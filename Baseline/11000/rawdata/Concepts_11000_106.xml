'''Actor–observer asymmetry''' (also '''[[#bias|actor–observer bias]]''') explains the errors that one makes when forming attributions about the behavior of others {{harv|Jones|Nisbett|1971}}. When people judge their own behavior, and they are the actor, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the particular situation than to a generalization about their personality. Yet when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person (the actor), they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors' overall disposition rather than to situational factors. This frequent error shows the bias that people hold in their evaluations of behavior {{harv|Miller|Norman|1975}}. Because people are better acquainted with the situational (external) factors affecting their own decisions, they are more likely to see their own behavior as affected by the social situation they are in. However, because the situational effects of anothers' behavior are less accessible to the observer, observers see the actor's behavior as influenced more by the actor's overall personality. The actor-observer asymmetry is a component of the [[ultimate attribution error]].
Sometimes the Actor–observer asymmetry is defined as the fundamental attribution error &lt;ref&gt;"Fundamental Attribution Error." The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science, edited by W. Edward Craighead, and Charles B. Nemeroff, Wiley, 3rd edition, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which is when people tend to focus on the internal, personal characteristic or disposition as cause of a behavior rather than the external factors or situational influences.&lt;ref&gt;McCornack Steven and Joseph Ortiz. Choices and connections 2nd edition, Bedford, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The actor-observer asymmetry tends to happen in event where people express behavioral emotion, such a first meeting, a blind date, a shopping at a supermarket etc... (Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1972). From a study by Jhonson and Sheldon (1993) when asking people which object they have noticed when talking with another person, their common answers were based on their own thought and the other person appearance &lt;ref&gt;Forgas, Joseph P, and Kipling D. Williams. The Social Self: Cognitive, Interpersonal and Inter-group Perspectives. Hoboken: Taylor and Francis, 2014. Internet resource.&lt;/ref&gt;

This term falls under "[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]]" or "[[attribution theory]]". The specific hypothesis of an actor-observer asymmetry in attribution (explanations of behavior) was originally proposed by [[Edward E. Jones|Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] (1971), when they claimed that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor” {{harv|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=93}}. Supported by initial evidence, the hypothesis was long held as firmly established, describing a robust and pervasive phenomenon of [[social cognition]].

However, a [[meta-analysis]] of all the published tests of the hypothesis between 1971 and 2004 {{harv|Malle|2006}} yielded a contradictory finding: there was no actor-observer asymmetry of the sort {{harvtxt|Jones|Nisbett|1971}} had proposed. {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} interpreted this result not so much as proof that actors and observers explained behavior exactly the same way but as evidence that the original hypothesis was fundamentally flawed in the way it framed people's explanations of behavior—namely, as attributions to either stable dispositions or to the situation. Against the background of a different theory of explanation, {{harvtxt|Malle et al.|2007}} tested an alternative set of three actor-observer asymmetries and found consistent support for all of them. Thus, the actor-observer asymmetry does not exist in one theoretical formulation (traditional attribution theory) but does exist in the new alternative theoretical formulation. {{harvtxt|Malle|2011}} argues that this favors the alternative theoretical formulation, but current textbooks have not yet fully addressed this theoretical challenge.{{as of?|date=June 2016}}

Considerations of actor-observer differences can be found in other disciplines as well, such as philosophy (e.g. [[privileged access]], [[incorrigibility]]), management studies, artificial intelligence, semiotics, anthropology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Malle et al.|2007}} for relevant references.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and initial formulation==
The background of this hypothesis was in the 1960s, with social psychology's increasing interest in the [[cognition|cognitive]] mechanisms by which people make sense of their own and other people's behavior. This interest was instigated by [[Fritz Heider|Fritz Heider's]] (1958) book, ''[[#CITEREFHeider1958|The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations]]'', and the research in its wake has become known as "[[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] research" or "[[attribution theory]]."

The specific hypothesis of an "actor–observer asymmetry" was first proposed by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] [[Edward E. Jones|Jones]] and [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] in 1971. Jones and Nisbett hypothesized that these two roles (actors and observers) produce asymmetric explanations.{{sfn|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=80}} Their research findings showed that “there is pervasive tendency for actors to attribute their actions to situational requirements, whereas observers tend to attribute the same actions to stable personal dispositions”.{{sfn|Jones|Nisbett|1971|p=80}} For example, a student who studies hard for an exam is likely to explain her own (the actor's) intensive studying by referring to the upcoming difficult exam (a situational factor), whereas other people (the observers) are likely to explain her studying by referring to her dispositions, such as being hardworking or ambitious.

==Early evidence and reception==
Soon after the publication of the actor-observer hypothesis, numerous research studies tested its validity, most notably the first such test by {{harvtxt|Nisbett et al.|1973}}. The authors found initial evidence for the hypothesis, and so did {{harvtxt|Storms|1973}}, who also examined one possible explanation of the hypothesis: that actors explain their behaviors by reference to the situation because they attend to the situation (not to their own behaviors) whereas observers explain the actor's behavior by reference to the actor's dispositions because they attend to the actor's behavior (not to the situation). Based largely on this initial supporting evidence, the confidence in the hypothesis became uniformly high. The asymmetry was described as “robust and quite general”,&lt;ref name=Jones1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Edward E.|title=How Do People Perceive the Causes of Behavior? Experiments based on attribution theory offer some insights into how actors and observers differ in viewing the causal structure of their social world|journal=American Scientist|date=1976|volume=64|issue=3|pages=300–305|jstor=27847255}}&lt;/ref&gt; "firmly established"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=David|title=The actor and the observer: How are their perceptions of causality divergent?|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1982|volume=92|issue=3|pages=682–700|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.92.3.682}} Page 698.&lt;/ref&gt; and “an entrenched part of scientific psychology”.{{sfn|Robins et al.|1996|p=376}} Likewise, evidence for the asymmetry was considered to be "plentiful”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Fiske, S. T., &amp; Taylor, S. E.|title=Social Cognition|edition=2nd |location=New York|publisher= McGraw-Hill|date=1991|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and “pervasive”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aronson|first1= E.|title=The Social Animal|date=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York, NY|page=166|edition=11th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mMdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166|isbn=9781429233415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent evidence==
Over 100 studies have been published since 1971 in which the hypothesis was put to further tests (often in the context of testing another hypothesis about causal attributions). {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} examined this entire literature in a [[meta-analysis]], which is a robust way of identifying consistent patterns of evidence regarding a given hypothesis across a broad set of studies. The result of this analysis was stunning: across 170 individual tests, the asymmetry practically did not exist. (The average effect sizes, computed in several accepted ways, ranged from d = -0.016 to d = 0.095; corrected for [[publication bias]], the average effect size was 0.) Under circumscribed conditions(i.e. if the actor was portrayed as highly idiosyncratic, or in negative events), it could sometimes be found, but under other conditions, the opposite was found. The conclusion was that the widely held assumption of an actor-observer asymmetry in attribution was false.{{sfn|Malle|2006|p=895}}

In contrast to the {{harvtxt|Malle|2006}} article, other research has shown a strong presence of the actor-observer asymmetry even in instances with familiar people. {{harvtxt|Krueger et al.|1996}} conducted a study on pairs of university dorm roommates who liked and knew one another well. The researchers aimed for familiar pairs of participants was to discover whether or not actor-observer asymmetry existed in conditions that might atypically work against it. Previous literature suggests that actor-observer asymmetry would not be present in situations where the actors and the observers were familiar with each other, which is why Krueger and colleagues wanted to perform the study with familiar pairs. Each participant answered three questionnaires where the final scores were weighed against each other in order to understand the presence of actor-observer asymmetry. The results showed that gender did not affect the findings, so whether or not the pairs were the same or opposite sex was not a mediator for the data. The researchers found that actors were aware of the actor-observer asymmetry, but the observers were not, which is typically what happens in everyday life. Krueger and colleagues showed another side to the actor-observer asymmetry, wherein it is present even among familiar people.

Even more recent evidence was published on the social acceptability of actions and the speed with which an observer's perception of an actor's moral character are determined and affected by actor-observer asymmetry.  {{harvtxt|Critcher et al.|2012}} conducted two experiments in order to support the idea that an immoral action is quickly followed by a negative evaluation of the actor's moral character by the observer.  On the other hand, a morally good decision by an actor is readily given a positive evaluation of that actor's moral character.  This is due to the fact that actions are observed as having been made with a degree of certainty and intentionality on the part of the actor, and more distinct motives are the underlying cause of these actions, thus creating more contrasted evaluations of the actor by the observer.

==Theoretical reformulation==
The result of the meta-analysis implied that, across the board, actors and observers explain behaviors the same way. But all the tests of the classic hypothesis presupposed that people explain behavior by referring to "dispositional" vs. "situational" causes. This assumption turned out to be incorrect for the class of behavioral events that people explain most frequently in real life {{harv|Malle|Knobe|1997}}: intentional behaviors (e.g., buying a new car, making a mean comment). People explain unintentional behaviors in ways that the traditional disposition-situation framework can capture, but they explain intentional behaviors by using very different concepts (Buss, 1978; {{harvnb|Heider|1958}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=Allan|title=Causes and reasons in attribution theory: A conceptual critique|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1978|volume=36|issue=11|pages=1311–1321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.11.1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent empirical theory of how people explain behavior was proposed and tested by {{harvs|last1=Malle|year1=1999|year2=2004 |txt }}, centering on the postulate that intentional behaviors are typically explained by reasons—the mental states (typically beliefs and desires) in light of which and on the grounds of which the agent decided to act (a postulate long discussed in the [[philosophy of action]]). But people who explain intentional behavior have several choices to make, and the theory identifies the psychological antecedents and consequences of these choices:

{{ordered list|type=lower-latin
  | giving either reason explanations or "causal history of reason (CHR) explanations" (which refer to background factors such as culture, personality, or context—causal factors that brought about the agent's reasons but were not themselves reasons to act);
  | giving either desire reasons or belief reasons;
  | linguistically marking a belief reason with its mental state verb (e.g., "She thought that..."; "He assumes that...").
}}

Empirical studies have so far supported this theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see {{harvnb|Malle|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within this framework, the actor-observer asymmetry was then reformulated as in fact consisting of three asymmetries: that actors offer more reason explanations (relative to CHR explanations) than observers do; that actors offer more belief reasons (relative to desire reasons) than observers do; and that actors use fewer belief reason markers than observers do {{harv|Malle|1999}}. {{harvtxt|Malle et al.|2007}} tested these asymmetries across 9 studies and found consistent support for them. In the same studies they also tested the classic person/disposition vs. situation hypothesis and consistently found no support for it.

Thus, people do seem to explain their own actions differently from how they explain other people's actions. But these differences do not lie in a predominance of using "dispositional" vs. "situational" causes. Only when people's explanations are separated into theoretically meaningful distinctions (e.g., reasons vs. causal history of reason explanations) do the differences emerge.

In addition, an alternative theory has been proposed called the folk-conceptual theory.{{sfn|Kiesler|Lee|Kramer|2006}}{{sfn|Malle|2011}} In contrast to the actor-observer asymmetry, it posits that people's explanations of behavior varies based on three key parameters (these parameters being: use of reason explanations vs. causal history explanations, use of belief reasons vs. desire reasons, and the use of mental state markers).

===Implications===
The choices of different explanations for intentional behavior (reasons, belief reasons, etc.) indicate particular psychological functions. Reasons, for example, appear to reflect (among other things) psychological closeness. People increase reason explanations (relative to CHR explanations) when they explain their own rather than another person's behavior {{harv|Malle et al.|2007}}, when they portray another person in a positive light {{harv|Malle et al.|2007}}, and when they explain behaviors of nonhuman agents for whom they have ownership and affection (e.g., a pet fish; {{harvnb|Kiesler|Lee|Kramer|2006}}). Conversely, people use fewer reasons and more CHR explanations when explaining behaviors of collectives or aggregate groups {{harv|O'Laughlin|Malle|2002}}. Actor-observer asymmetries can therefore be seen as part of a broader continuum of psychological distance people have to various kinds of minds (their own, others', groups', animals' etc.).

==Cultural differences==
Cultural differences may impact how certain behaviors or actions are attributed and interpreted. Current research supports the idea that Western culture emphasizes individualism, whereas East Asian cultures emphasize collectivism.The fundamental attribution error differs in those cultures. In the [[Individualistic]] cultures people tend to favor dispositional explanations for behavior. Whereas, in the [[collectivist]] cultures where P. B. Smith and Bond (1994) implied that the fundamental attribution error is minimal or even absent, so they tend to focus on situational explanation for behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Krull Douglas S., Michelle Hui-Min Loy, Jennifer Lin, Ching-Fu Wang, Suhong Chen, and Xudong Zhao Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol 25, Issue 10, pp. 1208 - 1219 October 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;]] . {{harvtxt|Masuda|Nisbett|2001}} found when viewing an underwater scene Americans focused more on fish in the foreground and the direction they were swimming within the tank than the background of the environment. This supports the idea that Americans are more like to attribute behavior to dispositional cue that are directly present in the environment or foreground. This is opposed to Japanese participants who focused on the fish, but additionally focused on the background of the environment (plants, other animals). This shows how people from East Asian cultures are more likely to attribute behavior to both dispositional and situational cues in the environment. In addition, {{harvtxt|Choi|Nisbett|2008}} found that when situational constraints of participants in an experiment were made more salient that only the East Asian participants had an increased perception of the situational constraints and made their judgments accordingly. This is opposed to North American participants who showed little to no change in perception of the situational constraints as they were made more salient. Additionally, it has differed in religious perspective. Protestant are most likely to focus on internal factor whether than external for behavior. Unlike the Catholic who would tend to focus on the external factor. The cause is that Protestant rely too much on correlational evidence without evidence of causality (MacKinnon, 2008). It is also cause by the fact that Protestant have stronger faith and are more aware of the soul's condition than Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;Li Y, Johnson K, Cohen A, Williams M, Knowles E, Chen Z. Fundamental(ist) attribution error: Protestants are dispositionally focused. Journal Of Personality And Social Psychology. February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Related but distinct concepts==

===&lt;span id="bias"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Actor-observer "bias"===
Instead of speaking of a hypothesis of an actor-observer asymmetry, some textbooks and research articles speak of an "actor-observer bias." The term "[[bias]]" is typically used to imply that one of the explainers (either the actor or the observer) is biased or incorrect in their explanations. But which one—the actor or the observer—is supposed to be incorrect is not clear from the literature. On the one hand, [[Lee Ross|Ross's]] (1977) hypothesis of a "[[fundamental attribution error]]" suggests that observers are incorrect, because they show a general tendency to overemphasize dispositional explanations and underemphasize situational ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|date=1977|volume=10|pages=173–220|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60357-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Nisbett and Wilson (1977) argued that actors don't really know the true causes of their actions (the so-called "[[introspection illusion]]") and often merely invent plausible explanations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes |journal= Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=231–259 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231|last1=Nisbett |first1=Richard E. |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Jones|Nisbett|1971}} themselves did not commit to calling the hypothesized actor-observer asymmetry a bias or an error. Similarly, recent theoretical positions consider asymmetries not a bias, but rather the result of multiple cognitive and motivational differences that fundamentally exist between actors and observers.{{sfn|Malle et al.|2007|p=508}}{{sfn|Robins et al.|1996|p=387}}

===Self-serving bias===
The actor-observer asymmetry is often confused with the hypothesis of a [[self-serving bias]] in attribution — the claim that people choose explanations in a strategic way so as to make themselves appear in a more positive light. The important difference between the two hypotheses is that the assumed actor-observer asymmetry is expected to hold for all events and behaviors (whether they are positive or negative) and require a specific comparison between actor explanations and observer explanations. The self-serving bias is often formulated as a complete reversal in actors' and observers' explanation tendencies as a function of positive vs. negative events.{{sfn|Malle|2006|p=896}} In traditional attribution terms, this means that for positive events (e.g., getting an A on an exam), actors will select explanations that refer to their own dispositions, (e.g., "I am smart") whereas observers will select explanations that refer to the actor's situation (e.g., "The test was easy"); however, for negative events (e.g., receiving an F on the exam), actors will select explanations that refer to the situation, (e.g., "The test was impossibly hard") whereas observers will select explanations that refer to the actor's dispositions (e.g., "She is not smart enough").

===Positivity bias===
The actor-observer asymmetry can seem similar to the hypothesis of a positivity bias in attribution- the claim that people are biased toward favorable evaluations. This hypothesis states that people will attribute their behavior with positive consequences to internal factors and their behavior with negative consequences to external factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Pligt|first1=Joop|title=Actors' and Observers' attributions, self-serving bias and positivity bias|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1983|volume=13|issue=1|pages=95–104|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420130107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The positivity bias is described in terms of the actors attributions of their own behavior. This means that people will attribute their behavior which received a positive consequence (passes their driving test and receiving their drivers license) to an internal factor (I really know the material). However, people will attribute their behavior in which they received a negative consequence (failing a driving test) to an external factor (the sun was in my eyes).

===Correspondence bias===
Observers attribute actions of others to their future behavior. Witnessing one's actions brings the witness to attribute those same actions to that person's future behavior. This explains why first impressions are so important to us. Once an action is seen, it is hard for the observer to imagine any other differing behaviors from the actor. However, on the other hand, it is hard for actors to attribute one action they have made to their whole behavior. They view themselves as more responsive, and therefore believe themselves to be in control of all situational matters. As the actor can attribute every action in the past he/she has done, the observer can only attribute the one action that is witnessed to that actor. Therefore, will attribute dispositional, rather than situational means to the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel|last2=Malone|first2=Patrick|title=The correspondence bias|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1995|volume=117|issue=1|pages=21–38|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.21|pmid=7870861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1772">In [[psychoanalysis]], '''anticathexis''', or countercathexis, is the energy used by the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] to bind the primitive impulses of the [[Ego, superego, and id|Id]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the ego follows the instructions of the [[superego]] in doing so; sometimes however it develops a double-countercathexis, so as to block feelings of guilt and anxiety deriving from the superego, as well as id impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 132 and p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression and isolation==

[[Freud]] saw the establishment of a permanent anticathexis as a prerequisite for successful [[psychological repression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/anticathexis-reference/anticathexis Anticathexis]&lt;/ref&gt; He also saw countercathexis as playing a central role in [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In a late work, Freud further distinguished between the external anticathexis of repression and what he called “internal anticathexis" (i.e. alteration of the ego through [[reaction formation]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Figure-ground==
Anticathexis has also been linked to the phenomenon of [[Figure-ground (perception)|figure-ground]], in that it may entail the suppression of the margin or ground of a perceptual field.&lt;ref&gt;R. Boothby, ''Freud as Philosopher'' (2001) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">The '''[[Apollo]] [[archetype]]''' personifies the aspect of the [[Personality psychology|personality]] that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface, as opposed to beneath appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over [[feeling]], distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].&lt;ref name="Shinoda-Bolen, J. 1989 p.135"&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves (1989) p.135 Harpur &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Layton-Shapira, L., The Cassandra Complex: Living with Disbelief, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G., 'The Apollonian and The Dionysian' p.136 in  Psychological Types, Vol 6 Collected Works, Princeton-Bollingen 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Early in the 20th century, [[Carl Gustav Jung]] sought to find a word that could describe the innate patterns of behaviour that govern our lives. Thus he introduced the term ‘[[Archetype]]s’ into modern [[psychology]]. Jung described archetypes as distinct [[wikt:theme|themes]] manifesting in the [[fantasy|fantasies]] and behaviour of his patients, and found these same themes visibly rendered in the arts, [[religion]]s, [[mythology|myths]], [[architecture]], and social customs of all peoples. Because he did not want the term ‘archetypes’ to become yet another intellectual abstraction, Jung advanced various mythic images to illustrate them. For instance, the Goddess Demeter is a presentation of the archetypal mother; Zeus an archetypal father; Apollo the archetypal intellectual, and so on. Jung went on to personify many archetypes by using general expressions such as 'The Great Mother’, 'Old Wise Man’, 'Shadow archetype’, etc. which have now become standard expressions in the field of [[Analytical Psychology]]. Jung writes “The fact that the unconscious spontaneously personifies is the reason why I have taken over these personifications in my terminology and formulated them in names”.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G., The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious Vol 9, part 1. Collected Works, Princeton-Bollingen 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
As with other archetypes, the Apollo archetype is not gender-specific.&lt;ref name="Shinoda-Bolen, J. 1989 p.135"/&gt; "Women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all… There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves (1989) p.x-xi Harpur &amp; Row&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the many positive aspects of the Apollo archetype such as order, reason, moderation, harmoniousness, and unemotional perfection,&lt;ref&gt;Hillman. J., Suicide and The Soul, Spring Publications 1965. p.122-23&lt;/ref&gt; archetypal [[psychologist]] [[James Hillman]] suggests that the archetype may also manifest as a negative potential if it becomes overly dominant: "Apollo certainly presents a pattern that is disastrous, destructive for psychological life, cut off from everything that has to do with feminine ways, whether [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra]] or [[Creusa (daughter of Erechtheus)|Creusa]] or [[Daphne]] — whomever he touches goes wrong — so that you have the feeling that [[Apollo]] simply doesn't belong where there is psyche."&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. ''Inter-Views'', Spring Publications, 1983 p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Shinoda-Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate… Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up" - be vulnerable and empathic - in order to truly know someone else…. But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties… she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref&gt;Shinoda-Bolen, J., Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves p.130-160 (1989)"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

  |title=Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the terminology evolved. 
==Argument==
An '''[[argument]]''', more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|''valid'']] [[if and only if]] its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument ''per se''; such must come from the outside. 

Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word ''constituent'' may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of [[truth-bearer]]: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.

==Deduction==
A '''deduction''' is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a [[deductive argument]]. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as [[Venn diagrams]] and other graphic procedures have been proposed.

==Proof==
A '''[[Formal proof|proof]]''' is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is a deduction that might use several premises — [[axiom]]s, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As [[Alfred Tarski]] famously emphasized in accord with [[Aristotle]], truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.
==Comparison==
Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. 
Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.
Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.
==Context==
Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.[[Willard Van Orman Quine| Quine]] devotes the first chapter of ''Philosophy of Logic'' to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;WILLARD QUINE, ''Philosophy of logic'', Harvard, 1970/1986. &lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not even been able to agree on what [[Aristotle]] took as constituents.&lt;ref&gt; JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300–1. &lt;/ref&gt;


Argument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the ''consequence-deducibility'' distinction and the ''truth-and-consequence conception of proof''.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.

Logician [[Alonzo Church]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church

|isbn=9780691029061}}&lt;/ref&gt; never used the word ''argument'' in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun ''deduction'' for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.

The absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed [[Plato]]nistic logicism. Following [[Michael Dummett|Dummett's]] insightful remarks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{buddhism}}
'''Arya''' (Sanskrit, also ''ārya''; Pāli: ''ariya'') is a term frequently used in [[Buddhism]] that can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious",{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} "pure",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} etc. Arya in the sense of "noble" or "exalted" is frequently used in Buddhist texts to designate a spiritual warrior or hero.

==Usage==
The term is used in the following contexts:
* The [[Four Noble Truths]] are called the ''catvāry ārya satyāni'' (Sanskrit) or ''cattāri ariya saccāni'' (Pali). 
* The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is called the ''ārya mārga'' (Sanskrit, also ''{{IAST|āryāṣṭāṅgikamārga}}'') or ''ariya magga'' (Pāli). 
* Buddha's [[Dharma]] and [[Vinaya]] are the ''ariyassa dhammavinayo''.
* In Buddhist texts, the āryas are those who have the Buddhist ''[[śīla]]'' (Pāli ''sīla'', meaning "virtue") and follow the Buddhist path. 
* Buddhists who have attained one of the [[Four stages of enlightenment|four levels of awakening]] ([[Sotāpanna|stream-entry]], [[Sakadagami|once-returner]], [[Anāgāmi|non-returner]], [[arahant]]) are themselves called ''ariya puggalas'' (Arya persons).

In the context of the [[four noble truths]] (Sanskrit: ''arya satya''; Pali: ''ariya sacca''), contemporary scholars explain the meaning of ''arya'' as follows:
* Paul Williams states: "The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana' (Narada 1980: 50).{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}
* Geshe Tashi Tsering states: "The modifier noble [i.e. arya]  means truth as perceived by arya beings, those beings who have had a direct realization of emptiness or selflessness. Noble means something seen by arya beings as it really is, and in this case it is four recognitions—suffering, origin, cessation, and path. Arya beings see all types of suffering—physical and mental, gross and subtle—exactly as they are, as suffering. For people like us, who do not have the direct realization of emptiness, although we may understand certain levels of physical and mental experiences as suffering, it is impossible for us to see all the levels of suffering for what they are. Instead we may see some things as desirable when in truth they are suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 349-350}}

Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.vipassana.com/resources/bodhi/nobility_of_the_truths.php The Nobility of the Truths, by Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt;
: The word "noble," or ariya, is used by the Buddha to designate a particular type of person, the type of person which it is the aim of his teaching to create. In the discourses the Buddha classifies human beings into two broad categories. On one side there are the puthujjanas, the worldlings, those belonging to the multitude, whose eyes are still covered with the dust of defilements and delusion. On the other side there are the ariyans, the noble ones, the spiritual elite, who obtain this status not from birth, social station or ecclesiastical authority but from their inward nobility of character.

:These two general types are not separated from each other by an impassable chasm, each confined to a tightly sealed compartment. A series of gradations can be discerned rising up from the darkest level of the blind worldling trapped in the dungeon of egotism and self-assertion, through the stage of the virtuous worldling in whom the seeds of wisdom are beginning to sprout, and further through the intermediate stages of noble disciples to the perfected individual at the apex of the entire scale of human development. This is the Arahant, the liberated one, who has absorbed the purifying vision of truth so deeply that all his defilements have been extinguished, and with them, all liability to suffering.

In Chinese Buddhist texts, ''{{IAST|ārya}}'' is translated as [[:wikt:聖|聖]] (approximately, "holy, sacred", [[pinyin]] ''[[:wikt:shèng|shèng]]'', [[on'yomi]] ''[[:wikt:せい|sei]]'').

The spiritual character of the use of the term ārya in Buddhist texts can also be seen in the Mahavibhasa and in the Yogacarabhumi. The [[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhasa]] &lt;ref&gt;(Taisho 1545, vol. xxvii, 401c29-402a12, 402b5-6, and 402a27-b6)&lt;/ref&gt; states that only the noble ones (āryas) realize all four of the four noble truths (āryasatyāni) and that only a noble wisdom understands them fully. The same text also describes the āryas as the ones who "have understood and realized about the [truth of] [[dukkha|suffering]], ([[impermanence]], [[sunyata|emptiness]], and [[anatta|no-self]])" and who "understand things as they are".&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst 1999"&gt;(Deshpande/ Gomez in Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In another text, the [[Yogacarabhumi|Yogācārabhūmi]] (Taishō 1579, vol. xx, 364b10-15), the āryas are described as being free from the ''viparyāsa''s.

Several Buddhist texts show that the ''{{IAST|ārya dharma}}'' was taught to everybody, including the āryas, [[Dasyu]]s, [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Gandharva]]s and [[Asura]]s. The {{IAST|Bhaiṣajyavastu}} (from the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya]]) describes a story of Buddha teaching his dharma to the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] ({{IAST|Catvāraḥ Mahārājāḥ}}) of the four directions. In this story, the guardians of the east ({{IAST|Dhṛtarāṣṭra}}) and the south ({{IAST|Virūḍhaka}}) are āryajatiya (āryas) who speak [[Sanskrit]], while the guardians of the west ({{IAST|Virūpākṣa}}) and the north ([[Vaisravana|{{IAST|Vaiśravaṇa}}]]) are dasyujatiya (Dasyus) who speak Dasyu languages. In order to teach his Dharma, Buddha has to deliver his discourse in Aryan and Dasyu languages. This story describes Buddha teaching his Dharma to the āryas and Dasyus alike.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999"&gt;Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Karandavyuha|{{IAST|Karaṇḍavyūha}}]] (a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] sūtra) describes how [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] taught the ārya Dharma to the [[asura]]s, [[Yaksha|{{IAST|yakṣa}}]]s and [[Rakshasa|{{IAST|rakṣasa}}]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999"/&gt;

In many parts of the South India, if somebody (new) is supposed to be addressed respectably, the prefix "Ayya", derived from "Arya" is used. South Indians used to call them "Arya" which is now transformed to "Ayya". This term is used even today.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The '''big push model''' is a concept in [[development economics]] or [[welfare economics]] that emphasizes that a firm's decision whether to industrialize or not depends on its expectation of what other firms will do. It assumes [[economies of scale]] and [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] market structure and explains when industrialization would happen.

The originator of this theory was [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]] in 1943. Further contributions were made later on by [[Kevin M. Murphy|Murphy]], Shleifer and [[Robert W. Vishny]] in 1989. Analysis of this economic model ordinarily involves using [[game theory]].

The theory of the model emphasizes that [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] require large amounts of investments to embark on the path of [[economic development]] from their present state of backwardness. This theory proposes that a 'bit by bit' investment programme will not impact the process of growth as much as is required for developing countries. In fact, injections of small quantities of investments will merely lead to a wastage of [[resource]]s.
[[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]] approvingly quotes a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] study in this regard, "There is a minimum level of [[resource]]s that must be devoted to... a [[Economic development|development]] programme if it is to have any chance of success. Launching a country into self-sustaining growth is a little like getting an [[airplane]] off the ground. There is a critical [[ground speed]] which must be passed before the craft can become airborne...."&lt;ref name="Rodan-Notes" /&gt;

[[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan|Rosenstein-Rodan]] argued that the entire industry which is intended to be created should be treated and planned as a massive entity (a [[firm]] or [[Trust (monopoly)|trust]]). He supports this argument by stating that the social [[marginal product]] of an investment is always different from its private [[marginal product]], so when a group of [[Industry|industries]] are planned together according to their social marginal products, the [[Economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy is greater than it would have otherwise been.&lt;ref name="NATH" /&gt;

==The three indivisibilities==

According to Rosenstein-Rodan, there exist three indivisibilities in [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]]. These indivisibilities are responsible for [[Network effect|external economies]] and thus justify the need for a big push. The indivisibilities are as follows-
# Indivisibility in [[production function]]
# Indivisibility of [[demand]]
# Indivisibility in the supply of [[savings]]

===Indivisibility in production function===

Indivisibilities in the [[production function]] may be with respect to any of the following:
* [[Factors of production|Inputs]]
* [[List of industrial processes|Processes]]
* [[Output (economics)|Outputs]]
These lead to increasing returns (i.e., [[economies of scale]]), and may require a high optimum size of a firm. This can be achieved even in developing countries since at least one optimum scale firm can be established in many industries. But investment in [[social overhead capital]] comprises investment in all basic industries (like [[Electric power industry|power]], transport or communications) which must necessarily come before directly productive investment activities. Investment in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]] is 'lumpy' in nature. Such capital requirements cannot be imported from other nations. Therefore, heavy initial investment necessarily needs to be made in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (this is approximated to be about 30 to 40 percent of the total investment undertaken by [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]]).
Social overhead capital is further characterized by four indivisibilities:
# ''Irreversibility in time'': It must precede other directly productive investments
# ''Minimum durability of equipment'':. Any lesser level of [[Durable good|durability]] is either impossible due to technical reasons or much less [[Economic efficiency|efficient]]
# ''Long gestation periods'': The investment in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]] takes time to generate returns and its impact in the economy is not immediately or directly visible
#''Irreducible minimum social overhead capital–industry mix'': Investment needs to be of a certain minimum magnitude and spread across a mix of industries, without which it will not significantly impact the process of growth.

===Indivisibility (or complementarity) of demand===
Developing countries are characterized by low per-capita income and purchasing power. Markets in these countries are therefore small. In a [[Autarky|closed economy]], modernization and increased efficiency in a single industry has no impact on the economy as a whole since the output of that industry will fail to find a market. A large number of industries need to be set up simultaneously so that people employed in one industry consume the output of other industries and thus create [[Complementary good|complementary]] demand.

To illustrate this, Rosenstein Rodan gives the example of a shoe industry. If a country makes large investments in the shoe industry, all the disguisedly employed labor from the other industries find work and a source of income, leading to a rise in production of shoes and their own incomes. This increased income will not be expended only on buying shoes. It is conceivable that the increased incomes will lead to increased spending on other products too. However, there is no corresponding supply of these products to satisfy this increased demand for the other goods. Following the basic [[Free market|market forces]] of demand and supply, the prices of these commodities will rise. To avoid such a situation, investment must be spread out amongst different industries.

The situation may be different in an [[open economy]] as the output of the new industry may replace former imports or possibly find its market by way of exports. But even if the world market acts as a [[Substitute good|substitute]] for domestic demand, a big push is still needed (though its required size may now be reduced due to the presence of international trade).

===Indivisibility in the supply of savings===
High levels of investment require a corresponding high level of savings. We cannot always rely on foreign aid as the huge levels of investments in the different [[Economic sector|sectors]] need to be made not only once, but multiple times. Hence domestic savings are a must. But in an underdeveloped economy,this is a challenge due to the low income levels. The [[Marginal propensity to save|marginal rate of savings]] needs to be increased following the rise in incomes due to higher investment.

== How the big push works ==
[[File:Figure 1 Operation of Big Push.png|thumb|right|500px|alt=|Fig.1]]
Consider a country whose economy is characterized by a large number  [[Economic sector|sectors]] which are so small that any increase in the productivity of one sector has no impact on the economy as a whole. Each sector can either rely on traditional methods or switch to modern methods of production which would increase its efficiency. Let us assume that there are &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; workers in the economy and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; sectors. Each sector therefore has &lt;math&gt;{l}/{n}&lt;/math&gt; workers.

''Using traditional technology'', a sector would produce &lt;math&gt;{l}/{n}&lt;/math&gt;  amount of output, with each worker producing one unit of the commodity.

''Using modern technology'' a sector would produce more as the productivity would be greater than one unit per worker. However, a modern sector would require some of the workers (say &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;) to perform administrative tasks.

In figure 1, the x-axis represents the labor employed and the y-axis represents the level of production. The production in the traditional [[Economic sector|sector]] is given by the curve T and the production in the modern sector is given by M. The curve M has a positive intercept on the x-axis, implying that even with zero production, there is a minimum level of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; workers who still remain employed for carrying out administrative activities. With our assumption of &lt;math&gt;{l/n}&lt;/math&gt;  workers in the economy, the modern sector will have a higher level of productivity than the traditional sector. The production function of the modern sector is steeper than that of the traditional sector because of the higher productivity of workers in the former. The slope of both production functions is &lt;math&gt;{1}/{m}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the marginal labor required to produce an additional unit of output. This level of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is lower for the modern sector than it is for the traditional sector.

[[File:Figure 2 High and low wages.png|thumb|left|500px|alt=|Fig.1]]
Assume that the traditional sector pays workers one unit of output which is subsequently spent equally by them in all sectors. The modern sector pays higher wages to workers. If all the workers are employed by the traditional sector, then the demand generated for the output of each sector is &lt;math&gt;D_1={1}/{n}&lt;/math&gt;.
Government intervention in a manner that investment is carried out on those industries that have higher forward and backward linkages.
We have two possible cases:

* ''Wages are low'' – When low wages are prevalent in the economy, say &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;, a firm which faces demand &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt; will need to employ &lt;math&gt;l^*&lt;/math&gt; workers if it wants to modernize. This will cost the firm &lt;math&gt;w_1l^*&lt;/math&gt;.
:Now, wages are low. Therefore
::&lt;math&gt;w_1l^*&lt;D_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:This implies that costs (given by &lt;math&gt;w_1l^*&lt;/math&gt;) are lower than the earnings (given by &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt;). So the firm makes a profit and will choose to modernize (even if other firms do not).

* ''Wages are high'' – When high wages are prevalent in the economy, say &lt;math&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt;, a firm which faces demand &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt; will make losses if no other firms choose to modernize.
:This is because
::&lt;math&gt;w_2l^*&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt;.
:This implies that costs (given by &lt;math&gt;w_2l^*&lt;/math&gt;) are higher than the earnings (given by &lt;math&gt;D_1&lt;/math&gt;).

:However, if all the other firms have modernized, the firm faces a higher demand &lt;math&gt;D_2&lt;/math&gt;, arising out of higher income levels of workers of these modernized firms. The firm will hence choose to modernize as well so that it makes profits:
::&lt;math&gt;w_2l^*&lt;D_2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Indivisibilities and external economies==
The concept of [[Externality|externalities]] is relevant for the Industrialization of [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]], where decisions are to be made regarding distribution of savings among alternative [[Investment|investment opportunities]]. These arise from the interdependence in market economies.&lt;ref name="SCI" /&gt;

'''[[Pecuniary externality|Pecuniary economies]]''' are [[Externality#Positive|external economies]] transmitted through the [[price system]], as prices are the [[Price signal|signalling]] device (under conditions of [[perfect competition]] in a market economy). They arise in an industry (say industry X) due to internal economies of overcoming technical indivisibilities. This reduces the price of its product, which will benefit another industry (say industry Y) which use this output as an input or a factor of production.&lt;ref name="MYI" /&gt; Subsequently, the profits of industry Y will rise, leading to its expansion and generating demand for the output of industry X. As a result, industry X's production and profits also expand.&lt;ref name="AGA-SINGH" /&gt;

However in [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]], conditions of [[perfect competition]] are not present due to the [[Decentralization#Economic decentralization|decentralized]] and differentiated nature of the market. Prices fail to act as a [[Price signal|signalling system]] in the following ways:&lt;ref name="SCI" /&gt;
* Prices express the situation as it is and do not predict future economic situations
* Prices can decide present productive activities but cannot determine investments which would be appropriate for developing countries
* The response of the private sector to price signals is inadequate and imperfect due to the differentiation and decentralisation in developing countries
This justifies the need for centralized pan-industry planning of investment in Developing countries, as the private sector cannot undertake such planning.

'''Enlargement of the market size''' is another important externality which arises from the complementarity of industries. There exists an incentive to expand the scale of operations because the employees of one industry become the customers of another industry. In terms of products too (as in the above example of industries X and Y), one industry generates demand for the output of the other when the scale of operations increase.&lt;ref name="MEA" /&gt;

'''Marshallian economies''' also accrue to a firm within a growing industry, resulting from agglomeration of industrial districts or clusters in a particular area. These occur due to the following advantages of agglomeration identified by [[Alfred Marshall]]:
# Spillover of information
# Specialization and division of labor
# Development of a market for skilled labor.&lt;ref name="AGA-SINGH" /&gt;

'''Availability of skilled labour''' is an externality which arises when industrialization occurs, as workers acquire better training and skills. This is not achievable by mere establishment of a few industries, but requires a large program of industrial growth. It is one of the most important external economies because absence of skilled labor is a strong impediment to industrialization.&lt;ref name="MISPURI" /&gt;

== Role of the State ==
The large-scale programme of industrialization advocated by this model requires huge investments which are beyond the means of the private sector. The investment in infrastructure and basic industries (like power, transport and communications) is 'lumpy' and has long gestation periods. The role of the state in this theory is therefore critical for investment in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Even if the private sector had the requisite resources to invest in such a programme, it would not do so since it is driven by profit motives.&lt;ref name="MISPURI" /&gt; 
Many investments are profitable in terms of social marginal net product but not in terms of private marginal net product. Due to this there is no incentive for individual entrepreneurs to invest and take advantage of external economies.&lt;ref name= "Rodan-Notes" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The theory has been criticized by [[Hla Myint]] and [[Celso Furtado]], among others, primarily on the grounds of the massive effort required to be taken by [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] to move along the path of industrialization. Some of the major criticisms are as follows.

* ''Difficulties in execution and implementation'': The execution of related projects during the course of industrialization may involve unexpected or unavoidable changes due to revisions of plans, delays and deviations from the planned process. [[Hla Myint]] notes that the various departments and agencies involved in the process of development need to coordinate closely and evaluate and revise plans continuously. This is a challenging task for the governments of developing countries.&lt;ref name="MYI" /&gt;
* ''Lack of absorptive capacity'': The implementation of industrialization programmes may be constrained by ineffective disbursement,short-term bottlenecks, [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] problems and volatility, loss of competitiveness and weakening of institutions. [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] is often utilized at low rates or after long time lags. There is often a loss of competitiveness due to the [[Dutch disease]] effect.&lt;ref name="PAT" /&gt;
* ''Historical inaccuracy'': When viewed in light of historical experience of countries over the last two centuries, no country displayed any evidence of development due to massive industrialization programmes. [[Steady-state economy|Stationary economies]] do not develop simply by making large-scale investment in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref name="FURT" /&gt;
* ''Problems in mixed economies'': In a [[mixed economy]], where the [[Private sector|private]] and [[public sector]]s co-exist, the environment for growth may not be a conducive one. Unless there is a [[Complementary good|complementarity]] between the sectors, there is bound to arise competition between them, with the [[Ministry (government department)|government departments]] keeping their plans confidential out of fear of [[Speculation|speculative activities]] by the [[private sector]]. The private sector's activities are simultaneously inhibited due to [[Information asymmetry|lack of information]] of government policies and the general economic situation&lt;ref name="MYI" /&gt;
* ''Neglect of methods of production'': Rather than [[Capital (economics)|capital]] formation, it is productive techniques which determine the success of a country in [[economic development]]. The big push model ignores productive techniques in its support for [[Capital (economics)|capital]] formation and industrialisation.&lt;ref name="FURT" /&gt;
* ''Shortage of resources in underdeveloped countries'': Eugenio Gudin criticizes the theory of the big push on the grounds that [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] lack the [[Capital (economics)|capital]] required to provide the big push required for rapid [[Economic development|development]]. If an underdeveloped nation had ample [[Capital (economics)|capital]] supply and scarce [[Factors of production|factors]], it would not be classified as ''underdeveloped'' at all. Limited [[resource]] availability is the first impediment to such countries. Though this problem may be overcome by foreign aids, industrialization may not take off as expected if the aid flows are volatile.&lt;ref name="PAT" /&gt;
* ''Ignores the agricultural sector'': With its heavy emphasis on industry, the model finds no place for agriculture. This is a gaping flaw in the theory, as in most [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] it is this sector which is large and has labor [[Economic surplus|surplus]]. Investments in agriculture need to go hand-in-hand with those in industry so as to [[Stimulus (economics)|stimulate]] the industrial sector by providing a market for industrial goods. If neglected, it would be difficult to meet the food requirements of the nation in the [[Long run and short run|short run]] and to significantly expand the [[Market (economics)|size of the market]] in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].
* ''Inflationary pressures'': It follows from the neglect of the agricultural sector that [[Famine|food shortages]] are likely to occur with industrialization. Though it would take time for investments in social overhead [[Capital (economics)|capital]] to yield returns, the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] would increase immediately, thus imposing [[Inflation|inflationary pressures]] on the economy. Cost escalations may even cause projects to be postponed and the [[Economic development|development]] process in general to slow down.&lt;ref name="Rodan-Notes" /&gt;
* ''Dependence on indivisibilities'': The emphasis of this theory on indivisibility of processes is too much, as investments need not necessarily be on such a large scale to be economic. [[Reform movement|Social reforms]] are ignored, which are vital if a country is to grow on the basis of its own [[resources]] and initiatives. [[Economic development|Development]] is bound to intensify if social reform is a part of the industrialization process.&lt;ref name="FURT" /&gt;

[[Image:Tawa chakana qillqana.svg|thumb|right|Construction method]]
[[Image:CruzzersChakana.jpg|thumb|right]]
The '''chakana''' (or '''Inca Cross''') is a stepped cross made up of an equal-armed cross indicating the cardinal points of the compass and a superimposed square. The square is suggested to represent the other two levels of existence. The three levels of existence are ''Hana Pacha'' (the upper world inhabited by the superior gods), ''Kay Pacha'', (the world of our everyday existence) and ''Ukhu'' or ''Urin Pacha'' (the underworld inhabited by spirits of the dead, the ancestors, their overlords and various deities having close contact to the Earth plane). The hole through the centre of the cross is the Axis by means of which the shaman transits the cosmic vault to the other levels.  It is also said to represent [[Cusco]], the center of the [[Incan Empire|Incan empire]], and the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation.

==Composition==
The geometry of the symbol has a high degree of [[symmetry]]. The symbol can be drawn from a circle. A square is inscribed in the circle, with the corners tangent to the circle. This forms the "middle step" of the ladder. A smaller square (tilted 45 degrees) is made from the midpoints of the large square. Connecting the midpoints of the small square and extending the lines to the edge of the circle will form the arms of the cross, otherwise known as the "first" and "last" steps of the chakana. Lines are drawn from the points the lines exit the circle, to complete the cross. A small circle is made from the diameter of the cross lines. To proof the construction, a separate construction line is drawn from the point where the square corners with the cross rectangles to the same point on the opposite side.

==Historical evidence==
The [[mestee]] historian [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega, ''el Ynga'']], reports about a  holy cross of white and red marble or [[jasper]], which was venerated in 16th-century [[Cusco]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. The cross had been kept in a royal house, in a sacred place or ''[[huaca|wak'a]]'', but the Incas did not worship it. They simply admired it because of its beauty. The cross was square (''quadrada''), measuring about two by two feet, its branches three inch wide, the edges carefully squared and the surface brightly polished.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Incas began to venerate the holy cross, after they heard how [[Pedro de Candia]] had miraculously defied a lion and a tiger holding a cross. When the Spaniards captured the city, they transferred the cross to sacristy of the newly built cathedral, where De la Vega saw it in 1560. He was surprised that the clergy had not decorated it with gold or gems.&lt;ref&gt;Garcillago de la Vega, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WcVoauZVaFEC&amp;pg=PA111 First part of the Royal Commentaries of the Yncas], 1869, repr. Cambridge 2010, vol. 1, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; As we know from Middle America, this may have been part of a deliberate strategy by [[Mendicant orders|mendicant friars]], trying to adapt to indigenous cultural codes. As a rule, the veneration of the holy cross was a carefully designed ecclesiastical enterprise, incorporating native symbols and reproducing them on sacral level. Most surviving Meso-American crosses do not predate the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mónica Domínguez Torres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q_b3sg-tLvQC Military Ethos and Visual Culture in Post-Conquest Mexico], Burlington 2013, pp. 61-110&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing stories about indigenous crosses contributed to the idea of a [[Natural theology|'natural' religion]] that would have prepared the Indians for their inevitable conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ditchfield, ‘What Did Natural History Have to Do with Salvation? José de Acosta SJ (1540-1600) in the America's', in: Peter Clarke and Tony Claydon, God's Bounty? The Churches and the Natural World, Woodbridge, Suffolk and Rochester, NY 2010, pp. 144-168&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, this Andean "cross" has been documented in Tiwanaku architecture (Bolivia) dating back to 300 BC and AD 300. Other Andean cultures, Mapuche, whose presence in the Americas also predates Western presence and date back 600 t 500 BC.

==Controversy==

The "chakana" is an invented tradition. Although the Chakana as the 'Andean cross', presented as an Inca and pre-Inca symbol bearing cultural, spiritual, or mystical interpretations as expressed in this article, has wide popularity in contemporary Andean culture, its roots are no older than the late 20th century, and the popular version, than 2003. The current Chakana mythos as it impacts the New Age belief system and the Peruvian tourist-oriented economy initiates from the 2003 publication of the book Andean Awakening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Andean-Awakening-Publisher-Council-Books/dp/B004OP45GC/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412193531&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=jorge+luis+delgado |title=Andean Awakening Publisher: Council Oak Books: MaryAnn Male Jorge Luis Delgado: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by Jorge Luis Delgado, and Mary Anne Male. This is the source of the myth. They are followed by such authors as Mark Torra and Roger Calverley (CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/CHAKANA-Secret-Teachings-Ancient-Mystery-ebook/dp/B00FOXQZT8 |title=CHAKANA: Secret Teachings of an Ancient Andean Mystery School eBook: Roger Calverley: Kindle Store |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeoastronomer Carlos Milla Villena published his own, distinctly different speculative interpretations of the chacana as “andean, cross” in Génesis de la cultura andina,1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nVuAAAAMAAJ&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions |title=Génesis de la cultura andina - Carlos Milla Villena - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.pe |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream scientific, scholastic, and archaeological sources do not refer to or support the word chakana as the cross-and-box design - rather, it is in [[Runasimi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clacsnyublog.com/2011/03/08/runa-simi-pantachiqkunamanta-about-the-forgers-of-runa-simi/ |title=Runa Simi pantachiqkunamanta – About the Forgers of Runa Simi &amp;#124; CLACS @ NYU |publisher=Clacsnyublog.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the traditional language of the Inca peoples, (modern Quechua), derived from chaka, 'bridge', and means 'to cross over', or 'a crossing'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Earth-Sky-Cosmology-Monograph-ebook/dp/B00HEUJQ9U/ref=la_B001HCZIHA_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1412197906&amp;sr=1-3 |title=At the Crossroads of the Earth and the Sky: An Andean Cosmology (Latin American Monographs: No. 55) - Kindle edition by Gary Urton.

The twelve-cornered design itself occasionally appears in pre-contact artifacts such as textiles and ceramics from such cultures as the Wari, Ica, and Tiwanaku, but with no particular emphasis and no key or guide to a means of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tocapu.org/images/index.php |title=Images |publisher=tocapu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Andeans and Andeanists regard the imposition of this modern “invented tradition"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm &amp; Terence Ranger, ed. (1983). The Invention of Tradition. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521246458}}.&lt;/ref&gt;” as [[cultural appropriation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kareem |first=Nadra |url=http://racerelations.about.com/od/diversitymatters/fl/What-Is-Cultural-Appropriation-and-Why-Is-It-Wrong.htm |title=What Is Cultural Appropriation and Why Is It Wrong? |publisher=Racerelations.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Peruvian author Tupaq Katari writes: “When I hear you foreigners, with ease and lightness talking of the Andean themes, this surprises me, since we here in Peru continually try to find details about our own history, which is very complex and you argue so lightness without a historical or experiential support of what are the Andes and its diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamanportal.org/article_details.php?id=891 |title=10th PACHAKUTI by Tupaq Katari / Shaman Portal |publisher=Shamanportal.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

'''Collaborative language systems''' is a therapeutic approach largely based in contemporary [[hermeneutics]], the study of interpretation as a way to produce understanding, while considering both context and cognition, as well as [[social constructionism]]. This approach involves a reciprocal relationship between both the therapist and client, through which the client works through his or her clinical problems using [[dialogical conversation]] with the therapist. The therapist and client work together, utilizing their own, individual knowledge and understanding of the issues, to conceptualize and illuminate the client’s problems and provide new context, meaning and comprehension to those problems based on the collaboration.

== Early sources ==

The theoretical approach known as collaborative language systems evolved from the traditional basis of collaborative therapy. Together, Harlene Anderson and Harry Goolishian took the core values incorporated into practiced therapeutic techniques involving reciprocal approaches toward the client-patient relationship and applied a cooperative understanding of the use of modern language and the role it plays in the formulation of ideas and perception, as well as [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]] theory towards the therapeutic relationship. Goolishian and Anderson were later joined by Lynn Hoffman in expanding the application of their ideas. The approach corrected by the collective contributors was eventually expounded upon by Tom Andersen, who thrust the theories into a broader range of practice within the field [[family therapy|family systems therapy]].&lt;ref name="Family Therapy Review"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombs|first=Robert|title=Family Therapy Review|year=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-4312-4|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creating collaborative therapy ==

Collaborative therapy emerged as a [[postmodernist]] concept rooted in philosophical principles as a way to challenge existing [[psychotherapeutic]] approaches. The basic foundations upon which collaborative language systems are based involve the formation of our understanding of events and situations based on the words used to describe them. Through narration and dialogue, it is theorized, we give meaning to situations. This meaning changes given the context of the conversation and how we choose to describe it. Collaborative therapists believe that knowledge and language, and thus the meaning each is given, are interdependent, dynamic processes that change through the exchange of information and ideas.&lt;ref name="The New Language of Change"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|chapter=On a roller coaster: A collaborative language systems approach to therapy |editor-first=Steven |editor-last=Friedman |title=The New Language of Change: Constructive Collaboration In Psychotherapy|year=1993|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-89862-145-3|pages=323–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapist–client relationship ==

Unlike traditional psychotherapy, the collaborative [[therapist]] plays a more active role in the therapist/patient relationship. As narration is essential to this form of therapy, the therapist constantly invites and facilitates the dialogue in order to sustain a constant exchange of ideas and experience. The therapist’s goal is to gain an understanding of the client’s problems through their narration by attempting to comprehend meaning from the perspective of the client. This process serves as a co-learning experience during which the therapist pays close attention to both what and how things are being said. Any comments or suggestions made by the therapist are used simply as a basis for continued conversation rather than an attempt at guidance or persuasion. The role of a collaborative therapist is to provide a context in which the client can begin to author, edit, and re-edit their own lives through the development and exchange of language. Despite the implicit implications regarding influence during this mutual exchange,&lt;ref name="Collaborative Influence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Tom|title=Collaborative Influence|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|year=2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=144–145|url=http://www.anzjft.com/pages/articles/140.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process most closely resembles the ethical practice of re-framing rather than coaching. The collaborative therapist believes that the open exchange of ideas and continuous dialogue will create opportunities for growth and transformation within the client.

== Application of Ideas ==

Collaborative language systems holds to certain core concepts during the conversational practice of therapy. Those concepts are:

* Conversational Partners
* Client Expertise
* "Not Knowing"
* Transparency
* Uncertainty
* "Everyday Ordinary Life"
* Mutual Transformation&lt;ref name="Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|title=Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/Pages/rogers.htm|work=Journal of Family Therapy|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophies attempt to ensure, while working in tandem, the relationship between client and therapist grows in a mutually inclusive way, expounding upon the knowledge and understanding of situations by placing both the parties on the same level, providing the client the ability to share and explore their understanding openly and freely while setting and meeting their goals for therapy based on the end points they set for themselves. In this way, collaborative therapy builds upon the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] ideals with the client as the expert. It then builds upon the social constructionist view of identity through open dialogue. This theory involves the creation and understanding of problem an situations based upon the context and exchange in which they are formed. As the client and the therapist build their relationship through dialogical conversation, the context and meaning the client gives to the problems they are facing is altered as new perspectives and alternative viewpoints are offered by the therapist for consideration.

The '''doctrine of exoneration of liens''' (sometimes simply referred to as "'''doctrine of exoneration'''") refers to a [[common law]] rule. The rule says that encumbrances (i.e. a [[mortgage law|mortgage]]) of a property conveyed by a [[Will (law)|will]] is discharged with funds from the originating [[Estate (law)|estate]], not from the property itself.&lt;ref name=WT&amp;E&gt;

The '''economics of plastics processing''' is determined by the type of process. [[Plastics]] can be processed with the following methods: machining, [[compression molding]], [[transfer molding]], [[injection molding]], [[extrusion]], [[rotational molding]], [[blow molding]], [[thermoforming]], casting, forging, and [[foam molding]]. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, tooling cost, and build volume. High equipment and tooling cost methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and tooling cost methods are used for low production volumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials (5th ed)|last = Kalpakjian|first = Serope|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-13-227271-1|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458|pages = 657–658|first2 = Steven|last2 = Schmid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam [[Molding (process)|molding]] has high equipment and tooling cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.

==Aspects of plastic processing==

=== Degradable plastics ===
[[Oxo-degradable]] plastics:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oxodegradable plastics: degradation, environmental impact and recycling|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270465953|journal = Proceedings of the ICE - Waste and Resource Management|pages = 133–140|volume = 165|issue = 3|doi = 10.1680/warm.11.00014|first = Noreen L.|last = Thomas|first2 = Andrew R.|last2 = McLauchlin|first3 = Stuart G.|last3 = Patrick|first4 = Jane|last4 = Clarke|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are petroleum-based plastics with additives such as transition metals and metals salts that promote the process of fragmentation of the plastic when exposed to a particular environment, such as high temperature or oxygen rich one, for a prolonged period of time. Fragmentation exposes a larger surface area of the plastic to colonies of bacteria that eventually decompose the polymer into its lower energy state components: carbon dioxide and water.

Some aspects to take into account regarding this method to dispose of end-of-life plastics are:
* The type of polymer: experiments conducted by Chiellini ''et al.'' confirmed that bacteria are only able to decompose low molecular weight polymers (at least at a rate that can be appreciated).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Comparative Study of the Degradability and Recyclability of Different Classes of Degradable Polyethylene|journal = Journal of Macromolecular Science, Part A|date = 1995-04-01|issn = 1060-1325|pages = 709–730|volume = 32|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/10601329508010283|first = S.|last = Al-Malaika|first2 = S.|last2 = Chohan|first3 = M.|last3 = Coker|first4 = G.|last4 = Scott|first5 = R.|last5 = Arnaud|first6 = P.|last6 = Dabin|first7 = A.|last7 = Fauve|first8 = J.|last8 = Lemaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environmental conditions: the time for fragmentation/degradation varies according to conditions which aren’t always controllable. 
* Material’s potential to be recycled: this characteristic will be compromised, since the polymer’s durability or strength will be affected by the additives that accelerate fragmentation.
Classifying a polymer as [[biodegradation|bio-degradable]] requires specifications regarding these aspects.

Important economic aspects that need to be considered when disposing of degradable polymers include:
* Waste landfill costs:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date = 2009-07-27|issn = 0962-8436|pmc = 2873020|pmid = 19528059|pages = 2115–2126|volume = 364|issue = 1526|doi = 10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|first = Jefferson|last = Hopewell|first2 = Robert|last2 = Dvorak|first3 = Edward|last3 = Kosior}}&lt;/ref&gt; if plastics represent a significant percentage of waste in a particular region, manufacturing plastics with bio-degradable properties may be more profitable and ecologically friendly than merely disposing of a non-degradable plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.jclepro.2004.02.018|title = Municipal solid waste management from a systems perspective|journal = Journal of Cleaner Production|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 241–252|year = 2005|last1 = Eriksson|first1 = O.|last2 = Carlsson Reich|first2 = M.|last3 = Frostell|first3 = B.|last4 = Björklund|first4 = A.|last5 = Assefa|first5 = G.|last6 = Sundqvist|first6 = J.-O.|last7 = Granath|first7 = J.|last8 = Baky|first8 = A.|last9 = Thyselius|first9 = L.|url = http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-8913}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using degradable polymers, costs due to waste transportation, landfill maintenance, new landfill excavation and environmental hazard control can be avoided. 
* Lost end-of-life plastic potential:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; processes such as [[energy recovery]] of the plastic by incineration or biological treatment and material recovery by recycling have to be taken into account when assessing the feasibility of manufacturing degradable polymers.

=== Reusable plastic containers ===

The implementation of [[Reuse|reusable]] [[plastic container]]s arises as a consequence of concerns with sustainability and [[environmental impact]]. Use of recyclable plastic packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.ijpe.2013.12.014|title = Economic and environmental assessment of reusable plastic containers: A food catering supply chain case study| journal=International Journal of Production Economics| volume=152| pages=88–101|year = 2014|last1 = Accorsi|first1 = Riccardo| last2=Cascini| first2=Alessandro| last3=Cholette| first3=Susan| last4=Manzini| first4=Riccardo| last5=Mora| first5=Cristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers all the way to the use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.

===Incineration of plastics===

[[plastics recycling|Recycling plastics]] presents the difficulty of handling mixed plastics, as unmixed plastics are usually necessary to maintain desirable properties. Mixing many plastics results in diminished material properties, with even just a few percent of [[polypropylene]] mixed with [[polyethylene]] producing a plastic with significantly reduced [[tensile strength]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Stein|first = Richard S.|year = 1998|title = Polymer Recycling: Thermodynamics and Economics|url =|journal = Macromolecular Symposia}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to recycling of these plastics and those which can’t be easily recycled such as thermosets is to use degradation to break the polymers down into monomers of low molecular weight. The products of this process can be used to make high quality polymers however energy stored in the polymer bonds is lost during this process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An alternative to economically dispose of plastics is to burn them in an [[incinerator]]. Incinerators capable of cleanly burning polymers exist and while they require significant capital investment, the energy produced offsets the economic impact.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 26 September 1989|title = The Environmental Impact of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration|url =|journal = Findings of the International Symposium on Solid Waste Incineration, Symposium: Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most plastics are produced from [[petroleum]], their molecules consist exclusively or primarily of [[carbon]], oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. With proper design, an incinerator can completely combust these plastics allowing the recovery of energy stored in the original petroleum feedstock which would otherwise escape during processes such as degradation. Some polymers contain [[chlorine]] or [[nitrogen]] which can result in undesirable combustion products however the use of [[scrubber]]s can remove such products. The end result is that many polymers burn more cleanly than [[coal]] and as clean as most oils.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">'''Electron equivalent''' is a concept commonly used in [[redox chemistry]], reactions involving [[electron transfer]], to define a quantity (e.g. energy or moles) relative to one electron. [[Gibbs free energy|Energies of formation]] are often given as kilojoules per electron equivalent to enable calculation of specific reaction energies on a "per electron" basis.  Reactions containing movement of electrons are often balanced such that reaction quantities are given in relation to the transfer of a single electron, allowing quantification of reactants and products in relation to a single electron transfer.

{{Other uses}}

In [[mathematics]], an '''embedding''' (or '''imbedding'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}} suggests that "the English" (i.e. the British) use "embedding" instead of "imbedding".&lt;/ref&gt;) is one instance of some [[mathematical structure]] contained within another instance, such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is a [[subgroup]].

When some object ''X'' is said to be embedded in another object ''Y'', the embedding is given by some [[Injective function|injective]] and structure-preserving map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}}. The precise meaning of "structure-preserving" depends on the kind of mathematical structure of which ''X'' and ''Y'' are instances. In the terminology of [[category theory]], a structure-preserving map is called a [[morphism]].

The fact that a map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is an embedding is often indicated by the use of a "hooked arrow" ({{unichar|21AA|RIGHTWARDS ARROW WITH HOOK|ulink=Unicode}});&lt;ref name="Unicode Arrows"&gt;{{cite web| title = Arrows – Unicode| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2190.pdf| accessdate = 2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus: &lt;math&gt; f : X \hookrightarrow Y.&lt;/math&gt; (On the other hand, this notation is sometimes reserved for [[inclusion map]]s.)

Given ''X'' and ''Y'', several different embeddings of ''X'' in ''Y'' may be possible. In many cases of interest there is a standard (or "canonical") embedding, like those of the [[natural number]]s in the [[integer]]s, the integers in the [[rational number]]s, the rational numbers in the [[real number]]s, and the real numbers in the [[complex number]]s. In such cases it is common to identify the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] ''X'' with its [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''X'') contained in ''Y'', so that {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ ''Y''}}.

==Topology and geometry==
===General topology===

In [[general topology]], an embedding is a [[homeomorphism]] onto its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hocking|Young|1988|page=73}}. {{harvnb|Sharpe|1997|page=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More explicitly, an injective [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] map &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; between [[topological space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''topological embedding''' if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; yields a homeomorphism between &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; carries the [[subspace topology]] inherited from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). Intuitively then, the embedding &lt;math&gt;f : X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; lets us treat &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subspace topology|subspace]] of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Every embedding is injective and [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]]. Every map that is injective, continuous and either [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]] is an embedding; however there are also embeddings which are neither open nor closed. The latter happens if the image &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is neither an [[open set]] nor a [[closed set]] in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

For a given space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, the existence of an embedding &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a [[topological invariant]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This allows two spaces to be distinguished if one is able to be embedded in a space while the other is not.

===Differential topology===

In [[differential topology]]:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be smooth [[manifold]]s and &lt;math&gt;f:M\to N&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth map. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] if its [[pushforward (differential)|derivative]] is everywhere injective. An '''embedding''', or a '''smooth embedding''', is defined to be an injective immersion which is an embedding in the topological sense mentioned above (i.e. [[homeomorphism]] onto its image).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bishop|Crittenden|1964|page=21}}. {{harvnb|Bishop|Goldberg|1968|page=40}}. {{harvnb|Crampin|Pirani|1994|page=243}}. {{harvnb|do Carmo|1994|page=11}}. {{harvnb|Flanders|1989|page=53}}. {{harvnb|Gallot|Hulin|Lafontaine|2004|page=12}}. {{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1963|page=9}}. {{harvnb|Kosinski|2007|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lang|1999|page=27}}. {{harvnb|Lee|1997|page=15}}. {{harvnb|Spivak|1999|page=49}}. {{harvnb|Warner|1983|page=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other words, an embedding is [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to its image, and in particular the image of an embedding must be a [[submanifold]]. An immersion is a local embedding (i.e. for any point &lt;math&gt;x\in M&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;x\in U\subset M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f:U\to N&lt;/math&gt; is an embedding.)

When the domain manifold is compact, the notion of a smooth embedding is equivalent to that of an injective immersion.

An important case is &lt;math&gt;N = \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. The interest here is in how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; must be for an embedding, in terms of the dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Whitney embedding theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitney H., ''Differentiable manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''37''' (1936), pp. 645–680&lt;/ref&gt; states that &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; is enough, and is the best possible linear bound. For example the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a power of two, requires &lt;math&gt;n = 2m&lt;/math&gt; for an embedding. However, this does not apply to immersions; for instance, '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be immersed in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; as is explicitly shown by [[Boy's surface]]&amp;mdash;which has self-intersections. The [[Roman surface]] fails to be an immersion as it contains [[cross-cap]]s.

An embedding is '''proper''' if it behaves well with respect to [[Topological_manifold#Manifolds_with_boundary|boundaries]]: one requires the map &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; to be such that

*&lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) = f(X) \cap \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;, and
*&lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to &lt;math&gt;\partial Y&lt;/math&gt; in any point of &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X)&lt;/math&gt;.

The first condition is equivalent to having &lt;math&gt;f(\partial X) \subseteq \partial Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(X \setminus \partial X) \subseteq Y \setminus \partial Y&lt;/math&gt;. The second condition, roughly speaking, says that ''f''(''X'') is not tangent to the boundary of ''Y''.

===Riemannian geometry===

In [[Riemannian geometry]]:
Let (''M,g'') and (''N,h'') be [[Riemannian manifold]]s.
An '''isometric embedding''' is a smooth embedding ''f'' : ''M'' → ''N'' which preserves the  [[Riemannian metric|metric]] in the sense that ''g'' is equal to the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of ''h'' by ''f'', i.e. ''g'' = ''f''*''h''. Explicitly, for any two tangent vectors 

:&lt;math&gt;v,w\in T_x(M)&lt;/math&gt;

we have 

:&lt;math&gt;g(v,w)=h(df(v),df(w)).&lt;/math&gt;

Analogously, '''isometric immersion''' is an immersion between Riemannian manifolds which preserves the Riemannian metrics.

Equivalently, an isometric embedding (immersion) is a smooth embedding (immersion) which preserves length of [[curve]]s (cf. [[Nash embedding theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nash J.,  ''The embedding problem for Riemannian manifolds,'' Ann. of Math. (2), '''63''' (1956), 20–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebra==
In general, for an algebraic category ''C'', an embedding between two ''C''-algebraic structures ''X'' and ''Y'' is a ''C''-morphism {{nowrap|''e'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} that is injective.

===Field theory===

In [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], an '''embedding''' of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''E'' in a field ''F'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''σ'' : ''E'' → ''F''}}.

The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''σ'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''E'' which cannot be the whole field ''E'', because of the condition {{nowrap|1=''σ''(1) = 1}}. Furthermore, it is a well-known property of fields that their only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole field itself. Therefore, the kernel is 0, so any embedding of fields is a [[monomorphism]]. Hence, ''E'' is [[isomorphic]] to the subfield ''σ''(''E'') of ''F''. This justifies the name ''embedding'' for an arbitrary homomorphism of fields.

===Universal algebra and model theory===
{{further|Substructure (mathematics)|Elementary equivalence}}
If σ is a [[signature (logic)|signature]] and &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; are σ-[[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] (also called σ-algebras in [[universal algebra]] or models in [[model theory]]), then a map &lt;math&gt;h:A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is a σ-embedding [[iff]] all of the following hold:
* &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is injective,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;h(f^A(a_1,\ldots,a_n))=f^B(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n))&lt;/math&gt;,
* for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;R \in\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n \in A^n,&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A \models R(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;B \models R(h(a_1),\ldots,h(a_n)).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;A\models R (a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a model theoretical notation equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in R^A&lt;/math&gt;. In model theory there is also a stronger notion of [[elementary embedding]].

==Order theory and domain theory==
In [[order theory]], an embedding of [[partial order]]s is a function F from X to Y such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1,x_2\in X: x_1\leq x_2\Leftrightarrow F(x_1)\leq F(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[domain theory]], an additional requirement is: 

:&lt;math&gt; \forall y\in Y:\{x: F(x)\leq y\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Directed set|directed]].

==Metric spaces==

A mapping &lt;math&gt;\phi: X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; of [[metric spaces]] is called an ''embedding''
(with [[stretch factor|distortion]] &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;) if 
:&lt;math&gt; L d_X(x, y) \leq d_Y(\phi(x), \phi(y)) \leq CLd_X(x,y) &lt;/math&gt;
for some constant &lt;math&gt;L&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Normed spaces ===

An important special case is that of [[normed spaces]]; in this case it is natural to consider linear embeddings. 

One of the basic questions that can be asked about a finite-dimensional [[normed space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \| \cdot \|)&lt;/math&gt; is, ''what is the maximal dimension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;\ell_2^k&lt;/math&gt; can be linearly embedded into &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with constant distortion?''

The answer is given by [[Dvoretzky's theorem]].

==Category theory==

In [[category theory]], there is no satisfactory and generally accepted definition of embeddings that is applicable in all categories. One would expect that all isomorphisms and all compositions of embeddings are embeddings, and that all embeddings are monomorphisms. Other typical requirements are: any [[monomorphism#Related concepts|extremal monomorphism]] is an embedding and embeddings are stable under [[Pullback (category theory)|pullback]]s.

Ideally the class of all embedded [[subobject]]s of a given object, up to isomorphism, should also be [[small class|small]], and thus an [[ordered set]]. In this case, the category is said to be well powered with respect to the class of embeddings. This allows defining new local structures in the category (such as a [[closure operator]]). 

In a [[concrete category]], an '''embedding''' is a morphism ''ƒ'':&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' which is an injective function from the underlying set of ''A'' to the underlying set of ''B'' and is also an '''initial morphism''' in the following sense:
If ''g'' is a function from the underlying set of an object ''C'' to the underlying set of ''A'', and if its composition with ''ƒ'' is a morphism ''ƒg'':&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'', then ''g'' itself is a morphism.

A [[factorization system]] for a category also gives rise to a notion of embedding. If (''E'',&amp;nbsp;''M'') is a factorization system, then the morphisms in ''M'' may be regarded as the embeddings, especially when the category is well powered with respect to&amp;nbsp;''M''. Concrete theories often have a factorization system in which ''M'' consists of the embeddings in the previous sense. This is the case of the majority of the examples given in this article.

As usual in category theory, there is a [[dual (category theory)|dual]] concept, known as quotient. All the preceding properties can be dualized.

An embedding can also refer to an [[Subcategory#Embeddings|embedding functor]].

'''Endoxa''' ({{lang-el|ἔνδοξα}}) derives from the word ''[[doxa]]'' (δόξα, meaning "beliefs", "opinions"). Whereas [[Plato]] condemned ''doxa'' as a starting point from which to attain truth, [[Aristotle]] used the term ''endoxa''{{spaced ndash}}in the sense of "commonplace", "everyday", "consensus"{{spaced ndash}}to identify a group or population's beliefs that had previously withstood debate and argument (and were, thereby, more stable than ''doxa'').

Examples of Aristotle's use of ''endoxa'' may be found in the ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics][Book I 1 100b18 Loeb Classical Library #391 p. 273]]'' of the ''[[Organon]]'' and in his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''. Otfried Höffe, translated by Christine Salazar, offers a detailed discussion of the topic in "Aristotle" (2003; {{pp.|35|42}}).

'''The Experimental Television Center (ETC)''' (1969-2011) was a nonprofit [[Electronic art|Electronic]] and [[Media art|Media Art]] center located in [[upstate New York]].

==History==

The Experimental Television Center (ETC) was founded in 1971 by Ralph Hocking. The center was the result of the expansion of a media access program that Ralph Hocking established as Professor of video and computer art at [[Binghamton University]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=High, Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Sherry Miller|last3=Jimenez|first3=Mona|title=The emergence of video processing tools : television becoming unglued|date=2014|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=184150663X|page=xvii|authorlink1=Kathy High}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, in July 1979, the center was moved from [[Binghamton]] to [[Owego, New York]].

The ETC, directed by Ralph Hocking and Sherry Miller Hocking, was devoted to the exploration and development of potential uses of new technology in video and [[media art]]. Artists, social, cultural and educational organizations and also interested individuals worked in innovative image processing tools, using all the equipment and the studio facilities with no charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hocking|first1=Ralph|title=Experimental Television Center: A brief History|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/etc-history|website=Experimental Television Center|accessdate=11 May 2015}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20150209021443/http://experimentaltvcenter.org/etc-history-1968-1971 Archived] by [[Internet Archive]] on 9 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for more than 40 years had provided a residency program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Experimental Television Center |url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/ExpTeleCenter/general.pdf |website=[[Vasulka|VASULKA.ORG]] |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406022736/http://www.vasulka.org/archive/ExhTWO/ExpTeleCenter/general.pdf |archivedate=6 April 2008 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 14 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residency Program |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/residency-program |website=Experimental Television Center |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322085511/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/residency-program |archivedate=22 March 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 22 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; that emphasized the aesthetic experimentation of electronic and media art though new technologies. Artists from around the world and students were trained and worked with rare and unique analog and digital devices for creating video artworks and had access to the media art library of the center. For Ralph Hocking, the center was "a learning place [...], where artists and engineers worked in tandem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the center organized exhibitions, workshops, cultural events, conferences and provided grand programs to support artists and non-profit media art programs.

In 2011, the Residency and Grants Program of the center was closed. The center’s media arts collection has since been archived and housed at the [[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]] through [[Cornell University Library]]’s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video library and archives of the Experimental Television Center|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813.001/8946249|website=[[Rose Goldsen Archive of New Media Art]], ETC|publisher=[[Cornell University Library]]}}[http://goldsen.library.cornell.edu/etc/Archived] by [[Internet Archive]] on 20 May 2015.{{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center, through the Video History Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video History Project|url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/video-history-project|website=Experimental Television Center|accessdate=11 May 2015}}

==Tools==
One of the early projects at the center (1972), a research program aiming to develop a more flexible set of imaging tools for artists, involved the construction of the "Paik/Abe video synthesizer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A brief overview of the Paik-Abe video synthesizer|url=http://www.audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/paik_abe/paik_abe.htm|website=AudioVisualizers.com|accessdate=11 May 2015|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103100214/http://audiovisualizers.com/toolshak/vidsynth/paik_abe/paik_abe.htm|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 3 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paik-Abe Screening Not Still Art Festival Catalog |url=http://www.improvart.com/nsa/paik_abe.htm |website=ImprovArt.com |accessdate=11 May 2015 |archivedate=2011-01-10 |location=Cherry Valley, NY |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110054013/http://www.improvart.com/nsa/paik_abe.htm |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 10 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[video synthesizer]] was designed by Shuya Abe and [[Nam June Paik]] and built at the center by David Jones and Robert Diamond, for the TV Lab at [[WNET-TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fifield |first1=George |title=The Paik/Abe Synthesizer |url=http://davidsonsfiles.org/paikabesythesizer.html |website=The Early Video Project |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411014509/http://davidsonsfiles.org/paikabesythesizer.html |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Dunn|editor1-first=David|title=Nam June Paik and Shuya Abe: Paik/Abe video Synthesizer (Keyer and Colorizer) and Scan Modulator (aka "the Wobbulator"), 1970|journal=Eigenwelt Der Apparate-Welt: Pioneers of Electronic Art; [[Ars Electronica]], 1992 (Catalogue)|date=1994|pages=126–129|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/eigenwelt/pdf/126-129.pdf|accessdate=11 May 2015|publisher=[[Vasulka|The Vasulkas, Inc]].|location=Francisco Carolinum, [[Linz]]|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024223034/http://vasulka.org/archive/eigenwelt/pdf/126-129.pdf|archivedate=24 October 2004|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was funded by [[New York State Council on the Arts|the New York State Council on the Arts]].

In the early of 1970s, the center was the home to many innovative tools that artists in residency took advantage of to make complex and technologically progressive artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=ed. by Jon|title=The end of cinema as we know it : American cinema in the nineties|date=2002|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=9780745318790|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Abe colorizer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hocking |first1=Sherry Miller |last2=Brewster |first2=Richard |last3=Peer |first3=Bode |last4=Rudolph |first4=Hank |last5=Schlanger |first5=Matthew |title=Paik/Abe Colorizer - Experimental Television Center Studio System Manual |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/paikabe-colorizer-experimental-television-center-studio-system-manual |website=Experimental Television Center |accessdate=11 May 2015 |date=1980 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520153922/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/paikabe-colorizer-experimental-television-center-studio-system-manual |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 20 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; for example, "an image processing device, was the precursor of many of special effects that nowadays are taken for granted", as [[Bill T.

[[Gary Hill]], artist-in-residence at the Experimental Television Center from 1975 to 1977, explained that this scan processor "allowed one to manipulate the video image, providing an enormous amount of flexibility in altering a video input or in generating new images by using other inputs like waveforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Robert C.|title=Gary Hill|date=2000|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=9780801864025|pages=194–195|chapter=Lucinda Furlong, A Manner of Speaking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the center started a long-term collaboration with the artist and engineer Dave Jones, who was repairing, modifying and building video equipment for the center. After becoming the ETC’s full-time technician, Jones designed a series of tools for video image processing to be used at the Center by a number of video artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones |first1=Dave |title=Bio |url=http://www.djdesign.com/davebio.html |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610201058/http://www.djdesign.com/davebio.html |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 10 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tools available in the ETC studio included the "Jones colorizer" (1974, 1975), the "Jones 8-input sequencer" (1984, 1985), the "Jones keyer" (1985), the "Jones buffer" (1986), the "Voltage control", and the "Raster manipulation unit–wobbulator".

In mid- 1970s, the center started to research the interface of an "LSI-11 computer" with a video processing system with the collaboration of [[Vasulka|Steina and Woody Vasulka]] and the support of [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hocking |first1=Sherry Miller |title=The Evolution of Thinking Machines |journal=The Squealer, Squeaky Wheel/ Buffalo Media Resources |date=2004 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=9 |url=http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/sites/default/files/history/pdf/HockingThinkingMachines_1802.pdf |accessdate=11 May 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520154524/http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/sites/default/files/history/pdf/HockingThinkingMachines_1802.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2015 |df= }} by [[Internet Archive]] on 27 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to make a digital imaging system more user-friendly to the artists. In the late of 1970s and the beginning of 1980s, the ETC’s research programs shifted from the hardware building to artist-oriented software development and to completing new and old tools and systems.&lt;ref name="Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=High, Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Ralph|last3=Hocking|first3=Sherry Miller|title=Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009|date=2009|publisher=Experimental Television Center, LTD|location=Owego, NY|pages=24–25|url=http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|chapter=Radical Learning, Radical Perception: The History of the Experimental Television Center|authorlink1=Kathy High|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520151443/http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-20|df=}} by [[Internet Archive]] on 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 1980s, the center’s interest transitioned to the new "[[Amiga computer]]". Subsequently, in the 1990s, the available image processing system was enriched by commercially available tools. According to Ralph and Sherry Miller Hocking, the image processing system became through the years “a hybrid tool set, permitting the artist to create interactive relationships between older historically analog instruments and new digital technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=High|first1=Kathy|last2=Hocking|first2=Ralph|last3=Hocking|first3=Sherry Miller|title=Experimental Television Center DVD compilation collection 1969-2009|date=2009|publisher=Experimental Television Center, LTD|location=Owego, NY|pages=24–25|url=http://kathyhigh.com/pdfs/writing-video-history/ETC.pdf|chapter=Radical Learning, Radical Perception: The History of the Experimental Television Center|authorlink1=Kathy High}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at the beginning of the 1990s, using a [[Relational database|computerized relational database]], the center started to catalog the antique equipment, all the video and audio tapes and also the printed material.

{{further|Language proficiency}}Language fluency is one of a variety of terms used to characterize or measure a person's language ability,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Bilingual Education|last=González|first=Josué M.|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781412937207|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; often used in conjunction with accuracy and complexity.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58970182|title=Analysing learner language|author=Ellis, Rod|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Barkhuizen, Gary Patrick.|isbn=0194316343|location=Oxford|oclc=58970182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no widely agreed-upon definitions or measures of language fluency,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chambers"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Francine|title=What do we mean by fluency?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00046-8|journal=System|volume=25|issue=4|pages=535–544|doi=10.1016/s0346-251x(97)00046-8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; someone is typically said to be fluent if their use of the [[language]] appears ''fluid'', or natural, coherent, and easy as opposed to slow, halting use.&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; In other words, fluency is often described as the ability to [[Language production|produce language]] on demand and be understood.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

Varying definitions of fluency characterize it by the language user’s automaticity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=R.|date=1992|title=Psychological mechanisms underlying second language fluency|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=14|pages=357–385|via=|doi=10.1017/s0272263100011189}}&lt;/ref&gt; their speed and coherency of language use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual differences in language ability and language behavior|last=Fillmore|first=C.

Language fluency is sometimes contrasted with accuracy (or correctness of language use, especially grammatical correctness)&lt;ref name="Chambers" /&gt; and complexity (or a more encompassing knowledge of vocabulary and discourse strategies).&lt;ref name="Gonzalez" /&gt; Fluency, accuracy, and complexity are distinct but interrelated components of [[language acquisition]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]].

=== Types of fluency ===
There are four commonly discussed types of fluency: reading fluency, oral fluency, oral-reading fluency, and written or compositional fluency. These types of fluency are interrelated, but do not necessarily develop in tandem or linearly. One may develop fluency in certain type(s) and be less fluent or nonfluent in others.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;

In the sense of proficiency, "fluency" encompasses a number of related but separable skills:
* '''Reading fluency''' refers to the link between the recognition of words while reading and [[reading comprehension]],&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt; which manifests itself in the speed and accuracy that one is able to read text.&lt;ref name=Guillot/&gt; Research on reading fluency aligns concepts of accuracy, automaticity, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].&lt;ref name=Rasinski/&gt;  To achieve reading fluency, readers must have knowledge of the content of the language as well as the [[vocabulary]] being used. Interventions designed to help children learn to read fluently generally include some form of repeated reading, but this process may differ for children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]], who may struggle with reading fluency.&lt;ref name=Wolfe/&gt;
* '''Oral fluency''' or '''speaking fluency''' is a measurement both of production and reception of [[speech]], as a fluent speaker must be able to understand and respond to others in conversation. [[Spoken language]] is typically characterized by seemingly non-fluent qualities (e.g., fragmentation, pauses, false starts, hesitation, repetition) because of ‘task stress.’ How orally fluent one is can therefore be understood in terms of perception, and whether these qualities of speech can be perceived as expected and natural (i.e., fluent) or unusual and problematic (i.e., non-fluent).&lt;ref name=Guillot&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44961785|title=Fluency and its teaching|author=Guillot, Marie-Noëlle,|date=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=1853594393|location=Clevedon, U.K.|oclc=44961785}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oral reading fluency''' is sometimes distinguished from oral fluency. Oral reading fluency refers to the ability to read words accurately and quickly while using good vocal expression and phrasing.&lt;ref name=Rasinski&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasinski, T. V. |year=2006 |chapter=A brief history of reading fluency |editor1=Samuels, S. |author2=Farstrup, A. |title=What research has to say about fluency instruction |pages=70–93 |location=Newark, DE |publisher=International Reading Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral reading fluency is often linked to Schreiber’s Theory of Prosody, which places importance on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], rhythm, and expressiveness of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Peter A.|date=1991-06-01|title=Understanding prosody's role in reading acquisition|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405849109543496|journal=Theory Into Practice|volume=30|issue=3|pages=158–164|doi=10.1080/00405849109543496|issn=0040-5841}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Written or compositional fluency''' can be measured in a variety of ways. Researchers have measured by length of the [[Composition (language)|composition]] (especially under timed conditions), words produced per minute, sentence length, or words per clause. Ratio measures (e.g., words per clause, words per sentence, and words per error-free sentence) have historically been most valid and reliable.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40664312|title=Second language development in writing : measures of fluency, accuracy, &amp; complexity|author1=Wolfe-Quintero, Kate|date=1998|publisher=Second Language Teaching &amp; Curriculum Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa|author2=Shunji, Inagaki |author3=Hae-Young, Kim|isbn=9780824820695|location=Honolulu|oclc=40664312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluency in second-language acquisition ===

Because an assessment of fluency is typically a measure or characterization of one's language ability, determining fluency may be a more challenging task when the speaker is acquiring a second language. It is generally thought that the later in life a learner approaches the study of a foreign language, the harder it is to acquire receptive  ([[Hearing (sense)|auditory]]) comprehension and fluent production (speaking) skills. For adults, once their mother tongue has already been established, the acquisition of a second language can come more slowly and less completely, ultimately affecting fluency. However, the [[critical period hypothesis]] is a hotly debated topic, with some scholars stating that adults can in fact become fluent in acquiring a second language. For instance, reading and writing skills in a foreign language can be acquired more easily even after the primary [[language acquisition]] period of youth is over.&lt;ref name=harrell/&gt;

So although it is often assumed that young children learn languages more easily than adolescents and adults,{{sfn|McLaughlin|1992}}{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}} the reverse is in fact true; older learners are faster. The only exception to this rule is in [[pronunciation]]. Young children invariably learn to speak their second language with native-like pronunciation, whereas learners who start learning a language at an older age only rarely reach a native-like level.{{sfn|Dicker|2003|pp=88–92}}

====Second-language acquisition in children====

Since childhood is a [[critical period]], widespread opinion holds that it is easier for young children to learn a second language than it is for adults.  Children can even acquire native fluency when exposed to the language on a consistent basis with rich interaction in a social setting.  In addition to capacity, factors like; 1) motivation, 2) aptitude, 3) personality characteristics, 4) age of acquisition 5) first language typology 6) socio-economic status and 7) quality and context of L2 input play a role in L2 acquisitions rate and building fluency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|title=Second Language Acquisition in Childhood|last=Paradis|first=Johanne|date=August 2006|website=University of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jparadis/Johanne_Paradis_Homepage/Publications_files/P_CSLA_Handbook.pdf|archive-date=2018-05-09|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second language acquisition (SLA) has the ability to influence children’s cognitive growth and linguistic development.

Skill that consists of ability to produce words in target language develops until adolescence.  Natural ability to acquire a new language with a deliberate effort may begin to diminish around puberty i.e. 12–14 years of age.  Learning environment, comprehensible instructional materials, teacher, and the learner are indispensable elements in SLA and developing fluency in children.  Extensive reading in L2 can offer twofold benefits in foreign language learning i.e. "reading to comprehend English and reading to learn English".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|title=The Role of Unput, Interaction and Output in the Development of Oral Fluency|last=Zhang|first=Shumei|date=December 2009|website=English Language Teaching|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202053320/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3d3/257374693bf714c2cb8f6a311d31cc17ec12.pdf|archive-date=2017-12-02|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradis (2006)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; study on childhood language acquisition and building fluency examines how first and second language acquisition patterns are generally similar including vocabulary and morphosyntax.  Phonology of first language is usually apparent in SLA and initial L1 influence can be lifelong, even for child L2 learners.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Children can acquire a second language simultaneously (learn L1 and L2 at the same time) or sequentially (learn L1 first and then L2).  In the end, they develop fluency in both with one dominant language which is spoken largely by the community they live in.

According to one source, there are five stages of SLA and developing fluency:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=McREL International|title=McREL - The Five Stages of Second Language Acquisition|date=2014-08-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|accessdate=2017-12-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509173500/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNDNNW6LgWM|archivedate=2018-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018}}

# Early production

# Intermediate fluency
# Advanced fluency.

====Second-language acquisition in adults====

The process of learning a second language or "L2," among older learners differs from younger learners because of their [[working memory]]. Working memory, also connected to fluency because it deals with automatic responses, is vital to language acquisition. This happens when information is stored and manipulated temporarily. During working memory, words are filtered, processed, and rehearsed, and information is stored while focusing on the next piece of interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackey | first1 = A. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = Rebecca | year = 2012 | title = Older Learners in SLA Research: A First Look at Working Memory, Feedback, and L2 Development | url = | journal = Language Learning | volume = 62 | issue = 3| page = 724 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2011.00649.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These false starts, pauses or repetitions found in fluency assessments, can also be found within one's working memory as part of communication.

Those with education at or below a high school level are least likely to take language classes. It has also been found that women and young immigrants are more likely to take language classes.&lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Further, highly educated immigrants who are searching for skilled jobs – which require interpersonal and intercultural skills that are difficult to learn – are the most affected by lower fluency in the L2.

==Speech-language pathology==
Fluency is a [[speech language pathology]] term that means the smoothness or flow with which sounds, syllables, words and phrases are joined together when speaking quickly.&lt;ref name=harrell&gt;{{cite web

Both disorders have breaks in the fluidity of speech, and both have the fluency breakdown of repetition of parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65617513|title=Stuttering and cluttering : frameworks for understanding and treatment|last=9-|first=Ward, David, 1956 December|date=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9781841693347|location=Hove [England]|oclc=65617513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In creativity ==

Studies in the assessment of creativity list fluency as one of the four primary elements in creative thinking, the others being flexibility, originality and elaboration. Fluency in creative thinking is seen as the ability to think of many diverse ideas quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16354591|title=The Nature of creativity : contemporary psychological perspectives|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Sternberg, Robert J.|isbn=052133036X|location=Cambridge|oclc=16354591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fogging''' is a type of visual censorship. An area for a picture or movie is blurred to obscure it from sight. This form of [[censorship]] is used for sexually related images/scenes, hiding [[genitals]], [[pubic hair]], or [[sexual penetration]] of any sort. [[Pixelization]] is a form of fogging. In [[Japan]], where it is called ''bokashi'', fogging is employed on most films that show pubic hair or genitals, including [[hardcore pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eiga9.altervista.org/articulos/obscenity.html|title=Obscenity and Article 175 of the Japanese Penal Code: A Short Introduction to Japanese Censorship|accessdate=2014-05-08|last=da Silva|first=Joaquin|date=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of editing also appears in television programs where an individual's face may not be shown due to legal or privacy concerns. As it does not contrast with the surrounding image very much, it is preferable over most other forms of censorship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Fogging is also used if the scenes which are too bloody and gruesome to be rendered even in black and white, over vehicle license plates, mainly to protect the identities of the vehicles' owners, and over branded items and specific company names to obscure their background.

'''Green consumption''', is closely related to the notions of [[sustainable development]] or [[sustainable consumer behaviour]]. It is a form of consumption that is compatible with the safeguard of the environment for the present and for the next generations. It is a concept which ascribes to consumers responsibility or co-responsibility for addressing environmental problems through adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors, such as the use of organic products, clean and [[renewable energy]] and the research of goods produced by companies with zero, or almost, impact.&lt;ref&gt;J. Connoly, A. Prothero, 2008, Green consumption: life-politics, risk and contradictions, Journal of consumer culture, vol. 8, pp. 117-145&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Western societies, during the ‘60s and the early ‘70s, the necessity to protect the environment and the people health from the effects caused by industrial pollutants and by the continuous growth of economic and population has developed this new idea of consumption. In the 1980s first American "green" brands began to appear and exploded on the American market. During the 1990s green products had a slow mild growth, remaining a niche phenomenon. American interest in green products . started to increase again in the early 2000s with greater speed and, despite the latest recession, it has been continuing to grow.&lt;ref&gt;R.Elliott, 2013, The taste for green:the possibilities and dynamics of status differentiation through "green" consumption, Sci Verse ScienceDirect, ELSEVIER, vol. 41, pp. 294-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development ==
The origin of the necessity to behave in an environmental-friendly way goes back to the 1960s and '70s. In particular after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]], Western countries start to think about the use of renewable energy, as an alternative to fuel fossil. Nowadays green consumption is considered a basic point of environmental reform and it is also guarantee by supra-national organizations like European Union.  Some sociologist argue that after the increasing [[globalization]], people feel more interconnected with other people and the environment, so there has been increasing awareness of global [[environmental problems]], especially in western countries. 
The main forums in which the issue has been discussed, and provided guidelines to orient national governments are: [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment]]; [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#World Conservation Strategy|IUCN 1980 World Conservation Strategy]]; [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983 and 1987 Brundtland Report]]; Italy 1993 National Plan for Sustainable Development; Aalborg 1994, 1st European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Lisbon 1996, 2nd European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Hannover 2000, 3rd Conference on Sustainable Cities; European Union in 2001, VI Environmental Action Plan 2002/2010; Aalborg +10 and the Aalborg Commitments in 2004.

== Pro-environmental behavior ==
Green consumer behavior is a form of pro-environmental behavior, which can be defined as a form of consumption that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment.&lt;ref&gt;L. Steg, C. Vlek, 2009, Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour: An integrative review and research agenda, Journal of environmental psychology, vol. 29, pp. 309-317&lt;/ref&gt; Past research has provided empirical support to the claim that green or pro-environmental consumer behavior is a multidimensional construct&lt;ref&gt;M.

Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; which is composed of:

* "Private-sphere behavior" refers to the purchase, use and disposal of personal and household products that have environmental impact,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as automobiles, public transportation, or recycling&lt;ref&gt;M.

Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Public-sphere behavior" refers to behavior that affects the environment directly through committed environmental activism or indirectly by influencing public policies,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as active involvement in environmental organizations and demonstrations (direct impact) or petitioning on environmental issues (indirect impact)&lt;ref&gt;M.

Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual factors such as monetary incentives, costs, regulations, public policy norms, as well as subjectively perceived factors such as perceived resources available&lt;ref&gt;E. Olli, G. Grendstad, D. Wollebaek, 2001, Correlates of environmental behaviors: Bringing back social context, Environment and Behavior, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 181-208&lt;/ref&gt; have a strong impact on consumer pro-environmental behavior and thus green consumption through the mediating effect of attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, it is through attitude, that subjectively perceived contextual factors such as, for example, the extent to which consumers perceive having more or less time, money and power available, modulate pro-environmental behavior, in general, and green consumption, in particular.

== Green consumer behavior ==
We can define a green consumer behavior the one that has these characteristics:

* "purchase choice, product use and post-use, household management, collective, and consumer activism behaviors, reflecting some degree of environmental- related motivation";&lt;ref&gt;K. Peattie, 2010, Green consumption: behavior and norms, vol. 35, pp. 195-228&lt;/ref&gt;
* "purchase and use of products with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable products, recycled or reduced packaging, and low energy usage";&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;
* use of organic product, made with processes that provide [[energy saving]], then by the action of [[recycling]], in fact a green consumer is "one who purchase products and services perceived to have a positive (or less negative) influence on the environment […]"&lt;ref&gt;K. Haws, R. Walker Naylor, K. Page Winterich, 2013, Seeing the world through GREEN- tinted Glasses: Green Consumption Values and Responses to Environmentally Friendly Products, Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/ref&gt; 
We can find a green consumer behavior when an individual acts ethically, motivated not only by his/her personal needs, but also by the respect and preservation of the welfare of entire society, because a green consumer takes into account the environmental consequences (costs and benefits) of his/her private consumption. Green consumers are expected to be more conscientious in their use of assets, for example by using their goods without wasting resources. 
However the Eurobarometer’s survey of consumers’ behavior (2013) showed that consumers seem not to be fully conscious of the importance to adopt a set of new behaviors, that are more environmental-friendly. In this report it is possible to find that even though a very high proportion of citizens buy green products (80%), more than a half are classified as occasional maintenance (54%), and only a quarter are regular buyer of green products (26%).
This fact implies that most of people do not behave like green consumer continuously, probably because of a lot of social and economic constraints, such as the fact that green products are much more expensive than non-green ones, and also because it is not always so easy to find organic and [[biological]] goods for each category, and because the green-retailers are not so widespread. Some researchers find that personal values are influential determinants of consumption and that pro-environmental behavior might serve as a signal of personality dimension. Considering the time-horizon in the acquisition of green behavior, we can distinguish two types of consumers:

# prevention-type consumers, that feel a moral duty towards a greener lifestyle
# promotion-type, that are more focused on their aspirations and their dreams and don't strongly feel the pressure to quickly adjust their behavior in the direction of becoming more environmental-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bertoli, M. Bonera, A. Codini, E. Corvi, G. Miniero, 2014, Being green: from attitude to actual consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 521-528&lt;/ref&gt;
Another research find the effect of gender and [[social identity]] on green consumption: "female declared higher levels of sustainable consumption compared with male participants; however when social identity is salient, male increased their [[sustainable consumption]] intentions to the same level as female.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;  In this research are identified two kind of people, that have more:

# self-transcendent values, like woman, that are more willing to engage in sustainable consumption
# self-enhanced values, like men, that are less interested in green behavior

The fact is that sustainable consumption is, for men, a way to reinforce their social image, showing to others that they care about environment, instead for women is intrinsically important. The evidence is that green consumers are mainly female, aged between 30 and 44 years old, well educated, in a household with a high annual income.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on [[sustainable consumption]], International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principal areas of developed green consumption ==

=== [[Green energy]] ===
Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution.

=== Green food ===
In the food area, there is a recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food|local]] food.  
Organic food is produced through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and wormers common in intensive livestock farming. 
Consumers can also choose to buy local food in order to reduce the social and environmental impacts of "food miles" – the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seyfang, 2007, Growing sustainable consumption communities, The case of local organic food networks, International Journal of Sociology and social policy, vol. 27, pp. 120-134&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.

=== Green fashion ===
{{Main article|Sustainable fashion}}
''"Ethical clothing refers to clothing that takes into consideration the impact of production and trade on the environment and on the people behind the clothes we wear. Eco clothing refers to all clothing that has been manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. It includes organic textiles and sustainable materials such as hemp and non-textiles such as bamboo or recycled plastic bottles. It also includes recycled products (clothes made from recycled clothing including vintage, textile and other materials and can also be termed re-used) and is not necessarily made from organic fibers. Organic clothing means clothes that have been made with a minimum use of chemicals and with minimum damage to the environment and fair-trade is intended to achieve better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms for farmers and workers in the developing world".''&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The three main reasons that would motivate the purchase of organic cloths are:
* Environmental -friendly protection;
* Health impact;
* Ethical concerns.

Another important question is related to the textile and clothing industry that generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. 
Consumers are concerned about this (environmental) issues, and are best motivated to change their behaviors in a [[philanthropic]] or environmental-friendly actions that adapt with their financial and sustainability interests.
An intuitive and sustainable strategy is the reusing cloths. Textile recycling is a method of reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. This can reduce manufacturing pollution and [[resource consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. H. Hu, Q. Li, X. J. Chen, Y. F. Wang, 2014, Sustainable Rent-Based Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Fashion Products, Sustainability, vol. 6, pp. 7063-7088&lt;/ref&gt;  The world is facing one of the worst economic crises ever, which affects all industries, including fashion and luxury. In this way moderate consumption is becoming an implicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;  
Consumers pay attention to the origin and the materials of the clothes they buy and the fact that they are not harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton incorporated: http://www.cottoninc.com/corporate/Market-Data/SupplyChainInsights/consumer-perspectives-on-green-apparel/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the issue of trust arises and a label certifying the organic origin is strongly required. 
But consumers often have a lack of information of green fashion or maybe they are unaware of the existence of green fashion alternatives to traditional adult fashion. 
Thus, there is a need to create awareness and inform better the consumers on the nature of organic fashion.

The '''Habitats Directive''' (more formally known as '''Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora''') is a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 1992 as an EU response to the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Berne Convention]]. It is one of the EU's two directives in relation to wildlife and nature conservation, the other being the [[Birds Directive]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature |title=EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Homepage |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JNCC-EUlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1372 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – European Legislation |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of European nature's policies that establishes one organised network—[[Natura 2000]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Natura 2000]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} which intends to protect nature and wildlife. The Habitats Directive requires national governments to specify areas that are expected to be ensuring the conservation of flora and fauna species.

The '''Habitats Directive''' assures the conservation of endangered native animal and plant divisions. It aims to protect 220 habitats and approximately 1,000 species listed in the directive's Annexes. These are species and habitats which are considered to be of European interest, following criteria given in the directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm EUROPA – Environnement – Nature and Biodiversity – Mission Statement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019093120/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/mission_statement/index_en.htm |date=19 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-Habitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1374 |title=Joint Nature Conservation Committee – EC Habitats Directive |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=30 October 1994 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It directs Member States of the EU to take measures to maintain the "favourable conservation status" of protected habitats and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Yaffa|date=7 May 2016|title=Favourable Conservation Status for Species: Examining the Habitats Directive’s Key Concept through a Case Study of the Swedish Wolf|url=http://jel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/05/06/jel.eqw006|journal=Journal of Environmental Law|pages=eqw006|doi=10.1093/jel/eqw006|issn=0952-8873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annex I covers habitats, 
* Annex II species requiring designation of [[Special Areas of Conservation]], 
* Annex IV species in need of strict protection, and 
* Annex V species whose taking from the wild can be restricted by European law.
The directive led to the setting up of a network of Special Areas of Conservation, which together with the existing [[Special Protection Area]]s form a network of protected sites across the [[European Union]] called [[Natura 2000]].&lt;ref name="EUwebsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JNCC-EUlaw"/&gt; Article 17 of the directive requires EU Member States to report on the state of their protected areas every six years. The first complete set of country data was reported in 2007.

==History==

From 1988 to 1992, the policy was given importance at the national level by policy experts, scientists and ecologists and later on spawned political, social and administrative discussions within the states that are engaged in the policy in the 1990s.

In 1998, the protection of the habitat of the [[European hamster]]&lt;ref&gt;[[European hamster]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} —''Korenwolf'', received a lot of attention from the public and the media during discussions projected by the ''Non-governmental Organization'' responsible for the matter. The extinction of the species symbolised the failed conservation of wild flora and fauna and other species of plants and animals and the deficiency of the pursuit for nature policies in the Netherlands.

==Implications==
Due to differences in nature conservation traditions, national problems have arisen in the implementation of the directive. Since member states in the South and East of Europe participated less in nature policies, these states experienced misfits in promoting the new EU-originating provisions. In Germany, Austria, Italy and Belgium, the observation of conflicts between various government layers have caused prolonged delays in the management of nature policies. On the other hand, in member states such as United Kingdom and Sweden, positive outcomes have developed due to stakeholder involvement, pro-active authorities, agencies responsible for implementation and public participation.

Not only does the '''Habitats Directive''' promote nature and wildlife conservation but it also develops a disquisition between ''"economy" and "ecology"'' (Van der Zouwen and Van den Top 2002). Several discussions have been made regarding the directive and its flaws by the Dutch politics and administration— these discussions are still going on until today. The disadvantages of the policy have been believed to raise awareness on Europe's implementation of policies. Representatives of provinces and municipalities have been putting efforts in implementing nature policies within their area and scope. The '''Habitats Directive''' and [[Birds Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Birds Directive]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}were considered as the first legitimate effort in pursuing [[Europeanization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Europeanisation]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

The Project is known primarily for the ''[[Human Security Report 2005]]'', which provided evidence that, according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[war]]s, [[genocide]]s, and international crises since the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033240/http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2008-05-16 }} (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in armed conflict in recent history has been referred to as the [[Long Peace]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504335-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Long-Peace-Inquiries-Into-History/dp/0195043359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=Lawrence|title=Stephen Pinker and the long peace: alliance, deterrence and decline|journal=Cold War History|volume=14|issue=4|year=2014|pages=657–672|issn=1468-2745|doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.950243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is general agreement among experts that the frequency of war has declined since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; despite a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423–451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the ''Human Security Brief 2006'', updating the core global trend data from the 2005 ''Report'', and the ''Human Security Brief 2007''. The 2007 ''Brief'' demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world. If fatalities from [[political violence]] against [[civilian]]s perpetrated by [[Non-state actor|non-state groups]] in [[Iraq]] are counted as deaths from terrorism, the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005915/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114431/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 |date=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in [[civil war]] by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 ''Brief'', the incidence of global terrorism has again increased, with most of the increase being in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, the 2007 ''Brief'' suggested positive change in Sub-Saharan Africa's security landscape; the number of conflicts being waged in the region more than halved between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000129/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published, in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the ''miniAtlas of Human Security''.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security"&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073705/http://miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ |date=2009-03-11 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an "at-a-glance guide to global security issues", using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's ''miniAtlas'' series.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075252/http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas |date=2011-07-17 }} (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the ''miniAtlas'' into Russian, Japanese, and Arabic.

In 2010, the Project launched the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' at the [[United Nations]]. Part I of the ''Report'' examines "The Causes of Peace" since the end of [[World War II]]. Part II examines "The Shrinking Costs of War", paying particular attention to "indirect deaths" from war-exacerbated disease and [[malnutrition]]. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world. A hard copy version of the ''Report'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] early in 2011. The text of the ''Report'' is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

*[[Human Security Gateway]]
*[http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/overview.aspx Human Security Research]

== Funding and collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in peace and conflict studies, including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], based in [[Norway]]
*The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], based in [[Sweden]]

It has received funding from a number of governments, including:

*Canada's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]]
*The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]]
*The [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*The [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]

The Project is a principal partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends––are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?––than in absolute numbers. For [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths––incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' contains a discussion of these debates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3919">'''Immanent critique''' is a method of discussing culture which aims to locate contradictions in society's rules and systems. This method is used in the study of cultural forms in philosophy and the social sciences and humanities. It may be contrasted with "transcendental" [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]]  [[critical philosophy]]. Immanent critique further aims to contextualize not only the object of its investigation, but also the [[ideology|ideological]] basis of that object: both the object and the category to which it belongs are shown to be products of a historical process. Immanent critique has its roots in the dialectic of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and the criticisms by [[Karl Marx]]. Today it is strongly associated with the [[critical theory|critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] as well as literary theorists such as [[Fredric Jameson]] who, in his seminal work [[The Political Unconscious]], explored the idea of an immanent analysis of texts to argue the primacy of political interpretation. [[Roy Bhaskar]] has advocated it as one of the key methodological elements of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008) [1975], ''A Realist Theory of Science'' (Routledge 'With a new introduction' edition), Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of immanent critique is the detection of societal contradictions which suggest possibilities for emancipatory social change. It considers ideas’ role in shaping society, with focus on future emancipatory change. An immanent critique of a value is a discussion of the principles (overt or implicit) the value proposes. It highlights the gaps between what something stands for and what is being done in actual terms. Immanent critique tries to find contradictions and indirectly provide alternatives, without constructing an entirely new theory.

Quoting Marx, Robert J. Antonio writes in the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'',
:"'Setting out from [[idealism]] ... I hit upon seeking the Idea in the real itself. If formerly the gods had dwelt above the world, they had now become its center.' Marx concluded that immanent principles were necessary weapons in the struggle for progressive social change, because they provide a basis for critique ''within'' historical reality. Later, this immanent grounding became the axis of his emancipatory critique of [[capitalism]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Immanent critique as the core of critical theory." ''British Journal of Sociology'' Vol. 32, No. 3, p. 333 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Harvey]], formerly of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]],

:"Critical theory at its most abstract and general level ... begins as a formal 'negativity.' As a dissenting motif, it selects some tradition, ideological premise, or institutionalized orthodoxy for analysis. As immanent critique, it then 'enters its object,' so to speak, '[[boring from within]].' Provisionally accepting the methodological presuppositions, substantive premises, and truth-claims of orthodoxy as its own, immanent critique tests the postulates of orthodoxy by the latter's own standards of proof and accuracy. Upon 'entering' the theory, orthodoxy's premises and assertions are registered and certain strategic contradictions located. These contradictions are then developed according to their own logic, and at some point in this process of internal expansion, the one-sided proclamations of orthodoxy collapse as material instances and their contradictions are allowed to develop 'naturally.'"&lt;ref&gt;''Sociological Perspectives: Vol 33, No. 1, "Critical Theory," p. 5 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], an '''immutable truth''' is an unchanging universal fact or reality that is not influenced by human opinion. According to [[positivism]], [[observation]] and [[experience]] are the only ways for immutable truths to become fully realized or understood.

'''Infinitism''' is the view that knowledge may be justified by an infinite chain of reasons. It belongs to [[epistemology]], the branch of [[philosophy]] that considers the possibility, nature, and means of [[knowledge]].

==Epistemological infinitism==

Since [[Gettier problem|Gettier]], "knowledge" is no longer widely accepted as meaning "[[justified true belief]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=knowledge-analysis|title=The Analysis of Knowledge|date=2017-03-17|edition=Fall 2017|last=Ichikawa|first=Jonathan Jenkins|last2=Steup|first2=Matthias}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some epistemologists{{who|date=March 2016}}  still consider knowledge to have a justification condition. Traditional theories of justification ([[foundationalism]] and [[coherentism]]) and indeed some philosophers{{who|date=March 2016}} consider an infinite regress not to be a valid justification. In their view, if ''A'' is justified by ''B'', ''B'' by ''C'', and so forth, then either 
# The chain must end with a link that requires no independent justification (a foundation), 
# The chain must come around in a circle in some finite number of steps (the belief may be justified by its coherence), or 
# Our beliefs must not be justified after all (as is posited by [[Philosophical skepticism|philosophical skeptics]]).

Infinitism, the view, for example, of [[Peter D. Klein]], challenges this consensus, referring back to work of [[Paul Moser]] (1984) and John Post (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/inf-epis/#H2|title = Infinitism in Epistemology|accessdate = 2015-06-19|website = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last = Klein|first = Peter D.|last2 = Turri|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the evidential ancestry of a justified belief must be infinite and non-repeating, which follows from the conjunction two principles that Klein sees as having straightforward intuitive appeal: "The Principle of Avoiding Circularity" and "The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness."

The Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then for all y, if y is in the evidential ancestry of x for S, then x is not in the evidential ancestry of y for S."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAC says that the proposition to be justified cannot be a member of its own evidential ancestry, which is violated by coherence theories of justification.

The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) is stated as follows: "For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then there is some reason, r1, available to S for x; and there is some reason, r2, available to S for r1; etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAA says that in order to avoid arbitrariness, for any proposition ''x'' to be justified for an epistemological agent, there must be some reason ''r'' available to the agent; this reason will in turn require the same structure of justification, and so on ''ad infinitum''. Foundationalist theories can only avoid arbitrariness by claiming that some propositions are self-justified. But if a proposition is its own justification (e.g. coherentism), then it is a member of its own evidential ancestry, and the structure of justification is circular.

In this view, the conjunction of both PAC and PAA leaves infinitism as the only alternative to skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Availability of Reasons: Klein also relies on the notion of "availability". In other words, a reason must be available to the subject in order for it to be a candidate for justification. There are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order for a reason to be available: objectively and subjectively.

An objectively available reason is stated as follows: "a belief, r, is objectively available to S as a reason for p if '''(1)''' r has some sufficiently high probability and the conditional probability of p given r is sufficiently high; or '''(2)''' an impartial, informed observer would accept r as a reason for p; or '''(3)''' r would be accepted in the long run by an appropriately defined set of people; or '''(4)''' r is evident for S and r makes p evident for S; or '''(5)''' r accords with S's deepest epistemic commitments; or '''(6)''' r meets the appropriate conversational presuppositions; or '''(7)''' an intellectually virtuous person would advance r as a reason for p."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these conditions are sufficient to describe objectively available reasons and are compatible with infinitism. Klein concedes that, ultimately, the proper characterization of objectively available need be a member of this list, but, for the scope of Klein's defense of infinitism, he need not provide a fully developed account of objectively available reasons. Objective availability could be best understood, at least as a working definition, as an existing, truth-apt reason not dependant on the subject.

A subjectively available reason is stated as follows: "S must be able to call on r." (Subjectively available is comparatively straightforward compared to objectively available.) The subject must be able to evoke the reason in their own mind and use the reason in the process of justification. In essence, the reason must be "properly hooked up with S's own beliefs" in order to be subjectively available.

A reason that is both objectively and subjectively available to a subject is a candidate for justification according to infinitism (or, at least for Klein).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objection to Infinitism: Klein addresses an objection to infinitism.

The finite mind objection (attributed to John Williams): The human mind is finite and has a limited capacity. "It is impossible to consciously believe an infinite number of propositions (because to believe something takes some time) and it is impossible to "unconsciously believe"...an infinite number of propositions because the candidate beliefs are such that some of them "defeat human understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is simply an impossibility that a subject has an infinite chain of reasons which justify their beliefs because the human mind is finite. Klein concedes that the human mind is finite and cannot contain an infinite number of reasons, but the infinitist, according to Klein, is not committed to a subject actually possessing infinite reasons. "The infinitist is not claiming that in any finite period of time...we can consciously entertain an infinite number of thoughts. It is rather that there are an infinite number of propositions such that each one of them would be consciously thought were the appropriate circumstances to arise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Peter D.|date=1999|title=Human Knowledge and the Infinite Regress of Reasons|url=|journal=Philosophical Perspectives|volume=13|pages=297–325|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, an infinite chain of reasons need not be present in the mind in order for a belief to be justified rather it must merely be possible to provide an infinite chain of reasons. There will always be another reason to justify the preceding reason if the subject felt compelled to make the inquiry and had subjective access to that reason.

'''Lahutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "lightness", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyalahutā'' - lightness of mental body (or lightness of cetisakas)
* ''Cittalahutā'' - lightness of consciousness (or lightness of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}
:The twofold lightness has the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush heaviness. It is manifested as non-sluggishness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as sloth and torpor, which create heaviness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=225}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 42, 43) this pair of cetasikas consists in the absence of sluggishness and inertia, they have “alertness in varying”. The meaning of this will be clearer when we read what the ''Mula-Tīkā'' states about lightness of citta: “the capacity of the mind to turn very quickly to a wholesome object or to the contemplation of impermanence, etc.”

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 30) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: Kāya-lightness is buoyancy of mental factors; citta-lightness is buoyancy of consciousness. They have the characteristic of suppressing the heaviness of the one and the other; the function of crushing heaviness in both; the manifestation of opposition to sluggishness in both, and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as sloth and torpor, which cause heaviness and rigidity in mental factors and consciousness.

'''Masculinity''' (also called '''manhood''' or '''manliness''') is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with boys and men.

==Overview==
Masculine qualities and roles are considered typical of, appropriate for, and expected of boys and men. The concept of masculinity varies historically and culturally; although the [[dandy]] was seen as a 19th-century ideal of masculinity, he is considered [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] by modern standards.&lt;ref name = "Reeser"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reeser | first = Todd W. | title = Masculinities in theory: an introduction | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4051-6859-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YMnn8Zf0heoC | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–3}} Masculine norms, as described in [[Ronald F.

The academic study of masculinity received increased attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the number of courses on the subject in the United States rising from 30 to over 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Bradley |first=Rolla M. |date=2008|title=Masculinity and self perception of men identified as informal leaders |publisher= [[University of the Incarnate Word]] | url = https://athenaeum.uiw.edu/uiw_etds/190/|oclc=1004500685}} [https://search.proquest.com/openview/bb91cf3b301335a7d97da0d80aed98a6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y View online preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sparked investigation of the intersection of  masculinity with other axes of social discrimination and concepts from other fields, such as the [[social construction of gender difference]]&lt;ref name="Flood 2007 Viii"&gt;{{cite book | last = Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood | title = International encyclopedia of men and masculinities |page=viii | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUON2SYps-QC | isbn = 9780415333436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (prevalent in a number of [[philosophical]] and [[sociological]] theories).

Both males and females can exhibit masculine traits and behavior. Those exhibiting both masculine and [[feminine]] characteristics are considered [[androgynous]], and feminist philosophers have argued that gender ambiguity may blur gender classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = [[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York London | year = 2006 | origyear = 1990 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Laurie | first = Timothy | title = The ethics of nobody I know: gender and the politics of description | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–78 | publisher = [[Emerald Group Publishing|Emerald]] | doi = 10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | date = 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/QRJ-03-2014-0011 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/6262250/The_Ethics_of_Nobody_I_Know_Gender_and_the_Politics_of_Description Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since what constitutes masculinity has varied by time and place, according to [[Raewyn Connell]], it is more appropriate to discuss "masculinities" than a single overarching concept.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|185}} Study of the history of masculinity emerged during the 1980s, aided by the fields of women's and (later) gender history. Before women's history was examined, there was a "strict gendering of the public/private divide"; regarding masculinity, this meant little study of how men related to the household, domesticity and family life.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tosh, John (1999), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Br8JCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Introduction: masculinity and domesticity]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Tosh | editor-first = John | title = A man's place: masculinity and the middle-class home in Victorian England |page=2 | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven, Connecticut | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780300077797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although women's historical role was negated, despite the writing of history by (and primarily about) men, a significant portion of the male experience was missing. This void was questioned during the late 1970s, when women's history began to analyze gender and women to deepen the female experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Davis | first = Natalie Z. | title = "Women's history" in transition: the European case | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 83–103 | publisher = Feminist Studies, Inc. | doi = 10.2307/3177729 | jstor = 3177729  | date = Spring–Summer 1976 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3177729 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Scott's seminal article, calling for gender studies as an analytical concept to explore society, power and discourse, laid the foundation for this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Scott | first = Joan W. | title = Gender: a useful category of historical analysis | journal = [[The American Historical Review]] | volume = 91 | issue = 5 | pages = 1053–1075 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | jstor = 1864376 | date = December 1986 | url = https://doi.org/10.1086/ahr/91.5.1053 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Scott, gender should be used in two ways: productive and produced. Productive gender examined its role in creating power relationships, and produced gender explored the use and change of gender throughout history. This has influenced the field of masculinity, as seen in Pierre Bourdieu's definition of masculinity: produced by society and culture, and reproduced in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bourdieu | first = Pierre | title = Masculine domination | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780745622651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A flurry of work in women's history led to a call for study of the male role (initially influenced by psychoanalysis) in society and emotional and interpersonal life. Connell wrote that these initial works were marked by a "high level of generality" in "broad surveys of cultural norms". The scholarship was aware of contemporary societal changes aiming to understand and evolve (or liberate) the male role in response to feminism.&lt;ref name="Connell_2005" /&gt;{{rp|28}}John Tosh calls for a return to this aim for the history of masculinity to be useful, academically and in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Steedman, Carolyn (1992), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EzD4fdELEioC&amp;pg=PA614 Culture, cultural studies and the historians]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Grossberg | editor-first1 = Lawrence | editor-last2 = Nelson | editor-first2 = Cary | editor-last3 = Treichler | editor-first3 = Paula | title = Cultural studies | page = 617 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | isbn = 9780415903455 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Odysseus sehnt sich nach Ithaka (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Odysseus leaning on a ship|[[Odysseus]], hero of the ''Odyssey'']]
Ancient literature dates back to about 3000 BC, with explicit expectations for men in the form of laws and implied masculine ideals in myths of gods and heroes. In the [[Hebrew Bible]] of 1000 BC, King David of Israel told his son, "I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Bible Gateway passage: 1 Kings 2:2 - King James Version |url= https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+2:2&amp;version=KJV | website = biblegateway.com |publisher=Bible Gateway |access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after David's death. Throughout history, men have met exacting cultural standards. Kate Cooper wrote about ancient concepts of femininity, "Wherever a woman is mentioned a man's character is being judged – and along with it what he stands for."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Kate (1996), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19 Private lives, public meanings]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Cooper | editor-first = Kate | title = The virgin and the bride: idealized womanhood in late antiquity | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QVvn8vUMZdIC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 | page = 19 | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | isbn = 9780674939509 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (about 1750 BC):
*Rule 3: "If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders, and does not prove what he has charged, he shall, if it be a capital offense charged, be put to death."
*Rule 128: "If a man takes a woman to wife, but has no intercourse with her, this woman is no wife to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammurabi | author-link = Hammurabi | others = L.W.

Legends of ancient heroes include the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The stories demonstrate qualities in the hero which inspire [[respect]], such as wisdom and courage: knowing things other men do not know and taking risks other men would not dare.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Medieval and Victorian eras ===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Beowulf, holding a sword, blocks a dragon's fire with his shield.|Beowulf fighting the dragon]]

[[Jeffrey Richards]] describes a European "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richards | first = Jeffrey | title = From Christianity to Paganism: The New Middle Ages and the Values of 'Medieval' Masculinity | journal = Cultural Values | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–234 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/14797589909367162 | date = 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14797589909367162 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courage, respect for women of all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The [[Anglo-Saxon]]s [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and [[Beowulf]] are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]) that ''Beowulf'' is a tale of medieval [[heroism]] overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf "cut[s] men off from women, other men, passion and the household".&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, David (1993), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC&amp;pg=PA11 The armor of the man-monster in Beowulf]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Rosen | editor-first = David | title = The changing fictions of masculinity | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana | page = 11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXgBaWrB4OYC | isbn = 9780252063091 | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Victorian era, [[Victorian masculinity|masculinity]] underwent a transformation from traditional heroism. Scottish philosopher [[Thomas Carlyle]] wrote in 1831: "The old ideal of Manhood has grown obsolete, and the new is still invisible to us, and we grope after it in darkness, one clutching this phantom, another that; [[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Werterism]], [[Byron]]ism, even [[Beau Brummell|Brummelism]], each has its day".&lt;ref&gt;Adams, James Eli (1995), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f7gwHwyxZJ4C&amp;pg=PA1 Introduction]", in {{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=James Eli | title = Dandies and desert saints: styles of Victorian masculinity |page=1 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, New York | isbn = 9780801482083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxing was professionalized in America and Europe in the 19th century, and emphasized the physical and confrontational aspects of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Thrasher, ''Fight Sports and American Masculinity: Salvation in Violence from 1607 to the Present'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Bare-knuckle fighting without gloves represented "the manly art" in 19th century America.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott J. Gorn, ''The Manly Art: Bare-Knuckle Prize Fighting in America'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Modern times}} Twentieth century to present ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a traditional family consisted of the father as  [[breadwinner model|breadwinner]] and the mother as [[homemaker]]. Despite women's increasing participation in the paid labor force and contributions to family income, men's identities remained centered on their working lives and specifically their economic contributions. Central to adult men's identities is the provider role, as masculinity is often measured by the size of one's paycheck/economic contribution to the family.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, R. 1974. Measuring masculinity by the size of a paycheck. In: J. Pleck &amp; J. Sawyer (Eds.) ''Men and masculinity'' (pp. 96 – 100). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Masculinity is also secured by denying any semblance of softness, emotion, femininity, or any characteristic associated with women and femininity.&lt;ref&gt;Pascoe, C. J. (2012). ''Dude, you're a fag : masculinity and sexuality in high school.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overwhelmingly, the construction of masculinity most valued in the latter part of the twentieth century to today is one that is independent, sexually assertive, and athletic, among other normative markers of manhood.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kaufman, ed. 1987. ''Beyond patriarchy : essays by men on pleasure, power, and change''. New York : Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Nick T., Patrick C. McKenry, &amp; Beth Skilken Catlett. 2004. "Athlete Aggression on the Rink and off the Ice Athlete Violence and Aggression in Hockey and Interpersonal Relationships." ''Men and Masculinities'' 6:291-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. 2007. "The Girl Hunt: Urban Nightlife and the Performance of Masculinity as Collective Activity." ''Symbolic Interaction'' ''30''(2), 221-243. doi:10.1525/si.2007.30.2.221&lt;/ref&gt; Social theorist [[Erving Goffman]]'s seminal work on stigma management presents a list of traits prescribed as categorically masculine for contemporary men:&lt;blockquote&gt;In an important sense there is only one complete unblushing male in America: a young, married, white, urban, northern, heterosexual Protestant father of college education, fully employed, or good complexion, weight and height, and a recent record in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving. 1963. ''Stigma: Notes On The Management Of Spoiled Identity''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:128&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some evidence of masculinities undergoing shifts in the contemporary social landscape. Characteristic of present-day masculinity is men's willingness to counter stereotypes. Regardless of age or nationality, men more frequently rank good health, a harmonious family life and a good relationship with their spouse or partner as important to their quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=26 August 2008 |title=Research and insights from Indiana University |url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/tips/page/normal/8690.html |location= |publisher=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=13 March 2017}}

In many cultures, displaying characteristics not typical of one's gender may be a social problem. In [[sociology]], this labeling is known as [[gender role|gender assumptions]] and is part of [[socialization]] to meet the [[mores]] of a society.

The relative importance of socialization and genetics in the development of masculinity is debated. Although [[social conditioning]] is believed to play a role, [[psychologist]]s and [[psychoanalysts]] such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]] believed that aspects of "feminine" and "masculine" identity are [[subconscious]]ly present in all human males.{{efn|See [[innate bisexuality]] and [[anima and animus]] for more information.}}

The historical development of gender roles is addressed by [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human ecology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. All human cultures seem to encourage gender roles in literature, costume and song; examples may include the epics of [[Homer]], the [[Hengist and Horsa]] tales and the [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] commentaries of [[Confucius]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} More specialized treatments of masculinity may be found in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the [[Bushido|bushidō]] of ''[[Hagakure]]''.

===Nature versus nurture===
{{main|Nature versus nurture}}

The sources of [[gender identity]] are debated. Some believe that masculinity is linked to the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with [[human penis|male genitalia]].&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Proponents of this view argue that women can become men [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormonally]] and [[Sex reassignment surgery|physically]],&lt;ref name="Reeser" /&gt;{{rp|3}} and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mills | first = Sara | title = Third wave feminist linguistics and the analysis of sexism | journal = Discourse Analysis Online | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | publisher = [[Sheffield Hallam University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://extra.shu.ac.uk/daol/articles/closed/2003/001/mills2003001-paper.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source.

In contrast to earlier perspectives of the nature versus nurture debate, contemporary social scientists suggest masculinity to stem from both nature ''and'' nurture, as both biological predispositions and social factors intersect to give rise to masculine gender identities.&lt;ref name="footnote.co"&gt;''Fausto-Sterling, Anne. 2014.

===Social construction of masculinity===
Social scientists conceptualize masculinity (and femininity) as a performance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judith Butler|Butler, Judith]] (2006) [1990]. ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity]]''. New York London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masculinities"&gt;[[Raewyn Connell|Connell, R.W.]] (2005). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC ''Masculinities''] (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Candace, and Don H. Zimmerman. 1987. “Doing Gender.” ''Gender &amp; Society'' 1:125–151&lt;/ref&gt; Gender performances may not necessarily be intentional and people may not even be aware of the extent to which they are performing gender, as one outcome of lifelong gender socialization is the feeling that one's gender is "natural" or biologically-ordained.

The social construction of gender also conceptualizes gender as a continuum. Theorists suggest one is not simply masculine or feminine, but instead may display components of both masculinity and femininity to different degrees and in particular contexts.

Masculine performance varies over the life course, but also from one context to another. For instance, the sports world may elicit more traditionally normative masculinities in participants than would other settings.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A. 1992. ''Power at Play: Sports and the Problem of Masculinity''. Boston: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Men who exhibit a tough and aggressive masculinity on the sports field may display a softer masculinity in familial contexts. Masculinities vary by social class as well. Studies suggest working class constructions of masculinity to be more normative than are those from middle class men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edward W. 2008. “Rednecks,” “Rutters,” and `Rithmetic: Social Class, Masculinity, and Schooling in a Rural Context." ''Gender &amp; Society'' 22 (6): 728-751.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Karin A. 1996. ''Puberty, Sexuality, and the Self: Boys and Girls at Adolescence''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; As these contexts and comparisons illustrate, theorists suggest a multiplicity of masculinities, not simply one single construction of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Masculinities"/&gt;

==Hegemonic masculinity==

From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).&lt;ref&gt;Kostas, M.

==Precarious manhood==
Researchers have argued that the "precariousness" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82–86 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721411402669 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Precarious" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved. In many cultures, boys endure painful initiation rituals to become men. Manhood may also be lost, as when a man is derided for not "being a man". Researchers have found that men respond to threats to their manhood by engaging in stereotypically-masculine behaviors and beliefs, such as supporting hierarchy, espousing homophobic beliefs, supporting aggression and choosing physical tasks over intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vandello | first1 = Joseph A. | last2 = Bosson | first2 = Jennifer K. | last3 = Cohen | first3 = Dov | last4 = Burnaford | first4 = Rochelle M. | last5 = Weaver | first5 = Jonathan R. | title = Precarious manhood | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 95 | issue = 6 | pages = 1325–1339 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0012453 | date = December 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0012453 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Winegard and Geary wrote that the precariousness of manhood involves social status (prestige or dominance), and manhood may be more (or less) precarious due to the avenues men have for achieving status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Winegard | first1 = Bo M. | last2 = Winegard | first2 = Ben | last3 =  Geary | first3 = David C. | title = Eastwood’s brawn and Einstein’s brain: an evolutionary account of dominance, prestige, and precarious manhood | journal = [[Review of General Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–48 | publisher = [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0036594 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036594 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men who identify with creative pursuits, such as poetry or painting, may not experience manhood as precarious but may respond to threats to their intelligence or creativity. However, men who identify with traditionally-masculine pursuits (such as football or the military) may see masculinity as precarious. According to Winegard, Winegard, and Geary, this is functional; poetry and painting do not require traditionally-masculine traits, and attacks on those traits should not induce anxiety. {{Dubious|date=August 2015}} Football and the military require traditionally-masculine traits, such as pain tolerance, endurance, muscularity and courage, and attacks on those traits induce anxiety and may trigger retaliatory impulses and behavior. This suggests that nature-versus-nurture debates about masculinity may be simplistic. Although men evolved to pursue prestige and dominance (status), how they pursue status depends on their talents, traits and available possibilities. In modern societies, more avenues to status may exist than in traditional societies and this may mitigate the precariousness of manhood (or of traditional manhood); however, it will probably not mitigate the intensity of male-male competition.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Women who participate in sports, especially male-dominated sports, are sometimes derided as being masculine. Even though most sports emphasize stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength, competition, and aggression, women who participate in sports are still expected to conform to strictly feminine gender norms. This is known as the "female/athlete paradox". Although traditional gender norms are gradually changing, female athletes, especially those that participate in male-dominated sports such as boxing, weight lifting, American football, ice hockey, and motor sports, are still often viewed as deviating from the boundaries of femininity and may suffer repercussions such as discrimination or mistreatment from administrators, harassment by fans, and decreased media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paloian|first1=Andrea|title=The Female/Athlete Paradox: Managing Traditional Views of Masculinity and Femininity|url=https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2012/fall/female|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence points to the negative impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5&amp;nbsp;million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from [[heart disease]]. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from [[cardiovascular disease]] than women, and are more likely to be diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galdas | first1 = Paul M. | last2 = Cheater | first2 = Francine M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Paul | title = Men and health help-seeking behaviour: Literature review | journal = [[Journal of Advanced Nursing]] | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 616–623 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | pmid = 15737222 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2648.2004.03331.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effeminacy==
{{see also|Effeminacy#Gay men}}
Gay men are considered by some to "deviate from the masculine norm" and are [[benevolent prejudice|benevolently stereotyped]] as "gentle and refined", even by other gay men. According to gay human-rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the well-intentioned claim that gays are "just the same" as straights, there is a difference. What is more, the distinctive style of gay masculinity is of great social benefit. Wouldn't life be dull without the flair and imagination of [[queer]] fashion designers and interior decorators? How could the NHS cope with no gay nurses, or the education system with no gay teachers? Society should thank its lucky stars that not all men turn out straight, macho and insensitive. The different hetero and homo modes of maleness are not, of course, biologically fixed.&lt;ref name=Tatchell&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter| author-link =Peter Tatchell|title=What straight men could learn from gay men - a queer kind of masculinity?|work=The Scavenger|url=http://www.thescavenger.net/glbtiq-sp-1239/glbtiq/170-what-straight-men-can-learn-from-gay-men-6789.html|accessdate=7 March 2015|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Psychologist Joseph Pleck argues that a hierarchy of masculinity exists largely as a [[dichotomy]] of homosexual and heterosexual males: "Our society uses the male heterosexual-homosexual dichotomy as a central symbol for all the rankings of masculinity, for the division on any grounds between males who are "real men" and have power, and males who are not".&lt;ref name=nomas.org&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleck|first=Joseph|title=Understanding patriarchy and men's power|url=http://nomas.org/understanding-patriarchy-and-mens-power/ | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) |accessdate=11 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Kimmel]] adds that the [[Trope (literature)|trope]] "You're so gay" indicates a lack of masculinity, rather than homosexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Kimmel | first1 = Michael S. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = Summer | author-link1 = Michael Kimmel | title = Mars and Venus, Or, Planet Earth?: Women and Men in a New Millenium [sic] | publisher = Kansas State University | format = DVD | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57227710 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pleck, to avoid male oppression of women, themselves and other men, [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] structures, institutions and discourse must be eliminated from Western society.

In the documentary ''The Butch Factor'', gay men (one of them [[transgender]]) were asked about their views of masculinity. Masculine traits were generally seen as an advantage in and out of the [[closeted|closet]], allowing "butch" gay men to conceal their [[sexual orientation]] longer while engaged in masculine activities such as sports.

Feminine-looking men tended to [[Coming out|come out]] earlier after being labeled gay by their peers. More likely to face bullying and harassment throughout their lives,&lt;ref name=ifbutscoconuts/&gt; they are taunted by derogatory words (such as "[[sissy]]") implying feminine qualities.

[[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave]] [[pro-feminism]] paid greater attention to issues of sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and [[hegemonic masculinity]]. This shift led to increased cooperation between the [[Men's liberation movement|men's liberation]] and [[gay liberation]] movements developing, in part, because masculinity was understood as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and in response to the universalization of "men" in previous men's movements. Men's-rights activists worked to stop second-wave feminists from influencing the gay-rights movement, promoting [[hypermasculinity]] as inherent to gay sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jeffreys | first = Sheila | author-link = Sheila Jeffreys | title = Unpacking queer politics: a lesbian feminist perspective | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780745628387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Two concerns over the study of the history of masculinity are that it would stabilize the historical process (rather than change it) and that a cultural overemphasis on the approach to masculinity lacks the reality of actual experience. According to John Tosh, masculinity has become a conceptual framework used by historians to enhance their cultural explorations instead of a specialty in its own right.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tosh, John (2011), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0E5ARiVe9YUC&amp;pg=PA17 The history of masculinity: an outdated concept?]", in {{cite book |editor-last1= Arnold |editor-first1= John H. |editor-last2= Brady |editor-first2= Sean | title = What is masculinity?: historical dynamics from antiquity to the contemporary world | pages = 17&amp;ndash;34 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781137305602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This draws attention from reality to representation and meaning, not only in the realm of masculinity; culture was becoming "the bottom line, the real historical reality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tosh critiques Martin Francis' work of in this light because popular culture, rather than the experience of family life, is the basis for Francis' argument.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Francis | first = Martin | title = A flight from commitment? Domesticity, adventure and the masculine imaginary in Britain after the Second World War | journal = [[Gender &amp; History]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–185 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | date = April 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0424.2007.00469.x | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis uses contemporary literature and film to demonstrate that masculinity was restless, shying away from domesticity and commitment, during the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Francis wrote that this flight from commitment was "most likely to take place at the level of fantasy (individual and collective)". In focusing on culture, it is difficult to gauge the degree to which films such as ''[[Scott of the Antarctic (film)|Scott of the Antarctic]]'' represented the era’s masculine fantasies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Michael Roper’s call to focus on the subjectivity of masculinity addresses this cultural bias, because broad understanding is set aside for an examination "of what the relationship of the codes of masculinity is to actual men, to existential matters, to persons and to their psychic make-up" (Tosh's human experience).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Roper|first = Michael | title = Slipping out of view: subjectivity and emotion in gender history | journal = [[History Workshop Journal]] | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–72 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | date = March 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/hwj/dbi006 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tosh, the culture of masculinity has outlived its usefulness because it cannot fulfill the initial aim of this history (to discover how manhood was conditioned and experienced) and he urged "questions of behaviour and agency".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work on Victorian masculinity uses individual experience in letters and sketches to illustrate broader cultural and social customs, such as birthing or Christmas traditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Stefan Dudink believes that the methodological approach (trying to categorize masculinity as a phenomenon) undermined its [[Historiography|historiographic]] development.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink |first = Stefan | title = The trouble with men: Problems in the history of 'masculinity' | journal = [[European Journal of Cultural Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–431 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/136754949800100307 | date = September 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/136754949800100307 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abigail Solomou-Godeau’s work on post-revolutionary French art addresses a strong, constant patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Solomon-Godeau | first = Abigail | title = Male trouble: a crisis in representation | publisher = Thames and Hudson | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780500280379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tosh’s overall assessment is that a shift is needed in conceptualizing the topic&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; back to the history of masculinity as a speciality aiming to reach a broader audience, rather than as an analytical tool of cultural and social history. The importance he places on public history hearkens back to the initial aims of gender history, which sought to use history to enlighten and change the present. Tosh appeals to historians to live up to the "social expectation" of their work,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which would also require a greater focus on subjectivity and masculinity. This view is contrary to Dudink’s; the latter called for an "outflanking movement" towards the history of masculinity, in response to the errors he perceived in the study.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This would do the opposite of what Tosh called for, deconstructing masculinity by not placing it at the center of historical exploration and using discourse and culture as indirect avenues towards a more-representational approach. In a study of the [[Low Countries]], Dudink proposes moving beyond the history of masculinity by embedding analysis into the exploration of nation and nationalism (making masculinity a lens through which to view conflict and nation-building).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dudink|first = Stefan | title = Multipurpose masculinities: gender and power in low countries histories of masculinity | journal = [[BMGN: Low Countries Historical Review]] | volume = 127 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–18 | publisher = Royal Netherlands Historical Society | doi = 10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | date = March 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.18352/bmgn-lchr.1562 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Francis' work on domesticity through a cultural lens moves beyond the history of masculinity because "men constantly travelled back and forward across the frontier of domesticity, if only in the realm of the imagination"; normative codes of behavior do not fully encompass the male experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Media images of boys and young men may lead to the persistence of harmful concepts of masculinity. According to men's-rights activists, the media does not address men's-rights issues and men are often portrayed negatively in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Farrell | first1 = Warren | last2 = Sterba | first2 = James P. | author-link1 = Warren Farrell | title = Does feminism discriminate against men? | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780195312829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson called hegemonic masculinity "economically exploitative" and "socially oppressive": "The form of oppression varies from patriarchal controls over women's bodies and reproductive rights, through ideologies of domesticity, femininity and compulsory heterosexuality, to social definitions of the value of work, the nature of skill and the differential remuneration of 'productive' and 'reproductive' labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Jackson | first = Peter | title = The cultural politics of masculinity: towards a social geography | journal = [[Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–213 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/622614 | jstor = 622614 | date = April 1991 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/622614 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological research===
According to a paper submitted by Tracy Tylka to the [[American Psychological Association]], "Instead of seeing a decrease in [[objectification]] of women in society, there has just been an increase in the objectification of both sexes. And you can see that in the media today." Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grabmeier | first = Jeff | title = Pressure to be more muscular may lead men to unhealthy behaviors | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080618040952/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | archive-date = 18 June 2008 | url = http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/maleobj.htm | publisher = [[Ohio State University]] | date = 10 August 2006 | access-date = 29 July 2008 }}

In 1987 Eisler and Skidmore studied masculinity, creating the idea of "masculine stress" and finding three elements of masculinity which often result in emotional stress:
* The emphasis on prevailing in situations requiring body and fitness
* Being perceived as emotional
* The need for adequacy in sexual matters and financial status

Because of social norms and pressures associated with masculinity, men with spinal-cord injuries must adapt their self-identity to the losses associated with such injuries; this may "lead to feelings of decreased physical and sexual prowess with lowered self-esteem and a loss of male identity. Feelings of guilt and overall loss of control are also experienced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hutchinson | first1 = Susan L. | last2 = Kleiber | first2 = Douglas A. | title = Heroic masculinity following spinal cord injury: Implications for therapeutic recreation practice and research | journal = Therapeutic Recreation Journal | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | publisher = Sagamore Journals | date = January 2000 | url = http://js.sagamorepub.com/trj/article/view/1110 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that men feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising.

In their book ''Raising Cain: Protecting The Emotional Life of Boys'', [[Dan Kindlon]] and Michael Thompson wrote that although all boys are born loving and empathic, exposure to gender socialization (the tough male ideal and [[hypermasculinity]]) limits their ability to function as emotionally-healthy adults.

The crisis has also been attributed to the questioning of male dominance and rights granted to men solely on the basis of sex following the [[feminist movement]].&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt;{{rp|83–86}} British sociologist John MacInnes wrote that "masculinity has always been in one crisis or another", suggesting that the crises arise from the "fundamental incompatibility between the core principle of modernity that all human beings are essentially equal (regardless of their sex) and the core tenet of patriarchy that men are naturally superior to women and thus destined to rule over them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = MacInnes | first = John | authorlink = | title = The end of masculinity: the confusion of sexual genesis and sexual difference in modern society | year = 1998 | publisher = Open University Press | location = Philadelphia | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-335-19659-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Beynon, masculinity and men are often conflated and it is unclear whether masculinity, men or both are in crisis.  He writes that the "crisis" is not a recent phenomenon, illustrating several periods of masculine crisis throughout history (some predating the women's movement and [[post-industrial society]]), suggesting that due to masculinity's fluid nature "crisis is constitutive of masculinity itself".&lt;ref name="Beynon_2002" /&gt; Film scholar [[Leon Hunt]] also writes: "Whenever masculinity's 'crisis' actually started, it certainly seems to have been in place by the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Leon | year = 1998 | title = British low culture: from safari suits to sexploitation | publisher = Routledge | location = London, New York | page = 73 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3dvtQEetWrsC&amp;pg=PA73 | isbn = 978-0-415-15182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Herbivore men}}
In 2008, the word "herbivore men" became popular in Japan and was reported worldwide. Herbivore men refers to young Japanese men who naturally detach themselves from masculinity. [[Masahiro Morioka]] characterizes them as men 1) having gentle nature, 2) not bound by manliness, 3) not aggressive when it comes to romance, 4) viewing women as equals, and 5) hating emotional pain. Herbivore men are severely criticized by men who love masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Morioka | first = Masahiro | title = A phenomenological study of "Herbivore Men" | journal = The Review of Life Studies | volume = 4 | pages = 1–20 | date = September 2013 | url = http://www.lifestudies.org/press/review.html | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.lifestudies.org/press/rls0401.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''minority group''' refers to a [[Categorization|category]] of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006532841|title=Race, ethnicity, gender, &amp; class : the sociology of group conflict and change|last=1945-|first=Healey, Joseph F.,|others=Stepnick, Andi,, O'Brien, Eileen, 1972-|isbn=9781506346946|edition= Eighth |location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=1006532841|date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: [[sex]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871004576|title=Essentials of sociology|last=George,|first=Ritzer,|isbn=9781483340173|location=Los Angeles|oclc=871004576|date=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing the framework of [[intersectionality]], it is important to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Laurie|first1=Timothy|title=The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture|url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889|journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=3|year=2017|last2=Khan|first2=Rimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The term "minority group" often occurs within the [[discourse]] of [[civil rights]] and [[collective rights]], as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/louilr63&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=The Struggle for Civil Rights: The Need for, and Impediments to, Political Coalitions among and within Minority Groups|last=Johnson|first=Kevin|date=|website=heinonline.org|publisher=Louisiana Law Review|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minority group members often face [[discrimination]] in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/658199810|title=The economics of discrimination|last=1930-2014.|first=Becker, Gary S.

== Definitions ==

=== Sociological ===
[[Louis Wirth]] defined a minority group as "a group of people who, because of their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the [[society]] in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Man in the World Crisis|last=Wirth|first=L.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1945|editor-last=Linton|editor-first=Ralph|location=New York|page=347|chapter=The Problem of Minority Groups}} The political scientist and law professor, Gad Barzilai, has offered a theoretical definition of non-ruling communities that conceptualizes groups that do not rule and are excluded from resources of political power. Barzilai, G. ''Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition includes both objective and subjective criteria: membership of a minority group is objectively [[Ascribed status|ascribed]] by society, based on an individual's physical or behavioral characteristics; it is also subjectively applied by its members, who may use their status as the basis of group identity or [[Social solidarity|solidarity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/12323228|title=Minorities in the new world : six case studies|last=Wagley|first=Charles|last2=Harris|first2=Marvin|date=1958|publisher=New York : Columbia University Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, minority group status is categorical in nature: an individual who exhibits the physical or behavioral characteristics of a given minority group is accorded the status of that group and is subject to the same treatment as other members of that group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Joe Feagin]], states that a minority group has five characteristics: (1) suffering discrimination and subordination, (2) physical and/or cultural traits that set them apart, and which are disapproved by the dominant group, (3) a shared sense of collective identity and common burdens, (4) socially shared rules about who belongs and who does not determine minority status, and (5) tendency to marry within the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Racial and Ethnic Relations|last=|author=Joe R. Feagin|first=|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=978-0-13-750125-0|edition= 2nd|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms====
There is a controversy with the use of the word minority, as it has a common and an academic usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Diversity Glossary of Terms|last=Diversity Training University International|publisher=Diversity Training University International Publications Division|year=2008|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common usage of the term indicates a statistical minority; however, academics refer to power differences among groups rather than differences in population size among groups.&lt;ref name="Barzilai 20102"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1sHzZbXdjggC|title=Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities|last=Barzilai|first=Gad|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists have criticised the concept of "minority/majority", arguing this language excludes or neglects changing or unstable cultural identities, as well as cultural affiliations across national boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Laurie|first1=Timothy|title=The Concept of Minority for the Study of Culture|url=https://www.academia.edu/31725889|journal=Continuum: Journal for Media and Cultural Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=1–12|year=2017|last2=Khan|first2=Rimi}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the term historically excluded groups (HEGs) is often similarly used to highlight the role of historical oppression and domination, and how this results in the underrepresentation of particular groups in various areas of social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Konrad|first=Alison M.|date=1999|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/handbook-of-gender-and-work/n22.xml|work=Handbook of Gender &amp; Work|pages=429–452|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452231365.n22|access-date=2018-08-15|last2=Linnehan|first2=Frank|title=Handbook of Gender &amp; Work Handbook of gender &amp; work|isbn=9780761913559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
The term national minority is often used to discuss minority groups in international and national politics.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Daniel Šmihula|year=2008|title=National Minorities in the Law of the EC/EU|url=http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=Romanian Journal of European Affairs|volume=8|pages=51–81|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823110657/http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-23|number=3|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All countries contain some degree of racial, ethnic, or linguistic diversity.[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/18/the-most-and-least-culturally-diverse-countries-in-the-world/] In addition, minorities may also be minorities they may be migrant, indigenous or landless nomadic communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/754152959|title=The representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in parliament : a global overview|last=Oleh.|first=Protsyk,|date=2010|publisher=Inter-parliamentary Union|others=Inter-parliamentary Union.|isbn=9789291424627|location=Geneva|oclc=754152959}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often results in variations in language, culture, beliefs, practices, that set some groups apart from the dominant grop. As these differences are usually perceived negatively by, this results in loss of social and political power for members of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verkuyten|first=Maykel|date=2005|title=Ethnic Group Identification and Group Evaluation Among Minority and Majority Groups: Testing the Multiculturalism Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=88|issue=1|pages=121–138|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.121|pmid=15631579|issn=1939-1315|citeseerx=10.1.1.595.7633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no legal definition of national minorities in international law, though protection of minority groups is outlined by the United Nations [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]. [[International criminal law]] can protect the rights of racial or ethnic minorities in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyal Sunga|Lyal S. Sunga]] (2004). ''International Criminal Law: Protection of Minority Rights, Beyond a One-Dimensional State: An Emerging Right to Autonomy?'' ed. Zelim Skurbaty. (2004) 255–275.&lt;/ref&gt; The right to [[self-determination]] is a key issue.

The formal level of protection of national minorities is highest in European countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Council of Europe proposes a definition of national minorities in the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] and by the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]; however these definitions are not binding upon member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/minorities/fcnm-factsheet|title=Factsheet on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|website=National Minorities (FCNM)|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this framework, a national minority can be theoretically defined as a group of people within a given nation state:

#which is numerically smaller than the rest of population of the state or a part of the state,
#which is not in a dominant position,
#which has culture, language, religion, race etc. distinct from that of the majority of the population,
#whose members have a will to preserve their group identity,
#whose members are citizens of the state where they have the status of a minority, and
#whose members have had long-term presence in the territory.

In some places, subordinate [[ethnic group]]s may constitute a numerical majority, such as Blacks in South Africa under [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=du Toit|first=Pierre|last2=Theron|first2=François|date=1988|title=Ethnic and minority groups, and constitutional change in South Africa|journal=Journal of Contemporary African Studies|language=en|volume=7|issue=1–2|pages=133–147|doi=10.1080/02589008808729481|issn=0258-9001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], for example, non-Hispanic Whites constitute the majority (63.4%) and all other racial and ethnic groups (Hispanic or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], [[African Americans]], [[Asian Americans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]], and [[Native Hawaiians]]) are classified as "minorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045217|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: UNITED STATES|website=Census Bureau QuickFacts|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the non-Hispanic White population falls below 50% the group will only be the ''plurality'', not the majority.

== Examples of minority groups ==
===Age minorities===
The elderly, while traditionally influential or even (in a [[gerontocracy]]) dominant in the past, are now usually reduced to the minority role of economically 'non-active' groups.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Children can also be understood as a minority group in these terms, and the discrimination faced by the young is known as [[adultism]]. Discrimination against the elderly is known as [[ageism]].

Various local and [[International human rights instruments|international statutes]] are in place to mitigate the exploitation of children, such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], as well as a number of organizations that make up the [[children's rights movement]]. The [[youth rights]] movement campaigns for social empowerment for young people, and against the legal and social restrictions placed on [[Minor (law)|legal minors]]. Groups that advocate the interests of [[Senior citizen|senior citizens]] range from the charitable ([[Help the Aged]]) to grass-roots activism ([[Gray Panthers]]), and often overlap with disability rights issues.

=== Educational minorities ===

=== Involuntary minorities ===
Also known as "castelike minorities," involuntary minorities are a term for people who were originally brought into any society against their will. In the United States, for instance, it includes but is not limited to Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, African Americans,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adams.edu/administration/hr/search-procedures/understanding-cultural-diversity-and-learning.pdf|title=Understanding Cultural Diversity and Learning|last=Ogbu|first=John U.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and native-born Mexican Americans.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogbu and Simons|first=|date=1998|title=Voluntary and Involuntary Minorities: A Cultural-Ecological Theory of School Performance with Some Implications for Education|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDUC305/OgbuSimonsvoluntaryinvoluntary.pdf|journal=Anthropology and Education Quarterly|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons of cultural differences, involuntary minorities may experience difficulties in school more than members of other (voluntary) minority groups. Social capital helps children engage with different age groups that share a common goal.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Subtractive Schooling|last=Valenzuela|first=Angela|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voluntary minorities===
Immigrants take on minority status in their new country, usually in hopes of a better future economically, educationally, and politically than in their homeland. Because of their focus on success, voluntary minorities are more likely to do better in school than other migrating minorities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Adapting to a very different culture and language make difficulties in the early stages of life in the new country. Voluntary immigrants do not experience a sense of divided identity as much as involuntary minorities, and are often rich in social capital because of their educational ambitions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Major immigrant groups in the United States include Mexicans, Central and South Americans, Cubans, Africans, and Indians.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Gender and sexuality minorities ===
{{main|Sexual minority}}The term sexual minority is frequently used by public health researchers to recognize a wide variety of individuals who engage in same-sex sexual behavior, including those who do not identify under the LGBTQ umbrella. For example, men who have sex with men (MSM), but do not identify as gay. In addition, the term gender minorities can include many types of [[Gender variance|gender variant]] people, such as [[intersex]] people, [[Transsexuality|transgender people]], or gender non-conforming individuals. However, the terms sexual and gender minority are often not preferred by LGBTQ people, as they represent clinical categories rather than individual identity.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989–995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[queer]] (LGBTQ) people have existed throughout human history, LGBT rights movements across many western countries led to the recognition of LGBTQ people as members of a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kenneth H.|last2=Bradford|first2=Judith B.|last3=Makadon|first3=Harvey J.|last4=Stall|first4=Ron|last5=Goldhammer|first5=Hilary|last6=Landers|first6=Stewart|date=2008|title=Sexual and Gender Minority Health: What We Know and What Needs to Be Done|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=98|issue=6|pages=989–995|doi=10.2105/ajph.2007.127811|issn=0090-0036|pmc=2377288|pmid=18445789}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBTQ people represent a numerical and social minority. They experience numerous social inequalities stemming from their group membership as LGBTQ people. These inequalities include social discrimination and isolation, unequal access to healthcare, employment, and housing, and experience negative mental and physical health outcomes due to these experiences.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===People with disabilities===
The [[disability rights movement]] has contributed to an understanding of people with disabilities (including not to be called 'disabled') as a minority or a coalition of minorities who are disadvantaged by society, not just as people who are disadvantaged by their impairments. Advocates of disability rights emphasize difference in physical or psychological functioning, rather than inferiority. For example, some people with [[autism]] argue for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]], much as opponents of [[racism]] argue for acceptance of ethnic diversity. The [[deaf community]] is often regarded as a linguistic and cultural minority rather than a group with disabilities, and some [[deaf]] people do not see themselves as having a disability at all. Rather, they are disadvantaged by technologies and social institutions that are designed to cater for the dominant group. (''See the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]''.)[[File:Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_NYWTS.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Photo of the Rosenbergs in jail]]

===Political minorities===
One of the most controversial minorities in the [[United States]] and other countries has been communists. Along with the [[Red Scare]] and execution of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], the United States ran open campaigns to fight, contain and promote fear of communism in the country. Some were persecuted as communist even when they were not actually so: for example, many activists for civil rights were portrayed as inspired by a communist agenda. Communists in the United States, as in many European countries, are often afraid to proclaim their politics, fearing abuse and discrimination from the political majority.

===Religious minorities===
{{main|Religious minorities}}People belonging to religious minorities have a faith which is different from that held by the majority. Most countries of the world have religious minorities. It is now widely accepted in the west that people should have the freedom to choose their own religion, including not having any religion ([[atheism]] and/or [[agnosticism]]), and including the right to convert from one religion to another. However, in many countries this freedom is constricted. For example, in [[Egypt]], a new system of identity cards&lt;ref&gt;See "The Situation of the Bahá'í Community of Egypt" and "Religion Today: Bahais' struggle for recognition reveals a less tolerant face of Egypt", [http://www.bahai.org/persecution/egypt/update Bahai.org],  [http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html DWB.sacbee.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053747/http://dwb.sacbee.com/24hour/religion/story/3315375p-12212722c.html|date=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires all citizens to state their religion—and the only choices are [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], or [[Judaism]] (See [[Egyptian identification card controversy]]).

=== Regional minorities ===
Authors have pointed out that many coal workers would be unwilling to move for work or were not likely to be able to be retrained as Appalachians are an "ethnic minority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/14/americas-other-minority/|title=OPINION: America's other minority?|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|date=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women as minorities ===
While in most societies, numbers of men and women are roughly equal, the status of women as a subordinate group has led to many social scientists to study them as a minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hacker|first=Helen Mayer|year=1951|title=Women as a Minority Group|journal=[[Social Forces]]|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–69|doi=10.2307/2571742|jstor=2571742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though women's legal rights and status vary widely across countries, women experience social inequalities relative to men in most societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56216656|title=Multicultural jurisdictions : cultural differences and women's rights|last=1966-|first=Shachar, Ayelet,|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-0511040801|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=|oclc=56216656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are often denied access to education, subject to violence, and lack access to the same economic opportunities as men.&lt;ref&gt;Women, U. N. (2018). Annual Report 2017–2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and government==
In the politics of some countries, a "minority" is an [[ethnic group]] recognized by law, and having specified rights. Speakers of a legally recognized [[minority language]], for instance, might have the right to education or communication with the government in their mother tongue. Countries with special provisions{{which|date=May 2016}} for minorities include [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[India]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The various minority groups in a country are often not given equal treatment. Some groups are too small or indistinct to obtain minority protections. For example, a member of a particularly small ethnic group might be forced to check "Other" on a checklist of different backgrounds and so might receive fewer privileges than a member of a more defined group.

Many contemporary governments prefer to assume the people they rule all belong to the same nationality rather than separate ones based on ethnicity. The United States asks for [[race (U.S. Census)|race and ethnicity]] on its official census forms, which thus breaks up and organizes its population into sub-groups, primarily racial rather than national. [[Spain]] does not divide its nationals by ethnic group, although it does maintain an official notion of minority languages.

Some especially significant or powerful minorities receive comprehensive protection and political representation. For example, the former Yugoslav republic of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] recognizes the three constitutive nations, none of which constitutes a numerical majority (see [[nations of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]). However, other minorities such as [[Romani people|Romani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00421|title=Political recognition of Roma People in Spain. [Social Impact]. WORKALÓ. The creation of new occupational patterns for cultural minorities: the Gypsy Case (2001-2004). Framework Programme 5 (FP5)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jews]], are officially labelled "foreign" and are excluded from many of these protections. For example, they may be excluded from political positions, including the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf Opinion of the Council of Europe's Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in particular paragraphs 37–43] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616100431/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/minorities/2._framework_convention_(monitoring)/2._monitoring_mechanism/4._opinions_of_the_advisory_committee/1._country_specific_opinions/1._first_cycle/PDF_1st_OP_BiH.pdf |date=2007-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate over recognizing minority groups and their privileges. One view&lt;ref&gt;For example, J.A. Lindgren-Alves, member of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, speaking at the Committee's 67th Session (Summary Record of the 1724th Meeting, 23 August 2005, CERD/C/SR.1724)&lt;/ref&gt; is that the application of special rights to minority groups may harm some countries, such as new states in Africa or Latin America not founded on the European [[nation-state]] model, since minority recognition may interfere with establishing a national identity. It may hamper the integration of the minority into mainstream society, perhaps leading to [[separatism]] or [[supremacist|supremacism]]. In [[Canada]], some{{who|date=January 2012}} feel that the failure of the dominant [[English language|English]]-speaking majority to integrate [[French Canadians]] has provoked [[Quebec separatism]].

Others assert that minorities require specific protections to ensure that they are not marginalised: for example, [[bilingual education]] may be needed to allow linguistic minorities to fully integrate into the school system and compete equally in society. In this view, rights for minorities strengthen the nation-building project, as members of minorities see their interests well served, and willingly accept the legitimacy of the nation and their integration (not assimilation) within it.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |first=K. |last=Henrard |title=Devising an Adequate System of Minority Protection: Individual Human Rights, Minority Rights and the Right to Self-Determination |location= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |year=2000 |pages=218–224 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFF5nzuAze0C&amp;pg=PA218 |isbn=978-9041113597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moral intelligence''' is the capacity to [[understanding|understand]] right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right.&lt;ref name="Langkah"&gt;'''[http://www.micheleborba.com/Pages/7virtues.htm The Step-By-Step Plan to Building Moral Intelligence]'''[http://www.micheleborba.com/Pages/7virtues.htm .] Retrieved 28 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Moral intelligence was first developed as a concept in 2005 by Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph.D. Much of the research involved with moral intelligence agrees that this characteristic is ability-based, rather than trait-based. Therefore, moral intelligence is seen as a skill that can be further developed with practice. Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Moghadam (2011) claim that moral intelligence is the “’central intelligence’ for all humans.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is considered a distinct form of intelligence, independent to both emotional and cognitive intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Models of Moral Intelligence ==
There are two general 'models' of moral intelligence that are recurrent in the literature.

Doug Lennick and Fred Kiel, Ph.D., authors of ''Moral Intelligence'' and the originators of the term, identified four competencies of moral intelligence: integrity, responsibility, forgiveness, and compassion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!Lennick &amp; Kiel's competencies
!Description
|-
|Integrity
|Creating harmony between what we believe and how we act, doing what we know is right, always telling the truth
|-
|Responsibility
|Taking personal responsibility, admitting mistakes and failures, embracing responsibility for serving others    
|-
|Forgiveness
|Letting go of one’s own mistakes, letting go of others’ mistakes    
|-
|Compassion
|Actively caring about others    
|}

Another identified model of moral intelligence was proposed by author Michele Borba, Ed.D., in her book ''Building Moral Intelligence: The Seven Essential Virtues that Teach Kids to Do the Right Thing.'' Borba notes seven essential virtues of moral intelligence: empathy, conscience, self-control, respect, kindness, tolerance, and fairness.&lt;ref name="Langkah" /&gt; In her book, Borba gives a step-by-step plan for parents to teach their children these virtues to enhance their moral intelligence.

|-

|}

== Moral Intelligence and Leadership ==
Moral intelligence is proposedly an important characteristic for leaders to have. Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Moghadam (2011) studied the effects of moral intelligence on leadership and identified that moral intelligence affects the overall performance of an organization because leaders who are morally intelligent are more committed, continuously learn from others around them, are more humble, and more willing to risk their own self-interests for the greater good of moral goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Beheshtifar, M., Esmaeli, Z., &amp; Moghadam, M. N. (2011). Effect of moral intelligence on leadership. ''European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, 43,'' 6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Beheshtifar and colleagues argue that moral intelligence provides a “great potential to improve our understanding of learning and behavior,” and in particular within leadership roles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to their research, moral intelligence is the driving force of our other forms of intelligences. Rahimi (2011) claims that humans are born with a natural moral instinct and that moral decisions are made rapidly and subconsciously. Beheshtifar and colleagues believe that within this moral instinct lies “inaccessible moral knowledge.”

Beheshtifar, Esmaeli, and Modhadam (2011) reported that there is a significant amount of research to support that leadership effectiveness is positively correlated with intelligence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that more intelligent people are likely to be good leaders. However, the researchers suggest that smarter people are not always the best or most efficient leaders. They even go as far as to claim that other studies have found that “being much smarter than your subordinates can actually hinder effective leadership” due to the level of communication between the leaders and followers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although moral intelligence is often highly associated with the business world, Beheshtifar and colleagues agree that this form of intelligence does not lie solely in the field of business psychology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Moral Intelligence and Education ==
Education has been said to be a “moral endeavor.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Clarken, R.H., 2009. “Moral Intelligence in the Schools”. School of Education, Northern Michigan University. PP. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) stated during a panel on moral education that schools should define and teach universal moral values as part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rodney H. Clarken of the Northern Michigan University School of Education argued that moral intelligence must be taught to children by breaking it down into three different domains: cognitive, affective, and conative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cognitive domain is used to understand and develop a sense of moral intelligence by teaching children right from wrong, practical application of virtues, and exercising moral problem solving. The affective domain is an approach to develop moral intelligence through sense of when a situation is a moral dilemma, knowing how to respond to a problem appropriately, and learning how to develop a set of values. Lastly, the conative domain includes setting goals, and taking action and persevering.

'''Moral rationalism''', also called '''ethical rationalism''', is a view in [[meta-ethics]] (specifically the [[epistemology]] of [[ethics]]) according to which moral principles are knowable ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', by reason alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/919107782|title=Ethical rationalism and the law|others=Capps, Patrick,, Pattinson, Shaun D.,|isbn=9781849467865|location=Oxford|oclc=919107782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent figures in the [[history of philosophy]] who have defended moral rationalism are [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Perhaps the most prominent figure in the history of philosophy who has rejected moral rationalism is [[David Hume]]. Recent philosophers who have defended moral rationalism include [[R. M. Hare|Richard Hare]], [[Christine Korsgaard]], [[Alan Gewirth]], and [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]].

Moral rationalism is similar to the rationalist version of [[ethical intuitionism]]; however, they are distinct views. Moral rationalism is neutral on whether basic moral beliefs are known via inference or not. A moral rationalist who believes that some moral beliefs are justified non-inferentially is a [[Ethical intuitionism#Rational intuition versus moral sense|rationalist ethical intuitionist]]. So, rationalist ethical intuitionism implies moral rationalism, but the reverse does not hold.

==Emotions and reason==

There are two main forms of moral rationalism, associated with two major forms of reasoning.  If moral reasoning is based on [[theoretical reason]], and is hence analogous to discovering [[empirical]] or [[scientific]] [[truth]]s about the world, a purely emotionless being could arrive at the truths of reason.  Such a being wouldn't necessarily be motivated to act morally.  Beings who are motivated to act morally can also arrive at moral truths, but needn't rely upon their emotions to do so.

Many moral rationalists believe that moral reasoning is based on [[practical reason]], which involves choices about what to do or intend to do, including how to achieve one's goals and what goals one should have in the first place.  In this view, moral reasoning always involves emotional states and hence be intrinsically motivating.  Immanuel Kant expressed this view when he said that immoral actions do not involve a contradiction in belief, but a contradiction in the will, that is, in one's commitment to a principle which one intends to motivate actions. Christine Korsgaard's elaboration of Kantian reasoning tries to show that if ethics is actually based on practical reasoning, this shows that it can be objective and universal, without having to appeal to questionable metaphysical assumptions.

==Criticisms==
[[Moral sense theory|Moral sense theorists]] (or sentimentalists), such as [[David Hume]], are the key opponents of moral rationalism. In Book 3 of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' and in ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'' (EPM), Hume argues (among other things) that reason and emotions (or the "passions" as he often calls them) are quite distinct faculties and that the foundations of morality lie in sentiment, not reason. Hume takes it as a fact about human psychology and morality that moral judgments have an essentially emotional, sentimental, or otherwise non-rational or cognitive character to them. According to Hume, "...morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary" (EPM, Appendix 1, ¶10).

[[File:Hugo de Vries (1848-1935), by Thérèse Schwartze (1851-1918).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Painting of [[Hugo de Vries]], making a painting of an [[Oenothera|evening primrose]], the plant which had apparently produced new forms by large mutations in his experiments, by [[Thérèse Schwartze]], 1918]]
'''Mutationism''' is one of several [[alternatives to evolution by natural selection]] that have existed both before and after the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book, ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. In the theory, mutation was the source of novelty, creating new forms and new species, potentially instantaneously,&lt;ref name=BowlerEclipse/&gt; in sudden jumps.{{sfn|Smocovitis|1996|p=56}} This was envisaged as driving evolution, which was thought to be limited by the supply of mutations.

Before Darwin, biologists commonly believed in [[saltationism]], the possibility of large evolutionary jumps, including immediate [[speciation]]. For example, in 1822 [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] argued that species could be formed by sudden transformations, or what would later be called macromutation. Darwin opposed saltation, insisting on [[phyletic gradualism|gradualism]] in evolution as [[uniformitarianism|in geology (uniformitarianism)]]. In 1864, [[Albert von Kölliker]] revived Geoffroy's theory. In 1901 the [[genetics|geneticist]] [[Hugo de Vries]] gave the name "mutation" to seemingly new forms that suddenly arose in his experiments on the evening primrose ''[[Oenothera lamarckiana]]'', and in the first decade of the 20th century, mutationism, or as de Vries named it '''''mutationstheorie''''', became a rival to Darwinism supported for a while by geneticists including [[William Bateson]], [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], and [[Reginald Punnett]].

Understanding of mutationism is clouded by the mid-20th century portrayal of the early mutationists by supporters of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] as opponents of Darwinian evolution and rivals of the biometrics school who argued that selection operated on continuous variation. In this portrayal, mutationism was defeated by a synthesis of genetics and natural selection that supposedly started later, around 1918, with work by the mathematician [[Ronald Fisher]]. However, the alignment of Mendelian genetics and natural selection began as early as 1902 with a paper by [[Udny Yule]], and built up with theoretical and experimental work in Europe and America. Despite the controversy, the early mutationists had by 1918 already accepted natural selection and explained continuous variation as the result of multiple genes acting on the same characteristic, such as height.

Mutationism, along with other alternatives to Darwinism like [[Lamarckism]] and [[orthogenesis]], was discarded by most biologists as they came to see that [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|Mendelian genetics and natural selection could readily work together]]; mutation took its place as a source of the genetic variation essential for natural selection to work on.  However, mutationism did not entirely vanish. In 1940, [[Richard Goldschmidt]] again argued for single-step speciation by macromutation, describing the organisms thus produced as "hopeful monsters", earning widespread ridicule. In 1987, [[Masatoshi Nei]] argued controversially that evolution was often mutation-limited. Modern biologists such as [[Douglas J. Futuyma]] conclude that essentially all claims of evolution driven by large mutations can be explained by Darwinian evolution.

In 1822, in the second volume of his ''Philosophie anatomique'', [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that "monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hallgrímsson, Benedikt; Hall, Brian K. |year=2011 |title=Variation: A Central Concept in Biology |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-088777-4 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new [[species]] instantaneously.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|p=127}}

=== Darwin's anti-saltationist gradualism, 1859 ===
{{further|Phyletic gradualism}}

In his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] denied saltational evolution. He argued that evolutionary transformation always proceeds gradually, never in jumps: "[[natural selection]] acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short steps". Darwin continued in this belief throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles Darwin |author=Darwin, Charles |year=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species |page=471 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/pdf/1859_Origin_F373.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kölliker Rudolph Albert von 1818-1902.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolph Albert von Kölliker revived Geoffroy's saltationist ideas, calling his theory [[heterogenesis]]. It depended on a nonmaterial directive force ([[orthogenesis]]).]]

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] warned Darwin that he had taken on "an unnecessary difficulty in adopting ''[[Natura non facit saltus|Natura non facit saltum]]'' ["Nature does not take leaps"] so unreservedly."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. (1859). [http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-2544.html Letter to Charles Darwin.] Nov. 23, 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley feared this assumption could discourage naturalists ([[catastrophism|catastrophists]]) who believed that major leaps and cataclysms played a significant role in the history of life.&lt;ref name=gould77&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gould, Stephen J. |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1977 |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_hopeful-monsters.html |title=The Return of Hopeful Monsters |journal=Natural History |volume=86 |issue=24 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== von Kölliker's heterogenesis, 1864 ===

In 1864 [[Albert von Kölliker]] revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of [[heterogenesis]], but this time assuming the influence of a nonmaterial force{{efn|[[Orthogenesis]], possibly [[vitalism]].}} to direct the course of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Sewall Wright |author=Wright, Sewall |year=1984 |title=Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=10 |isbn=978-0226910383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galton's "sports", 1892 ===

Darwin's cousin, [[Francis Galton]], considered Darwin's evidence for evolution, and came to an opposite conclusion about the type of variation on which natural selection must act. He carried out his own experiments and published a series of papers and books setting out his views. Already by 1869 when he published ''Hereditary Genius'', he believed in evolution by saltation. In his 1889 book ''Natural Inheritance'' he argued that natural selection would benefit from accepting that the steps need not, as Darwin had stated, be minute. In his 1892 book ''Finger Prints'', he stated directly that "The progress of evolution is not a smooth and uniform progression, but one that proceeds by jerks, through successive 'sports' (as they are called), some of them implying considerable organic changes; and each in its turn being favoured by Natural Selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|2001|pp=14–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1860 to 1880 saltation had been a minority viewpoint, to the extent that Galton felt his writings were being universally ignored. By 1890 it became a widely held theory, and his views helped to launch a major controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Radick, Gregory |year=2008 |title=The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate about Animal Language |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |page=368 |isbn=978-0226702247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LevitMeister2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levit |first1=Georgy S. |last2=Meister |first2=Kay |last3=Hoßfeld |first3=Uwe |title=Alternative evolutionary theories: A historical survey|journal=Journal of Bioeconomics |volume=10 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=71–96 |doi=10.1007/s10818-008-9032-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Johannsen's "pure line" experiments, 1903===
[[File:Wilhelm Johannsen 1857-1927.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm Johannsen]]'s "pure line" experiments seemed to show that evolution could not work on continuous variation.]]

In the early 1900s, Darwin's mechanism of natural selection was understood by believers in continuous variation, principally the [[biometrician]]s [[Walter Weldon]] and [[Karl Pearson]], to be able to work on a continuously varying characteristic, whereas de Vries argued that selection on such characteristics would be ineffective. [[Wilhelm Johannsen]]'s "pure line" experiments on ''[[Phaseolus vulgaris]]'' beans appeared to refute this mechanism. Using the true-breeding Princess variety of bean, carefully inbred within weight classes, Johannsen's work appeared to support de Vries. The offspring had a smooth random distribution. Johanssen believed that his results showed that continuous variability was not inherited, so evolution must rely on discontinuous mutations, as de Vries had argued.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=92–100}}&lt;ref name=Roll-Hansen_1989&gt;{{cite journal | author=N.

== The undermining of mutationism ==

=== Yule's analysis of Mendelism and continuous variation, 1902 ===

The undermining of mutationism began almost at once, in 1902, as the statistician [[Udny Yule]] analysed Mendel's theory and showed that given full dominance of one allele over another, a 3:1 ratio of alleles would be sustained indefinitely. This meant that the recessive allele could remain in the population with no need to invoke mutation. He also showed that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation, as indeed Mendel had suggested, removing the central plank of the mutationist theory, and criticised Bateson's confrontational approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Yule | first1=G.

=== Nilsson-Ehle's experiments on Mendelian inheritance and continuous variation, 1908 ===

The Swedish geneticist H. Nilsson-Ehle demonstrated in 1908, in a paper published in German in a Swedish journal, ''Einige Ergebnisse von Kreuzungen bei Hafer und Weizen'' (Observations on Crosses in Oats and Wheat),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nilsson-Ehle |first1=H. |title=Einige Ergebnisse von Kreuzungen bei Hafer und Weizen |language=German |trans-title=Observations on Crosses in Oats and Wheat |journal=Botaniska Notiser |date=1908 |pages=257–294 |url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit38177/index.meta}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continuous variation could readily be produced by multiple Mendelian genes. He found numerous Mendelian 3:1 ratios, implying a dominant and a recessive allele, in [[oats]] and [[wheat]]; a 15:1 ratio for a cross of oat varieties with black and white [[glume]]s respectively, implying two pairs of alleles (two Mendelian factors); and that crossing a red-grained Swedish velvet wheat with a white one gave in the third (F3) generation the complex signature of ratios expected of three factors at once, with 37 grains giving only red offspring, 8 giving 63:1 in their offspring, 12 giving 15:1, and 6 giving 3:1. There weren't any grains giving all white, but as he had only expected 1 of those in his sample, 0 was not an unlikely outcome. Genes could clearly combine in almost infinite combinations: ten of his factors allowed for almost 60,000 different forms, with no need to suppose that any new mutations were involved. The results implied that natural selection would work on Mendelian genes, helping to bring about the unification of Darwinian evolution and genetics.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=114–118}}

=== Castle's selection experiments on hooded rats, 1911 ===

Starting in 1906, [[William Castle]]  carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in [[rat]]s. The [[piebald]] or hooded pattern was recessive to the grey [[wild type]]. He crossed hooded rats with the black-backed Irish type, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found that it was possible to change the characteristics way beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation could not be inherited permanently, requiring new mutations. By 1911 Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on heritable variation of Mendelian genes.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=109–114}}

[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s work on ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' found many small Mendelian factors for natural selection to work on.]]

By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] showed that these animals had many small Mendelian factors on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=120–121}}

=== Muller's balanced lethal explanation of ''Oenothera'' "mutations", 1918 ===

De Vries's mutationism was dealt a serious if not fatal blow in 1918 by the American geneticist [[Hermann Joseph Muller]]. He compared the behaviour of balanced lethals in ''Drosophila'' with De Vries's supposed mutations in ''Oenothera'', showing that they could work the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muller |first1=Hermann Joseph |title=Genetic Variability, Twin Hybrids and Constant Hybrids, in a Case of Balanced Lethal Factors |journal=Genetics |date=1918 |volume=2 |page=471 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200446/pdf/422.pdf |pmc=1200446 |pmid=17245914}}&lt;/ref&gt; No actual mutations were involved, but infrequent [[chromosome]] crossovers accounted for the sudden appearance of traits which had been present in the genes all along.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=121–122}}

=== Fisher's explanation of polymorphism, 1927 ===

In 1927, Fisher explicitly attacked Punnett's 1915 theory of discontinuous evolution of mimicry. Fisher argued that selection acting on genes making small modifications to the butterfly's [[phenotype]] (its appearance) would allow the multiple forms of a polymorphism to be established.&lt;ref name=ProvineOnFisher/&gt;

== Later mutationist theories ==
The understanding that Mendelian genetics could both preserve discrete variations indefinitely, and support continuous variation for natural selection to work on gradually, meant that most biologists from around 1918 onwards accepted natural selection as the driving force of evolution.{{sfn|Bowler|2003|pp=307–308}} Mutationism and other alternatives to evolution by natural selection did not however vanish entirely.&lt;ref name=Levit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hubbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gould1982/&gt;

Better understanding of mutation led instead (dashed orange arrows) to the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of [[Mendelian genetics]] with [[natural selection]], establishing [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]] throughout biology.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=280–281}}]]

==Historiography==

Biologists at the start of the 20th century broadly agreed that evolution occurred, but felt that the mechanisms suggested by Darwin, including natural selection, would be ineffective. Large mutations looked likely to drive evolution quickly, and avoided the difficulty which had rightly worried Darwin, namely that blending inheritance would average out any small favourable changes.{{efn|Mendelian inheritance, with discrete alleles, solves Darwin's problem, as blending does not occur.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=210}}}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|p=121}} Further, large saltatory mutation, able to create species in a single step, offered a ready explanation of why the fossil record should contain large discontinuities and times of rapid change.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=127–129, 157–167}}

These discoveries were often framed by supporters of the mid-20th century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], such as [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Ernst Mayr]], as a controversy between the early geneticists—the "Mendelians"—including Bateson, Johannsen, de Vries, Morgan, and Punnett, who advocated Mendelism and mutation, and were understood as opponents of Darwin's original gradualist view, and the biometricians such as Pearson and Weldon, who opposed Mendelism and were more faithful to Darwin. In this version, little progress was made during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]], and the debate between mutationist geneticists such as de Vries and biometricians such as Pearson ended with the victory of the modern synthesis between about 1918 and 1950.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=56–107}}&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_2006/&gt; According to this account, the new [[population genetics]] of the 1940s demonstrated the explanatory power of natural selection, while mutationism, alongside [[Alternatives to Darwinism|other non-Darwinian approaches]] such as [[orthogenesis]] and [[structuralism (biology)|structuralism]], was essentially abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |year=2007 |title=What Makes Biology Unique?: Considerations on the Autonomy of a Scientific Discipline |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages= |isbn=978-0521841146}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view became dominant in the second half of the 20th century, and was accepted by both biologists and historians.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis/&gt;

A more recent view, advocated by the historians Arlin Stoltzfus and Kele Cable, is that Bateson, de Vries, Morgan and Punnett had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on [[allele]]s (alternative forms of a gene), the [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]], the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will [[Fixation (population genetics)|become fixed]]. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection alongside mutation, but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900.&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |last2=Cable |first2=Kele |title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2014 |volume=47 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10739-014-9383-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation outright is simply false; as early as 1902, Bateson and [[Edith Rebecca Saunders|Edith Saunders]] wrote that "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various [[homozygous|homo-]] and [[heterozygous|hetero-zygous]] combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected".&lt;ref name="BatesonSaunders1902"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bateson |first1=William |author1link=William Bateson |last2=Saunders |first2=E.

Historians have interpreted the history of mutationism in different ways.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=56–107}}&lt;ref name=Stoltzfus_Cable_2014&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoltzfus, A. |author2=Cable, K. | year=2014 | title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis | journal=J Hist Biol | volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roll-Hansen_1989/&gt;{{sfn|Gayon|1988|pages=289 and passim}}The classical view is that mutationism, opposed to Darwin's gradualism, was an obvious error; the decades-long delay in synthesizing genetics and Darwinism is an "inexplicable embarrassment";&lt;ref name=Hull_1985&gt;{{ cite book |first=D.

A revisionist view is that mutationists accepted both mutation and selection, with broadly the same roles they have today, and early on accepted and indeed offered a correct explanation for continuous variation based on multiple genes, paving the way for gradual evolution.

{{Neuropsychology |functions}}

In [[neuropsychology]], [[linguistics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], a '''natural language''' or '''ordinary language''' is any [[language]] that has [[linguistic evolution|evolved]] naturally in humans through use and repetition without conscious planning or premeditation. Natural languages can take different forms, such as [[Vocal language|speech]] or [[Sign language|signing]]. They are distinguished from [[Constructed language|constructed]] and [[formal language]]s such as [[Programming language|those used to program computers]] or to study [[logic]].&lt;ref name="john lyons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lyons |first=John |title=Natural Language and Universal Grammar |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0521246965 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defining natural language ==

Though the exact definition varies between scholars, natural language can broadly be defined in contrast to artificial or [[constructed language]]s (such as [[Programming language|computer programming languages]] and [[international auxiliary language]]s) and to other [[Biocommunication (science)|communication systems in nature]]. Such examples include bees' [[waggle dance]]&lt;ref name="fernandes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fernandes |first=Keith |title=On the Significance of Speech: How Infants Discover Symbols and Structure |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=978-1243524065 |pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[whale vocalization|whale song]], to which researchers have found or applied the linguistic cognates of [[dialect]] and even [[syntax]]. 

All [[variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] of [[world language]]s are natural languages, although some varieties are subject to greater degrees of published [[linguistic prescription|prescriptivism]] or [[list of language regulators|language regulation]] than others. Thus [[nonstandard dialect]]s can be viewed as a [[wild type]] in comparison with [[standard language]]s. But even an [[official language]] with a regulating academy, such as [[Standard French]] with the [[Académie française|French Academy]], is classified as a natural language (for example, in the field of [[natural language processing]]), as its prescriptive points do not make it either constructed enough to be classified as a [[constructed language]] or controlled enough to be classified as a [[controlled natural language]].

== Controlled languages ==
{{Main|Controlled natural language}}

Controlled natural languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars and dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity (for instance, by cutting down on rarely used superlative or adverbial forms or [[irregular verbs]]). The purpose behind the development and implementation of a controlled natural language typically is to aid non-native speakers of a natural language in understanding it, or to ease computer processing of a natural language. An example of a widely used controlled natural language is [[Simplified Technical English|Simplified English]], which was originally developed for [[aerospace]] industry maintenance manuals.

== Constructed languages and international auxiliary languages ==
{{Main|Constructed language|International auxiliary language}}
Constructed [[international auxiliary language]]s such as [[Esperanto]] and [[Interlingua]] (even those that have [[native speaker]]s) are not generally considered natural languages.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "A historical overview of international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural languages have been used to communicate and have evolved in a natural way, whereas Esperanto was designed by [[L.L. Zamenhof]] selecting elements from natural languages, not grown from natural fluctuations in vocabulary and syntax. Some natural languages have become naturally "standardized" by children's natural tendency to correct for illogical grammatical structures in their parents' speech, which can be seen in the development of [[pidgin]] languages into [[creole language]]s (as explained by Steven Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]''), but this is not the case in many languages, including constructed languages such as Esperanto, where strict rules are in place as an attempt to consciously remove such irregularities. The possible exception to this are true native speakers of such languages.&lt;ref&gt;Proponents contend that there are 200–2000 [[native Esperanto speakers|native speakers of Esperanto]].&lt;/ref&gt; More substantive basis for this designation is that the vocabulary, grammar, and orthography of Interlingua are natural; they have been standardized and presented by a [[International Auxiliary Language Association|linguistic research body]], but they predated it and are not themselves considered a product of human invention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951. (Original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Most experts, however, consider Interlingua to be naturalistic rather than natural.&lt;ref name="Gopsill, F. P. 1990"/&gt; [[Latino Sine Flexione]], a second naturalistic auxiliary language, is also naturalistic in content but is no longer widely spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., "Naturalistic international languages". In ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nukapu Conflict}}
The '''Nukapu Expedition''' occurred between October 1871 and February 1872 and was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[punitive expedition|punitive operation]] in response to the murder of [[Bishop]] [[John Coleridge Patteson]] by the natives of [[Nukapu]]. A [[Royal Navy]] warship was sent to the island and it sank a group of hostile [[canoe|war-canoes]] and landed men to attack a fortified village.

==Expedition==
In October 1871, the screw [[sloop-of-war]] [[HMS Rosario (1860)|HMS ''Rosario'']] was operating against [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] [[blackbirder]]s when her captain, [[Commander|Acting-Commander]] [[Albert Hastings Markham]] received orders to sail for Nukapu in the [[Solomon Islands]]. A contemporary newspaper described the events thus:
{{cquote|''The Rosario{{'}}s boat had got to within 50 yards of the mainland when the natives commenced their war dance and made other hostile indications. They then sent a shower of arrows at the Rosario{{'}}s boat, which however, all fell short. The boat then returned to the ship to report the attack, and to ask permission to return it. The boat was ordered to return, and the ship was cleared for action, and opened fire with shell from the [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|40-pounder Armstrong]], and the [[RML 7 inch gun|7in. six and a half ton gun]]; while the crew of the boat opened fire with their rifles. The Rosario made a circuit of the island, and when abreast of the native village fired on it with shell at 2,300 yards. At 4 p.m., it being high water, the boats were able to cross the reef, and four of them advanced on the village with small arms, and engaged the natives, who kept up a continual discharge of arrows; the ship sent in shell at a range of a mile. After firing several hundred rounds, the men landed from the boats and drove the natives in from the beach. Here one of the arrows struck Corporal Marcus in the arm, and the wound afterwards proved fatal. The native canoes were destroyed, and the seamen pulled on to the village, where one of them received two bad wounds, but ultimately recovered from their effects. The village proved to be very strongly fortified with stonework, which was thrown up in front of each hut. In a few minutes the native habitations were set in flames. It was estimated that from 20 to 30 natives were killed in the engagement.|20px|20px|The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson, reported in ''The Argus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]| location = [[Melbourne]] |date= 15 February 1872|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5859743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, pg. 32-323&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Markham published an account of the cruise under the title ''The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands, exposing the recent atrocities connected with the kidnapping of natives in the South Seas.''&lt;ref name=CR&gt;{{cite book |title=The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands |last=Markham |first=Albert Hastings |authorlink=Albert Hastings Markham  |year=1873 |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures taken by ''Rosario'' became the subject of questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1872/mar/11/question-5#S3V0209P0_18720311_HOC_34|title=Hansard, 11 March 1872|accessdate=2009-11-19|quote=Mr W Johnston asked the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, If there is any foundation for the statement that Her Majesty's ship ''Rosario'' has shelled and destroyed the village in the Island of Nukapu, in which resided the natives who murdered Bishop Patteson; and, if so, by whose orders this was done?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Markham's book&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; on the subject may well have been prompted by them. The book itself makes clear that Markham clearly understood the cycle of violence and deplored both the murderous activities of the Blackbirders, and the apparent need for further violence in restoring order.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11151">The traditional '''Polish units of measurement''' included two uniform yet distinct systems of [[weights and measures]], as well as a number of related systems borrowed from neighbouring states. The first attempt at [[standardisation]] came with the introduction of the '''Old Polish measurement [system]''', also dubbed the '''Warsaw system''', introduced by a royal decree of December 6, 1764. The system was later replaced by the '''New Polish measurement [system]''' introduced on January 1, 1819.

The traditional Polish systems of weights and measures were later replaced with those of surrounding nations (due to the [[Partitions of Poland]]), only to be replaced with [[metric system]] by the end of the 19th century (between 1872 and 1876).

== History ==

=== Historic weights and measures ===
The first recorded weights and measures used in Poland were related to dimensions of human body, hence the most basic measures in use were ''sążeń'' ([[fathom]]), ''łokieć'' ([[ell]]), ''piędź'' ([[Span (unit)|span]]), ''stopa'' ([[Foot (unit)|foot]]) and ''skok'' ([[jumping|jump]]). With time trade relations with the neighbouring nations brought to use additional units, with names often borrowed from [[German language|German]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Czech language|Czech]].

From Middle Ages until the 18th century, there was no single system of measurement used in all of Poland. Traditional units like ''stopa'' ([[foot]]) or ''łokieć'' ([[ell]]) were used throughout the country, but their meaning differed from region to region. Most major cities in the area used their own systems of measurement, which were used in the surrounding areas as well. Among the commonly used systems were [[Austrian units of measurement|Austrian]], [[Galician units of measurement|Galician]], [[Danzig units of measurement|Danzig]], [[Kraków units of measurement|Kraków]], [[German units of measurement|Prussian]], [[Russian units of measurement|Russian]] and [[German units of measurement|Breslau]]. The matter was further complicated by the fact that Austrian or German systems were hardly uniform either and differed from town to town.&lt;ref name="Cardarelli"&gt;{{cite book | author =François Cardarelli | coauthors = | title =Encyclopedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures. Their SI Equivalences and Origins | year = | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | location =Berlin | isbn=1-85233-682-X  | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the systems tended to evolve over time: in the 13th century the Kraków's [[ell]] was equivalent to 64.66 [[centimetre]]s, a century later it was equivalent to 62.5&amp;nbsp;cm, then in the 16th century it shrunk to 58.6&amp;nbsp;cm and finally was equalled to standard "old Polish ell" of 59.6&amp;nbsp;cm only in 1836.

To add to the confusion, various goods were traditionally measured with different units, often incompatible or difficult to convert. For instance, [[beer]] was sold in units named ''[[achtel]]'' (0.5 of [[barrel]], that is 62 Kraków [[gallon]]s of 2.75 [[litre]]s each). However honey and mead were recorded for tax purposes in units named ''rączka'' (slightly more than 10 Kraków gallons).

As the weights and measures were important in everyday life of merchants, in 1420 the royal decree allowed each [[voivode]] to create and maintain a single system used in his [[voivodeship]]. This law was later confirmed by a [[Sejm]] act of 1565. Steel or copper rods used as local standard of [[ell]] (basic unit of length) were being created in voivode's capital and then dispatched to all nearby towns, where they were further duplicated for everyday use. One bar was to be stored in the [[town hall]] for comparison, while additional rods were stored in the gatehouses or toll points to be borrowed by merchants as needed. Damaging or losing a rod was punishable by law.

=== Measuring time ===

Outside of this set of systems was the measurement of time. As [[clock tower]]s only started to appear in late Middle Ages, and their usability was limited to within a small radius, some basic substitutes for modern minutes and hours were developed, based on Christian prayers. The ''pacierz'' (or ''paternoster'') was a non-standard unit of time comprising some 25 seconds, that is enough time to recite the [[Lord's Prayer]]. Similarly, ''zdrowaśka'' (from ''Zdrowaś Mario'', the first words of the [[Hail Mary]]) was used, as was the [[Rosary]] (''różaniec'') that is the time needed to recite Hail Mary 50 times (roughly 16 minutes). Those units were never strictly defined, but were used in rural areas of Poland as late as the 20th century.

=== Early attempts at standardisation ===

While this system introduced some level of standardisation throughout the country, the systems used in various voivodeships still differed from one another. To counter this problem the [[Kraków]] ell and [[Poznań]] ell were made equal in 1507. The same applied to ells used in Lwów and Lublin, which however were different from those in Kraków and Poznań. In 1532 the [[Płock]] ell was aligned with the Kraków ell, which in 1565 was declared an official ell to be used in all of the [[Crown of Poland]]. The system used by Warsaw was adopted in [[Płock]] and all of [[Masovia]] in 1569. In 1613 additional systems were created for [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]]. The standardisation of other units of measurement also made some progress since the 15th century, but at a different pace. In the end this created even more confusion, as two towns could use the same units of length, but two different units of weight, although using the same terms.

=== 1764 reform - the Old Polish system ===

As until then not only different units varied from town to town but also their relation to one another, in 1764 a major overhaul of the measurement system was prepared. By a royal decree of December 6, 1764 all units of measurement were to be converted to a new system, common to all of Poland and its dependencies. The system relied on previously used units, but introduced a common, unified system of relations between them. It had no official name and it was not until the 19th century when it started to be called the Old Polish system (''miary staropolskie'', or ''Old-Polish measures''), in contrast to the ''new'' system introduced then.

The basic unit of length - the [[ell]] or łokieć in Polish - was set to 0.5955 [[metre]]s. For trade and everyday use it was further subdivided into the [[foot_(unit)|foot]] (''stopa'', ≈29.78 [[Centimetre|centimetres]]); ''[[sztych]]'' (≈19.86cm); quarter (''ćwierć'', ≈14.89cm); [[Palm (length)|palm]] (''dłoń'', ≈7.44cm); and [[inch]] (''cal'', ≈2.48 centimetres), or gathered into the [[fathom]] (''sążeń'', 3 ells or 1.787 metres in length), such that:&lt;blockquote&gt;1 ell  =  2 feet  =  3 sztychs  =  4 quarters  =  8 palms  =  24 inches  ( =  ⅓ of a fathom ).&lt;/blockquote&gt;A different system of units, although complementary and interchangeable, was used in measuring lengths for agrarian purposes. The basic unit was a step (''krok''), equalling 3.75 of standard ell, or 2.2333 metres. Two steps made a [[Rod (unit)|rod]] (''pręt'', 4.4665 metres), 2 rods made a stick (''laska''), and five sticks were equal to a cable (''sznur'' of 44.665 metres). Finally 3 cables made up a [[furlong]] (''staje'') of roughly 134 metres.

In measuring the distance between cities, the basic unit was ''staje'', although it was different from the ''staje'' mentioned before and had the length of roughly 893 metres. Eight ''staje'' made up a [[Polish mile]] of 7144 metres.

The weights were based on the Polish pound (''funt'' of 0.4052 [[kilogram|kg]]) composed of two ''[[Grzywna (unit)|grzywna]]s'', each in turn comprising 16 [[Lot (unit)|lot]]s (''łut'' of 0.0127&amp;nbsp;kg). For heavier goods the basic units were a [[Stone (imperial mass)|stone]] (''kamień'', 32 pounds or 12.976&amp;nbsp;kg) and [[Hundredweight]] (''cetnar'', five stones or 64.80&amp;nbsp;kg).

There were two sets of units of volume: one for fluids and the other for [[dry goods]]. Both used the [[gallon]] (''garniec'') of 3.7689 [[litre]]s as the basic unit. This was subdivided into 4 [[quart]]s (''{{lang|pl|kwarta}}'') of 0.9422 L or 16 ''{{lang|pl|kwarterka}}''. For dry goods four gallons comprised a measure (''{{lang|pl|miarka}}''), 2 measures comprised a [[quarter (unit)|quarter]] (''{{lang|pl|ćwierć}}''), 4 quarters comprised a [[bushel]] (''{{lang|pl|korzec}}'') of 120.6 L, and 30 bushels comprised a [[last (unit)|last]] (''{{lang|pl|łaszt}}'') of 3618 L. For fluids, 5 gallons comprised a ''konew'' of 18.8445 L and 14.4 ''konew'' made up a [[barrel]] of 271.36 L.

=== Current use ===

Though the traditional systems were officially abandoned in the 19th century, traces of their use, especially in rural areas, were found by [[ethnographers]] as late as 1969.&lt;ref name="Kunikowski"&gt;{{cite book | author =Stanisław Kunikowski | coauthors = | title =Miary na ziemiach polskich; wystawa ze zbiorów Muzeum Ziemi Kujawskiej i Dobrzyńskiej we Włocławku | year =1987 | editor = | pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Muzeum Narodowe Rolnictwa i Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego | location =Szreniawa  | isbn= | url = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old age''' refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and is thus the end of the human [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Terms and euphemisms include '''old people''', '''the elderly''' (worldwide usage), '''seniors''' (American usage), '''senior citizens''' (British and American usages), '''older adults''' (in the social sciences&lt;ref&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition'' (American Psychological Association, 2009) {{ISBN|1433805618}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and '''the elders''' (in many cultures—including the cultures of aboriginal people).

Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, injuries and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of [[ageing]] is called [[senescence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/senescence |title=Senescence – definition of senescence by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical study of the aging process is called [[gerontology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gerontology |title=Gerontology – definition of gerontology by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called [[geriatrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/geriatrics |title=Geriatrics – definition of geriatrics by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly also face other social issues around [[retirement]], [[loneliness]], and [[ageism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24572231 |title=Jeremy Hunt highlights plight of 'chronically lonely' – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age is not a definite biological stage, as the chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198568506.001.0001/acref-9780198568506-e-4834?rskey=7F4W2c&amp;result=4834 |title=Old age |publisher=Oxford Reference |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations]] proposed a human rights convention that would specifically protect older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/OlderPersons/Pages/OlderPersonsIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR - 	 	Human rights of older persons|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Image:Maes Old Woman Dozing.jpg|thumb|upright|''Old Woman Dozing'' by [[Nicolaes Maes]] (1656). [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]], [[Brussels]]]]
Definitions of old age include official definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows.

===Official definitions===
Old age comprises "the later part of life; the period of life after youth and middle age . . ., usually with reference to deterioration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/258473?redirectedFrom=old+age&amp; |title=Millennium Web Catalog |publisher=0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At what age old age begins cannot be universally defined because it differs according to the context. The United Nations has agreed that 65+ years may be usually denoted as old age&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Definition of an older or elderly person |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) set 55 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developed Western countries set the age of 60 to 65 for retirement. Being 60–65 years old is usually a requirement for becoming eligible for senior social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-eligibility.html|title=Medicare Eligibility Requirements – How to Qualify for Medicare – AARP Everyw...|last=Barry|first=Patricia|website=AARP|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various countries and societies consider the onset of old age as anywhere from the mid-40s to the 70s.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426737/old-age |title=old age |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of old age continue to change especially as life expectancy in developed countries has risen to beyond 80 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141539/http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |archivedate=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, a paper published in the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' presented the conclusion that the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] is an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dong |first1=Xiao |last2=Milholland |first2=Brandon |last3=Vijg |first3=Jan |title=Evidence for a limit to human lifespan |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19793.html |date=October 5, 2016 |doi=10.1038/nature19793 |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |volume=538 |journal=Nature |pages=257–259 |pmid=27706136|bibcode=2016Natur.538..257D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors' methods and conclusions drew criticism from the scientific community, who concluded that the study was flawed.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Santen|first1=Hester|title=Peer review post-mortem: how a flawed aging study was published in Nature|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/12/09/how-weak-science-slipped-past-through-review-and-landed-in-a-top-journal-a1535637|accessdate=11 December 2016|publisher=NRC|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-group definitions{{anchor|Third age}}&lt;!--[[Third age (retirement)]] redirects here--&gt;===
Gerontologists have recognized the very different conditions that people experience as they grow older within the years defined as old age. In developed countries, most people in their 60s and early 70s are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 607.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 75, they will become increasingly [[Frailty syndrome|frail]], a condition marked by serious mental and physical debilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=204046 |title=JAMA Network &amp;#124; JAMA &amp;#124; Frailty in Older Adults |publisher=Jama.jamanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, rather than lumping together all people who have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups. One study distinguishes the young old (60 to 69), the middle old (70 to 79), and the very old (80+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1727842|year=1992|author1=Forman|first1=D. E.|title=PTCA in the elderly: The "young-old" versus the "old-old"|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=40|issue=1|pages=19–22|last2=Berman|first2=A. D.|last3=McCabe|first3=C.

Y.|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1992.tb01823.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study's sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), middle-old (75–84), and oldest-old (85+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/gerona/gln045|title=Total Water Intakes of Community-Living Middle-Old and Oldest-Old Adults|journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences|volume=64A|issue=4|pages=481–486|year=2009|last1=Zizza|first1=C. A.|last2=Ellison|first2=K. J.|last3=Wernette|first3=C. M.|pmc=2657166}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third sub-grouping is "young old" (65–74), "old" (74–84), and "old-old" (85+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transgenerational.org/aging/demographics.htm |title=Demographics of Aging |publisher=Transgenerational.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delineating sub-groups in the 65+ population enables a more accurate portrayal of significant life changes.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a "fourth age" sub-group. In British English, the "third age" is "the period in life of active retirement, following middle age".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "third age".&lt;/ref&gt; Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as "an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, ''Rethinking Old Age: Theorizing the Fourth Age'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), vii, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions of old age===
''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nallétamby, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (SAGE Publications, 2010), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental.&lt;ref&gt;John Wattis, Stephen Curran, ''Practical Psychiatry of Old Age'' (Radcliffe Publishing, 2006). 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronological age may differ considerably from a person's functional age. The distinguishing marks of old age normally occur in all five senses at different times and different rates for different persons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010319220229/http://ohioline.osu.edu/ss-fact/0101.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

===Senior citizen===
Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in [[American English]], and sometimes in [[British English]]. It implies that the person being referred to is retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl |title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries &amp;#124; Find the meanings, definitions, pictures, pronunciation of words at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420174106/http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&amp;title=21st |title=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |publisher=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&amp;dict=CALD |title=senior citizen Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn usually implies that the person is over the [[retirement age]], which varies according to country. Synonyms include '''old age pensioner''' or '''pensioner''' in British English, and '''retiree''' and '''senior''' in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread use of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen |title=senior citizen – Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online |publisher=Ldoceonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defined in an official context, ''senior citizen'' is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group.

It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as ''old person'', ''old-age pensioner'', or ''elderly'' as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "[[citizen]]s" of society, of ''senior'' rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waughfield|first1=Claire G.|last2=Burckhalter|first2=Teresa S.|title=Mental health concepts|date=2002|publisher=Delmar/Thomson Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=9780766838307|page=64|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xylg46v5fRUC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64|accessdate=4 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm|title=The Senior Times Online|publisher=|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famed caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] claimed on several occasion that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term 'senior citizen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIgT8dfbX1wC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=al+hirschfeld+father+coined+senior+citizen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OvOd6pwp_A&amp;sig=5O-oLxdttOny8StHEODJ38LkG88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigsc32y-jJAhWClR4KHYbTDakQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20hirschfeld%20father%20coined%20senior%20citizen&amp;f=false | title=Hirschfeld: On Line | publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books | page=10 | date=February 1, 2000| accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Al Hirschfeld| title = The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story | medium = VHS| publisher = Cabin Fever Entertainment| date = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,417721,00.html | title=That Old Feeling: The Fun in Al Hirschfeld | publisher=TIME | author=Richard Corliss | date=January 29, 2003| accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an [[adjective]].

In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a "[[senior discount]]". The age at which these discounts are available varies between 55, 60, 62 or 65, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special "[[senior discount card]]" or other proof of age needs to be obtained and produced to show entitlement.

====Age qualifications====

The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts, it is usually associated with an age at which [[pension]]s or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a [[marketing]] device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahn Shin-Hyun |url=http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&amp;mncd=0301&amp;sort=A&amp;gubun=00&amp;p_page=65&amp;natcd=KR&amp;key=20110404000005 |title=Economic Report |publisher=SERIWorld |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html |title=Retirement Age Calculator |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the OAS (Old Age Security) pension is available at 65 (the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had planned to gradually increase the age of eligibility to 67, starting in the years 2023–2029, although the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is considering leaving it at 65),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102073722/http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |archivedate=November 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CPP (Canada Pension Plan) as early as age 60.

The [[AARP]] allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse.

==Marks of old age==
{{See also|Ageing#Effects of ageing}} 

The distinguishing characteristics of old age are both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1891555|year=1991|author1=Salokangas|first1=R. K.|title=Physical and mental health changes in retirement age|journal=Psychotherapy and psychosomatics|volume=55|issue=2–4|pages=100–7|last2=Joukamaa|first2=M|doi=10.1159/000288415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marks of old age are so unlike the marks of middle age that legal scholar Richard Posner suggests that, as an individual transitions into old age, he/she can be thought of as different persons "time-sharing" the same identity.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

These marks do not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Also, they occur at different rates and order for different people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Marks of old age can easily vary between people of the same chronological age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216170927/http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is "slowness of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.001553|pmid=7872732|title=Aging and Speed of Behavior: Possible Consequences for Psychological Functioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=46|pages=329–53|year=1995|last1=Birren|first1=J E|last2=Fisher|first2=L M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "slowing down principle" finds a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Kausler and Barry C. Kausler, ''The Graying of America: An Encyclopedia of Aging, Health, Mind, and Behavior'' (University of Illinois, 2001), 376–377.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies from Buffalo University and Northwestern University have shown that the elderly are a happier age group than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Updated 1553 GMT (2253 HKT) April 24, 2015 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/24/health/old-people-happy/ |title=Older people are happier than you.

===Physical marks of old age===
Physical marks of old age include the following:

*Bone and joint. Old bones are marked by "thinning and shrinkage". This might result in a loss of height (about two&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) by age 80), a stooping posture in many people, and a greater susceptibility to bone and joint diseases such as [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="wahsa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030211939/http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="documbase1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documbase.com/The-Normal-Aging-Process.pdf |title=The Normal Aging Process – PDF documents |publisher=Documbase.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/osteoporosis-diagnosis#Overview1|title=Osteoporosis Tests and Diagnosis|publisher=Healthline|date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic diseases. Some older persons have at least one [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic condition]] and many have multiple conditions. In 2007–2009, the most frequently occurring conditions among older persons in the United States were uncontrolled [[hypertension]] (34%), diagnosed arthritis (50%), and heart disease (32%).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|title=Administration on Aging&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|access-date=2014-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010053036/http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) "defined as coughing and bringing up [[sputum]] . . . is a common respiratory symptom in elderly persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/21/40_suppl/10s |title=Determinants of prognosis of COPD in the elderly: mucus hypersecretion, infections, cardiovascular comorbidity &amp;#124; European Respiratory Society |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=21 |pages=10S–14s |date=2003-05-01 |accessdate=2016-04-04|doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00403403 |last1=Pistelli |first1=R. |last2=Lange |first2=P. |last3=Miller |first3=D.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dental problems. May have less [[saliva]] and less ability for [[oral hygiene]] in old age which increases the chance of [[Dental caries|tooth decay and infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/helping-your-elder-with-grooming-and-hygiene.html |title=Helping Your Elder with Grooming and Hygiene – For Dummies |publisher=Dummies.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digestive system. About 40% of the time, old age is marked by digestive disorders such as difficulty in swallowing, inability to eat enough and to absorb nutrition, constipation and bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JohnsHopkinsHealthAlerts.com |title=Health After 50: News on Prostate Cancer, Arthritis, Heart Disease, and other conditions which affect Health After 50 |publisher=Johnshopkinshealthalerts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Essential Tremor (ET) is an uncontrollable shaking in a part of the upper body. It is more common in the elderly and symptoms worsen with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/essential-tremor-basics |title=Essential Tremor: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eyesight. [[Presbyopia]] can occur by age 50 and it hinders reading especially of small print in low lighting. Speed with which an individual reads and the ability to locate objects may also be impaired.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/guides/older.aspx|title=Older Adults' Health and Age-Related Changes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a [[cataract]] or have had [[cataract surgery]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Cataract|url=https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts|accessdate=14 August 2016|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf.

*Gait change. Some aspects of [[Gait (human)|gait]] normally change with old age. Gait velocity slows after age 70. Double stance time (i.e., time with both feet on the ground) also increases with age. Because of gait change, old people sometimes appear to be walking on ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Judge |first=James O. |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/geriatrics/gait-disorders-in-the-elderly/gait-disorders-in-the-elderly |title=Gait Disorders in the Elderly – Geriatrics – Merck Manuals Professional Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date=2016-03-25 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Hearing. By age 75 and older, 48% of men and 37% of women encounter impairments in hearing. Of the 26.7 million people over age 50 with a hearing impairment, only one in seven uses a hearing aid.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  In the 70–79 age range, the incidence of partial [[hearing loss]] affecting communication rises to 65%, predominantly among low-income males.&lt;ref name="Feder2015"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= |title=Prevalence of hearing loss among Canadians aged 20 to 79: Audiometric results from the 2012/2013 Canadian Health Measures Survey |year=2015 |last1=Feder |first1=K. |last2=Michaud |first2=D. |last3=Ramage-Morin |first3=P. |last4=McNamee |first4=J. |last5=Beauregard |first5=Y. |journal=Health Reports |volume=26 |issue=7 |pages=18–25 |pmid=26177043 |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental marks of old age===
Mental marks of old age include the following:

*Adaptable describes most people in their old age. Despite the stressfulness of old age, they are described as "agreeable" and "accepting". However, old age dependence induces feelings of incompetence and worthlessness in a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608–609.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caution marks old age. This antipathy toward "risk-taking" stems from the fact that old people have less to gain and more to lose by taking risks than younger people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 112, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Depressed mood.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy G.J. The epidemiology of late-life depression. In: Kennedy G. J, editor. Suicide and depression in late life: Critical issues in treatment, research and public policy. New York: John Wiley and Sons; 1996. pp. 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice"). When people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. "People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rates of depression as they get older."&lt;ref name="Cox et al.

Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptions of old age==

===Old age from a middle-age perspective===
Many books by middle-age writers depict their perceptions of old people.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Survive Your Aging Parents'' (Surrey, 2001); ''Are Your Parents Driving You Crazy?'' (Vanderwyk &amp; Burnham, 2005); ''Coping With Your Difficult Older Parent: A Guide for Stressed-Out Children'' (William Morrow, 1999); ''Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents: How to Help, How to Survive'' (Holt, 2005); ''The Caregiver's Survival Handbook: Caring for Your Aging Parents Without Losing Yourself'' (Perigee, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; One writer notices the change in his parents: they move slowly, they have lost strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret.&lt;ref&gt;David Solie, ''How to Say It to Seniors: Closing the Communication Gap with Our Elders'' (Prentice Hall, 2004), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: they refuse to follow her advice, they are obsessed with the past, they avoid risk, they live at a "glacial pace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthiessen |first=Connie |url=http://www.caring.com/articles/elderly-communication |title=Elderly Communication &amp;#124; Communicating with Stubborn Elderly Parents |publisher=Caring.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers treat the perceptions of middle-age people regarding their own old age. In her ''The Denial of Aging'', Dr. Muriel R. Gillick, a [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]], accuses her contemporaries of believing that by proper exercise and diet they can avoid the scourges of old age and proceed from middle age to death.&lt;ref&gt;Gillick, ''The Denial of Aging: Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies'' (Harvard, 2007), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies find that many people in the 55–75 range can postpone morbidity by practicing healthy lifestyles. These discourses take part in a general idea of [[successful ageing]]. However, at about age 80, all people experience similar morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae, ''Physical Dimensions of Aging'' (Human Kinetics, 2004), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with healthy lifestyles, most 85+ people will undergo extended "frailty and disability".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jacoby, ''Never Say Die: The Myth and Marketing of the New Old Age'' (Pantheon, 2011), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from an old-age perspective===
Early old age is a pleasant time; children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people are also willing to get involved in community and [[Activist ageing|activist organizations]] to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old (old age in the real meaning of the term&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;) tend to be negative.

{{illm|Georges Minois|WD=Q921484}} writes that the first man to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;O Sovereign my Lord!  Oldness has come; old age has descended. Feebleness has arrived; dotage is here anew. The heart sleeps wearily every day.&lt;br/&gt; The eyes are weak, the ears are deaf, the strength is disappearing because of weariness of the heart and the mouth is silent and cannot speak.&lt;br/&gt; The heart is forgetful and cannot recall yesterday. The bone suffers old age. Good is become evil. All taste is gone. What old age does to men is evil in every respect.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989) Minois, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minois comments that the scribe's "cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age" and "expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian B. Rubin|Lillian Rubin]], active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book ''60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America'' with "getting old sucks. It always has, it always will." Dr. Rubin contrasts the "real old age" with the "rosy pictures" painted by middle-age writers.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian B. Rubin, ''60 on Up: The Truth About Aging in America'' (Beacon, 2007), 1, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing at the age of 87, Mary C. Morrison delineates the heroism required by old age: to live through the disintegration of one's own body or that of someone you love. Morrison concludes, "old age is not for the fainthearted."&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Morrison, ''Let Evening Come'' (1998), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Life Beyond 85 Years'', the 150 interviewees had to cope with physical and mental debilitation and with losses of loved ones. One interviewee described living in old age as "pure hell".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 7–8, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from society's perspective===
Based on his survey of old age in history, [[:fr:Georges Minois|Georges Minois]] concludes that "it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age." In Western thought, "old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death." Furthermore, death is often preferred over "decrepitude, because death means deliverance".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The problem of the ambiguity of old age has . . . been with us since the stage of primitive society; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of "decline and decrepitude".&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beauty and strength" were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable "great mysteries" along with evil, pain, and suffering. "Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval and Renaissance periods depicted old age as "cruel or weak".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical periods reveal a mixed picture of the "position and status" of old people, but there has never been a "golden age of aging".&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have disproved the popular belief that in the past old people were venerated by society and cared for by their families.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration for and antagonism toward the aged have coexisted in complex relationships throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"/&gt;

In ancient times, although some strong and healthy people lived until they were over 70 most died before they were 50. The general understanding is that those who lived into their 40's were treated with respect and awe. In contrast, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or in extreme cases killed.&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuqFh1Ff3rgC&amp;dq=ancient%20%20old%20age%20Most%20people%20died%20before%20they%20were%20%2050&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Oxford Handbook of Retirement|first=Mo|last=Wang|date=8 November 2012|publisher=OUP USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; People were defined as "old" because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] did not like old people." Their youth rebelled against the old, driving them off or killing them.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was skeptical of the gods, [[Aristotle]] concurred in the dislike of old people. In his ''Ethics'', he wrote that "old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century Utopians, [[Thomas More]] and [[Antonio de Guevara]], allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 277–278, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Thomas More, on the island of [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]], when people are so old as to have "out-lived themselves" and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that "they shall be happy after death." If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/Utopia_T.pdf|title=Utopia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio de Guevara]]'s utopian nation "had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years". At that age, they practiced self-immolation. Rather than condemn the practice, Bishop Guevara called it a "golden world" in which people "have overcome the natural appetite to desire to live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002444985 |title=The diall of princes: by Don Anthony of Guevara: tr. by Sir Thomas ... – Full View &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library |publisher=Babel.hathitrust.org |date=2012-08-18 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Modern period, the "cultural status" of old people has declined in many cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Joan Erikson]] observed that "aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame."&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on age-related attitudes consistently finds that negative attitudes exceed positive attitudes toward old people because of their looks and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Birren and K Warner Schaie, eds., ''Handbook of the Psychology of Aging'' (Academic, 2011), 253.&lt;/ref&gt; In his study ''Aging and Old Age'', Posner discovers "resentment and disdain of older people" in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University's [[implicit-association test]] measures implicit "attitudes and beliefs" about Young vis a vis Old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html |title=ProjectImplicit |publisher=Implicit.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'', a book about the test, reports that 80% of Americans have an "automatic preference for the young over old" and that attitude is true worldwide. The young are "consistent in their negative attitude" toward the old.&lt;ref&gt;Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald, ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'' (Random House, 2013), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ageism'' documents that Americans generally have "little tolerance for older persons and very few reservations about harboring negative attitudes" about them.&lt;ref&gt;Todd D. Nelson, ed, ''Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons'' (Bradford, 2004), ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its prevalence, [[ageism]] is seldom the subject of public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Judith E Phillips and others, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (Sage, 2010), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a documentary film called ''[[The Age of Love (2014 film)|The Age of Love]]'' used humor and poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70- to 90-year-olds, and discovered how the search for romance changes; or does not change; from a [[childhood sweetheart]] to older age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/02/documentary-tracks-seniors-in-search-of-love/ |title=Documentary tracks seniors in search of love |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old age from simulated perspective===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that "there is one form of experience that belongs only to those that are old – that of old age itself."&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Coming of Age'', trans by Patrick O'Brian (Norton, 1996), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, simulations of old age attempt to help younger people gain some understanding.

Texas A&amp;M University offers a plan for an "Aging Simulation" workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension, "Aging Simulation: Sensitizing People to the Process of Aging" online at
http://fcs.tamu.edu/files/2015/06/aging-simulation.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop is adapted from ''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging: The In-Service Educator's Guide'' by Marvin Ernst and Herbert Shore, Dallas Geriatric Research Institute, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the simulations follow:
:* Sight: Wearing swimmer's goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision, 
:* Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking. 
:* Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt.
:* Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid.
:* Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute conducts Xtreme Aging workshops, as depicted in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/us/03aging.html|title=Simulating Age 85, With Lessons on Offering Care|date=3 August 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A condensed version was presented on

On set #1, write your 5 most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your 5 most valued possessions; on set #3, write your 5 most loved people. Then "lose" them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all as happens in old age.

Most people in the age range of 60–80 (the years of retirement and early old age), enjoy rich possibilities for a full life, but the condition of [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]] distinguished by "bodily failure" and greater dependence becomes increasingly common after that.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"&gt;Tor Inge Romoren, ''Last Years of Long Lives: The Larvik Study'' (Routledge, 2003), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2011 shows that injury was the most common reason for hospitalization among patients aged 65+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Weiss AJ, Barrett ML, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections of U.S. Hospital Costs by Payer, 2003–2013 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #176 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = July 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb176-Hospital-Cost-Projections-by-Age-2013.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerontology|Gerontologists]] note the lack of research regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, they add that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), xxi, 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] proposed a general definition of frailty as "a physical state of increased vulnerability to stressors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stressors |title=Stressors &amp;#124; definition of stressors by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that results from decreased reserves and disregulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/dysregulation |title=Dysregulation Medical Definition &amp;#124; Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in multiple physiological systems".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence of frailty===
Frailty is a common condition in later old age 
but different definitions of frailty produce diverse assessments of prevalence. One study placed the incidence of frailty for ages 65+ at 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04054.x|pmid=22881367|title=Prevalence of Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Persons: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1487–92|year=2012|last1=Collard|first1=Rose M.|last2=Boter|first2=Han|last3=Schoevers|first3=Robert A.|last4=Oude Voshaar|first4=Richard C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study placed the incidence of frailty in age 65+ population at 22% for women and 15% for men.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian study illustrated how frailty increases with age and calculated the prevalence for 65+ as 22.4% and for 85+ as 43.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741960 |title=Prevalence of Frailty Increases Throughout Adulthood |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worldwide study of "patterns of frailty" based on data from 20 nations found (a) a consistent correlation between frailty and age, (b) a higher frequency among women, and (c) more frailty in wealthier nations where greater support and medical care increases longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075847|pmid=24204581|title=Patterns of Frailty in Older Adults: Comparing Results from Higher and Lower Income Countries Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE)|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e75847|year=2013|last1=Harttgen|first1=Kenneth|last2=Kowal|first2=Paul|last3=Strulik|first3=Holger|last4=Chatterji|first4=Somnath|last5=Vollmer|first5=Sebastian|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875847H|pmc=3812225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the "fourth age" or "old age in the real meaning of the term". Similarly, the "Berlin Aging Study" rated over-all functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80–90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90–100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;

In the United States, the 85+ age group is the fastest growing, a group that is almost sure to face the "inevitable decrepitude" of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; (Frailty and decrepitude are synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.yourdictionary.com/frailty |title=Another word for frailty &amp;#124; Synonyms for frailty |publisher=Thesaurus.yourdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Markers of frailty===
Three unique markers of frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of any notion of invincibility, (b) loss of ability to do things essential to one's care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nortin-M.-Hadler/e/B001ITYO36 |title=Nortin M. Hadler: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age survivors on-average deteriorate from agility in their 65–80s to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems coupled with increased dependency in the [[Basic activities of daily living|basic activities of daily living (ADLs)]] required for personal care add emotional problems: depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick, ''Lifelines: Living Longer, Growing Frail, Taking Heart'' (Norton, 2001), x, xv–xvi, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of "complex issues," distinct but "causally interconnected," that often include "comorbid diseases",&lt;ref&gt;"diseases in addition to the primary disease"&lt;/ref&gt; progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions of frail people===
Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of  ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85-year-olds and older, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have at least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) "successful adaptation" to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over-85s does not harm their well-being; they "welcome increased detachment". Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their "cognitive and emotional processes" and reconstituted their "self–representation".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care and costs===
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The hand of an elderly person]]
Frail people require a high level of care. Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death" for years. This added time costs many frail people "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of emergency department visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006–2011 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title =  Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Steiner CA, Barett ML, Weiss AJ, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections in Hospital Stays for Adults With Multiple Chronic Conditions, 2003–2014 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #183 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = November 2014 | url =https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb183-Hospitalizations-Multiple-Chronic-Conditions-Projections-2014.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These final years are also costly in economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue 1994, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 17–18, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; One out of every four Medicare dollars is spent on the frail in their last year of life . . . in attempts to postpone death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Wang |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/11/pf/end-of-life-care-duplicate-2.moneymag/ |title=Cutting the High Cost of End-of-Life Care &amp;#124; TIME |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical treatments in the final days are not only economically costly, they are often unnecessary, even harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Wang, "Cutting the high cost of end-of-life care" (CNNMoney, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Nortin Hadler, M.D. warns against the tendency to medicalize and overtreat the frail.&lt;ref&gt;Nortin M. Hadler, ''Rethinking Aging: Growing Old and Living Well in an Overtreated Society'' (University of North Carolina, 2011) 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age'', Michael R. Gillick M.D. argues that appropriate medical treatment for the frail is not the same as for the robust. The frail are vulnerable to "being tipped over" by any physical stress put on the system such as medical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 116, 189,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and frailty===
Old age, death, and frailty are linked because approximately half the deaths in old age are preceded by months or years of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 3, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Older Adults' Views on Death'' is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70–90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7. 
Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive palliative care if needed.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 6–7, 9, 12, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of older adults suffer multimorbidity, that is, they have three or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html |title=Multimorbidity &amp;#124; Johns Hopkins Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death," but in many cases this postponement adds "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering," a time that is costly in social, psychological, and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 18, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' found "progressive terminal decline" in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, "Living this long is pure hell."
However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die "on their feet".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of  ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' found that the more frail people were, the more "pain, suffering, and struggles" they were enduring, the more likely they were to "accept and welcome" death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunion with departed loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002) 55, 270, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religiosity in old age==
Generally speaking, old people have always been more religious than young people.&lt;ref&gt;https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/57193/Davie%20Progress%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, wide cultural variations exist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the United States, 90% of old age Hispanics view themselves as very, quite, or somewhat religious.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Research Center's study of black and white old people found that 62% of those in ages 65–74 and 70% in ages 75+ asserted that religion was "very important" to them. For all 65+ people, more women (76%) than men (53%) and more blacks (87%) than whites (63%) consider religion "very important" to them. This compares to 54% in the 30–49 age range.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"&gt;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a British 20-year longitudinal study, less than half of the old people surveyed said that religion was "very important" to them, and a quarter said they had become less religious in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010). 608.&lt;/ref&gt; The late-life rise in religiosity is stronger in Japan than in the United States, but in the Netherlands it is minimal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the practice of religion, a study of 60+ people found that 25% read the Bible every day and over 40% look at religious TV.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Pew Research found that in the age 65+ range, 75% of whites and 87% of blacks pray daily.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"/&gt;

Participation in organized religion is not a good indicator of religiosity because transportation and health problems often hinder participation.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"/&gt;

==Demographic changes==
In the industrialized countries, life expectancy and, thus, the old age population have increased consistently over the last decades.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus08.pdf#026 |title=Table 26: Life expectancy at birth, at 65 years of age, and at 75 years of age by race and sex: United States, selected years, 1900 – 2005|date= |work= |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the proportion of people aged 65 or older increased from 4% in 1900 to about 12% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-12.pdf|title=Census 2000 Brief, C2KBR/01-12, U.S.|publisher="Census Bureau"|location="Washington, DC"|accessdate=2009-03-17|last=Meyer|first=Julie|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, only about {{Nowrap|3 million}} of the nation's citizens were 65 or older (out of 76 million total American citizens). By 2000, the number of senior citizens had increased to about 35 million (of 280 million US citizens). Population experts estimate that more than {{Nowrap|50 million}} Americans—about 17 percent of the population—will be 65 or older in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/Main_Site/Data/2012_Documents/Population.aspx |title=Older Americans 2012: Key Indicators of Well-Being |publisher=Agingstats.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055028/http://agingstats.gov/main_site/data/2012_documents/population.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, it is projected that at least 400,000 Americans will be 100 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of old people is growing around the world chiefly because of the [[post–World War II baby boom]] and increases in the provision and standards of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/ |title=World Population Ageing |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, 33% of the developed world's population and almost 20% of the less developed world's population will be over 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;John Bond and others, editors, ''Ageing in Society'' (Sage, 2007 3rd ed), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html |title=Social Security: A Program and Policy History |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011|title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations|journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology|volume=1|year=2007|last1=De Grey|first1=Aubrey D.N.J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

==Psychosocial aspects==
[[File:BuddhistMonk02.jpg|thumb|upright|An elderly [[Khmer people|Khmer]] woman]]
According to [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|"Stages of Psychosocial Development"]], the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual's complete life. He characterises old age as a period of "Integrity vs. Despair", during which a person focuses on reflecting back on his life. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1968). ''Identity: Youth and Crisis''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1963). ''[[Childhood and Society]]''. (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S. &amp; Scheir, M.F. (2000). ''Perspectives on Personality''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; Coping is a very important skill needed in the aging process to move forward with life and not be 'stuck' in the past. The way a person adapts and copes, reflects his aging process on a psycho-social level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021259/http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people in their 80s and 90s, [[Joan Erikson]] added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders" and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman &amp; Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. There are two different types of people described in this stage of life.  The "young old" are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently. The "old old" are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases. This period of life is characterized as a period of "immortality vs. extinction". Immortality is the belief that your life will go on past death, some examples are an afterlife or living on through one's family. Extinction refers to feeling as if life has no purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Newman, Philip R. Newman, ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach: A Psychosocial Approach'' (Cengage Learning, 2011), Ch 13 "Later Adulthood (60–75 Years)" and Ch 14, "Elderhood (75 until death)".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of old age===
[[File:Habibaadansalat.jpg|thumb|An elderly [[Somali people|Somali]] woman]]
[[File:Walking style of an aged woman on road.jpg|thumb|An elderly woman walks down a road]]
Social theories, or concepts,&lt;ref&gt;"Theory: A conception . . . of something to be done, or of the method of doing it." ''Oxford English Dictionary Online ''. December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies.

One of the theories is the [[disengagement theory]] proposed in 1961. This theory proposes that in old age a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress.
This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 613.&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the disengagement theory, the [[activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity, even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[continuity theory]], in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Socioemotional selectivity theory]] also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy==
[[Life expectancy]] by nation at birth in the year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82. Low values indicate high death rates for infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21 |title=World Development Indicators &amp;#124; The World Bank |publisher=Wdi.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of the world women live, on average, longer than men; even so, the disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;de Blij, Harm. The power of place. Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape. [[Oxford University Press]]. London:2009. p161ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of elderly persons worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. Up to that time (and still true in underdeveloped countries), five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over-65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under 5 population. By 2013, the over-65 population had grown to equal the under 5 population. The over-65 population is projected to double the under five by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the surge in the over-65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, scientists identified the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] at an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"/&gt; However, the concept of a maximum lifespan in humans is still widely debated among the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=What's the Longest Humans Can Live? 115 Years, New Study Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/science/maximum-life-span-study.html |date=October 5, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age benefits==
German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] created the world's first comprehensive government [[social safety net]] in the 1880s, providing for old age pensions.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

In the [[Social Security (United States)|United States of America]], and the [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], 65 (UK 60 for women) was traditionally the age of retirement with full old age benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Old-Age+Benefits |title=Old-Age Benefits legal definition of Old-Age Benefits |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html |title=New state pension age: when will you retire? |publisher=This is Money |date=2016-03-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the age at which a United States citizen became eligible for full Social Security benefits began to increase gradually, and will continue to do so until it reaches 67 in 2027. Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66.&lt;ref name="socialsecurity.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/retirechart.htm |title=Age To Receive Full Social Security Retirement Benefits|date= |work= |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social SecurityAdministration]]|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that."&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"/&gt;

Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly persons from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schulz and Robert H. Binstock, Aging Nation: The Economics and Politics of Growing Older in America (Johns Hopkins, 2008). 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = U.S. spending|date = April 19, 1990|work = [[Rolling Stone]]|access-date = |via = |page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from "needy" and "worthy" to "powerful" and "greedy," old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Katz Olson, ''The Not-so-golden Years: Caregiving, the Frail Elderly, and the Long-term Care Establishment'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Assistance: devices and personal==
[[File:Nursing home.JPG|thumb|Old man at a [[nursing home]] in [[Norway]]]]
In the United States in 2008, 11 million people aged 65+ lived alone: 5 million or 22% of ages 65–74, 4 million or 34% of ages 75–84, and 2 million or 41% of ages 85+.

Many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves [[activities of daily living]] (ADL). Able Data&lt;ref&gt;Maintained for the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the U.S. Dept. of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=19327&amp;ksectionid=19327 |title=Welcome to |publisher=AbleData |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |title=Elderly Health Service |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831094556/http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish study found that at age 76, 46% of the subjects used assistive devices. When they reached age 86, 69% used them. The subjects were ambivalent regarding the use of the assistive devices: as "enablers" or as "disablers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of assistive devices – a reality full of contradictions in elderly persons' everyday life|first1=Greta|last1=Häggblom-Kronlöf|first2=Ulla|last2=Sonn|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=6|pages=335–345|doi=10.1080/17483100701701672|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them. Those who see them as symbols of disability reject them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemods.org/resources/pages/accept.shtml |title=Home Modifications |publisher=Homemods.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[organization]]s like [[Love for the Elderly]] aim to combat such age-related prejudice by educating the public about the importance of appreciating growing older, while also providing services of kindness to elders in senior homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lovefortheelderly.org/|title=Love for the Elderly|website=Love for the Elderly|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8.5 million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired [[basic activities of daily living]] required for personal care or impaired [[instrumental activities of daily living]] (IADL) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many options for such long term care to those who require it. There is [[home care]] in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in [[senior centers]]. A third option is [[assisted living]] where 24-hour round-the-clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a [[nursing home]] which provides professional nursing care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44363-LTC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''organizational chart''' (often called '''organization chart''', '''org chart''', '''organigram(me)''', or '''organogram''') is a [[diagram]] that shows the [[organizational structure|structure]] of an [[organization]] and the relationships and relative ranks of its parts and positions/jobs. The term is also used for similar diagrams, for example ones showing the different elements of a field of knowledge or a group of languages.

==Overview==
The organization chart is a diagram showing graphically the relation of one official to another, or others, of a company. It is also used to show the relation of one department to another, or others, or of one function of an organization to another, or others. This chart is valuable in that it enables one to visualize a complete organization, by means of the picture it presents.&lt;ref name="HB 1922"&gt;Allan Cecil Haskell, Joseph G. Breaznell (1922) ''[https://archive.org/stream/graphicchartsin00breagoog#page/n90 Graphic charts in business: how to make and use them]''. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A company's organizational chart typically illustrates relations between people within an organization. Such relations might include managers to sub-workers, directors to managing directors, chief executive officer to various departments, and so forth. When an organization chart grows too large it can be split into smaller charts for separate departments within the organization. The different types of organization charts include:
* [[Hierarchical organization|Hierarchical]]
* [[Matrix management|Matrix]]
* [[Flat organization|Flat]] (also known as [[Horizontal organization|Horizontal]])

There is no accepted form for making organization charts other than putting the principal official, department or function first, or at the head of the sheet, and the others below, in the order of their rank. The titles of officials and sometimes their names are enclosed in boxes or circles. Lines are generally drawn from one box or circle to another to show the relation of one official or department to the others.&lt;ref name="HB 1922"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tabulating Machine Co Organization Chart.jpg|thumb|Organization chart of Tabulating Machine Co., 1917]]
The Scottish-American engineer [[Daniel McCallum]]  (1815–1878) is credited for creating the first organizational charts of American business&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.]] (1962). ''Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the American Industrial Enterprise''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; around 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Burton S. Kaliski (2001). ''Encyclopedia of business and finance''. p.669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For years people believed no copy of this chart survived, see for example: Sidney Pollard, Richard S. Tedlow (2002) ''Economic History''. p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This chart was drawn by [[George Holt Henshaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Rosenthal (2012) "[http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/big_data_in_the_age_of_the_telegraph Big data in the age of the telegraph]" in McKinsey Quarterly, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "organization chart" came into use in the early twentieth century. In 1914 [[Willard C. Brinton|Brinton]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Brinton, Willard Cope]]. ''Graphic methods for presenting facts''. The Engineering magazine company, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; declared "organization charts are not nearly so widely used as they should be. As organization charts are an excellent example of the division of a total into its components, a number of examples are given here in the hope that the presentation of organization charts in convenient form will lead to their more widespread use." In those years industrial engineers promoted the use of organization charts.

In the 1920s a survey revealed that organizational charts were still not common among ordinary business concerns, but they were beginning to find their way into administrative and business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Hamilton institute]] (1923) ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35128001192606 Organization charts].'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "organigram" originated in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Stevenson (2010) ''Oxford Dictionary of English''. p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
There are several limitations of organizational charts:
* If updated manually, organizational charts can very quickly become out-of-date, especially in large organizations that change their staff regularly.
* They only show "formal relationships" and tell nothing of the pattern of human (social) relationships which develop. They also often do not show horizontal relationships.
* They provide little information about the managerial style adopted (e.g. "[[autocratic]]", "[[democracy|democratic]]" or an intermediate style).
* In some cases, an [[organigraph]] may be more appropriate, particularly if one wants to show non-linear, non-hierarchical relationships in an organization.
* They often do not include customers.

==Examples==
[[Image:Organizational chart.svg|thumb|right|Sample military chart]]
The example on the right shows a simple hierarchical organizational chart.

An example of a "line relationship" (or [[chain of command]] in military relationships) in this chart would be between the general and the two colonels - the colonels are directly responsible to the general.

An example of a "lateral relationship" in this chart would be between "Captain A", and "Captain B" who both work on level and both report to the "Colonel B".

Various shapes such as rectangles, squares, triangles, circles can be used to indicate different roles. Color can be used both for shape borders and connection lines to indicate differences in authority and responsibility, and possibly formal, advisory and informal links between people. A department or position yet to be created or currently vacant might be shown as a shape with a dotted outline. Importance of the position may be shown both with a change in size of the shape in addition to its vertical placement on the chart.

'''Pen pals''' (or '''penpals''', '''pen-pals''', '''penfriends''' or '''pen friends''') are [[people]] who regularly write to each other, particularly via [[postal mail]].

==Purposes==
A penpal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a [[foreign language]], to improve [[literacy]], to learn more about other countries and life-styles, and to make friendships. As with any friendships in life, some people remain penpals for only a short time, while others continue to exchange letters and presents for life. Some penpals eventually arrange to meet face to face; sometimes leading to serious relationships, or even [[marriage]].

Penpals come in all ages, nationalities, cultures, languages and interests. Pals may seek new penfriends based on their own age group, a specific occupation, hobby, or select someone totally different from them to gain knowledge about the world around them.

A modern variation on the traditional penpal arrangement is to have a keypal / epal and exchange [[email]] addresses as well as or instead of paper letters. This has the advantage of saving money and being more immediate, allowing many messages to be exchanged in a short period of time. The disadvantage is that the communication can be very ephemeral if the email messages are not routinely saved. Many people prefer to receive paper letters, gaining the satisfaction of seeing their name carefully printed on a thick envelope in the letterbox.  Using [[postal mail]], it is possible to trade coupons, swap slips, [[postcard]]s, [[postage stamp|stamps]] and anything else light and flat enough to fit inside an envelope, often called "tuck-ins". Many penpallers like to trade sheets of stickers, notecards and stationery sets.

While the expansion of the [[Internet]] has reduced the number of traditional penpals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6133903/50-things-that-are-being-killed-by-the-internet.html|title=50 things that are being killed by the internet|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; penpal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Some people are looking for romantic interests, while others just want to find friends. It seems, on the internet, that the term "pen pals" defines those looking to correspond with others that live in a different place, where pen pals originated via postal mail correspondences and has evolved to mean something more. Penpals also make and pass around [[friendship book]]s, slams and crams. Another term used to describe pen pal is the word penfriend.

In recent years, pen pal correspondence with prison inmates has gained acceptance on the Internet.

==Organizations==
Many penpals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.

Organizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.

While the traditional [[snail mail]] pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's [[communication]] gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow [[prisoners]] to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the [[United States]] and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.

==In popular culture==
The [[Australia]]n author [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] wrote a [[memoir]] entitled ''Foreign Correspondence'' (1997) about her childhood, which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.

In the 1970s, syndicated children's television program ''[[Big Blue Marble]]'' often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.

On another children's TV show, ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', [[Pee-wee Herman]] would often receive pen pal letters.

At the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964/1965 World's Fair]] in New York, the [[Parker Pen]] pavilion provided a computer pen pal matching service. This service was officially terminated by Parker Pen in 1967. This service did not work in conjunction with any other pen friend clubs. The computer system and database used for this service were not sold, taken over, or continued in any way.

In the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen  but after several literally "botched" attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his "pencil-pal", with his first letter to his "pencil-pal" explaining the reason for the name change.

The 1983 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Romance (1983 film)|Romance]]'' is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals. The 1999 Bollywood film ''[[Sirf Tum]]'' has a similar storyline.

The 1998 film ''[[You've Got Mail (film)|You've Got Mail]]'' is a romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal Email courtship who are unaware that they are also business rivals.

The 2004 action-drama film ''[[Out of Reach (film)|Out of Reach]]'' is about a pen pal relationship  between a Vietnam veteran and a 13-year-old orphaned girl from Poland. When the letters suddenly stop coming, he heads to Poland to find out the reason.

The 2009 [[claymation]] film ''[[Mary and Max]]'' is about the pen pal relationship between an American man and an Australian girl.

The 2012 novel ''[[Penpal (novel)|Penpal]]'' takes a dark twist to this innocent idea by the plot revolving around the protagonist being stalked ever since sending his letter.

The 2015 musical album ''Gold'' is a collaboration between musicians [[Jetty Rae]] and [[Heath McNease]] under the moniker "Pen Pals".

'''Pristine Sources''' is a software management concept coined by the developers of the short-lived Bogus Linux distribution and popularized by [[Marc Ewing]], co-founder of [[Red Hat|Red Hat Inc]], after he adopted it and [[RPM Package Manager]] as a development philosophy for [[Red Hat Linux]].  It was the concept that enabled Red Hat to build Linux distributions faster and more reliably than had been possible previously.  Briefly, the problem with building an operating systems out of the myriad pieces of open source (or free software) components available from teams across the Internet was that there were many of these components and they all upgraded on different schedules at different times.  Ewing's insight was to recognize that he could not take responsibility for these components.  He and Erik Troan, wanted to build a software package management system, [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]], that allowed the team at Red Hat to avoid changing any of the source code of the software components they needed to use to build their Red Hat Linux operating system.

It is best summed up by Ewing's explanation in a mid-1990's Red Hat manual:

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

In [[criminology]], '''social control theory''' proposes that exploiting the process of [[socialization]] and [[Social learning theory|social learning]] builds [[self-control]] and reduces the inclination to indulge in behavior recognized as antisocial. It derives from [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] theories of crime and was developed by Ivan Nye (1958), who proposed that there were four types of control:
* Direct: by which [[punishment]] is threatened or applied for wrongful behavior, and compliance is rewarded by parents, family, and [[authority]] figures.
* Internal: by which a youth refrains from delinquency through the conscience or [[superego]].
* Indirect: by [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with those who influence behavior, say because his or her delinquent act might cause pain and disappointment to parents and others with whom he or she has close relationships.
* Control through needs satisfaction, i.e. if all an individual's needs are met, there is no point in criminal activity.

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Social control theory proposes that people's relationships, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs encourage them not to break the law. Thus, if moral codes are internalized and individuals are tied into and have a stake in their wider community, they will voluntarily limit their propensity to commit deviant acts. The theory seeks to understand the ways in which it is possible to reduce the likelihood of criminality developing in individuals. It does not consider motivational issues, simply stating that human beings may choose to engage in a wide range of activities, unless the range is limited by the processes of socialization and social learning. The theory derives from a [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] view of human nature as represented in [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], i.e. that all choices are constrained by implicit [[social contract]]s, agreements and arrangements among people. Thus, [[morality]] is created in the construction of social order, assigning costs and consequences to certain choices and defining some as evil, immoral and/or illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/command/detail?sid=2e47adb5-a167-49da-9d88-1fae2da5d377%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=16&amp;hid=101|title = Role-Taking And Recidivism: A Test Of Differential Social Control Theory|date = 2011|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = JQ: Justice Quarterly 28.5|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Ngo|first = Fawn T|pages = 667–697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
===Edward A. Ross===
The earliest form of the theory (or at least the earliest recorded) was proposed by [[Edward Alsworth Ross|Edward A. Ross]] in 1901, who defined social control as "the more that the smooth running of social machinery implies the frequent breaking off or turning aside of individual activities, the more perfect is the social order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/socialcontrolas00rossgoog|title=Social control; a survey of the foundations of order |date=1901|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the more perfect that the social order is, the more social control is achieved.  His best-known work, Social Control (1901), deals with the reasons for and the means of societal limitation of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Social-Control-by-Ross |title=Social Control - Work by Ross |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert J. Reiss===
Another early form of the theory was proposed by Reiss (1951: 196) who defined delinquency as, "...behavior consequent to the failure of personal and social controls."  Personal control was defined as, "...the ability of the individual to refrain from meeting needs in ways which conflict with the norms and rules of the community" while social control was, "...the ability of social groups or institutions to make norms or rules effective." Reiss' version did not specify the sources of such "abilities" nor the specific control mechanisms leading to conformity, but he did assert that the failure of primary groups such as the family to provide reinforcement for non-delinquent roles and values was crucial to the explanation of delinquency.
Reiss also wrote extensively on the application of his work to [[criminology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T7rH13P3NKMC&amp;pg=PA785&amp;lpg=PA785&amp;dq=Reiss+criminology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1w9eEy6NVI&amp;sig=iFsZtmL6xYGy8fVAYq9kCc7IYDQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMIr6uL98S_xwIVR30aCh3E1A7s#v=onepage&amp;q=Reiss%20criminology&amp;f=false Albert J Reiss] in ''Encyclopedia of Criminological Theory vol I'' (2010) FT Cullen, P Wilcox&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackson Toby===
Jackson Toby (1957),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toby|first1=Jackson|title=Social Disorganization and Stake in Conformity: Complementary Factors in the Predatory Behavior of Hoodlums|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|date=1957|volume=48|issue=1|pages=12–17|doi=10.2307/1140161|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4566&amp;context=jclc|ref=Stake in Conformity}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that "the uncommitted adolescent is a candidate for gang socialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karachi|first1=Larry|last2=Toby|first2=Jackson|title=The Uncommitted Adolescent: Candidate for Gang Socialization|journal=Sociological Inquiry|date=April 1962|volume=32|issue=2|pages=203–215|doi=10.1111/j.1475-682X.1962.tb00541.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging "gang socialization" as part of the causal, motivational dynamic leading to delinquency, but introduced the concept of ''stakes in conformity'' to explain "candidacy" for such learning experiences. He believed that all could be tempted into delinquency, but most refused because they considered that they had too much to lose. The young who had few stakes or investments in conformity were more likely to be drawn into gang activity. The notion of ''stakes in conformity'' fits very well with concepts invoked in later versions of social control theory.

===F. Ivan Nye===
Ivan Nye (1958)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nye|first1=Francis Ivan|title=Family relationships and delinquent behavior|date=1975|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=9780837169675|edition=2. repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only elaborated a social control theory of delinquency, but specified ways to "operationalize" (measure) control mechanisms and related them to self-reports of delinquent behavior. He formulated the theory after interviewing 780 young people in Washington State. The sample was criticized because it did not represent any urban environments, and those selected might have been more apt to describe their families unfavorably. Some were concerned that criminal activity was only mentioned in two of the questions, so the extrapolations to crime in general were considered unsafe. Like Reiss, he focused on the family as a source of control. Moreover, Nye specified three different types of control:
*direct control = punishments and rewards
*indirect control = affectionate identification with non-criminals; and
*internal control = conscience or sense of guilt.
Youth may be directly controlled through constraints imposed by parents, limiting the opportunity for delinquency, as well as through parental rewards and punishments. However, they may be constrained when free from direct control by their anticipation of parental disapproval (indirect control), or through the development of a conscience, an internal constraint on behavior. The focus on the family as a source of control was in marked contrast to the emphasis on economic circumstances as a source of criminogenic motivation at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2e47adb5-a167-49da-9d88-1fae2da5d377%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=101|title = Family Theory 20 Years Later|date = 1980|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Contemporary Sociology 9.2|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Heiss|first = Jerold|pages = 201–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he acknowledged motivational forces by stating that, "...some delinquent behavior results from a combination of positive learning and weak and ineffective social control" (1958: 4), he adopted a control-theory position when he proposed that, "...most delinquent behavior is the result of insufficient social control..."

===Walter Reckless===
[[Walter Reckless]] (1961)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reckless|first1=Walter C.|title=A New Theory of Deliquency and Crime|journal=Federal Probation|date=December 1961|volume=25|issue=4|pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed [[containment]] theory by focusing on a youth's self-conception or self-image of being a good person as an insulator against peer pressure to engage in delinquency.
*inner containment = positive sense of self;
*outer containment = supervision and discipline.
This inner containment through self-images is developed within the family and is essentially formed by about the age of twelve. Outer containment was a reflection of strong social relationships with teachers and other sources of conventional socialization within the neighborhood. The basic proposition is there are "pushes" and "pulls" that will produce delinquent behavior unless they are counteracted by containment. The motivations to deviate as pushes are:
*discontent with living conditions and family conflicts;
*aggressiveness and hostility, perhaps due to biological factors; and
*frustration and boredom, say arising from membership of a minority group or through lack of opportunities to advance in school or find employment;
and the pulls are:
*delinquent peers, and
*delinquent subcultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=34502fec-0fcb-460a-a2e2-b72973264d7f%40sessionmgr110&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=101|title = The Impact Of Self Esteem, Family Rituals, Religiosity, And Participation In Conforming Activities Upon Delinquency: A Comparison Of Young Adults In Turkey And The United States|date = 2011|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Journal of Comparative Family Studies |volume=42 |issue=1|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Roberts|first = Joanne|last2 = Gunes|first2 = Ismail Dincer|pages = 49–76|last3 = Seward|first3 = Rudy Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Matza===
An analysis of 'neutralization' was developed by Sykes and Matza (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=Gresham M.|last2=Matza|first2=David|title=Techniques of Neutralization: A Theory of Delinquency|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=664–670|doi=10.2307/2089195|jstor=2089195}}&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that there was little difference between delinquents and non-delinquents, with delinquents engaging in non-delinquent behavior most of the time. They also asserted that most delinquents eventually opt out of the delinquent lifestyle as they grow older, suggesting that there is a basic code of morality in place but that the young are able to deviate by using techniques of neutralization, i.e. they can temporarily suspend the applicability of norms by developing attitudes "favorable to deviant behavior". The five common techniques were:
*denial of responsibility (I couldn't help myself)
*denial of injury (nobody got hurt)
*denial of victim (they had it coming)
*condemnation of the condemners (what right do they have to criticize me?)
*appeal to higher loyalties (I did it for someone else).
Later Matza (1964) developed his theory of "drift" which proposed that people used neutralization to drift in and out of conventional behaviour, taking a temporary break from moral restraints. Matza based his "drift" theory upon four observations which were:
*Delinquents express guilt over their criminal acts
*Delinquents often respect law-abiding individuals
*A line is drawn between those they can victimize and those they can not
*Delinquents are not immune to the demands of conforming&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://resolver.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/openurl?sid=EBSCO%3aa9h&amp;genre=article&amp;issn=00380385&amp;ISBN=&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=3&amp;date=19700901&amp;spage=403&amp;pages=403-404&amp;title=Sociology&amp;atitle=Becoming+Deviant+(Book).&amp;aulast=Box%2c+Steven&amp;id=DOI%3a&amp;site=ftf-live|title = Becoming Deviant (Book)|date = 1970|accessdate = 24 Oct 2015|website = Sociology 4.3|publisher = Academic Search Complete|last = Box|first = Steven|pages = 403–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this theory of drift has not been widely supported by empirical tests, it remains a key idea in criminology despite not answering why some conform and others don't.

===Travis Hirschi===
[[Travis Hirschi]] adopted Toby's concept of an investment in conventionality or "stake in conformity". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued that a person was less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.

==== The general theory of crime ====
{{Main|Self-control theory of crime}}
Hirschi has since moved away from his bonding theory, and in co-operation with [[Michael R. Gottfredson]], developed a general theory or "self-control theory" in 1990. Akers (1991) argued that a major weakness of this new theory was that Gottfredson and Hirschi did not define self-control and the tendency toward criminal behavior separately. By not deliberately operationalizing self-control traits and criminal behavior or criminal acts individually, it suggests that the concepts of low self-control and propensity for criminal behavior are the same. Hirschi and Gottfredson (1993) rebutted Akers argument by suggesting it was actually an indication of the consistency of general theory. That is, the theory is internally consistent by conceptualizing crime and deriving from that a concept of the offender's traits. The research community remains divided on whether the general theory is sustainable but there is emerging confirmation of some of its predictions (e.g. LaGrange &amp; Silverman: 1999)

===Jack P. Gibbs===
[[Jack Gibbs|Gibbs]] (1989)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibbs|first1=Jack P.|title=Control : sociology's central notion|date=1989|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0252015908}}&lt;/ref&gt; has redefined social control and applied it to develop a control theory of [[homicide]]. Any attempt to get an individual to do or refrain from doing something can be considered an attempt at control. To qualify as 'social' control, such attempts must involve three parties. One or more individuals intends to manipulate the behavior of another by or through a third party. Gibbs' third party can be an actual person or a reference to "society", "expectations" or "norms". For example, if one party attempts to influence another by threatening to refer the matter to a third party assumed to have authority, this is referential social control. If one party attempts to control another by punishing a third (e.g. general deterrence), it is a form of vicarious social control. The presence of the third party distinguishes social control from mere external behavioral control, simple interpersonal responses, or issuing orders for someone to do something. This definition clearly distinguishes social control from mere "reactions to deviance" and from deviant behavior itself.

Gibbs argues that "Homicide can be described either as control or as resulting from control failure" (1989: 35), and proposes that the homicide rate is a function not just of the sheer volume of disputes, but also of the frequency of recourse to a third party for peaceful dispute settlement (p37). When one person fails to control the actions of another through the third party, murder represents another violent attempt at direct control. People resort to self-help when forms of social control are unavailable or fail. Gibbs is critical of Hirschi's Social Control Theory because it merely assumes that social relationships, personal investments and beliefs that discourage delinquency are social controls (which is one reason why Hirschi's theory is often referred to as a Social Bond Theory).

==Criticism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
Much of the early research on social control theory is based on self-reporting studies. Critics of self-report data note that there may be various motives for disclosing information, and that questions may be interpreted differently by individual participants. Nevertheless, many of the conclusions are intuitively convincing, e.g. that individuals will not engage in crime if they think that this will sacrifice the affection or respect of significant others, or cause them to lose employment or their autonomy if they face [[imprisonment]]. Davies (1994 and 2004), reports that in late-nineteenth century Britain, crime rates fell dramatically, as did drug and alcohol abuse, and illegitimacy became less common. All of these indexes of deviance were fairly steady between World War I and 1955. After 1955, they all rose to create a U-curve of deviance, over the period from 1847 to 1997. He attributes the initial shift to adoption of a culture in which the assumptions of [[Protestant]] Christianity were taken for granted. Everyone at the time believed—at least somewhat—in a moral code of helping others. This belief was rooted in religion. The same social norms for the defense of the person and property that informed the law before 1955 remain the policy norms. Furthermore, the concept that people are uncontrollable and may offend against those norms in social interactions, cannot be explained by simply counting how many people practice the [[golden rule]] (see the general discussion in Braithwaite: 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braithwaite|first1=John|title=Crime, shame and reintegration|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521356688|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Sous rature''''' is a strategic philosophical device originally developed by [[Martin Heidegger]]. Usually translated as 'under erasure', it involves the crossing out of a word within a text, but allowing it to remain legible and in place. Used extensively by [[Jacques Derrida]], it signifies that a word is "inadequate yet necessary";&lt;ref&gt;Madan Sarup, ''An Introductory Guide to Post-Structuralism and Postmodernism'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; that a particular [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]] is not wholly suitable for the concept it represents, but must be used as the constraints of our language offer nothing better.

In the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], ''sous rature'' has been described as the typographical expression that seeks to identify sites within texts where key terms and concepts may be paradoxical or self-undermining, rendering their meaning undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, V.E. &amp; Winquist, C.E. 2001, Encyclopaedia of Postmodernism, Taylor &amp; Francis, London, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Belsey|Belsey C]] 2001, ''Critical Practice'' 2nd ed., Routledge, London, p116&lt;/ref&gt; To extend this notion, deconstruction and the practice of ''sous rature'' also seek to demonstrate that meaning is derived from difference, not by reference to a pre-existing notion or freestanding idea.&lt;ref&gt;Belsey, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Sous rature'' as a literary practice originated in the works of German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976). The practice of placing words or terms under erasure first appeared in Heidegger's work ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', Heidegger's lecture course of 1929/30. And subsequently in a letter he penned to [[Ernst Jünger]] in 1956 titled "Zur Seinsfrage" (The Question of Being), in which Heidegger seeks to define [[nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Spivak, GC]] 1997, “Translator’s Preface” in Derrida, J. 1967, ''Of Grammatology'', Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the letter, Heidegger also begins to speculate about the problematic nature of defining anything, let alone words.  In particular, the meaning of the term ‘Being’ is contested and Heidegger crosses out the word, but lets both the deletion and the word remain. “Since the word is inaccurate, it is crossed out. Since it is necessary, it remains legible.”&lt;ref&gt;Spivak, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Heideggerian model, erasure expressed the problem of presence and absence of meaning in language. Heidegger was concerned with trying to return the absent meaning to the present meaning and the placing of a word or term under erasure “simultaneously recognised and questioned the term’s meaning and accepted use”.&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 113"&gt;Taylor, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) adopted this technique and further explored the implications of Heidegger's erasure and its application in the wider setting of deconstructive literary theory. Derrida extended the problem of presence and absence to include the notion that erasure does not mark a lost presence, rather the potential impossibility of presence altogether - in other words, the potential impossibility of univocity of meaning ever having been attached to the word or term in the first place. Ultimately, Derrida argued, it was not just the particular signs that were placed under erasure, but the whole system of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]].&lt;ref name="Taylor, p. 113"/&gt;

{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
{{other uses2|Steady state}}

A '''steady-state economy''' is an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time. The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].

Since the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xi-xvi}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|55f}}

The world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or population overshoot. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken — and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|148–155}}

A steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]].

An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].

== Definition and vision ==
Herman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy — something desirable by itself — maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14–19}}

Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

In the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|84}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|83}}

{{See also |Planetary boundaries |Anthropocene |List of environmental issues |Societal collapse }}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright| Like any other planet, earth is finite]]

The world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt; According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] — that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.&lt;ref name=gfn01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jw01/&gt; In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.&lt;ref name=welanth/&gt; The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Overpopulation
World population is [[Human overpopulation #Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population #Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Pollution and global warming
Air pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many — if not all — parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost #Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, a so-called [[Climate state #Hothouse|'Hothouse climate state']] may be the end result in the future.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Depletion of non-renewable minerals
Non-renewable [[Mineral resource classification|mineral reserves]] are currently extracted at high and [[Sustainable development#Insubstantial stretching of the term|unsustainable rates]] from [[Structure of the Earth#Crust|earth's crust]]. Remaining reserves are likely to [[Peak minerals#Future production|become ever more costly to extract in the near future]], and will reach depletion at some point. The era of relatively peaceful economic expansion that has prevailed globally since World War II may be interrupted by unexpected [[supply shock]]s or simply be succeeded by the [[Hubbert peak theory#Hubbert peaks|peaking depletion paths]] of [[Peak oil|oil]] and [[Critical mineral raw materials|other valuable minerals]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Net depletion of renewable resources
Use of [[Natural resource#Classification|renewable]] resources in excess of their replenishment rates is undermining [[ecological stability]] worldwide. Between 2000 and 2012, [[deforestation]] resulted in some 14 percent of the equivalent of earth's original forest cover to be cut down. Tropical rainforests have been subject to [[Rainforest#Deforestation|deforestation]] at a rapid pace for decades — especially in [[Deforestation by region#Africa|west and central Africa]] and in [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|Brazil]] — mostly due to [[Deforestation#Causes|subsistence farming, population pressure, and urbanization]]. Population pressures also strain the [[Soil retrogression and degradation#Consequences of soil regression and degradation|world's soil systems]], leading to land degradation, mostly in developing countries. Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries. By 2025, [[Water security#Fresh water|water scarcity]] could impact the living conditions of two-thirds of the world's population.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
;Loss of biodiversity
The destructive impact of human activity on [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] worldwide is accelerating the [[Anthropocene#Biodiversity|extinction of rare species]], thereby substantially reducing [[Biodiversity#Species loss rates|earth's biodiversity]]. The [[Nitrogen cycle|natural nitrogen cycle]] is heavily overloaded by [[Nitrogen fixation#Industrial nitrogen fixation|industrial nitrogen fixation and use]], thereby [[Human impact on the nitrogen cycle#Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle|disrupting most known types of ecosystems]]. The [[Marine pollution#Plastic debris|accumulating plastic debris]] in the oceans decimates aquatic life. [[Ocean acidification]] due to the excess concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere is resulting in [[coral bleaching]] and [[Ocean acidification#Impacts on oceanic calcifying organisms|impedes shell-bearing organisms]]. [[Arctic sea ice decline]] caused by global warming is [[Polar bear#Climate change|endangering the polar bear]].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These mounting concerns have prompted an increasing number of academics and other writers to point to limits to [[economic growth]], and to question — and even oppose — the prevailing ideology of infinite economic growth.&lt;ref name=dm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=rh01/&gt;&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg03/&gt;&lt;ref name=pe01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ub02/&gt;&lt;ref name=nk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ek01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=av01/&gt;&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=wr01/&gt;&lt;ref name=do03/&gt;

== Historical background ==
For centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].

=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===
{{Main|Classical economics}}
{{See also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}
From [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295}}

==== Adam Smith's concept ====
{{Main|Adam Smith}}
{{See also|Invisible hand}}
{{Further|The Wealth of Nations}}
[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]
[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the enlightened self-interest of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|349f, 533f}}

Smith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|59–68}}

Smith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:

{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}}}

According to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, "... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence."&lt;ref name=as01/&gt;{{rp|78}}

==== David Ricardo's concept ====
{{Main|David Ricardo}}
{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}
{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}
[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]
In the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade #Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|135f}}

In Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|6–10}}

According to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers – Ricardo himself died in 1823 – directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|202f}}

The Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|88f}}

Ricardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).

==== John Stuart Mill's concept ====
{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}
{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}
{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}
[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]
John Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|179}}

A champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.&lt;ref name=jsm02/&gt; Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:

{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...&lt;ref name=jsm03/&gt;{{rp|19}}}}

Mill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|16}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:

{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592}}}}

Contrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not "... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about "... a very considerable improvement on our present condition."&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by — instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.&lt;ref name=jsm01/&gt;{{rp|592–596}}

Hence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|14f}} &lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|79}}

=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===
{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}
When the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:

[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]
{{anchor|Karl Marx}}
* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of "from each according to ability, to each according to need" — that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|57–65}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|218–225}} &lt;ref name=pb01/&gt;{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that "Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]]."&lt;ref name=rg01/&gt;{{rp|52}}
* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.&lt;ref name=mb02/&gt;{{rp|295–299}} &lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|55–57}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|156–160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|121–123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.&lt;ref name=jb01/&gt;{{rp|145–148}}

Taken together, it has been argued that "... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics."&lt;ref name=hd04/&gt;{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has 
reintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).

=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===
{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}
{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}
{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}

[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]
[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.

In his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing "bad attack of economic pessimism" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' — avarice, exaction of interest, love of money — that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live "wisely and agreeably and well." Mankind would finally have solved "the economic problem," that is, the struggle for existence.&lt;ref name=jmk01/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|2, 11}}

The similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.&lt;ref name=lp01/&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

In his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and — if population was not increasing rapidly — society would finally "... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ..."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. "I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work."&lt;ref name=jmk02/&gt;{{rp|237}}

=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===
The economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.

==== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ====
{{See also|Environmentalism #Post-war expansion}}
After the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion — known today as the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]] — was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded — or later joined — [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973–75 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].

Throughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] — dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] — developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|46f}} &lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics — namely [[general equilibrium theory]] — was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.&lt;ref name=cs01/&gt;{{rp|416–422}}

In the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed — indeed, ''challenged'' — in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|296–298}}

==== Emerging ecological concerns ====
During the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:

* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution — like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.&lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|104}}
* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ag01/&gt;{{rp|13}} &lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|164f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–171}}
* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.&lt;ref name=ho01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rc01/&gt;{{rp|68–71}} &lt;ref name=cc01/&gt;{{rp|14f}}

* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection — ''not'' prediction — that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].&lt;ref name=dm02/&gt; Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.&lt;ref name=mc01/&gt;{{rp|244f}} &lt;ref name=jn01/&gt;{{rp|60f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|50–62}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.&lt;ref name=ch01/&gt;{{rp|230}} &lt;ref name=aj01/&gt;{{rp|8f}} &lt;ref name=hs01/&gt;{{rp|152–155}} &lt;ref name=gt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tj02/&gt;{{rp|8}}
Taken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|301–305}}

==== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ====
{{Main article| Ecological economics}}
Although most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martínez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).&lt;ref name=ir01/&gt;{{rp|308–310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].

When the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.&lt;ref name=ir02/&gt;{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.&lt;ref name=ba01/&gt;&lt;ref name=cs02/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp01/&gt;

== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ==

Since the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=ma01/&gt;{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;&lt;ref name=hd03/&gt;{{rp|117–124}} &lt;ref name=hd05/&gt; He has also helped founding a center for the advancement of the steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=casse/&gt; He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.&lt;ref name=cr01/&gt;

According to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] — or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] — top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|146–148}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]
The premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Daly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may — within some practical limits — extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock — and not the Sun — that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|21f}}

[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]
Daly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily — though not exclusively — on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.

Daly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:

{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point — the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|23}}}}

Following the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:

{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|36}}}}

This view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

In Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that "... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants".&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.

{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}
[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]
Consequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:

* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.
* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.
* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).

The purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls "a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity" and providing "the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|69}}

Among the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} 
&lt;ref name=kb02/&gt;{{rp|165–167}}

{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}
Responding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: "A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy".&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...

{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end — that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|370}}}}

Later, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.&lt;ref name=mr01/&gt;{{rp|90f}} &lt;ref name=mf01/&gt;{{rp|105–107}} &lt;ref name=mb03/&gt;{{rp|270}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=av01/&gt;{{rp|37}}

== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==
{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental and physical constraints}}
Several conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space. Herman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.

=== Role of technology ===
{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}
[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding 
the role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:

* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.&lt;ref name=cm01/&gt;{{rp|508f}} &lt;ref name=rc02/&gt;{{rp|813–816}} &lt;ref name=tt02/&gt;{{rp|409f}}

[[File:2012 09 03 Brückenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]
* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology — useful though it is — works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] — or disorder — of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|18–25}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}}

From the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|80f}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|116–118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.&lt;ref name=hd06/&gt;{{rp|134f}}

=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===
{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}

Resource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural resource consumption to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption — that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|67f}}

[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]
In the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income–consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|160–163}} &lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;{{rp|40f}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|64f}}

In 2009, two separate studies were published that — among other things — addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt; British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt; Consider each in turn:
* Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment — based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology — will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|11–18}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizsäcker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizsäcker notes that "... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption."&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizsäcker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.&lt;ref name=ew02/&gt;{{rp|309f}}
* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' — that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP—decreased by 33 percent;&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that "resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction," mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] — notably China — building up their [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that "simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt."&lt;ref name=tj01/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Herman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|61–64}}

* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.
* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).
* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both — and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.

For all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|77–80}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|118}}

=== Declining-state economy ===
{{Distinguish|Recession}}
{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}
{{Further|Degrowth}}

A declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.

Proponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his 
paradigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth — that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366–369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|374–379}} &lt;ref name=jg02/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

American political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner — who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work — have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:

* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is uncapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy — or what he terms an 'entropic society' — based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|205–224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}}
* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that "the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life."&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|103}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|134–138}} 
* In his article on ''Economic de-growth vs. steady-state economy'', Christian Kerschner has integrated the strategy of declining-state, or degrowth, with Herman Daly's concept of the steady-state economy to the effect that degrowth should be considered a path taken by the rich industrialized countries leading towards a globally equitable steady-state economy. This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time — although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=do02/&gt;{{rp|229}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

Herman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:

{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum."&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}}}}

Daly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt;{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

=== Capitalism without growth ===
{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}
Several [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.&lt;ref name=rs01/&gt;&lt;ref name=jf01/&gt;&lt;ref name=tt01/&gt;&lt;ref name=rf01/&gt;{{rp|97–100}} &lt;ref name=mm01/&gt;{{rp|45–51}} &lt;ref name=bb01/&gt;&lt;ref name=pa01/&gt; Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:

[[File:Wall Street Bull - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]
* In capitalism, economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige — or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.
* In capitalism, [[employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].
* In capitalism, the [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.
* In capitalism, [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.
* In capitalism, private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.
* In capitalism, governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.
* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.
— In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.

Fully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):

{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}}}

Daly concludes by inviting all (most) people — both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism — to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|367}}

=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===
{{Main| Asteroid mining}}
{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}
{{Further|Space advocacy}}

Ever since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).

[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]
In the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could — and indeed ''should'' — expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth — and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline — than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: "The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies."&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369}}

By the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation has long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.&lt;ref name=wc01/&gt; &lt;ref name=as02/&gt; &lt;ref name=pm01/&gt;

[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]
However, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space — and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.&lt;ref name=hd07/&gt;{{rp|24}} &lt;ref name=ub01/&gt;{{rp|81–83}} &lt;ref name=te01/&gt; &lt;ref name=ws01/&gt; &lt;ref name=kz01/&gt;

[[Christopher Strachey]] wrote a combinatory '''love letter algorithm''' for the [[Manchester Mark 1]] computer in 1952. The poems it generated have been seen as the first piece of [[digital literature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wardrip-Fruin|first1=Noah|title=Christopher Strachey: The first digital artist?|url=https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/01/christopher-strachey-first-digital-artist/|website=Grand Text Auto|publisher=School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=1 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a queer critique of heteronormative expressions of love.&lt;ref name="queer-history"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaboury|first1=Jacob|title=[Christopher Strachey]|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/apr/9/queer-history-computing-part-three/|website=A Queer History of Computing|publisher=Rhizome|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The algorithm==

Rather than modeling writing as a creative process, the love letter algorithm represents the writing of love letters as formulaic and ''without'' creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|first2=Natalia|last2=Fedorova|conference=International Conference on Computational Creativity|title=Small-Scale Systems and Computational Creativity|date=2012|url=http://nickm.com/if/montfort_fedorova__iccc_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The algorithm has the following structure:

# Print two words taken from a list of salutations
# Do the following 5 times:
## Choose one of two sentence structures depending on a random value Rand
## Fill the sentence structure from lists of adjectives, adverbs, substantives, and verbs.
# Print the letter's closing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Link|first1=David|title=There Must Be an Angel: On the Beginnings of the Arithmetics of Rays|url=http://www.alpha60.de/research/there_must_be_an_angel/DavidLink_MustBeAnAngel_2006.pdf|accessdate=19 August 2016|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lists of words were compiled by Strachey from a [[Roget's Thesaurus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Sample|first1=Mark|title=An Account of Randomness in Literary Computing|url=http://de.hypotheses.org/72951|accessdate=19 August 2016|date=2013|conference=Modern Language Association Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the list of words included several variations on the word ''love'', none of these variations made it into any of the widely circulated letters generated by Strachey's procedure.&lt;ref name="queer-history" /&gt;

'''Systems theory''' is the [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s. A system is a cohesive conglomeration of interrelated and interdependent parts that is either [[natural]] or [[man-made]]. Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose or nature and expressed in its functioning. In terms of its effects, a system can be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses [[synergy]] or [[emergent behavior]]. Changing one part of the system usually affects other parts and the whole system, with predictable patterns of behavior. For systems that are self-learning and self-adapting, the positive growth and adaptation depend upon how well the system is adjusted with its environment. Some systems function mainly to support other systems by aiding in the maintenance of the other system to prevent failure. The goal of systems theory is systematically discovering a system's dynamics, [[Theory of constraints|constraints]], conditions and elucidating principles (purpose, measure, methods, tools, etc.) that can be discerned and applied to systems at every level of nesting, and in every field for achieving optimized [[equifinality]].&lt;ref&gt;Beven, K. (2006). A manifesto for the equifinality thesis. Journal of hydrology, 320(1), 18-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

General systems theory is about broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles applicable to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. E.g. a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paolo Rocchi|title=Technology + Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2X17MLCjsKgC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2000|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1-58603-035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is related to '''systems thinking''' and [[systems engineering]].

== Key concepts ==
* System: An organized entity made up of interrelated and interdependent parts.
* Boundaries: Barriers that define a system and distinguish it from other systems in the environment.
* Homeostasis: The tendency of a system to be resilient towards external factors and maintain its key characteristics.
* Adaptation: The tendency of a self-adapting system to make the internal changes needed to protect itself and keep fulfilling its purpose.
* Reciprocal Transactions: Circular or cyclical interactions that systems engage in such that they influence one another.
* Feedback Loop: The process by which systems self-correct based on reactions from other systems in the environment.
* Throughput: Rate of energy transfer between the system and its environment during the time it is functioning.
* Microsystem: The system closest to the client.
* Mesosystem: Relationships among the systems in an environment.
* Exosystem: A relationship between two systems that has an indirect effect on a third system.
* Macrosystem: A larger system that influences clients, such as policies, administration of entitlement programs, and culture.
* Chronosystem: A system composed of significant life events that can affect adaptation.

== Origin of the term ==
The term "general systems theory" originates from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|general systems theory]] (GST). His ideas were adopted by others including [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]] and [[Anatol Rapoport]] working in mathematics, psychology, biology, game theory and [[social network analysis]].

Sociological systems thinking started earlier, in the 19th century.  Stichweh states:&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Badie et al. (eds.), ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science''. Sage New York.&lt;/ref&gt; "... Since its beginnings the [[social science]]s were an important part of the establishment of systems theory... the two most influential suggestions were the comprehensive sociological versions of systems theory which were proposed by [[Talcott Parsons]] since the 1950s and by [[Niklas Luhmann]] since the 1970s." References include Parsons' [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Stichweh (2011) "[http://www.fiw.uni-bonn.de/demokratieforschung/personen/stichweh/pdfs/80_stw_systems-theory-international-encyclopedia-of-political-science_2.pdf Systems Theory]", in:y.&lt;/ref&gt; and Luhmann's social systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luhmann|first=Niklas|title=Soziale Systeme: Grundriß einer allgemeinen Theorie|date=1984|publisher=Suhrkamp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Contemporary ideas from systems theory have grown with diverse areas, exemplified by the work of biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], linguist [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]], ecological systems with [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Fritjof Capra]], [[organizational theory]] and [[management]] with individuals such as [[Peter Senge]], interdisciplinary study with areas like [[Human Resource Development]] from the work of [[Richard A. Swanson]], and insights from educators such as [[Debora Hammond]] and Alfonso Montuori. As a transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary and [[Multiperspectivalism|multiperspectival]] domain, the area brings together principles and concepts from [[ontology]], [[philosophy of science]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[biology]] and [[engineering]] as well as [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychotherapy]] (within [[family systems therapy]]) and [[economics]] among others. Systems theory thus serves as a bridge for interdisciplinary dialogue between autonomous areas of study as well as within the area of [[systems science]] itself.

In this respect, with the possibility of misinterpretations, von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;Bertalanffy (1950: 142)&lt;/ref&gt; believed a general theory of systems "should be an important regulative device in science", to guard against superficial analogies that "are useless in science and harmful in their practical consequences". Others remain closer to the direct systems concepts developed by the original theorists. For example, [[Prigogine|Ilya Prigogine]], of [[the Center for Complex Quantum Systems]] at the University of Texas, Austin, has studied [[emergence|emergent properties]], suggesting that they offer [[analogy|analogues]] for [[life|living systems]]. The theories of [[autopoiesis]] of [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Humberto Maturana]] represent further developments in this field. Important names in contemporary systems science include [[Russell Ackoff]], [[Ruzena Bajcsy]], [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Anthony Stafford Beer]], [[Peter Checkland]], [[Barbara Grosz]], [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]], [[Robert L. Flood]], [[Allenna Leonard]], [[Radhika Nagpal]], [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Warren McCulloch]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[Michael C. Jackson]], [[Katia Sycara]], and [[Edgar Morin]] among others.

With the modern foundations for a general theory of systems following World War I, [[Ervin Laszlo]], in the preface for Bertalanffy's book: ''Perspectives on General System Theory'', points out that the [[translation]] of "general system theory" from German into English has "wrought a certain amount of havoc":&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"&gt;(Laszlo 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It (General System Theory) was criticized as pseudoscience and said to be nothing more than an admonishment to attend to things in a holistic way. Such criticisms would have lost their point had it been recognized that von Bertalanffy's general system theory is a perspective or paradigm, and that such basic conceptual frameworks play a key role in the development of exact scientific theory. .. Allgemeine Systemtheorie is not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on 'general system theory,' to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isss.org/laszlofw.htm Forward by Ervin Laszlo] to Perspectives on GENERAL SYSTEM THEORY by Ludwig von Bertalanffy&lt;/ref&gt;}} "Theorie" (or "Lehre"), just as "Wissenschaft" (translated Scholarship), "has a much broader meaning in German than the closest English words 'theory' and 'science'".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; These ideas refer to an organized body of knowledge and "any systematically presented set of concepts, whether [[empirically]], [[axiomatically]], or [[philosophical]]ly" represented, while many associate "Lehre" with theory and science in the etymology of general systems, though it also does not translate from the German very well; its "closest equivalent" translates as "teaching", but "sounds dogmatic and off the mark".&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt;  While the idea of a "general systems theory" might have lost many of its root meanings in the translation, by defining a new way of thinking about science and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]], Systems theory became a widespread term used for instance to describe the interdependence of relationships created in [[organization]]s.

A system in this frame of reference can contain regularly interacting or interrelating groups of activities. For example, in noting the influence in organizational psychology as the field evolved from "an individually oriented [[industrial psychology]] to a systems and developmentally oriented [[organizational psychology]]", some theorists recognize that organizations have complex social systems; separating the parts from the whole reduces the overall effectiveness of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;(Schein 1980: 4-11)&lt;/ref&gt; This difference, from conventional models that center on individuals, structures, departments and units, separates in part from the whole, instead of recognizing the interdependence between groups of individuals, structures and processes that enable an organization to function. Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;Laslo (1972: 14-15)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that the new systems view of organized complexity went "one step beyond the Newtonian view of organized simplicity" which reduced the parts from the whole, or understood the whole without relation to the parts. The relationship between organisations and their [[environment (systems)|environments]] can be seen as the foremost source of complexity and interdependence. In most cases, the whole has properties that cannot be known from analysis of the constituent elements in isolation. [[Béla H. Bánáthy]], who argued—along with the founders of the systems society—that "the benefit of humankind" is the purpose of science, has made significant and far-reaching contributions to the area of systems theory. For the Primer Group at ISSS, Bánáthy defines a perspective that iterates this view:&lt;ref&gt;(Banathy 1997: ¶ 22)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

{{quote|The systems view is a world-view that is based on the discipline of SYSTEM INQUIRY. Central to systems inquiry is the concept of SYSTEM. In the most general sense, system means a configuration of parts connected and joined together by a web of relationships. The Primer Group defines system as a family of relationships among the members acting as a whole. Von Bertalanffy defined system as "elements in standing relationship."}}

Similar ideas are found in learning theories that developed from the same fundamental concepts, emphasising how understanding results from knowing concepts both in part and as a whole. In fact, Bertalanffy's organismic psychology paralleled the learning theory of [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref name="GST"&gt;1968, General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, New York: George Braziller, revised edition 1976: {{ISBN|0-8076-0453-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider interdisciplinary perspectives critical in breaking away from [[industrial age]] models and thinking, wherein history represents history and math represents math, while the arts and sciences [[Academic specialization|specialization]] remain separate and many treat teaching as [[behaviorist]] conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;(see Steiss 1967; Buckley, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary work of [[Peter Senge]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge (2000: 27-49)&lt;/ref&gt; provides detailed discussion of the commonplace critique of educational systems grounded in conventional assumptions about learning, including the problems with fragmented knowledge and lack of holistic learning from the "machine-age thinking" that became a "model of school separated from daily life". In this way some systems theorists attempt to provide alternatives to, and evolved ideation from orthodox theories which have grounds in classical assumptions, including individuals such as [[Max Weber]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] in sociology and [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] in [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8; see also Owens 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The theorists sought holistic methods by developing systems concepts that could integrate with different areas.

Some may view the contradiction of [[reductionism]] in conventional theory (which has as its subject a single part) as simply an example of changing assumptions. The emphasis with systems theory shifts from parts to the organization of parts, recognizing interactions of the parts as not static and constant but dynamic processes. Some questioned the conventional [[closed system]]s with the development of [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] perspectives. The shift originated from [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] and universal authoritative principles and knowledge to relative and general [[concept]]ual and [[perceptual]] knowledge&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994: 3-8)&lt;/ref&gt; and still remains in the tradition of theorists that sought to provide means to organize human life. In other words, theorists rethought the preceding [[history of ideas]]; they did not lose them. Mechanistic thinking was particularly critiqued, especially the industrial-age mechanistic [[metaphor]] for the mind from [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]s of [[Newtonian mechanics]] by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers and later psychologists that laid the foundations of modern organizational theory and management by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Bailey 1994; Flood 1997; Checkland 1999; Laszlo 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of applications==

===System dynamics===
{{Main|System dynamics}}
System dynamics is an approach to understanding the [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] behaviour of [[complex system]]s over time using [[Stock and flow|stocks, flows]], internal [[feedback loop]]s, and time delays.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/sysdyn/sd-intro/ MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems biology===
{{Main|Systems biology}}
Systems biology is a movement that draws on several trends in bioscience research. Proponents describe systems biology as a biology-based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in [[biological system]]s, claiming that it uses a new perspective ([[holism]] instead of [[reductionist|reduction]]). Particularly from the year 2000 onwards, the [[biosciences]] use the term widely and in a variety of contexts. An often stated ambition of systems biology is the modelling and discovery of [[emergent property|emergent properties]] which represents properties of a system whose theoretical description requires the only possible useful techniques to fall under the remit of systems biology. It is thought that [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] may have created the term systems biology in 1928.&lt;ref name="LVB1928"&gt;1928, Kritische Theorie der Formbildung, Borntraeger. In English: Modern Theories of Development: An Introduction to Theoretical Biology, Oxford University Press, New York: Harper, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems ecology===
{{Main|Systems ecology}}
Systems ecology is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems Ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]]. Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

===Systems engineering===
{{Main|Systems engineering}}
[[Systems engineering]] is an [[interdisciplinary]] approach and means for enabling the realisation and deployment of successful [[system]]s. It can be viewed as the application of engineering techniques to the engineering of systems, as well as the application of a systems approach to engineering efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thomé | first = Bernhard | authorlink = | date = 1993 | title = Systems Engineering: Principles and Practice of Computer-based Systems Engineering | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester| isbn = 0-471-93552-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems engineering integrates other disciplines and specialty groups into a team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and disposal. Systems engineering considers both the business and the technical needs of all customers, with the goal of providing a quality product that meets the user's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=INCOSE|author-link=INCOSE |url=http://www.incose.org/practice/whatissystemseng.aspx|title=What is Systems Engineering|accessdate=2006-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Blockley David, Godfrey Patrick ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)'' ICE Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-0-7277-6082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems psychology===
{{Main|Systems psychology}}
Systems psychology is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[human behaviour]] and [[experience]] in [[complex system]]s. It received inspiration from systems theory and systems thinking, as well as the basics of theoretical work from [[Roger Barker]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]] and others. It makes an approach in [[psychology]] in which groups and individuals receive consideration as [[systems]] in [[homeostasis]]. Systems psychology "includes the domain of [[engineering psychology]], but in addition seems more concerned with societal systems and with the study of motivational, affective, cognitive and group behavior that holds the name engineering psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Lester R. Bittel and Muriel Albers Bittel (1978), ''Encyclopedia of Professional Management'', McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-005478-9}}, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; In systems psychology, "characteristics of [[organizational behaviour]], for example individual needs, rewards, [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]s, and attributes of the people interacting with the [[systems]], considers this process in order to create an effective system".&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Behrmann (1984), ''Handbook of Microcomputers in Special Education''. College Hill Press. {{ISBN|0-933014-35-X}}. Page 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether considering the first systems of written communication with [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[cuneiform]] to [[Maya numerals|Mayan numerals]], or the feats of engineering with the [[Egyptian pyramids]], systems thinking can date back to antiquity. Differentiated from Western [[rationalist]] traditions of philosophy, C. West Churchman often identified with the [[I Ching]] as a systems approach sharing a frame of reference similar to [[pre-Socratic]] philosophy and [[Heraclitus]].&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt; Von Bertalanffy traced systems concepts to the philosophy of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|G.W. Leibniz]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa]]'s ''[[Coincidentia oppositorum#Coincidentia oppositorum|coincidentia oppositorum]]''. While modern systems can seem considerably more complicated, today's systems may embed themselves in history.

Figures like [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] represent an important step to introduce the ''systems approach'' into the (rationalist) [[Hard Science|hard sciences]] of the 19th century, also known as the [[energy transformation]]. Then, the [[thermodynamics]] of this century, by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Josiah Gibbs]] and others, established the ''system'' [[reference model]] as a formal scientific object.

The [[Society for General Systems Research]] specifically catalyzed systems theory as an area of study, which developed following the World Wars from the work of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], [[Anatol Rapoport]], [[Kenneth E. Boulding]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[C. West Churchman]] and others in the 1950s, had specifically catalyzed by collaboration in. Cognizant of advances in science that questioned classical assumptions in the organizational sciences, Bertalanffy's idea to develop a theory of systems began as early as the interwar period, publishing "An Outline for General Systems Theory" in the ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'', Vol 1, No. 2, by 1950. Where assumptions in Western science from Greek thought with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' have historically influenced all areas from the hard to social sciences (see [[David Easton]]'s seminal development of the "[[political system]]" as an analytical construct), the original theorists explored the implications of twentieth century advances in terms of systems.

People have studied subjects like [[complexity]], [[self-organization]], [[connectionism]] and [[adaptive systems]] in the 1940s and 1950s. In fields like cybernetics, researchers such as [[Norbert Wiener]], [[William Ross Ashby]], [[John von Neumann]] and [[Heinz von Foerster]], examined complex systems mathematically. [[John von Neumann]] discovered [[cellular automata]] and self-reproducing systems, again with only pencil and paper. [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] and [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] worked on the foundations of [[chaos theory]] without any [[computer]] at all. At the same time [[Howard T. Odum]], known as a radiation ecologist, recognized that the study of general systems required a language that could depict [[energetics]], [[thermodynamics]] and [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] at any system scale. Odum developed a general system, or [[universal language]], based on the circuit language of [[electronics]], to fulfill this role, known as the [[Energy Systems Language]]. Between 1929-1951, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]] at the [[University of Chicago]] had undertaken efforts to encourage innovation and interdisciplinary research in the social sciences, aided by the [[Ford Foundation]] with the interdisciplinary Division of the Social Sciences established in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond 2003: 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars had actively engaged in these ideas before ([[Tectology]] by [[Alexander Bogdanov]], published in 1912-1917, is a remarkable example), but in 1937, von Bertalanffy presented the general theory of systems at a conference at the University of Chicago.

The systems view was based on several fundamental ideas. First, all phenomena can be viewed as a web of relationships among elements, or a [[system]]. Second, all systems, whether [[electrical]], [[biological]], or [[social system|social]], have common [[patterns]], [[behaviors]], and [[properties]] that the observer can analyze and use to develop greater insight into the behavior of complex phenomena and to move closer toward a unity of the sciences. System philosophy, methodology and application are complementary to this science.&lt;ref name="Laszlo 1974"/&gt; By 1956, theorists established the [[Society for General Systems Research]], which they renamed the International Society for Systems Science in 1988. The Cold War affected the research project for systems theory in ways that sorely disappointed many of the seminal theorists. Some began to recognize that theories defined in association with systems theory had deviated from the initial General Systems Theory (GST) view.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1970&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Kenneth Boulding]], an early researcher in systems theory, had concerns over the manipulation of systems concepts. Boulding concluded from the effects of the Cold War that abuses of [[Political power|power]] always prove consequential and that systems theory might address such issues.&lt;ref&gt;(Hammond 2003: 229-233)&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the Cold War, a renewed interest in systems theory emerged, combined with efforts to strengthen an [[ethical]]&lt;ref&gt;1968 Ludwig von Bertalanffy publishes General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications&lt;/ref&gt; view on the subject.

==Developments==

===General systems research and systems inquiry===
Many early systems theorists aimed at finding a general systems theory that could explain all systems in all fields of science. The term goes back to [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Bertalanffy]]'s book titled "''General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications''" from 1968.&lt;ref name="GST"/&gt; He developed the "allgemeine Systemlehre" (general systems theory) first via lectures beginning in 1937 and then via publications beginning in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]: ''... aber vom Menschen wissen wir nichts'', (English title: Robots, Men and Minds), translated by Dr. Hans-Joachim Flechtner. page 115. Econ Verlag GmbH (1970), Düsseldorf, Wien. 1st edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Bertalanffy's objective was to bring together under one heading the organismic science he had observed in his work as a biologist. His desire was to use the word ''system'' for those principles that are common to systems in general. In GST, he writes:

{{quote|...there exist models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relationships or "forces" between them. It seems legitimate to ask for a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles applying to systems in general.|Von Bertalanffy&lt;ref&gt;(GST p.32)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ervin Laszlo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/perspectives_on_general_system_theory|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the preface of von Bertalanffy's book ''Perspectives on General System Theory'':&lt;ref&gt;von Bertalanffy, Ludwig, (1974) ''Perspectives on General System Theory'' Edited by Edgar Taschdjian. George Braziller, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus when von Bertalanffy spoke of Allgemeine Systemtheorie it was consistent with his view that he was proposing a new perspective, a new way of doing science. It was not directly consistent with an interpretation often put on "general system theory", to wit, that it is a (scientific) "theory of general systems." To criticize it as such is to shoot at straw men. Von Bertalanffy opened up something much broader and of much greater significance than a single theory (which, as we now know, can always be falsified and has usually an ephemeral existence): he created a new paradigm for the development of theories.}}

Ludwig von Bertalanffy outlines systems inquiry into three major domains: Philosophy, Science, and Technology. In his work with the Primer Group, Béla H. Bánáthy generalized the domains into four integratable domains of systemic inquiry:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Domain
!Description
|-
|Philosophy
|the [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and [[axiology]] of systems
|-
|Theory
|a set of interrelated concepts and principles applying to all systems
|-
|Methodology
|the set of models, strategies, methods and tools that instrumentalize systems theory and philosophy
|-
|Application
|the application and interaction of the domains
|}

These operate in a recursive relationship, he explained. Integrating Philosophy and Theory as Knowledge, and Method and Application as action, Systems Inquiry then is knowledgeable action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.isss.org/Main/SystemsInquiry|title=start [ProjectsISSS]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetics===
{{Main|Cybernetics}}

Cybernetics is the study of the [[communication]] and control of regulatory [[feedback]] both in living and lifeless systems (organisms, organizations, machines), and in combinations of those. Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) controls its behavior, processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish those three primary tasks.

The terms "systems theory" and "cybernetics" have been widely used as synonyms. Some authors use the term ''cybernetic'' systems to denote a proper subset of the class of general systems, namely those systems that include [[feedback]] loops. However [[Gordon Pask]]'s differences of eternal interacting actor loops (that produce finite products) makes general systems a proper subset of cybernetics. According to Jackson (2000), von Bertalanffy promoted an embryonic form of general system theory (GST) as early as the 1920s and 1930s but it was not until the early 1950s it became more widely known in scientific circles.

Threads of cybernetics began in the late 1800s that led toward the publishing of seminal works (e.g., Wiener's ''Cybernetics'' in 1948 and von Bertalanffy's ''General Systems Theory'' in 1968). Cybernetics arose more from engineering fields and GST from biology. If anything it appears that although the two probably mutually influenced each other, cybernetics had the greater influence. Von Bertalanffy (1969) specifically makes the point of distinguishing between the areas in noting the influence of cybernetics: "Systems theory is frequently identified with cybernetics and control theory. This again is incorrect. Cybernetics as the theory of control mechanisms in technology and nature is founded on the concepts of information and feedback, but as part of a general theory of systems;" then reiterates: "the model is of wide application but should not be identified with 'systems theory' in general", and that "warning is necessary against its incautious expansion to fields for which its concepts are not made." (17-23). Jackson (2000) also claims von Bertalanffy was informed by [[Alexander Bogdanov]]'s three volume ''[[Tectology]]'' that was published in Russia between 1912 and 1917, and was translated into German in 1928. He also states it is clear to Gorelik (1975) that the "conceptual part" of general system theory (GST) had first been put in place by Bogdanov. The similar position is held by [[Richard Mattessich|Mattessich]] (1978) and Capra (1996). Ludwig von Bertalanffy never even mentioned Bogdanov in his works, which Capra (1996) finds "surprising".

Cybernetics, [[catastrophe theory]], [[chaos theory]] and [[Complex systems#Complexity and chaos theory|complexity theory]] have the common goal to explain complex systems that consist of a large number of mutually interacting and interrelated parts in terms of those interactions. Cellular automata (CA), neural networks (NN), artificial intelligence (AI), and [[artificial life]] (ALife) are related fields, but they do not try to describe general (universal) complex (singular) systems. The best context to compare the different "C"-Theories about complex systems is historical, which emphasizes different tools and methodologies, from pure mathematics in the beginning to pure computer science now. Since the beginning of chaos theory when [[Edward Lorenz]] accidentally discovered a [[strange attractor]] with his computer, computers have become an indispensable source of information. One could not imagine the study of complex systems without the use of computers today.

===Complex adaptive systems===
{{Main|Complex adaptive system}}
Complex adaptive systems (CAS) are special cases of [[complex system]]s. They are ''complex'' in that they are diverse and composed of multiple, interconnected elements; they are ''adaptive'' in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. In contrast to control systems in which [[negative feedback]] dampens and reverses disequilibria, CAS are often subject to [[positive feedback]], which magnifies and perpetuates changes, converting local irregularities into global features. Another mechanism, [[Dual-phase evolution]] arises when connections between elements repeatedly change, shifting the system between phases of variation and selection that reshape the system. Differently from Beer [[Management cybernetics|Management Cybernetics]], [[Cultural Agency Theory]] (CAT) provides a modelling approach to explore predefined contexts and can be adapted to reflect those contexts.

The term ''complex adaptive system'' was coined at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]] (SFI), by [[John Henry Holland|John H. Holland]], [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others. An alternative conception of complex adaptive (and learning) systems, methodologically at the interface between natural and social science, has been presented by [[Kristo Ivanov]] in terms of [[Kristo Ivanov#Hypersystems|hypersystems]]. This concept intends to offer a theoretical basis for understanding and implementing participation of "users", decisions makers, designers and affected actors, in the development or maintenance of self-learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kristo Ivanov|Ivanov, K.]] (1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7176">'''Tolerance tax''' (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], between 1747 and 1797.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under Maria Theresa (1740–1780)==

In 1747, during the reign of Empress [[Maria Theresa]], the Jews of Hungary were taxed for the privilege of remaining in the empire, and were threatened with expulsion if they did not pay.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt; 

On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from [[Szatmár]] County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.

The queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this ''Malkegeld'' (queen's money), as they called it.

The Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called ''delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta''. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]], in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] and [[Heves County (former)|Heves]] Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg ([[Székesfehérvár]]) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 [[kreuzer]] if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the [[Greeks]] and the merchants.

The Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay [[Toll road|toll]], although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as [[Security interest#Pledge|pledge]]s for [[arrears]] of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the Tolerance tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County ([[Szepes]], [[Spiš]]), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish [[artisan]]s might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.

The commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law.

The queen relieved the Jews from the Tolerance tax in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.

The Tolerance tax had hardly been instituted when [[Michael Hirsch]] petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.

Before the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed ''gravamina'' of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.

The method of calculating the Tolerance tax varied over time and location, according to the size of household, occupation, and income-producing assets.&lt;ref name="jg"/&gt;

==Under Joseph II==

In 1783, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the son of Maria Theresa, allowed Jews to settle in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], while enacting a tolerance tax, which the Jews had to pay to the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Budapest.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour Budapest, By Rebecca Weiner]&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1789, the Jews paid a tolerance tax of 4 guilder per family, a [[Kosher tax|tax on kosher meat]], a marriage tax, a tax on the synagogues and cemeteries of 100 guilder per year, and a quota tax of 50 guilder per year.&lt;ref name="jg2"/&gt;

In 1797, after the death of Joseph II, the tolerance tax and the taxes on homes and properties were replaced by a candle tax on Jewish religious candles.&lt;ref name="jg2"&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/rzeszow/rze047.html JewishGen, The History of the Jews of Rzeszow, Chapter 7, p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, further rights were granted to Jews in 1840, but the "tolerance tax" remained in force. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porges.net/JewishHistoryOfYugoslavia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''transmediale''' is an annual festival for [[art]] and [[Cyberculture|digital culture]] in Berlin, usually held over five days at the end of January and the beginning of February. The 2017 edition marked its 30-year anniversary. 

A conference, varying exhibition formats, a film and video program, performances, and workshops build its programmatic core. Simultaneously and in cooperation with transmediale, [[CTM Festival]] (formerly club transmediale, renamed in 2011) offers an annual platform for experimental and electronic music. Once a side event of transmediale, it is now organized and curated independently. Throughout the year, transmediale is also involved in a number of long- and short-term cooperative projects via transmediale/resource.

== History ==
transmediale was founded in 1988 under the name of VideoFilmFest (VideoFest as of 1989) within the framework of [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]], as a side event of the Internationales Forum des Jungen Films section. Its founders, Hartmut Horst and video artist and activist [[Micky Kwella]], sought to create a platform for electronic media productions, which were excluded from classic film festivals such as Berlinale. Over the course of the following 30 years, the festival evolved steadily and independently of Berlinale: from its initial focus on video culture it turned to cultivating an artistic and critical dialogue with television and multimedia, eventually emerging as a leading international platform for media art. In 1997, its name was changed to transmedia, and finally to transmediale in 1998. The change reflected the programmatic extension of the festival, which by then encompassed a broad spectrum of [[multimedia]] art forms such as [[Internet art|Internet]] and [[Software art|Software Art]].

In 2001, transmediale underwent far-reaching structural changes; further additions to the program and a new venue, [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]], led to a continuous increase in attendance. transmediale.02 was the first edition to feature an extensive exhibition in which media art could be experienced in a sensuous and physical way. In 2006, the festival’s subheading changed from “international media art festival” to “festival for art and digital culture”—a decision reflective of a shift towards a more open approach that would include art, technology, and everyday life in an increasingly digitalized world instead of the previous, narrower focus on media art alone.

The transmediale Award was introduced in 2001 to honour visionary works and projects centering around technology-led societies. In order to do justice to the rising number of submissions of theoretical works, the competition was complemented by the Vilém Flusser Theory Award at transmediale.08. Named after philosopher and media theorist [[Vilém Flusser]], it promoted “outstanding, media-theoretical and research-based artworks” until 2011. In 2012, it was converted into a residency program for artistic research; the transmediale Award and Open Web Award were discontinued.

In addition, club transmediale was founded as a side event of transmediale in 1999. Since then, [[CTM Festival|CTM]] has developed into an independent festival that presents electronic and experimental music in various Berlin venues once a year.

== Themes ==
As of 2001, transmediale has followed annually changing thematic headlines:

*transmediale.01 DIY [do it yourself!]
*transmediale.02 go public!
*transmediale.03 PLAY GLOBAL!
*transmediale.04 FLY UTOPIA!
*transmediale.05 BASICS

*transmediale 2015 CAPTURE ALL
*transmediale/conversationpiece 2016
*transmediale 2017 ever elusive
*transmediale 2018 face value

== Organisation ==
transmediale was founded by Hartmut Horst and Micky Kwella in 1988. From 2001 to 2007, art historian and curator Andreas Broeckmann took over the artistic direction of the festival. He was superseded by media and arts researcher Stephen Kovats, who led transmediale until 2011. As of April 2011, curator and media researcher Kristoffer Gansing has been the artistic director of the festival. 

Since 2004, Kulturstiftung des Bundes has been funding transmediale (alongside documenta, Berlin Biennale and others) as a Beacon of Contemporary Culture. The host organization of the festival is Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH, which was operated under the name of Kulturveranstaltungs-GmbH until 2005.

In 2011, transmediale/resource was established as a framework for transmediale’s year-round activities. Its aim is to provide a sustainable structure for feedback, research, and reflection beyond the timeframe of the festival. In addition to varying cooperative projects and network activities, transmediale/resource includes the Vilém Flusser Residency Program for Artistic Research, online publication format transmediale/journal and pre-festival program Vorspiel, presented in collaboration with CTM and a network of organizations, galleries, independent project spaces, and venues all over Berlin.

== Places ==
Until 1992, VideoFilmFest took place at MedienOperative as well as Deutsche Akademie der Künste in East Berlin. In 1993, it moved to Podewil, which is also where the transmediale offices have been located since 1997. From 2002 to 2005, Haus der Kulturen der Welt became the festival’s main location. In 2006, transmediale relocated to [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Akademie der Künste]], only to return to [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] in 2008, where it has remained since.

[[Image:Trefoil-Architectural.svg|150px|thumb|right|Architectural trefoil]]
'''Trefoil''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|trifolium}}'', "three-leaved plant") is a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings used in architecture and [[Christian symbolism]]. The term is also applied to other symbols of three-fold shape.

==Architecture==

===Ornamentation===
Trefoil is a term in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[architecture]] given to the ornamental foliation or cusping introduced in the heads of window-lights, tracery, and panellings, in which the center takes the form of a three-lobed [[leaf]] (formed from three partially overlapping circles). One of the earliest examples is in the plate tracery at [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] (1222–1235).  The fourfold version of an architectural trefoil is a [[quatrefoil]].

A simple trefoil shape in itself can be symbolic of the Trinity,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Christian Symbols'' by Friedrich Rest ({{ISBN|0-8298-0099-9}}), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; while a trefoil combined with an equilateral triangle was also a moderately common symbol of the Christian [[Trinity]] during the [[late Middle Ages]] in some parts of Europe.  Two forms of this are shown below:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Trefoil-Architectural-Equilateral-Triangle-outlined.svg|Outlined
File:Trefoil-Architectural-Equilateral-Triangle-interlaced.svg|Interlaced
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A [[Doves as symbols#Christianity|dove]], which symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]], is sometimes depicted within the outlined form of the trefoil combined with a triangle.

===Architectural layout===

In architecture and archaeology, trefoils describe a layout or floorplan consisting of three [[apse]]s in clover-leaf shape, as for example in the [[Megalithic temples of Malta]].

Particularly in church architecture, such a layout may be called a "triconchos".
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Evolution du plan des temples copie.jpg|Evolution of layout of Maltese Megalithic temples; [[Skorba Temples|Skorba]] (upper right) has a typical trefoil plan
File:Trikonchos.gif|Triconchos
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Heraldry==
The [[heraldry|heraldic]] ''trefoil'' is a stylized [[clover]]. It should not be confused with the figure named in French heraldry ''tiercefeuille'', which is a stylized flower with three petals. It differs from the heraldic trefoil in being not slipped. It could be translated as ''threefoil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}. The French terms ''quartefeuille'' and ''quintefeuille'' are translated as ''quatrefoils'' and ''cinquefoils''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Symbols==

Symmetrical Trefoils are particularly popular as warning and informational symbols. If a box containing hazardous material is moved around and shifted into different positions, it is still easy to recognize the symbol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Committee on Microbiological Safety - HMS|author=|date=|website=www.hms.harvard.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the distinctive trefoil design of the [[recycling symbol]] makes it easy for a consumer to notice and identify the packaging the symbol has been printed on as recyclable. Easily stenciled symbols are also favored.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:WikiProject Scouting trefoil fade.svg|One particular stylized form of the heraldic trefoil is used as the main element in the logo of most [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting]] organizations. For Girl Scouts, the three trefoil leaves represent the three-fold promise:  "To serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout law."
&lt;/gallery&gt;

While the green trefoil is considered by many to be the symbol of Ireland, the harp has much greater officially recognized status.  Therefore, shamrocks generally do not appear on Irish coins or postage stamps.

A trefoil is also part of the logo for [[Adidas Originals]], which also includes three stripes.

A '''triskelion''' or '''triskele''' is a [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] consisting of a '''triple spiral''' exhibiting   [[rotational symmetry]].
The spiral design can be based on interlocking [[Archimedean spiral]]s,  or represent three bent human legs.

Both terms are from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{Lang|el|"τρισκέλιον"}} (''triskelion'') or {{lang|grc|"τρισκελής"}} (''triskeles''), "three-legged",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtriskelh%2Fs τρισκελής],

A triskelion is a traditional symbol of [[Sicily]], where it is called ''trinacria'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angelo &amp; Mario Grifasi |url=http://www.grifasi-sicilia.com/trinacria.htm |title=Sicilia: Il Perchè del nome Trinacria |publisher=Grifasi-sicilia.com |date=1999-01-28 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Isle of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |title=Isle of Man Government |accessdate=2012-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510212828/http://www.gov.im/isleofman/facts.xml#flag |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is known in Manx as ''Tree Cassyn Vannin'', and [[Brittany]] where it is known as ''Triskèle''. [[Ingushetia]] also has a (stylised) triskelion in its flag.

The triskelion symbol appears in many early cultures, the first in [[Malta]] (4400–3600 BCE) and in the astronomical calendar at the famous megalithic tomb of [[Newgrange]] in Ireland built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowth.com/newgrange.htm |title=Newgrange Ireland - Megalithic Passage Tomb - World Heritage Site |publisher=Knowth.com |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] vessels, on coinage in [[Lycia]], and on [[stater]]s of [[Pamphylia]] (at [[Aspendos]], 370–333 BCE) and [[Pisidia]]. It appears as a [[heraldic]] emblem on warriors' shields depicted on Greek pottery.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the trislele on [[Achilles]]' round shield on an Attic late 6th century BCE ''[[hydria]]'' at the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], illustrated in John Boardman, Jasper Griffin and Oswyn Murray, ''Greece and the Hellenistic World'' (Oxford History of the Classical World) vol. I (1988), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triskelion is an ancient symbol of [[Sicily]], with the head of the [[Gorgon]], with snakes as hair, from which radiate three legs bent at the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weddinginsicily.co.uk/wedding_sicily_trinacria.htm|title=Weddings in Sicily Taormina|website=www.weddinginsicily.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of [[Magna Graecia]], the colonial extension of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] beyond the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].&lt;ref name="naples"&gt;Matthews, Jeff (2005) [http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm Symbols of Naples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030202145/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/symbols.htm |date=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the [[triangle|triangular]] form of the island, the ancient ''[[Kingdom of Sicily|Trinacria]]'' (from the Greek ''tri-'' (three) and ἄκρα ''akra'' (end, peak, citadel), which consists of three large capes equidistant{{fact|date=July 2018}} from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were [[Punta del Faro|Pelorus]], [[Capo Passero|Pachynus]], and [[Marsala|Lilybæum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The [[Celtic art|Celtic]] symbol of [[triple spiral|three conjoined spirals]] may have had triple significance similar to the imagery that lies behind the triskelion. The triple spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe. Though popularly considered a "Celtic" symbol, it is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Murphy and Richard Moore, ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers,'' 2nd ed., Dublin: The Liffey Press, 2008, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] monument in [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Newgrange, which was built around 3200 BCE,&lt;ref name="knowth.com"/&gt; predates the Celtic arrival in Ireland, but has long since been incorporated into Celtic culture. The symbol is also found [[petroglyph|carved in rock]] in [[Castro Culture]] settlement in modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. In Ireland before the 5th century, in [[Celtic Christianity]] the triskele took on new meaning, as a symbol of the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and therefore also a symbol of eternity. Its popularity continues today as a decorative symbol of faith for Christians of Celtic descent around the world.

==Asian usage==
Traditional Asian versions of the triskelion include the Japanese [[Mitsudomoe]], the Tibetan Buddhist [[Gankyil]], and the Korean [[Taegeuk#Tricolored Taegeuk|Sam Taegeuk]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
{{clear-left}}

==Modern usage==
A triskelion is featured on the seal of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A triskelion shape is the basis for the [[roundel]] of the [[Irish Air Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Aircraft Encyclopedia'' by Roy Braybrook, {{ISBN|0-671-55337-2}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the logo for the [[Trisquel]] [[Linux distribution]].

A triskelion shape was used in the design of RCA's "Spider" [[45 rpm adapter]], a popular plastic adapter for vinyl records, which allows larger center-holed 45 rpm records (commonly used on 7" singles and EPs) to spin on players designed for smaller center-holed 33-1/3 rpm records (the standard for 10" and 12" LPs). The design was practical, the three curved arms providing equal spring and thus keeping the hole centred. The iconic design of the Spider has led to its adoption as a popular symbol for record and music enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |title=We Love Life: Music - 45 RPM Adapters |publisher=Welove-music.com |date=2009-11-26 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202110840/http://www.welove-music.com/blog/index.php/technology/45-rpm-adapters/ |archivedate=2009-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.boingboing.net/2008/12/05/twenty-45-adapters.html |title=Boing Boing: Gadgets - Twenty 45 adapters |publisher=Gadgets.boingboing.net|date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most commonly used symbols of the [[BDSM#Symbols|BDSM]] community is a derivation of a triskelion shape within a circle.&lt;ref name=Luminais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Africa|South African]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[White supremacy|White supremacist]] [[White nationalism|White nationalist]] organization and political party [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] uses a Triskele composed of three sevens as its symbol in place of the [[Swastika|Nazi Swastika]].

The [[Flag of the Isle of Man]] bears 3 legs based on the Triskele.

The crest of the Breton [[association football|football]] club [[En Avant de Guingamp]] combines the [[Flag of Brittany]], the team colours and the triple spiral triskelion.

"[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]" is a second-season episode of the American science fiction television series ''[[Star Trek]]''.

In the [[Marvel Universe]], the intelligence agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uses the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]] as its headquarters {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

The Triskele is also used as a prominent symbol in MTV's "[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV Series)]]" which draws heavily from Celtic mythology. A Triskele was used by some younger betas to keep from shifting &amp; maintain calm. This happens by the beta repeating "Alpha, Beta, Omega" or "The Sun, The Moon, The Truth" over and over again until the beta is calm.

In [[Merlin (2008 TV series)]] it was used as symbol of druids.

==Reconstructionists and neopagans==
The triskele, usually consisting of spirals, but also the "horned triskelion", is used by some [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|polytheistic reconstructionist]] and [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups. As a Celtic symbol, it is used primarily by groups with a Celtic cultural orientation and, less frequently, can also be found in use by various eclectic or syncretic traditions such as [[Neopaganism]]. The spiral triskele is one of the primary symbols of [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2006) ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism''. New York, [[Kensington Books|Kensington]] Publishing Group {{ISBN|0-8065-2710-2}}. p. 132: [Among Celtic Reconstructionists] "...''An Thríbhís Mhòr'' (the great triple spiral) came into common use to refer to the three realms." Also p. 134: [On CRs] "Using Celtic symbols such as triskeles and [[triple spiral|spirals]]"&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic Reconstructionists use the symbol to represent a variety of triplicities in their cosmology and theology; it is also a favored symbol due to its association with the god [[Manannán mac Lir]].&lt;ref name="Bonewits"/&gt;

==Career==
Carlson began his [[journalism]] career as a fact-checker for ''[[Policy Review]]'',&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; a national [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] journal then published by [[The Heritage Foundation]] and since acquired by the [[Hoover Institution]].

===CNN (2000–2005)===
In 2000, Carlson co-hosted the short-lived show ''The Spin Room''.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

In 2001, Carlson was appointed co-host of ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]].'' On the show, Carlson and [[Robert Novak]] represented the political [[right-wing politics|right]] (alternating on different nights), while [[James Carville]] and [[Paul Begala]], also alternating as hosts, represented the left.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; During the same period, he also hosted a weekly public affairs program on [[PBS]], ''Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered''.

One of Carlson's most memorable appearances on ''Crossfire'' was his heated October 2004 exchange with [[Jon Stewart]], host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch Jon Stewart Call Tucker Carlson a "Dick" in Epic 2004 'Crossfire' Takedown |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-stewart-takes-down-tucker-carlson-crossfire-video-961127 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Stewart argued that Carlson and the nature of his show were harmful to political discourse in the United States.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Carlson later recalled that Stewart had stayed at CNN for hours after the show to discuss the issues he had raised on the air. "It was heartfelt," Carlson said, "He [Stewart] needed to do this."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cave |first=Damien |url=http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2004-10-24_nytimes_damien_cave.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Week in Review: If You Interview Kissinger, Are You Still a Comedian? |work=The New York Times |date=October 24, 2004 |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |via=Msl1.mit.edu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405064722/http://msl1.mit.edu/furdlog/docs/nytimes/2004-10-24_nytimes_damien_cave.pdf |archive-date=April 5, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, CNN announced they were ending their relationship with Carlson and would soon cancel ''Crossfire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalhumor.about.com/b/2005/01/07/jon-stewarts-wish-fulfilled-crossfire-to-stop-hurting-america.htm |title=Jon Stewart's Wish Fulfilled; 'Crossfire' to Stop 'Hurting America' |publisher=Politicalhumor.about.com |date=January 7, 2005 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/06crossfire.html?_r=1 "CNN Will Cancel 'Crossfire' and Cut Ties to Commentator"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.

[CNN] was a frustrating place to work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8607737266932832438&amp;q=tucker+carlson&amp;hl=en |title=Tucker Carlson Leaving CNN| accessdate=August 17, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MSNBC (2005–2008)===
{{Main|Tucker (2005 TV program)}}

Carlson's early evening show, ''Tucker'' (originally titled ''The Situation With Tucker Carlson'') premiered on June 13, 2005, on [[MSNBC]].

Carlson also hosted a late afternoon weekday wrap-up for MSNBC during the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], during which he attempted to learn how to play various Olympic sports. In July 2006, he reported live for ''Tucker'' from [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], during the [[2006 Lebanon War]] between Israel and [[Hezbollah]] in southern Lebanon. While in the [[Middle East]], he also hosted ''MSNBC Special Report: Mideast Crisis''.  He appeared regularly on ''[[Verdict with Dan Abrams]]'' as a panelist in political discussions.

''Tucker'' lasted fewer than three full seasons. The network announced its cancellation due to low ratings on March 10, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Gregory Replaces Tucker Carlson on MSNBC Evening Shift |date=March 10, 2008 |agency=Associated Press|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,336470,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final episode aired on March 14, 2008. Brian Stelter of ''The New York Times'' wrote that "during Mr. Carlson's tenure, MSNBC's evening programming moved gradually to the left. His former time slots, 6 and 9 p.m., were then occupied by two liberals, [[Ed Schultz]] and [[Rachel Maddow]]." Carlson stated that the network had changed a lot and "they didn't have a role for me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter|first=Brian|title=Tucker Carlson turns 40, moves to Fox News|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/tucker-carlson-turns-40-moves-to-fox-news/|accessdate=March 4, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlson served as editor-in-chief, and occasionally wrote opinion pieces with Patel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailycaller.com/author/carlsonandpatel/|title=Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel Author Page|work=The Daily Caller|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was funded by the conservative activist [[Foster Friess|Foster Freiss]].&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; By February ''The Daily Caller'' was part of the White House rotating press pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0210/Daily_Caller_joins_WH_pool.html|title=Daily Caller joins W.H. pool|last=Calderone|first=Michael|date=February 1, 2010|work=Politico|accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Politico]]'', Carlson said that ''The Daily Caller'' would not be tied to ideology but rather will be "breaking stories of importance". In a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article, Carlson added, "We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone." Columnist [[Mickey Kaus]] quit after Carlson refused to run a column critical of [[Fox News]]'s coverage of the immigration policy debate due to his contractual obligations to Fox News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/mickey-kaus-quits-daily-caller-after-tucker-carlson-204135.html|title=Mickey Kaus quits Daily Caller after Tucker Carlson pulls critical Fox News column|last1=Byers|first1=Dylan|date=March 17, 2015|work=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2015/03/18/daily-callers-tucker-carlson-takes-a-stand-for-censorship/|title=Daily Caller's Tucker Carlson takes a stand for censorship|last1=Wemple|first1=Erik|date=March 18, 2015|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

=== ''Dancing with the Stars'' ===
Carlson was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 3)|season 3]] of the [[reality show]] ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', which aired in 2006; he was paired with professional dancer [[Elena Grinenko]]. Carlson took four-hour-a-day [[ballroom dance]] classes in preparation for the competition. In an interview a month before the show began, he lamented that he would miss classes during a two-week-long MSNBC assignment in Lebanon, noting that "It's hard for me to remember the moves."&lt;ref name="AR2006081401091.html"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401091.html|title=Names &amp; Faces|date=August 15, 2006|accessdate=August 5, 2009|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson said he accepted ABC's invitation to perform because "I don't do things that I'm not good at very often. I'm psyched to get to do that."&lt;ref name="AR2006081401091.html" /&gt; Carlson was the first contestant eliminated, on September 13, 2006.&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;

==Political views==
===Capitalism===
Although in favor of conservative economic policies, Carlson is critical of pure libertarian [[free market]] ideals, saying that economic and technological change that occurs too quickly can cause widespread social and political upheaval. He has stated that one model to follow is that of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], whose interventionist role in the economy in the early 1900s may have, in Carlson's view, prevented a [[Communist]] revolution in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh8vqof9hAk&amp;t=1966s|title=Sunday Special Ep 26: Tucker Carlson|publisher=thedailywire.com|date=November 4, 2018|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservatism===
Carlson is considered a conservative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/media/cnn-will-cancel-crossfire-and-cut-ties-to-commentator.html|title=CNN Will Cancel 'Crossfire' and Cut Ties to Commentator|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=January 6, 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/life-after-bill-oreilly-for-fox-news-to-include-tucker-carlson.html|title=For Fox News, Life After Bill O'Reilly Will Feature Tucker Carlson|last=Grynbaum|first=Michael M.|date=April 19, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Koblin|first2=John|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; , though he has been associated with [[Libertarianism|Libertarian politics]] in the past.

Carlson criticized 2008 presidential candidate [[John McCain]] for being insufficiently ideological. Speaking to [[Salon.com]], Carlson stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I liked McCain. And I would have voted for McCain for president happily, not because I agree with his politics; I never took McCain's politics seriously enough even to have strong feelings about them. I don't think McCain has very strong politics. He's interested in ideas almost as little as [[George W. Bush]] is. McCain isn't intellectual, and doesn't have a strong ideology at all. He's wound up sort of as a liberal Republican because he's mad at other Republicans, not because he's a liberal.&lt;ref name="salon 20030913"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lauerman |first=Kerry |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/09/13/carlson/index.html |title="You burn out fast when you demagogue" – Salon.com |publisher=Dir.salon.com |date=September 13, 2003 |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512193301/http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/2003/09/13/carlson/index.html |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carlson has stated that former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] is not a true conservative. In an August 27, 2004, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' interview, Carlson expressed his "displeasure with Bush".&lt;ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39712-2004Aug27.html |title=Republican Convention: Tucker Carlson (washingtonpost.com) |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=August 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson did not vote in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], citing his disgust with the [[Iraq War]] and his disillusionment with the once [[small government|small-government]] Republican Party. He would go on to say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what you consider conservative, but I'm not much of a liberal, at least as the word is currently defined. For instance, I'm utterly opposed to [[abortion]], which I think is horrible and cruel. I think [[affirmative action]] is wrong. I'd like to slow immigration pretty dramatically. I hate all nanny state regulations, such as seat belt laws and smoking bans. I'm not for [[big government]]. I think the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad. I think these are conservative impulses. So by my criteria, Bush isn't much of a conservative.&lt;ref name="A39712-2004Aug27.html"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Carlson said in an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that he thinks "that the U.S. ought to hesitate before intervening abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/item/25081-change-from-kelly-to-carlson-may-give-fox-viewers-a-new-perspective|title=Change from Kelly to Carlson May Give Fox Viewers a New Perspective|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson is skeptical of foreign intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/feature/tucker-carlson-goes-war-against-the-neocons-21545?page=show|title=Tucker Carlson Goes to War Against the Neocons|first=Curt|last=Mills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq====
Carlson initially supported the U.S. war with Iraq during its first year. After a year, however, he began criticizing the war, telling the ''[[New York Observer]], "''I think it's a total nightmare and disaster, and I'm ashamed that I went against my own instincts in supporting it. It's something I'll never do again. Never. I got convinced by a friend of mine who's smarter than I am, and I shouldn't have done that. No. I want things to work out, but I'm enraged by it, actually."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=49632&amp;Disp=14&amp;Trace=on |title=LP: Newly Dovish, Tucker Carlson Goes Public (Tucker Carlson turns against the war) |publisher=Libertypost.org |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
In a July 2018 interview about Russian involvement in U.S. elections, Carlson said that [[Mexico]] has interfered in U.S. elections "more successfully" than Russia by "packing our electorate" through mass immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/397329-tucker-carlson-mexico-has-interfered-in-us-elections-more-successfully-than|title=Tucker Carlson: Mexico has interfered in US elections 'more successfully' than Russia|last=Greenwood|first=Max|date=July 16, 2018|work=TheHill|access-date=October 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assertion was disputed by journalist Philip Bump, who wrote that the number of Mexicans in the U.S. had decreased since 2009 and asked rhetorically, "What good has it done Mexico to have a number of its citizens move to the United States and gain the right to vote?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/17/tucker-carlson-identifies-the-actual-threat-to-american-democracy-hispanic-voters/|title=Analysis {{!}} Tucker Carlson identifies the actual threat to American democracy: Hispanic voters|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
Carlson has said he does not consider Russia a serious threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/tucker-carlson-is-doing-something-extraordinary/533586/|title=Tucker Carlson Is Doing Something Extraordinary|last=Beinart|first=Peter|work=The Atlantic|access-date=July 22, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson has called for the United States to work with Russia in the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/12/why-two-talking-heads-on-fox-news-just-rehashed-the-debates-of-1938/|title=Why two talking heads on Fox News just rehashed the debates of 1938|last=Heilbrunn|first=Jacob|date=July 12, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Heilbrunn|first2=Jacob|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes overthrowing [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Peter Beinart]] of ''[[the Atlantic]]'' said that Carlson has been an "apologist for Donald Trump on the Russia scandal".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Carlson described the controversy in the wake of revelations that [[Donald Trump Jr.]] was [[Trump campaign–Russian meetings|willing to accept anti-Clinton information from a Russian government official]] as a "new level of hysteria" and said that Trump Jr. had only been "gossiping with foreigners."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Syria ====
In April 2018, Carlson questioned whether Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was responsible for a chemical attack that occurred the same month and killed dozens.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/syria/fox-news-host-u-s-bombing-syria-could-lead-to-genocide-of-christian-1.5990560|title=Fox News Host: We Tolerate Saudi Atrocities in Yemen, So Why Not Assad's in Syria?|last=Haaretz|date=April 11, 2018|work=Haaretz|access-date=April 13, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson suggested, alluding to various [[conspiracy theories]], that a similar attack that occurred the year before (the [[Khan Shaykhun chemical attack]]), which was widely attributed to Assad's forces, was a [[False flag|false flag attack]] perpetrated to falsely implicate the Assad government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Immigration, race and diversity===
Carlson has been accused by Erik Wemple of ''The Washington Post'' and by writers for Vox.com of demonizing immigrants, both those who immigrated to the U.S. legally and illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/7/21/16008190/strikethrough-white-supremacists-love-tucker-carlson|title=Why white supremacists love Tucker Carlson|work=Vox|access-date=July 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/07/20/in-his-quest-to-demonize-immigrants-fox-newss-tucker-carlson-misses-a-good-story/|title=In his quest to demonize immigrants, Fox News's Tucker Carlson misses a good story|last=Wemple|first=Erik|date=July 20, 2017|work=The Washington Post|access-date=July 22, 2017|last2=Wemple|first2=Erik|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/05/08/fox-newss-tucker-carlson-demagogued-a-rape-case-involving-immigrants-then-they-were-cleared/|title=Fox News's Tucker Carlson demagogued a rape case involving immigrants.

When Mitt Romney condemned then-candidate Donald Trump for his refusal to condemn the Ku Klux Klan, saying it was a "disqualifying and disgusting response... His coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of America," Carlson criticized Romney. Carlson said, "Obama could have written" that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11084.html|title=Identity Crisis|last=|first=|date=|website=Princeton University Press|page=88|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Carlson said that [[Sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh|sexual assault allegations]] against Supreme Court justice nominee [[Brett Kavanaugh]] demonstrated "the left's war on old white men", and suggested that there could be a race war in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-race-war-brett-kavanaugh-1145172|title=Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggests a race war in America could be coming after Brett Kavanaugh hearing|date=September 29, 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=October 2, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Africa====
{{unbalanced-section|date=November 2018}}
In August 2018, Carlson ran a segment where he alleged that the South African government was targeting white farmers due to anti-white racism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/23/now-trump-is-having-a-twitter-spat-with-south-africa-over-land-reforms.html|title=Trump hypes fringe talking point about South African government 'seizing land from white farmers'|last=Ellyatt|first=Holly|date=August 23, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/world/africa/trump-south-africa-white-farmers.html|title=Trump Cites False Claims of Widespread Attacks on White Farmers in South Africa|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45282088|title=SA rejects Trump tweet on farmer killings|date=August 23, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the segment, Carlson criticized "elites" who were purportedly concerned about racism "paying no attention" to the "racist government of South Africa."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Carlson said that "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa had 'changed the country's constitution to make it possible to steal land from people because they are the wrong skin color.'

Mr. Ramaphosa has said that speeding up [land reform] will bolster economic growth and agricultural production. More fundamentally, the government has argued, returning land to black South Africans would make the country [more] just."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Following the Carlson segment, U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to "closely study the South Africa land and farm seizure and large scale killing of farmers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Trump's tweet was denounced as "'misinformed'" by the South African government, which stated that it would address the matter through diplomatic channels.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are no reliable figures that suggest that farmers are at greater risk of being killed than the average South African.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt; Some South African blacks have sought to retake land to which they have made claims, but South African police have stopped such ''ad hoc'' attempts at appropriating land.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The South African right-wing group AfriForum took credit for Carlson and Trump's statements, saying it believed that its campaign to influence American politics had succeeded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

On August 23, 2018, Carlson corrected certain statements about South Africa that he had made the previous evening, but did not admit having made errors. He said that the proposed constitutional amendment was still being debated in South Africa and added that no farms had yet been expropriated.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; Carlson later stated in an interview that he "doesn't  believe anyone should be rewarded or punished based upon characteristics they can't control" and added that his South Africa segment made "'an argument against tribalism'".&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;

===Libertarianism===
[[Image:TuckerRonPaul.jpg|thumb|Tucker Carlson at a 2007 [[Ron Paul]] presidential event]]
Carlson voted for [[Ron Paul]] in 1988 when he was running as the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allronpaul.blogspot.com/2007/05/msnbc-tucker-carlson-interviews-ron.html |title=All Ron Paul: Transcript: Tucker Carlson interviews Ron Paul on MSNBC before the May 3 debate |publisher=Allronpaul.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2007, it was reported that Carlson lobbied Nevada brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] to support Paul's candidacy.

[[File:Tucker Carlson (5222916).jpg|thumb|Carlson wearing a bow tie in early 2004]]
Carlson was known for wearing [[bow tie]]s both on- and off-air until 2006.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joketribe.com/video/Jon.Stewart.On.Crossfire.php |title=Jon Stewart Exposes The Fallacy Of The News Media on CNN's Crossfire |publisher=JokeTribe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 on the season-five episode of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', "[[List of Curb Your Enthusiasm episodes#Season 5 (2005)|The Bowtie]]", a character refers to [[Larry David]] as "Tucker Carlson" for wearing one. On April 11, 2006, Carlson announced on his MSNBC show that he would no longer be wearing either a bow tie or a regular tie, adding, "I just decided I wanted to give my neck a break. A little change is good once in a while, and I feel better already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title="The Situation with Tucker Carlson" for April 11 |format=transcript |date=April 11, 2006 |work=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12285620/ |quote=Well, if you watched this show before you may have noticed that I look different tonight.

I like bow ties, and I certainly spent a lot of time defending them. But from now on I'm going without: no ties at all. I didn't lose a bet. It is not a political statement.

===Sexism allegation===
Carlson endorsed controversial comments made by his brother, Buckley, about a spokeswoman for [[New York City Mayor]] [[Bill de Blasio]]. The spokesperson had asked for corrections to a story, and Buckley called her a "whiny little self-righteous bitch" and made sexually derogatory remarks. Tucker wrote that Buckley "meant it in the nicest way." Former speaker of the New York City Council [[Christine Quinn]] called on both Carlsons to apologize for the "offensive" and "sexist" comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/city-hall-aide-rips-daily-caller-boss-insulting-email-article-1.2162433|title=Bill de Blasio aide slams 'Daily Caller' founder Tucker Carlson and his brother for subjecting her to disparaging comments – NY Daily News|first=Jennifer|last=Fermino|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/tucker-carlson-brother-sent-profanity-laced-email-in-nicest-way-204536|title=Tucker Carlson: Brother sent profanity-laced email in 'nicest way'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/03/26/tucker-carlson-bro-caught-in-email-snafu-against-de-blasio-aide/|title=Tucker Carlson &amp; bro caught in email snafu against de Blasio aide|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encounters with protesters ===
On the night of November 8, 2018, a group of [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]] activists gathered in the street outside Carlson's home in [[Washington, D.C.]] for about ten minutes, chanting, "we know where you sleep at night!" Carlson's driveway was also vandalized with a spray-painted anarchist symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/antifa-group-chants-outside-vandalizes-fox-commentator-tucker-carlson-s-n934131|title=Antifa group chants outside, vandalizes Fox commentator Tucker Carlson's home|last1=Fieldstadt|first1=Elisha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson, who was not home at the time, asserted that "someone started throwing himself against the front door and actually cracked the front door",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/11/08/heres-the-vandalism-that-protesters-left-at-tucker-carlsons-house/&lt;/ref&gt; although a police report did not note any visible damage to the door; his wife, who was home, called 911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/media/tucker-carlson-cracked-door/index.html|title=Police say there was no visible 'crack' on Tucker Carlson's front door after Antifa protest|last=Business|first=Brian Stelter, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police opened an investigation into the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/08/they-were-threatening-me-my-family-tucker-carlsons-home-targeted-by-protesters/|title=‘They were threatening me and my family’: Tucker Carlson’s home targeted by protesters|last1=Chiu|first1=Allyson|date=November 8, 2018|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 8, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/anti-fascist-protesters-target-tucker-carlsons-home/2018/11/08/6c91ad78-e36d-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html|title=Anti-fascist protesters target Tucker Carlson’s home|last1=Chiu|first1=Allyson|date=November 8, 2018|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 8, 2018|last2=Stein|first2=Perry|language=en|last3=Brown|first3=Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/media/tucker-carlson-cracked-door/index.html|title=Police say there was no visible 'crack' on Tucker Carlson's front door after Antifa protest|last=Business|first=Brian Stelter, CNN|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Carlson is married to Susan Carlson (née Andrews).&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt; Together, they have three daughters and one son.&lt;ref name="peoplemag" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/travel/tmagazine/15T-FISH.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=|title=Off the Hook|last=Carlson|first=Tucker|date=May 15, 2005|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson is an [[Episcopal Church USA|Episcopalian]] and "loves the liturgy, though he abhors the liberals who run the denomination".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kelefa |last=Sanneh |title=Tucker Carlson's Fighting Words |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/tucker-carlsons-fighting-words |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=April 10, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlson quit drinking alcohol in 2002, "having decided that neither the pleasant nights nor the unpleasant mornings were improving his life".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words" /&gt; Years earlier, he had quit smoking and replaced cigarettes with nicotine gum, which he buys in bulk from New Zealand and "chews constantly".&lt;ref name="Fighting-Words" /&gt;

==Books==

In 2003, Carlson authored the memoir ''Politicians, Partisans and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News'', about his television news experiences; the publisher was [[Warner Books]].&lt;ref name=adventures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonian.com/bookreviews/currentaffairs/politicians-partisans-and-parasites-my-adventures-in-cable-news.php|title=Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News|work=Washingtonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the book's revelations was Carlson's description of being falsely accused of [[rape]] by a woman he did not know who suffered from severe [[mental illness]] and displayed [[stalking|stalker]]-like behavior. Carlson wrote in the book that the incident was emotionally [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News|last=Carlson|first=Tucker|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JoFL9epFbcC&amp;pg=PT103&amp;dq=Tucker+Carlson+rape&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2M47U_maMYjSsAT6uIGADg&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tucker%20Carlson%20rape&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Carlson, represented by the literary and creative agency [[Javelin (company)|Javelin]], signed an eight-figure, two-book deal with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'s [[Threshold Editions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 2, 2017 |title=Tucker Carlson Gets Two-Book, Eight-Figure Deal |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bookmark/tucker-carlson-gets-two-book-eight-figure-deal-999704 |agency=AP }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first book in the series, ''[[Ship of Fools (book)|Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution]]'', was released in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fox News' Tucker Carlson exposes 'elites' in his book 'Ship of Fools' |url=https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-now/fox-news-tucker-carlson-exposes-elites-in-his-book-ship-of-fools/465-3c0e29a4-8d8d-45ba-a438-51540c220ea5 |first=Dave |last=Osborn |date=October 2, 2018 |publisher=''Naples Daily News''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at #1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tucker Carlson's new book topples Woodward from #1 on New York Times best-seller list |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/410912-tucker-carlsons-new-book-topples-woodward-from-1-on-new-york-times-bestseller |first=Joe |last=Concha |date=October 11, 2018 |publisher=''The Hill''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal Space Interface Standard''' ('''USIS''') is a physical interface between medium to large manned or unmanned spacecraft such as satellites, [[space station]]s and service tugs.&lt;ref name= USISA/&gt; It is designed to be suitable for adoption as an [[technical standard|industry standard]]. Development is currently being undertaken by [[Mark Hempsell]] at Hempsell Astronautics Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hempsellastro.com/about/|title= Hempsell Astronautics Company Information|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale for the creation of an industry standard for spacecraft interfaces is that the number of applications for space vehicles is likely to increase greatly in the future ([[space tourism]] being a recent example). If each craft is utilising a common interface many new applications become feasible. This is somewhat analogous to the benefits which have been gained by widespread adoption of the [[USB]] connector in computing or even the standardisation of [[AC power plugs and sockets]] across some parts of the world.

==Design==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:USIS Designs.jpeg|thumbnail|right|Three designs for USIS proposed by [[Reaction Engines]], [[Qinetiq]] and Hempsell Astronautics.]] --&gt;
The fundamental purpose of USIS has been stated to "be a standard connection that maximises the interconnectivity between independent systems in both the open space (orbital) and celestial body surface environments".&lt;ref name= USISSpec&gt;{{Cite report |author= USIS Association|authorlink= |coauthors= |date= 28 April 2014|title= Requirement Specification for a universal space interface standard DRAFT|url= http://www.usisassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/USIS-Requirement-Specification-Draft-Fb.pdf|publisher= |page= |docket= |accessdate= 28 September 2014|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this USIS must be suitable for a range of connection types, from ground made connections to hard docking between orbiting spacecraft. It must also be highly interconnectable (for example being fully androgynous, any two USISs being compatible), capable of bearing expected loads, capable of soft capture, and be able to sever the connection in a controlled manner. USIS also needs to be able to facilitate data, power and resource transfer when connected, and allow easy passage of personnel who are not necessarily trained astronauts in anticipation of the [[Space Tourism]] industry.&lt;ref name= USISSpec/&gt;
Three potential designs have been proposed for the USIS concept, one from [[Reaction Engines]], one from [[Qinetiq]] and one most recently from Hempsell Astronautics.&lt;ref name=USISA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usisassociation.org/usis/ |title= USIS Association Information |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''Voigt notation''' or '''Voigt form''' in [[multilinear algebra]] is a way to represent a [[symmetric tensor]] by reducing its order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
  | title = Lehrbuch der kristallphysik
  | author = Woldemar Voigt
  | year = 1910
  | publisher = Teubner, Leipzig
  | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SvPPAAAAMAAJ
  | access-date = November 29, 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: '''Mandel notation''', '''Mandel–Voigt notation''' and '''Nye notation''' are others found. '''Kelvin notation''' is a revival by Helbig&lt;ref name="Helbig"&gt;{{Cite book
  | author = Klaus Helbig
  | title = Foundations of anisotropy for exploration seismics
  | publisher = Pergamon
  | year = 1994
  | isbn = 0-08-037224-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; of old ideas of [[Lord Kelvin]]. The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application.

For example, a 2&amp;times;2 symmetric tensor '''''X''''' has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed as the vector

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x_{1 1}, x_{2 2}, x_{1 2}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

As another example:

The stress tensor (in matrix notation) is given as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{xx} &amp; \sigma_{xy} &amp; \sigma_{xz} \\
  \sigma_{yx} &amp; \sigma_{yy} &amp; \sigma_{yz} \\
  \sigma_{zx} &amp; \sigma_{zy} &amp; \sigma_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

In Voigt notation it is simplified to a 6-dimensional vector:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\sigma= (\sigma_{xx}, \sigma_{yy}, \sigma_{zz},
  \sigma_{yz},\sigma_{xz},\sigma_{xy}) \equiv (\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3, \sigma_4, \sigma_5, \sigma_6).
&lt;/math&gt;

The strain tensor, similar in nature to the stress tensor—both are symmetric second-order tensors --, is given in matrix form as
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\epsilon}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \epsilon_{xx} &amp; \epsilon_{xy} &amp; \epsilon_{xz} \\
  \epsilon_{yx} &amp; \epsilon_{yy} &amp; \epsilon_{yz} \\
  \epsilon_{zx} &amp; \epsilon_{zy} &amp; \epsilon_{zz}
\end{matrix}}\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

Its representation in Voigt notation is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\epsilon= (\epsilon_{xx}, \epsilon_{yy}, \epsilon_{zz},
  \gamma_{yz},\gamma_{xz},\gamma_{xy}) \equiv (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2, \epsilon_3, \epsilon_4, \epsilon_5, \epsilon_6),
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{xy}=2\epsilon_{xy}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{yz}=2\epsilon_{yz}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{zx}=2\epsilon_{zx}&lt;/math&gt; are engineering shear strains.

The benefit of using different representations for stress and strain is that the scalar invariance
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}\cdot\boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \sigma_{ij}\epsilon_{ij} = \tilde\sigma \cdot \tilde\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;
is preserved.

Likewise, a three-dimensional symmetric fourth-order tensor can be reduced to a 6&amp;times;6 matrix.

== Mnemonic rule ==
A simple [[Mnemonic|mnemonic rule]] for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows:

* Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor)
* Strike out the diagonal
* Continue on the third column
* Go back to the first element along the first row.

Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue).

[[File:Voigt notation Mnemonic rule.svg|180px]]

==Mandel notation==
For a symmetric tensor of second rank
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\sigma}=
\left[{\begin{matrix}
  \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} &amp; \sigma_{13} \\
  \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} &amp; \sigma_{23} \\
  \sigma_{31} &amp; \sigma_{32} &amp; \sigma_{33}
\end{matrix}}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

only six components are distinct, the three on the diagonal and the others being off-diagonal. 
Thus it can be expressed, in Mandel notation, as the vector
:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde \sigma ^M=
\langle \sigma_{11}, 
\sigma_{22},
\sigma_{33},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{23},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{13},
\sqrt 2 \sigma_{12}
\rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

The main advantage of Mandel notation is to allow the use of the same conventional operations used with vectors,
for example:
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde \sigma : \tilde \sigma = \tilde \sigma^M \cdot \tilde \sigma^M = 
\sigma_{11}^2 +
\sigma_{22}^2 +
\sigma_{33}^2 +
2 \sigma_{23}^2 +
2 \sigma_{13}^2 +
2 \sigma_{12}^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

A symmetric tensor of rank four satisfying &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{jikl} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; D_{ijkl} = D_{ijlk} &lt;/math&gt; has 81 components in three-dimensional space, but only 36 
components are distinct. Thus, in Mandel notation, it can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde D^M=
\begin{pmatrix}
  D_{1111} &amp; D_{1122} &amp; D_{1133}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1123} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1113} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1112} \\
  D_{2211} &amp; D_{2222} &amp; D_{2233}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2223} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2213} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2212} \\
  D_{3311} &amp; D_{3322} &amp; D_{3333}  &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3323} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3313} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{3312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{2311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{2333}  &amp; 2 D_{2323} &amp; 2 D_{2313} &amp; 2 D_{2312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1311} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1322} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1333}  &amp; 2 D_{1323} &amp; 2 D_{1313} &amp; 2 D_{1312} \\
  \sqrt 2 D_{1211} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1222} &amp; \sqrt 2 D_{1233}  &amp; 2 D_{1223} &amp; 2 D_{1213} &amp; 2 D_{1212} \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
The notation is named after physicist [[Woldemar Voigt]].  It is useful, for example, in calculations involving constitutive models to simulate materials, such as the generalized [[Hooke's law]], as well as [[finite element analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke's law has a symmetric fourth-order stiffness tensor with 81 components (3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3&amp;times;3), but because the application of such a rank-4 tensor to a symmetric rank-2 tensor must yield another symmetric rank-2 tensor, not all of the 81 elements are independent. Voigt notation enables such a rank-4 tensor to be &lt;i&gt;represented&lt;/i&gt; by a 6&amp;times;6 matrix. However, Voigt's form does not preserve the sum of the squares, which in the case of Hooke's law has geometric significance. This explains why weights are introduced (to make the mapping an [[isometry]]).

A discussion of invariance of Voigt's notation and Mandel's notation be found in Helnwein (2001).&lt;ref name="Helnwein"&gt;{{cite journal

'''White pride''' or '''White power''' is an expression primarily used by [[white separatism|white separatist]], [[white nationalism|white nationalist]], [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organizations in order to signal [[racism|racist]] or [[racialist]] viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van McVey|first=Sarah|title=Race, Gender, and the Contemporary White Supremacy Movement: The Intersection of "isms" and Organized Racist Groups|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabriel2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gabriel, John|title=Whitewash: Racialized Politics and the Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80CEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5|date=4 January 2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-75016-0|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a slogan used by the prominent post-[[Ku Klux Klan]] group [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and a term used to make racist/racialist viewpoints more palatable to the general public who may associate historical abuses with the terms "white nationalist", "neo-Nazi", and "white supremacist".

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile identified "White Power! White Pride!" as "a much-used chant of white separatist movement supporters",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Dobratz| first=Betty A. |last2=Shanks-Meile |first2= Stephanie L.| title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: White Power, White Pride | place=Baltimore|  publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | year=2001 |isbn=0-8018-6537-9|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologist Mitch Berbrier has identified the use of this phrase as part of a "new racist&amp;nbsp;... frame-transformation and frame-alignment by (a) consciously packaging a 'hate-free' racism, (b) developing strategies of equivalence and reversal–presenting whites as equivalent to ethnic and racial minorities, and (c) deploying ideas about 'love,' 'pride,' and 'heritage-preservation' to evidence both their putative lack of animosity toward others as well as their ethnic credentials."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Half the Battle": Cultural Resonance, Framing Processes, and Ethnic Affectations in Contemporary White Separatist Rhetoric|url = http://socpro.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/4/431|journal = Social Problems|date = 1998-11-01|issn = 0037-7791|pages = 431–450|volume = 45|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/3097206|language = en|first = Mitch|last = Berbrier|jstor = 3097206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[social psychology]] experiment that tested how white participants could be influenced to identify with white pride ideology, social psychologists framed white pride as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;[P]eople who openly express White pride seem invariably to be those alienated from the mainstream culture—KKK members, [[Skinhead|skin-heads]], and White supremacists—people trying to grab onto some basis for feeling good about themselves when conventional avenues such as successful careers and relationships are not working well for them.

Samson documented the rhetorical evolution of white pride movements thus, "Because white pride has historically been predicated upon a denigration of nonwhites, the articulation of the duties and requirements of whiteness reflects a desire to correlate a conscious white identity with positive attributes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Monica|last2=Samson|first2=Frank L.|date=2005-01-01|title=White Racial and Ethnic Identity in the United States|jstor=29737719|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=31|pages=245–261|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.31.041304.122322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and social scientists commonly argue that the idea of "white pride" is an attempt to provide a clean or more palatable public face for white supremacy or white separatism and that it is an appeal to a larger audience in hopes of inciting more widespread racial violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration |last=Swain |first=Carol M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-80886-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph T. Roy of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], white supremacists often circulate material on the internet and elsewhere that "portrays the groups not as haters, but as simple white pride civic groups concerned with social ills".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://judiciary.senate.gov/oldsite/91499jtr.htm |title=Statement of Joseph T.

By contrast, then, "affirmations of white pride—however thinly cloaked as affirmations of ethnic pride—serve to mask and perpetuate [[white privilege]]".&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |title=Rights, Democracy, and Fulfillment in the Era of Identity Politics: Principled Compromises in a Compromised World |last=Ingram |first=David |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |place= Lanham, MD|isbn=0-7425-3348-4 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, Professor of Education at [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], Cris Mayo, characterizes white pride as "a politically distasteful goal, given that whiteness is not a personal or community identity, but has been a strategy to maintain [[social inequality|inequities]] of privilege and power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Certain Privilege: Rethinking White Agency {{!}} Mayo {{!}} Philosophy of Education Archive|url = http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes/article/viewArticle/1675|website = ojs.ed.uiuc.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-04|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political science|Political scientists]] [[Carol M. Swain]] and Russell Nieli, in their text on white nationalism, identify the idea of "white pride" as a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. They argue that over the course of the 1990s, "a new white pride, white protest, and white consciousness movement has developed in America". They identify three contributing factors: an immigrant influx during the 1980s and 1990s, resentment over [[affirmative action]] policies, and the growth of the Internet as a tool for the expression and mobilization of grievances.&lt;ref name="swain5"&gt;*{{citation |last=Swain| first=Carol M. |last2=Nieli |first2=Russell|title=Contemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America |place=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year=2003 |isbn=0-521-01693-2 |page=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Janet E. Helms]], founding director of [[Boston College]]'s Institute for the Study and Promotion of Race and Culture, a white person "must become aware of his or her Whiteness, accept it as personally and socially significant ... Not in the sense of Klan members' 'white pride' but in the context of a commitment to a just society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRof9vDClvQC|title="Why are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?": And Other Conversations about Race|last=Tatum|first=Beverly Daniel|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465083617|language=en}}{{Page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among people who strongly identify as white, research differentiates between a power cognizant group and a prideful group.

'''Willful blindness''' (sometimes called '''ignorance of law''',&lt;ref name=CL /&gt;{{rp|761}} '''willful ignorance''' or '''contrived ignorance''' or '''Nelsonian knowledge''') is a term used in [[law]] to describe a situation in which a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by intentionally keeping himself or herself unaware of facts that would render him or her liable. In ''[[United States v. Jewell]]'', the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of [[knowledge (legal construct)|knowledge]] as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;''Criminal Law – Cases and Materials'', 7th ed. 2012, [[Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business]]; [[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], [[Guyora Binder]], {{ISBN|978-1-4548-0698-1}}, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}}

Although the term was originally—and still is—used in legal contexts, the phrase "willful ignorance" has come to mean any situation in which people intentionally turn their attention away from an ethical problem that is believed to be important by those using the phrase (for instance, because the problem is too disturbing for people to want it dominating their thoughts, or from the knowledge that solving the problem would require extensive effort).

== Precedent in the United States ==
In ''[[United States v. Jewell]]'', the court held that proof of willful ignorance satisfied the requirement of [[knowledge]] as to criminal possession and importation of drugs.&lt;ref name="CL" /&gt;{{rp|225}} In a number of cases in the United States of America, persons transporting packages containing illegal [[drug]]s have asserted that they never asked what the contents of the packages were and so lacked the requisite intent to break the law. Such defenses have not succeeded, as [[court]]s have been quick to determine that the [[defendant]] ''should'' have known what was in the package and exercised [[recklessness (law)|criminal recklessness]] by failing to find out the package's contents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Notably, this rule has only ever been applied to independent couriers, and has never been used to hold larger services that qualify as [[common carriers]] (e.g., [[FedEx]], [[United Parcel Service]], or the [[U.S. Postal Service]]) liable for the contents of packages they deliver.

A famous example of such a defense being denied occurred in ''[[In re Aimster Copyright Litigation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Case citation|334 F.3d 643]] ([[7th Cir.]] 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[defendant]]s argued that the [[file-swapping]] technology was designed in such a way that they had no way of monitoring the content of swapped files. They suggested that their inability to monitor the activities of users meant that they could not be contributing to [[copyright infringement]] by the users. The court held that this was willful blindness on the defendant’s part and would not constitute a defense to a claim of contributory infringement.
