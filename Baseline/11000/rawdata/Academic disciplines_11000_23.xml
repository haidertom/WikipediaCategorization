The [[United States Intelligence Community]] '''A-Space''', or '''Analytic Space''', is a project from the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]]'s (ODNI) Office of Analytic Transformation and Technology to develop a common collaborative workspace for all analysts from the [[United States Intelligence Community|USIC]].  It is accessible from common workstations and provides unprecedented access to interagency databases, a capability to search classified and unclassified sources simultaneously, web-based messaging, and collaboration tools.  The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) is the executive agent for building the first phase of A-Space. Initial operational capability was scheduled for December 2007.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23&gt;{{citation

A-Space is built on [[Jive Software]]'s [[Clearspace]] application (which has been superseded by Jive's [[Social Business Software]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of National Intelligence has identified A-Space as a critical piece of "Analytic Transformation": {{quotation |Analytic Transformation seeks to change how we approach analysis, how we interact with our customers and each other, and is one of the principal priorities of the Director of National Intelligence. US Intelligence is engaged in a fundamental transformation of the Analysis mission at the national level. }}

Within the analytic transformation program, there are several initiatives under way in three areas: 
:1) enhancing the quality of analytic products,
:2) managing the mission more effectively at a  Community level, and
:3) building more integrated analytic operations across the Intelligence Community (IC).&lt;ref name=ATC2007-09-04&gt;{{citation

For contrast, see perceived limitations of CIA information technology at [[Intelligence analysis management#Information technology|CIA Information Technology]].

==Assumptions about improving collaboration among analysts==
A-Space, according to [[Andrew McAfee]] of [[Harvard Business School]],&lt;ref name=McAfee2007&gt;{{citation

 |archivedate=9 January 2008 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a means of sharing information that, in the normal course of events, might not be seen at all. He pointed out that "companies that rely heavily on innovation" spend considerable effort improving the communications among close colleagues.  [[Mark Granovetter]]'s insight, "The Strength of Weak Ties" (SWT) was that strong ties are not enough for the best innovative environments.&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973&gt;{{citation

 | doi=10.1086/225469
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong ties between people arise from long-term, frequent, and sustained interactions; weak ties from infrequent and more casual ones. A tool such as [[Intellipedia]] or A-Space encourages [[collaboration]] among people with weak ties, complementing the traditional "team-building" and "cross-functional management" characteristic of strong ties.

"How do you transform analysis?" asked [[Thomas Fingar]], Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis at the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI). "One word: attitude. For people to collaborate and bring new and vital skills to the intelligence community, we need to change our attitude."&lt;ref name=FCW2007-09-10&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingar said "60 percent of all U.S. intelligence analysts have five years' experience or less on the job. They expect to collaborate no matter where they are and without concern for chain of command," he said. "There is a sense of urgency, a push from the bottom that didn't exist before." Fingar said intelligence failures proved the need to transform intelligence analysis.

"Analysts have become risk-averse and because of that, many times that attitude precludes good analysis," Fingar said. "We have had more than one major problem every decade since Pearl Harbor. We fail because we are not willing to collaborate or accept the risks of collaboration."

==Security==
The first requisite for such a system is that it be secure. To minimize the complexity of the first release, the initial operating capability (IOC) is Web based rather than a full desktop client.  ''Information Week'' stated that A-Space must have 16 different security waivers and move across 16 differently configured firewalls. However, all this information in the browser, even on the secure intelligence Intranet, is bound to raise hackles, presumably for the 16 [[United States Intelligence Community|Intelligence Community]] agencies, according to Mike Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analytic transformation and technology.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;
 
Even though the system will be available only to users with [[security clearance]] for TOP SECRET [[sensitive Compartmented Information|Sensitive compartmented intelligence]] (SCI), security, in the world of intelligence, is not a simple matter of clearance. Individual users will be authorized, or not authorized to access specific "compartments".  For example, while an analyst might be authorized access to the [[HUMINT]] Control System, a major category of SCI, that does not necessarily allow an analyst working on Russia to see data on spies in [[Somalia]]. Somalian and Russian information, sometimes down to the granularity of individual spy contributions, are in separate compartments.

''Information Week'' pointed out that at these security levels, the users themselves need to be monitored.  One of the ways A-Space will maintain its security will be through observing traffic patterns, the department doing things like looking out for suspiciously anomalous searches. "Let's not be [[Pollyanna]]-ish about this," Wertheimer said. "This is a [[counter-intelligence]] nightmare. You've got to ask yourself, if there's one bad apple here, how much can that bad apple learn?"&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

In many cases, an analyst will have to request access to a new compartment or specific piece of information. It is hoped that this process will be speeded by the web-based services.

==Content==
To ensure its usefulness, the project will launch with access to the three large databases of current intelligence and [[Intellipedia]]. Eventually, A-Space will be capable of carrying documents several levels above Top Secret, certified at a level that 95% of all intelligence can be stored there. Reports will be able to be tagged with important related words or phrases via a system called [[TagConnect]] and labeled by usefulness. It will eventually be able to recommend related documents to analysts, much like Amazon recommends related books.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;
{{anchor|Library of National Intelligence|LNI}}

===The Library of National Intelligence===
The Library of National Intelligence (LNI) is an ODNI project to create a repository of all Intelligence Community disseminated intelligence, regardless of classification. The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] is the executive agent for this project. The Library's electronic card catalog – containing summary information for each report – will be classified at the lowest possible level, permitting analysts to discover everything that has been published by the Intelligence Community (IC) regardless of the original classification of the document. Analysts will be able to request the products in accordance with individual access levels and security guidelines. Services provided by LNI will include the ability to request information directly from producers, qualitative measures of value, and statistics on Community coverage of priorities.&lt;ref name=ATC2007-09-04 /&gt;

===CIA WIRe===
One of the components is [[CIA WIRe]], which went into operation on 7 September 2007. It takes all the agency's intelligence information and makes it available to CIA analysts in one database. According to [[Gus Hunt]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} CIA executive agent for LNI, the full LNI became available on 31 October 2007.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It boggles my mind that it took so long to understand the concept of bringing together all the community knowledge to use effectively," Hunt said. "DNI will let users on the top-secret network share information that was agreed to be released. We now will know [all that] we know about any topic."&lt;br&gt;

[[Dale Meyerrose]], ODNI's chief information officer, said LNI will make all information discoverable [i.e., through weak links&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;], and that is just the starting point. "The pedigree we need to add to data and discovery is huge. It is larger than LNI. The finished product must include intelligence information and open-source information."&lt;ref name=FCW2007-09-10 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Social networking===
In a compartmented environment, analysts may be unaware they have a counterpart, in another IC agency, working on a related problem, and they could assist one another. This is equally true of intelligence consumers; a policymaker might be aware of a [[CIA]] report of interest, but not one from the State Department's [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]]. Indeed, both analysts and consumers may be unaware of the common interests.&lt;blockquote&gt;Social networking will be another critical part of A-Space, where analysts can create trusted contacts with other analysts and post profiles that contain updated contact information and details of their areas of expertise. The analysts' areas of expertise may be further defined through text mining software that sifts through analyst e-mail. The social networking model isn't yet set, but the DNI has invited social networking experts the likes of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and vendors to recommend and help develop specs.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again, social networking supports interaction through weak links.&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;

==Contributors==
A-Space is open to all elements of the Intelligence Community. One of the first DIA components to enter A-space will be a new [[Counter-intelligence#Counterintelligence force protection source operations|Force Protection Assessment]] system to provide knowledge management and real-time updates on operational security analyses.&lt;ref name=FCW2007-11-26&gt;{{citation

===Tactical user needs===
The need is not only seen at top executive levels.&lt;ref name=SWJ2007-11&gt;{{citation

 | title = Intelligence Collection and Sharing (Updated)
 | journal = Small Wars Journal
 | first1 = Tim | last1 =Hsia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tim Hsia, a [[United States Army]] [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]], "Market trackers absorb information continuously, rigorously track trends, and enable traders to formulate decisions based on the latest news combined with historical data. The ability of market trackers to store and quickly recall historical data should be mimicked by the U.S. government ..." Hsia mentioned that the needs for intelligence, by operational military units, are not being met in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware. A fusion of geography and intelligence within a centralized network can ensure that commanders arrive at any location with the necessary intelligence derived from years of work by previous agencies and military units that have already provided a framework for understanding the enemy and the people in his assigned area. Commanders could then be spared the countless man hours recollecting data that has already been captured thru blood, sweat, and tears [captured by weakly linked researchers&lt;ref name=Granovetter1973 /&gt;]"

He describes the field need for a database:&lt;blockquote&gt;A geointel i.e., [[geographic intelligence]] database should include all agencies of the U.S. government and also extend to coalition partners. ...only cleared individuals and organizations can access certain intelligence products. The end state would be to encompass each city in the world from South America, Asia, and the Middle East. Each city in the geointel database would {{sic|comprise| of}} an abundance of historical data consisting of analysis, logistical, intelligence products, and operational summaries from all branches of the military, the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), CIA, and [[National Security Agency]]. Moreover, the geointel database would incorporate cutting open source intelligence ([[OSINT]]) products produced by news agencies, [[RAND Corporation|RAND]], and other think tanks. By combining products from different branches within the government it would ensure that policy makers from different agencies would have a complete portrait of their region and thus prevent decisions based on data {{sic|comprised}} solely from their agency...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This fusion of intelligence would not have to be centrally managed and each commander or diplomat could individually assign and weigh different parameters and factors internally within his staff when deciding amongst several courses of action. Intelligence could be pushed down to the lowest level which would then facilitate bottom-up refinement as each new unit that was involved in a certain locale could update the existing data to include their latest experiences. The battlefield commander, diplomat, or [[United States Army Special Forces]] SF ODA (Operational Detachment-Alpha) team leader could then make informed military, foreign affairs, or political decisions that produce more effective results because the data retrieved from the geointel site would provide them with the latest ground truth supplemented with historic data.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; ... The structure of the site should provide ease of accessibility while also compartmentalizing information so that only certain areas can be accessed by individuals depending upon their level of clearance. There would need to be a thorough security vetting process to prohibit individuals from being able to achieve sensitive information outside of their region, scope, and responsibility.... An additional safeguard would be to have superiors and agencies to proof and screen all intelligence products posted by their subordinates so that faulty and inaccurate reporting could be stunted before other organizations implemented inaccurate information...readers could...view the analyst's oeuvre, credentials, and security levels and also allow the reader to directly contact the author as to their assumptions and inquire about related issues pertaining to an intelligence product.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hsia points out that while [[SIPRNET]] (i.e., operating at the SECRET security level, not the higher intelligence levels) is widely available, "Expanding this network to encompass a more centralized program of data sharing would not require any additional hardware", but software changes in the devices now used to access SIPRNET. Depending on the operational needs, it might be necessary to have additional access points. Typically, only the intelligence staff of a command has access to intelligence data above the SECRET level, just as only the operational staff have access to TOP SECRET mission planning.

==Cost==
[[Michael Wertheimer]] emphasized working with small prototypes at first, which are likely to demonstrate failures. If the prototype is small enough that a new version, which addresses the failure, is not expensive, incremental improvement would be the way to control costs. He mentioned that the initial costs, "well under $5 million", will be for servers, software licenses and design. The greatest design challenge will be achieving the needed security. DNI policy is to have A-Space rely, as much as possible, on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

A [[Service oriented architecture| service oriented architecture (SOA)]] was the basic technical mode for building A-space. Eventually, that will allow analysts and developers to write or install their own widgets (i.e., small customized programs) onto their portal page. Widgets might first access Google Maps content, then attach classified layers to a map that could potentially overlay anti-aircraft missile sites with known bunkers. The intelligence community is already blogging, and A-Space could therefore take advantage of RSS feeds for blog content, among other things.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

It will be implemented as a portal that includes a Web-based word processing tool akin to GoogleDocs, a wiki-based intelligence community encyclopedia and access to three "huge, terabyte databases" of "raw" (i.e., not yet evaluated) data for analysts to examine. It will be scaled for 10,000 users at day one.&lt;ref name=IW2007-08-23 /&gt;

'''Advanced Placement [[Music theory|Music Theory]]''' (also known as '''AP Music Theory''', '''AP Jams''', '''AP Music''', or '''Music AP''') is a course and examination offered in the [[United States]] by the [[College Board]] as part of the [[Advanced Placement Program]] to [[high school]] students who wish to earn credit for a college level [[music theory]] course.

==The course==
Some of the material covered in the course involves low [[sight reading]], in-depth terminology, [[musical phrasing]] and composition, [[music history]], [[chord structure]] and [[Cadence (music)|cadence]]s, and other areas of music theory. This course is recommended for students with particularly strong abilities in music and college music majors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_music.html AP: Music Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exam==
The exam itself is divided into two broad sections: Section I, the multiple-choice section, and Section II, the free-response section. In turn, each section is divided into parts.

===Section I - multiple choice===
Section I of the exam consists of four-choice multiple choice questions; the total amount varies each year. The first half of the section is listening-based; the proctor will begin playing a provided CD, and the exam will begin. Each question or group of questions is based on a musical selection or an auditory stimulus. The selection or stimulus is played, and the student must answer as many of the questions as possible. Each musical selection or auditory stimulus is usually played two or three times for each question or group of questions, though the exact number differs from question to question.

===Section II - free response===
Section II of the exam consists of three parts, all of which require student-produced responses. One part of the section is listening-based, one part is part-writing, and one part is sight-singing.

The listening-based part of the section contains two types of questions: melodic dictation, in which a one-part [[melody]] is played two or three times, a starting pitch, [[time signature]], and [[Key (music)|key]] are given on the answer sheet, and the student must accurately record both the pitch and length of the played notes. The student must record two melodies; generally, one melody is in a [[major key]] and in a [[compound meter (music)|compound meter]] while the other melody is in a [[minor key]] and in a [[simple meter]]. One melody is written in the [[treble clef]] and the other is in the [[bass clef]]. The first melodic dictation question is in simple meter, while the second melodic question is in compound time. The reason for this is to test candidate AP Music Theory students in their ability to distinguish between simple and [[Compound (music)|compound]] time signatures as well as being able to read bass clef and treble clef.

The second type of listening-based question is harmonic dictation. A four-part texture, traditional [[SATB]], is played four times. The key, starting pitch for each part, and time signature are given on the answer sheet. The student must accurately notate only the bass and soprano lines, though the bass, tenor, alto, and soprano parts are played on the recording. The student must also provide a Roman numeral analysis of the chords in the progression with correct chord inversions.

The part-writing part of section II requires that the student, using knowledge of "eighteenth century composition guidelines" (as indicated on CollegeBoard's latest rubric and on the released 2003-2006 exams on [http://apcentral.collegeboard.com AP Central]), "standard" [[chord progressions]], cadences, [[voicing (music)|voicing]], and part ranges, write a short (usually two or four measure) two- or four-part texture given starting pitches, a key, time signature, and another piece of information that varies with each question: [[figured bass]] notation and completed bass part, [[Roman numeral notation]], or a completed soprano line.

For the question with the supplied figured bass notation and completed bass line, the student must write the Roman numeral notation of each chord and fill in the remaining tenor, alto, and soprano lines. For the question with the supplied Roman numeral notation, the student must write all four parts of the texture. For the question with the supplied soprano line, the student must develop a chord progression based on the given soprano line and write only an accompanying bass part.

The sight-singing part of the exam requires the student to analyze a given melodic line and perform the line as accurately as possible. Students perform two melodies one at a time; the written starting pitch will be played, and the student will have 75 seconds to practice aloud any parts he or she desires. Once the 75 seconds have ended, the starting pitch will be played again, and the student will have 30 seconds to perform the piece. Transposition of the key is allowed for voice comfortas stated on each year's directions. As with the melodic dictation part of the exam, one piece will generally be compound in meter and major in key, while the other will be simple in meter and minor in key. Students may sing the melody using [[solfège]] syllables, numbers, or a random syllable (la, la, la... ta, ta, ta etc...)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23263">'''Artificial intelligence for video surveillance''' utilizes [[computer software]] programs that analyze the images from [[Surveillance cameras|video surveillance camera]]s in order to recognize humans, vehicles or objects. Security contractors program the software to define restricted areas within the camera's view (such as a fenced off area, a parking lot but not the sidewalk or public street outside the lot) and program for times of day (such as after the close of business) for the property being protected by the camera [[surveillance]]. The [[artificial intelligence]] ("A.I.") sends an alert if it detects a trespasser breaking the "rule" set that no person is allowed in that area during that time of day.

The A.I. program functions by using [[machine vision]]. Machine vision is a series of [[algorithm]]s, or mathematical procedures, which work like a flow-chart or series of questions to compare the object seen with hundreds of thousands of stored reference images of humans in different postures, angles, positions and movements. The A.I. asks itself if the observed object moves like the reference images, whether it is approximately the same size height relative to width, if it has the characteristic two arms and two legs, if it moves with similar speed, and if it is vertical instead of horizontal. Many other questions are possible, such as the degree to which the object is reflective, the degree to which it is steady or vibrating, and the smoothness with which it moves. Combining all of the values from the various questions, an overall ranking is derived which gives the A.I. the probability that the object is or is not a human. If the value exceeds a limit that is set, then the alert is sent. It is characteristic of such programs that they are [[Unsupervised learning|self-learning]] to a degree, learning, for example that humans or vehicles appear bigger in certain portions of the monitored image – those areas near the camera – than in other portions, those being the areas farthest from the camera.

In addition to the simple rule restricting humans or vehicles from certain areas at certain times of day, more complex rules can be set. The user of the system may wish to know if vehicles drive in one direction but not the other. Users may wish to know that there are more than a certain preset number of people within a particular area. The A.I. is capable of maintaining surveillance of hundreds of cameras simultaneously. Its ability to spot a trespasser in the distance or in rain or glare is superior to humans' ability to do so.

This type of A.I. for security is known as "[[Logic programming|rule-based]]" because a human programmer must set rules for all of the things for which the user wishes to be alerted. This is the most prevalent form  of A.I. for security. Many video surveillance camera systems today include this type of A.I. capability. The hard-drive that houses the program can either be located in the cameras themselves or can be in a separate device that receives the input from the cameras.

A newer, non-rule based form of A.I. for security called "[[behavioral analytics]]" has been developed. This software is fully self-learning with no initial programming input by the user or security contractor. In this type of [[analytics]], the A.I. learns what is normal behavior for people, vehicles, machines, and the environment based on its own observation of patterns of various characteristics such as size, speed, reflectivity, color, grouping, vertical or horizontal orientation and so forth. The A.I. normalizes the visual data, meaning that it classifies and tags the objects and patterns it observes, building up continuously refined definitions of what is normal or average behavior for the various observed objects. After several weeks of learning in this fashion it can recognize when things break the pattern. When it observes such anomalies it sends an alert. For example, it is normal for cars to drive in the street. A car seen driving up onto a sidewalk would be an anomaly. If a fenced yard is normally empty at night, then a person entering that area would be an anomaly.

== History ==

=== Statement of the problem ===

Limitations in the ability of humans to vigilantly monitor video surveillance live footage led to the demand for artificial intelligence that could better serve the task. Humans watching a single video monitor for more than twenty minutes lose 95% of their ability to maintain attention sufficient to discern significant events.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Mary W. (1999) ''The Appropriate and Effective Use of Security Technologies in  U.S. Schools, A Guide for Schools and Law Enforcement Agencies'', Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt; With two monitors this is cut in half again.&lt;ref&gt;Sulman, N.; Sanocki, T.; Goldgof, D.; Kasturi, R., ''How effective is human video surveillance performance?, Pattern Recognition'', ICPR 2008. 19th International Conference on, vol., no., pp.1,3, 8-11 Dec. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Given that many facilities have dozens or even hundreds of cameras, the task is clearly beyond human ability. In general, the camera views of empty hallways, storage facilities, parking lots or structures are exceedingly boring and thus attention is quickly attenuated. When multiple cameras are monitored, typically employing a wall monitor or bank of monitors with split screen views and rotating every several seconds between one set of cameras and the next, the visual tedium is quickly overwhelming. While video surveillance cameras proliferated with great adoption by users ranging from car dealerships and shopping plazas to schools and businesses to highly secured facilities such as nuclear plants, it was recognized in hindsight that video surveillance by human officers (also called "operators") was impractical and ineffective. Extensive video surveillance systems were relegated to merely recording for possible forensic use to identify someone, after the fact of a theft, arson, attack or incident. Where wide angle camera views were employed, particularly for large outdoor areas, severe limitations were discovered even for this purpose due to insufficient resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nuechterlein, K.H., Parasuraman, R., &amp; Jiang, Q. (1983). 
''Visual sustained attention: Image degradation produces rapid sensitivity decrement over time''. Science, 220, 327-329&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases it is impossible to identify the trespasser or perpetrator because their image is too tiny on the monitor.

=== Earlier attempts at solution ===

==== Motion detection cameras ====

In response to the shortcomings of human guards to watch surveillance monitors long-term, the first solution was to add [[Motion detector|motion detectors]] to cameras. It was reasoned that an intruder's or perpetrator's motion would send an alert to the remote monitoring officer obviating the need for constant human vigilance. The problem was that in an outdoor environment there is constant motion or changes of pixels that comprise the total viewed image on screen. The motion of leaves on trees blowing in the wind, litter along the ground, insects, birds, dogs, shadows, headlights, sunbeams and so forth all comprise motion. This caused hundreds or even thousands of false alerts per day, rendering this solution inoperable except in indoor environments during times of non-operating hours.

==== Advanced video motion detection ====

The next evolution reduced false alerts to a degree but at the cost of complicated and time-consuming manual calibration. Here, changes of a target such as a person or vehicle relative to a fixed background are detected. Where the background changes seasonally or due to other changes, the reliability deteriorates over time. The economics of responding to too many false alerts again proved to be an obstacle and this solution was insufficient.

=== Advent of true video analytics ===

Machine learning of visual recognition relates to patterns and their classification.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Domingos, ''The Master Algorithm: How the
Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World'', September 22, 2015 Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, E. R. (2012) ''Computer and Machine Vision, Fourth Edition: Theory, Algorithms, Practicalities'' Academic Press, Waltham Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; True video analytics can distinguish the human form, vehicles and boats or selected objects from the general movement of all other objects and visual static or changes in pixels on the monitor. It does this by [[pattern recognition|recognizing patterns]]. When the object of interest, for example a human, violates a preset rule, for example that the number of people shall not exceed zero in a pre-defined area during a defined time interval, then an alert is sent. A red rectangle or so-called "bounding box" will typically automatically follow the detected intruder, and a short video clip of this is sent as the alert.

== Practical application ==

=== Real-time preventative action ===

The detection of intruders using video surveillance has limitations based on economics and the nature of video cameras. Typically, cameras outdoors are set to a wide angle view and yet look out over a long distance. Frame rate per second and dynamic range to handle brightly lit areas and dimly lit ones further challenge the camera to actually be adequate to see a moving human intruder. At night, even in illuminated outdoor areas, a moving subject does not gather enough light per frame per second and so, unless quite close to the camera, will appear as a thin wisp or barely discernible ghost or completely invisible. Conditions of glare, partial obscuration, rain, snow, fog, and darkness all compound the problem. Even when a human is directed to look at the actual location on a monitor of a subject in these conditions, the subject will usually not be detected. The A.I. is able to impartially look at the entire image and all cameras' images simultaneously. Using statistical models of degrees of deviation from its learned pattern of what constitutes the human form it will detect an intruder with high reliability and a low false alert rate even in adverse conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Dufour, Jean-Yves, ''Intelligent Video Surveillance Systems'', John Wiley Publisher (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Its learning is based on approximately a quarter million images of humans in various positions, angles, postures, and so forth.

A one megapixel camera with the onboard video analytics was able to detect a human at a distance of about 350' and an angle of view of about 30 degrees in non-ideal conditions. Rules could be set for a "virtual fence" or intrusion into a pre-defined area. Rules could be set for directional travel, object left behind, crowd formation and some other conditions.

==== Talk-down ====

One of the most powerful features of the system is that a human officer or operator, receiving an alert from the A.I., could immediately talk down over outdoor public address loudspeakers to the intruder. This had high deterrence value as most crimes are opportunistic and the risk of capture to the intruder becomes so pronounced when a live person is talking to them that they are very likely to desist from intrusion and to retreat. The security officer would describe the actions of the intruder so that the intruder had no doubt that a real person was watching them. The officer would announce that the intruder was breaking the law and that law enforcement was being contacted and that they were being video-recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Hantman, Ken (2014) [http://perimeterprotectivesystems.com/content/about-video-analytics/ ''What is Video Analytics, Simply Explained'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verified breach report ====

The police receive a tremendous number of false alarms from burglar alarms. In fact the security industry reports that over 98% of such alarms are false ones. Accordingly, the police give very low priority response to burglar alarms and can take from twenty minutes to two hours to respond to the site. By contrast, the video analytic-detected crime is reported to the central monitoring officer, who verifies with his or her own eyes that it is a real crime in progress. He or she then dispatches to the police who give such calls their highest priority.

==== Continuing advances ====

Analytics work with [[digital camera]]s or [[analog camera]]s that have [[analog-to-digital converter]]s. Various companies aside from VideoIQ and Avigilon offer video analytics. In many cases the software samples down to standard definition or less, regardless of the camera's resolution. The advance achieved by Avigilon is true analytics on up to exceedingly high-resolution 30 megapixel cameras.

== Behavioral analytics  ==

=== Active environments ===

While rule-based video analytics worked economically and reliably for many security applications there are many situations in which it cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Derek, ''Finding &amp; Selling The Value of Analytics'', SDM Magazine (Sept 2015) BNP Media II, Troy Michigan&lt;/ref&gt; For an indoor or outdoor area where no one belongs during certain times of day, for example overnight, or for areas where no one belongs at any time such as a [[Cell site|cell tower]], traditional rule-based analytics are perfectly appropriate. In the example of a cell tower the rare time that a service technician may need to access the area would simply require calling in with a pass-code to put the monitoring response "on test" or inactivated for the brief time the authorized person was there.

But there are many security needs in active environments in which hundreds or thousands of people belong all over the place all the time. For example, a college campus, an active factory, a hospital or any active operating facility. It is not possible to set rules that would discriminate between legitimate people and criminals or wrong-doers.

==== Overcoming the problem of active environments ====

Using behavioral analytics, a self-learning, non-rule-based A.I. takes the data from video cameras and continuously classifies objects and events that it sees. For example, a person crossing a street is one classification. A group of people is another classification. A vehicle is one classification, but with continued learning a public bus would be discriminated from a small truck and that from a motorcycle. With increasing sophistication, the system recognizes patterns in human behavior. For example, it might observe that individuals pass through a controlled access door one at a time. The door opens, the person presents their proximity card or tag, the person passes through and the door closes. This pattern of activity, observed repeatedly, forms a basis for what is normal in the view of the camera observing that scene. Now if an authorized person opens the door but a second "tail-gating" unauthorized person grabs the door before it closes and passes through, that is the sort of anomaly that would create an alert. This type of analysis is much more complex than the rule-based analytics. While the rule-based analytics work mainly to detect intruders into areas where no one is normally present at defined times of day, the behavioral analytics works where people are active to detect things that are out of the ordinary.

A fire breaking out outdoors would be an unusual event and would cause an alert, as would a rising cloud of smoke. Vehicles driving the wrong way into a one-way driveway would also typify the type of event that has a strong visual signature and would deviate from the repeatedly observed pattern of vehicles driving the correct one-way in the lane. Someone thrown to the ground by an attacker would be an unusual event that would likely cause an alert. This is situation-specific. So if the camera viewed a gymnasium where wrestling was practiced the A.I. would learn it is usual for one human to throw another to the ground, in which case it would not alert on this observation.

==== What the artificial intelligence 'understands' ====

The A.I. does not know or understand what a human is, or a fire, or a vehicle. It is simply finding characteristics of these things based on their size, shape, color, reflectivity, angle, orientation, motion, and so on. It then finds that the objects it has classified have typical patterns of behavior. For example, humans walk on sidewalks and sometimes on streets but they don't climb up the sides of buildings very often. Vehicles drive on streets but don't drive on sidewalks. Thus the anomalous behavior of someone scaling a building or a vehicle veering onto a sidewalk would trigger an alert.

==== Varies from traditional mindset of security systems  ====

Typical alarm systems are designed to not miss true positives (real crime events) and to have as low of a false alarm rate as possible. In that regard, burglar alarms miss very few true positives but have a very high false alarm rate even in the controlled indoor environment. Motion detecting cameras miss some true positives but are plagued with overwhelming false alarms in an outdoor environment. Rule-based analytics reliably detect most true positives and have a low rate of false positives but cannot perform in active environments, only in empty ones. Also they are limited to the simple discrimination of whether an intruder is present or not.

Something as complex or subtle as a fight breaking out or an employee breaking a safety procedure is not possible for a rule based analytics to detect or discriminate. With behavioral analytics, it is. Places where people are moving and working do not present a problem. However, the A.I. may spot many things that appear anomalous but are innocent in nature. For example, if students at a campus walk on a plaza, that will be learned as normal. If a couple of students decided to carry a large sheet outdoors flapping in the wind, that might indeed trigger an alert. The monitoring officer would be alerted to look at his or her monitor and would see that the event is not a threat and would then ignore it. The degree of deviation from norm that triggers an alert can be set so that only the most abnormal things are reported. However, this still constitutes a new way of human and A.I. interaction not typified by the traditional alarm industry mindset. This is because there will be many false alarms that may nevertheless be valuable to send to a human officer who can quickly look and determine if the scene requires a response. In this sense, it is a "tap on the shoulder" from the A.I. to have the human look at something.

==== Limitations of behavioral analytics ====

Because so many complex things are being processed continuously, the software samples down to the very low resolution of only [[Common_Intermediate_Format|1 CIF]] to conserve computational demand. The 1 CIF resolution means that an object the size of a human will not be detected if the camera utilized is wide angle and the human is more than sixty to eighty feet distant depending on conditions. Larger objects like vehicles or smoke would be detectable at greater distances.

==== Quantification of situational awareness  ====

The utility of artificial intelligence for security does not exist in a vacuum, and its development was not driven by purely academic or scientific study. Rather, it is addressed to real world needs, and hence, economic forces. Its use for non-security applications such as operational efficiency, shopper heat-mapping of display areas (meaning how many people are in a certain area in a retail space), and attendance at classes are developing uses.&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Illy, ''The Evolution of Video Analytics'', Security Sales &amp;  Integration magazine (August 11, 2012) Security Sales &amp; Integration, Framingham MA&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not as well qualified as A.I. to compile and recognize patterns consisting of very large data sets requiring simultaneous calculations in multiple remote viewed locations. There is nothing natively human about such awareness. Such multi-tasking has been shown to defocus human attention and performance. A.I.s have the ability to handle such data. For the purposes of security interacting with video cameras they functionally have better visual acuity than humans or the machine approximation to it.  For judging subtleties of behaviors or intentions of subjects or degrees of threat, humans remain far superior at the present state of the technology. So the A.I. in security functions to broadly scan beyond human capability and to vet the data to a first level of sorting of relevance and to alert the human officer who then takes over the function of assessment and response.

Security in the practical world is economically determined so that the expenditure of preventative security will never typically exceed the perceived cost of the risk to be avoided. Studies have shown that companies typically only spend about one twenty-fifth the amount on security that their actual losses cost them.&lt;ref&gt;Bressler, Martin S.,
''The Impact of Crime on Business: A Model of Prevention, Detection &amp; Remedy'', Journal of Management and Marketing Research (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; What by pure economic theory should be an equivalence or homeostasis, thus falls vastly short of it. One theory that explains this is [[cognitive dissonance]], or the ease with which unpleasant things like risk can be shunted from the conscious mind. Nevertheless, security is a major expenditure, and comparison of the costs of different means of security is always foremost amongst security professionals.

Another reason that future security threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct cost of a potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced. For example, the vandalism-destruction of a custom production machine in a factory or of a refrigerated tractor trailer would result in a long replacement time during which customers could not be served, resulting in loss of their business. A violent crime will have extensive public relations damage for an employer, beyond the direct liability for failing to protect the employee.

Behavioral analytics uniquely functions beyond simple security and, due to its ability to observe breaches in standard patterns of protocols, it can effectively find unsafe acts of employees that may result in workers comp or public liability incidents. Here too, the assessment of future incidents' costs falls short of the reality. A study by [[Liberty Mutual|Liberty Mutual Insurance Company]] showed that the cost to employers is about six times the direct insured cost, since uninsured costs of consequential damages include temporary replacement workers, hiring costs for replacements, training costs, managers' time in reports or court, adverse morale on other workers, and effect on customer and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;''Safety Index Report'', Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The potential of A.I. in the form of behavioral analytics to proactively intercept and prevent such incidents is significant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], a '''beneficial organism''' is any [[organism]] that benefits the growing process, including [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, other [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[nematode]]s. Benefits include [[pest control]], [[pollination]], and maintenance of [[soil health]]. The opposite of beneficial organisms are [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

==Beneficial or pest==
The distinction between ''beneficial'' and ''pest'' is arbitrary, subjectively determined by examining the effect of a particular organism in a specific growing situation.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

With beneficial organisms there is a flip side to these helpful organisms and that's the non beneficial organisms. These organisms hinder or stop the growing process or prey on beneficial organisms. Examples of these are Aphids, Assassin Bugs, and Japanese beetles. Aphids are attracted by pollen which is bad for plants because the aphids feed on the plants after they are located from spreading their pollen. Assassin Bugs are non beneficial because they feed on many beneficial insects by stabbing them with a horn on their head repeated times living up to its name "Assassin bug". Japanese beetles are especially a pest to gardeners and plants because the larva feed on the stems and roots while full grown beetles feed on leaves and flowers killing the plant.

===Insects===
[[Beneficial insect]]s can include predators (such as [[ladybug]]s) of pest insects, and [[pollinators]] (such as [[bee]]s, which are an integral part of the growth cycle of many crops). Increasingly certain species of insects are managed and used to intervene where natural pollination or biological control is insufficient, usually due to human disturbance of the balance of nature.

===Nematodes===
Certain microscopic [[nematodes]] (worms) are beneficial in destroying and controlling populations of larvae that are damaging or deadly to crops and other plants. They are commonly used in organic gardening for their ability to kill various kinds of harmful larvae ([[fungus gnat]]s, [[flea]] larvae, [[spidermite]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[Larva|grub]]s, [[rootworm]]s, [[cutworm]]s, etc.)

===Animals===
[[Bird]]s and other animals may, by their actions, improve conditions in various growing situations, and in such cases are also beneficials. Birds assist in the spread of seeds by ingesting the fruits and berries of plants, then depositing the seeds in their droppings. Other animals, such as raccoons, bears, etc. provide similar benefits.

===Plants===
Plants that perform positive functions can also be considered beneficials ([[companion planting]] is one technique based on principle of beneficial plants).

==Issues==

In agriculture, controversy surrounds the concept of beneficial insects. Much of this has to do with the effect of [[agrichemicals]], like [[insecticides]], [[herbicides]] and large quantities of synthetic [[fertilizers]], on what are considered beneficials. Citing the reduction or elimination of various organisms as a side effect of agrichemical-based farming, some argue that critical damage is being done to the [[ecosystem]], to the point where conventional agriculture is [[sustainability|unsustainable]]. For example, if bee populations are reduced by insecticides aimed at other pests, pollination is inhibited and crops don't appear. If soil microorganisms are killed off, natural [[soil regeneration]] is inhibited, and reliance on mechanical and chemical inputs to keep the soil viable is increased. The longer term impact of these conditions has not been determined. Commercial ventures currently exist to provide pollinators and [[biological pest control]].

'''Biotechnology and genetic engineering in Bangladesh''' is one of the thriving fields of science and technology in the [[Bangladesh|country]].

== History ==
The research for biotechnology in Bangladesh started in the late 1970s. The root cause behind the initiation was the significance of agricultural sector, which had been the backbone of the national economy since the ancient times. The research first started in the department of botany in [[University of Dhaka]] through [[Tissue culture]] on jute. Subsequently, within the next 10–12 years, similar research programs began to take place in [[The Faculty of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering was established with the vision that Sylhet Agricultural University (SAU) will lead the forefront in education and research in the fields of Life Science. Our mission is to effectively integrate learnin|Faculty of Biotechnology &amp; Genetic Engineering at Sylhet Agricultural University]], [[University of Rajshahi]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[University of Khulna]], [[Jagannath University]], [[Jahangirnagar University]],  [[Shahjalal University of Science and Technology]], [[Bangladesh Rice Research Institute]], Bangladesh Jute Research Institute, [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University|Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University,]]  [[Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute]], [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]], [[Bangladesh Forest Research Institute]], [[Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture]], [[Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (BCSIR) and [[Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission]]. In 1990, Bangladesh Association for Plant Tissue Culture (BAPTC) was formed which has been organising several international conferences since its inception. In September 1993, the [[government of Bangladesh]] formed a National Committee on Biotechnology Product Development to select potential biotechnological projects which could be leased out for commercialisation. In collaboration with BAPTC, the Ministry of Science and Technology organised a workshop on Biosafety Regulation in 1997, after which a task force was formed to formulate biosafety guidelines and biosafety regulations in the light of the regulation of the workshop. In the late 1990s, Bangladesh became a member of the [[International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology]] (ICGEB). In 1999, the [[National Institute of Biotechnology]] was established as the centre of excellence in biotechnological education.&lt;ref name="Rao"&gt;{{cite book | title=Biotechnology and Development: Challenges and Opportunities for Asia | publisher=Academic Foundation | author=Sachin Chaturvedi, S. R.

== Genome sequencing projects ==

=== Jute genome ===
In 2008, with the funding of the government, the [[University of Dhaka]], DataSoft IT firm and Bangladesh Jute Research Institute initiated a collaborative [[Genome project|genome research program]] on [[jute]] under the leadership of [[Maqsudul Alam|Dr. Maqsudul Alam]] who had previously sequenced the genomes of papaya and rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=251089 |title=Jute Genome project |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=25 September 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 2010, the group of scientists successfully [[genome sequencing|sequenced the genome]] of jute, through which, Bangladesh became only the second country after [[Malaysia]], among the [[Developing country|developing nations]], to have successfully sequenced a plant genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=143047 | title=Jute genome decoded | newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2011-11-17&amp;nid=40399 | title=Dhaka to get jute genome intellectual property right by mid-2012 | newspaper=[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]] | archive-url=https://archive.is/2013.07.07-164253/http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2011-11-17&amp;nid=40399 | archive-date=7 July 2013 | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fungus genome ===
In 2012, the same group of scientists decoded the genome of ''[[Macrophomina phaseolina]]'', a [[Botryosphaeriaceae]] fungus, which is responsible for causing seedling blight, root rot, and charcoal rot of more than 500 crop and non-crop species throughout the world. The sequencing took place at the laboratory of Bangladesh Jute Research Institute and was done as part of ''The Basic and applied Research on Jute'' project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_20-09-2012_Bangladeshi-scientists-decode-genome-of-jute-fungus_267_1_1_1_8.html | title=Bangladeshi scientists decode genome of jute fungus | newspaper=[[Daily Sun (Bangladesh)|Daily Sun]] | archive-url=https://archive.is/2013.07.07-164339/http://www.daily-sun.com/details_yes_20-09-2012_Bangladeshi-scientists-decode-genome-of-jute-fungus_267_1_1_1_8.html | archive-date=7 July 2013 | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Reaz Ahmad |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=250459 |title=Alam does it again |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/index.php?ref=MjBfMDlfMjlfMTJfMV82XzE0NTA5Ng== | title=Sequencing fungus genome: A nonpareil achievement | newspaper=[[Financial Express (Bangladesh)|Financial Express]] |location=Dhaka | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=8118 | title=Decoding fungal genome: Salute to Dr Maqsudul Alam | magazine=[[Dhaka Courier]] | accessdate=7 July 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928170935/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/?p=8118 | archivedate=28 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/index.php?ref=MjBfMDlfMjBfMTJfMV8yXzE0NDA2NA== |title=BD scientists crack genome sequencing of fungal pathogen |newspaper=The Financial Express |location=Dhaka |date= |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2012-09-20&amp;nid=24286 |title=Bangladeshi scientists invent fungus gene |newspaper=New Age |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113230738/http://newagebd.com/detail.php?date=2012-09-20&amp;nid=24286 |archivedate=13 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biotechnology industry ==
Biotechnology industry is yet to be a major contributor on the [[economy of Bangladesh|national economy]], however, according to the experts, the results of some ongoing research shows enough potentials of this sector.&lt;ref name="genetic"&gt;{{cite news |author=Naiyyum Choudhury and Md. Riajul Hossain |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/biotechnology-and-genetic-engineering/ |title=Biotechnology and genetic engineering |newspaper=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BCSIR]] has undertaken the production of [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] and a certain quantity of it is being marketed as tablets by several private manufacturers. BCSIR has also explored the production of [[baker's yeast]] using [[molasses]] which are by-products of the sugarcane manufacturing plants in the northern part of the country. The net production of molasses numbers about 100,000 million tons per year, about half of which is used in the distilleries for the production of [[ethanol]]. The production of [[Rhizobium]] is also perceived to have commercial potential. Several private pharmaceutical companies have started to develop separate and dedicated biotech units. Some private firms like [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] Biotechnology Center, [[Square Pharmaceuticals|Square Agric-tech]] and Aman Agro Industries are producing virus-free potato seeds in substantial quantities, gradually reducing the dependency on imported potato seeds. Proshika Tissue Culture Center is now exporting varieties of tissue culture derived orchid plants. Pharmaceutical companies like the [[Incepta Pharmaceuticals]] have begun to produce and market insulin and preparing to export abroad. Incepta has also signed an agreement with ICGEB to receive the technological know-how for commercially manufacturing [[hepatitis B vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Rao" /&gt;&lt;ref name="genetic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahmed |first=Zia Uddin |year=2012 |chapter=Biotechnology |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Biotechnology |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buddhist influences on print technology''' in [[East Asia]] are far-reaching.  The history of writing in Asia dates back to the 13th century BC.  China used bones and shells for religious inscriptions in the form of divinations.&lt;ref name="Tsien" &gt;{{cite book
  |author=[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]]
  |title=Written on Bamboo &amp; Silk: The Beginnings of Chinese Books &amp; Inscriptions

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these beginnings, numerous forms of writing and printing were developed.  In many instances, as in [[Europe]], it was religion that played a major role in the development of writing and printing techniques or which was the reason behind the usage of these techniques. Of the religions in East Asia, it was [[Buddhism]] that played the strongest role in influencing writing and, in particular, printing. There were other factors that influenced the creation of manuscript and print culture, but Buddhism had the largest influence in spreading the usage of print technology, which in turn led to an increase in the dissemination of secular printing and literacy as well as wielding an important influence on economics, government, and competing religions/philosophies.

== Brief survey of writing &amp; printing in early China ==
The earliest known writing in [[China]] are inscriptions on bones and shells which were used for divination for approximately three centuries until the late 11th century BC. Inscriptions can also be found on bronze, [[jade]], stone, and pottery. [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|Bronze]] was developed as a permanent record of socio-political and ceremonial information in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. Stone, on the other hand, is the only permanent method used continuously from ancient times to present. Also, stone was used extensively for inscriptions on monuments and for the preservation of [[Confucian]], Buddhist, and [[Taoist]] texts. Clay inscriptions flourished from the 4th or 5th century BC until the early 4th century AD.  These inscriptions were primarily records of names, titles, and phrases such as good luck sayings.&lt;ref name="Tsien" /&gt;(201)

[[History of silk|Silk]] was also used for the recording of information starting in the 7th or 6th century BC.  The predecessors to paper-based books in China were strips and tablets made of [[bamboo]] or wood, which were bound by cords and used much like books are today. This method of transmission of information was in use at the same time as the usage of bronze and the other methods.  Bamboo and wood was used for approximately three centuries more than paper and silk was in use for some 500 years longer than paper.  These methods were favoured by tradition and also had some advantages over paper. 
 
A less expensive alternative was developed, a form of paper made from a refuse fiber called [[zhi]]. This paper was developed before the Christian era and became commonplace in the 1st or 2nd century AD for books and other documents, but the other methods of recording information  continued.  Paper books were originally in the form of rolls, then folded leaves, and finally bound volumes like the books in use today.

There were various methods for the production of early Chinese records. Bone and stone media were engraved or incised with a metal stylus or knife.  Wood, bamboo, silk, and paper was written on with brush-pens; the ink was black; usage of ink dates to [[Neolithic China]].  [[stylus|Styli]] were also used and were made of bamboo, wood, horn, and metal, but it is not known when the stylus first came into common usage. Book knives were used as erasers for bamboo and wood tablets but not for inscriptions.  Inscriptions on bronze were [[casting|cast]] from molds. Inscriptions on clay were made by molds or were impressed with stamps. [[Seal (duplicate)|Seals]] were used to produce duplicates on soft clays and later on silk and paper. These seals were cast from metals or cut from [[jade]] or stone. Before the invention of woodblock printing, inked impressions from stone or other inscriptions would be made by rubbing or squeezing paper over their surfaces.  This technique was used up to the early 6th century and led to the invention of printing. Moveable type was invented in China some 400 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s press.  (1, 202-203)

== Buddhism and printing in China ==
The period following the collapse of the [[Han empire|Han]] (220 AD) is known as (one of the many) “Dark Ages” and was typified by political strife, wars, and social upheaval.  Despite the turmoil of that period, learning and culture continued to grow. Among the intellectual elite and rulership, Confucianism continued to be the dominant philosophy. Taoism and Buddhism emerged as religions and began to flourish.

Buddhism, a populist religion, had been introduced to China at the beginning of the [[Christian Era]] and quickly became a religion sought after in times of strife by the masses where it was propagated. The first translation of a Buddhist text appeared in China in the 2nd century AD and by the 3rd century the volume of translations had increased a great deal.  Buddhism’s influence on literature and scholarship grew in relation to the conversion of the elite and ruler ship.  (17)

During the [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618 AD), Buddhism enjoyed an explosion in the production of printed texts.  This is partly due to the reunification of the empire and partly because [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] decreed that all Buddhist texts then in print were to be copied and placed in temple libraries in all the major cities.  Another factor that influenced this increase in printing was the creation of a bureau in 606 AD for the translation of Buddhist texts &lt;!--from what language to what language? --&gt; at the behest of [[Emperor Yang]].  To illustrate this diffusion of Buddhist texts, the History of the Sui Dynasty’s bibliography lists 1950 Buddhist titles as compared to 377 Taoist titles.

Buddhism was, therefore, probably the most important factor in the development of printing. The demand for Buddhist texts was so great that it encouraged accelerated levels of printing for the following century. Despite the increased demand for Buddhist literature, the production of books by hand did not end.  Printing only increased the number of copies of books, thus facilitating the ease and degree of communication.  (18, 205)

As Confucianism was the major competing native belief set among the elite, the reason that Buddhist texts enjoyed such widespread printing needs explanation.&lt;ref name="Mair" &gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mair suggests that perhaps there is something inherent in Buddhism that is conducive to its being written in what he calls “vernacular Sinitic” as opposed to the “literary Sinitic” used for native Chinese texts.  One aspect of Buddhism that Mair cites is the notion of [[upaya]], known as fang-pien in Chinese; followers of the Buddha should do whatever is in their power to do to insure the salvation of all living things.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713) This would certainly help explain why Buddhist texts would be printed and circulated in a written language that is more accessible to a wider audience. Another point Mair makes is that lecture notes for sermons by laymen and monks were written in the vernacular language.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This makes sense considering that these notes were to be spoken from; one would not make notes for a sermon in a stilted and highly literary language.  Other Buddhist texts such as [[parable]]s were popular with the masses and so when written, the vernacular is the clear choice.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

Another inherent trait that Mair cites is the ostensibly oral nature of Buddhism and how the religion stresses that “…Buddha is beyond the ‘paths of speech’” and “…’the way of language is cut off, the workings of the mind are obliterated’….” (Ibid.)  Mair also writes:
: “Even the Zen masters, whose words are ironically preserved in written vernacular (perhaps one should say, especially the Zen masters),…’nonestablishment of written words’ (pu li wen-tzu), which disparages the efficacy of language, especially in its written form, to convey essential truths.”  &lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(713-714)

Despite this, even Buddhism could not survive and function as a religion without sacred texts.  Many Buddhist texts begin with the phrase evam me sutam (ju shih wo wen, “thus I have heard”).  Buddhist texts also make use of other expressions such as fo shuo (“spoken by the Buddha”). Mair points out that this underlines the direct oral transmission of Buddha’s teachings to the community through Ananda.  So, these phrases are a stamp of authenticity for the text, even when a text did not originate in India.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714)  Given this oral nature of Buddhism, it makes sense that its texts would be rendered in vernacular rather than literary Chinese.

The strongest explanation for the use of vernacular, and by extension the rapid spread of Buddhism and its influence on print culture, is the process by which Buddhism was introduced to China.  Mair argues that the process of translation was what influenced the use of vernacular in Chinese Buddhist texts. Commerce also played a strong role, but this will be discussed later.  It was foreigners that began the process of translation into Chinese (“…the early impetus for the translation of Buddhist texts into [[Sinitic]] came primarily from foreign monks resident in China.”)&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(714-715, 717)  What Mair calls “literary Sinitic” is an extremely difficult language to learn, “…requiring at least ten to fifteen years to gain a modicum of proficiency.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(716)  These foreign translators were adults when they came to China and most likely learned spoken Chinese through immersion in the culture before learning how to write the language.  When it came time to write, they used the language they knew which was the vernacular.  Also, when it was Chinese Buddhists working on writing a text, they worked in teams with other Chinese dictating their translations.  Obviously since literary Chinese is unspeakable, the dictation was done in the vernacular. (Ibid.)

The above argument is the strongest for what might be called the mechanical process for the rapid spread of Buddhism and the vast amount of texts available (and the rise in the use of printing) to a wider audience.  What is also a very important aspect in the spread of Buddhism and its influence on printing is the ideological aspects of Buddhism.  As opposed to the native Chinese religions/philosophies, Buddhism is a populist religion.  As Mair writes:  “…Buddhism functioned (and perhaps originated) as a means for the individual to escape from the normal societal bonds.” (719)  Buddhism appealed to the dispossessed, those that were outside the Confucian institutions.  Because Confucianism stressed a rigid social order, many people found themselves stuck in a social position they could not escape from.

The Buddhist community in China consisted of, for example, a large number of widows, orphans, and others that had no place in the fabric of Confucian society.  Literary Chinese was associated with the elite; those that could afford to attend the bureaucratic schools for example.  Buddhism aggressively pursued the conversion of followers and to move into a new area such as China&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721), it makes sense that Buddhism would make use of the vernacular in its texts; it was more accessible to the masses.  Because of this accessibility there was an increased demand for texts and thus the rise in printing.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(720)

Mair cites Daniel Gardner and his work on [[Neo-Confucianism]].  It seems that the vernacular was employed in Neo-Confucian texts because of its: 
: “…more inquisitive approach it permitted toward the classics…Considering the powerful influence of Buddhism
on the formation of Neo-Confucian thought and practice, the adoption of the written vernacular as a legitimate form of serious intellectual discussion would seem to be one more example of the radical restructuring of Confucianism brought about by this foreign religion.” (Ibid.)

So, not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also it also influenced society at large in adapting to the norms of Buddhist thought.  These influences were manifested in literature, philosophy, government, etc.  As Mair writes, “…may be analyzed sociolinguistically as emanating from the fundamentally demotic impulses of the religion."&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(721)

== Buddhism and printing in Korea ==
The story of printing in [[Korea]] is slightly different from in China, but Buddhism did play an important role in the development of printing.  Just as in China and Japan, [[woodblock printing]] was the primary technique used for printing, but a scarcity of resources needed for the production of woodblocks in Korea created a need for the invention of an alternative, which was moveable type. Korea was in the unique position among Asian countries of having an [[Korean alphabet|alphabet]] that facilitated the use of moveable type. This is not to say that woodblocks were not used.  Once [[moveable type]] came into use, Korea was no longer quite as dependent on China for texts.

Sometime in the 4th century the Chinese educational system was introduced to what was then the [[Koguryo state]]. A [[civil service examination system]] was established in [[Silla]] after the Korean states consolidated in the 7th century.  As the power of the government grew, demand for books from China increased.  Korea began to print its own texts and books from woodblocks in the 10th century.  Prior to 1056 Korea was mainly a manuscript culture.  Complaints from a provincial capital spurred the government to order copies from the royal collection to be printed. Newly carved woodblocks were sent from the provinces to the royal library, which spurred the production of more woodblocks.&lt;ref name="Sohn" &gt;{{cite journal
  |author=Sohn, Pow-key
  |title=Early Korean Printing
  |journal=The Journal of the American Oriental Society
  |volume= 79
  |issue= 2
  |date=April–June 1959
  |pages=96–103
  |doi=10.2307/595851
}}&lt;/ref&gt;(97)

Other than the perceived (and possibly true) unreliability of manuscript copies, religion provided an additional stimulus for the printing of texts from woodblocks, just as in the other countries of East Asia.  A large scale carving of woodblocks for the purpose of printing the [[Tripitaka]] was undertaken starting sometime around 1014.  During the last twenty odd years of the 11th century, more Tripitaka woodblocks were carved, in addition to woodblocks for other Chinese Buddhist works.  The demand for Buddhist texts, as well as Confucian texts, grew in the following years.  Most of these were subsequently destroyed during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;

At the time, Korea was rather zealous in its attempts to acquire Buddhist (and other) texts and utilized whatever means it could to acquire texts.  In addition to trade with [[Song dynasty|Song]] China, Korea bought books from private markets (once again, commerce and Buddhism will be discussed later).  The zealousness Korea had to acquire Buddhist texts also provided an impetus for the printing of texts.  By the end of the 11th century Korea had better copies of common texts as well as rare copies of certain editions.  Previously the flow of books was mainly from China to Korea, but in 1091 China asked Korea for 117 books that no longer existed in China’s libraries, a situation similar to that in Europe a few centuries earlier where Ireland had preserved Christian texts no longer in existence on the continent.&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;  This illustrates the strong role that Buddhism played in printing.  Buddhism provided the stimulus to keep as many texts in print as possible.  When these texts were lost in China, Korea proved to be an important repository of Buddhist literature due to its commitment to the printing of Buddhist texts.

Buddhism also played a role in the development of moveable type. Religion was not the only contributing factor in Korea’s development of moveable type.  First, the Song dynasty (which was apparently the only source outside of Korea for books) fled south after the Chin invasion in 1127. Second, many of Korea’s libraries were destroyed resulting in the loss of many texts and woodblocks during a power struggle in the royal court.  Thirdly, the scarcity of hardwoods used in the production of woodblocks in Korea contributed to the need for a more readily made printing source. Pine was the most common wood available in Korea at the time, but is not a good source for woodblocks.  There was birch, but these trees were not common and were to be found mostly on mountainous terrain making it difficult to get to and expensive to transport. (98)

The Koreans at that time were most likely already aware of moveable type as it had already been invented in China. In China, moveable type was made from baked clay, but the Koreans improved upon this by making cast-type.  Metal casting existed in Korea, but with the introduction of a new method of coin casting from China in 1102, Korea finally had the technology to create an effective method of printing using moveable type.  This method of casting came in the form of carving two molds that were joined together with the liquid metal presumably being poured into the hollow thus created. (98-100)  So with the zealous desire for Buddhist texts, the scarcity of resources for woodblock production, the introduction of new technology, and the cessation of trade with China, Korea was able to continue to print Buddhist texts.

There are other examples of how Buddhism stimulated printing in Korea. Despite the difficulties the [[Mongol]] invasion presented, printing of texts continued.  While in exile on [[Kangwha Island]], the [[Goryeo#Mongol invasions .281231 - 1350.29|Koryo]] government re-carved a woodblock edition of a Buddhist text crucial to the [[Son sect]] that had become scarce. Sohn also suggests that the invention of moveable type was due to the general scarcity of books after 1127 but before the Mongol invasion.  Sohn mentions that there was an urgent need for these texts. (98)  What he does not mention, and I would suggest, is that moveable type was used because it would have taken too long to re-carve the woodblocks.  Thus moveable type was utilized to meet the urgent demand for the texts.

There is more evidence for the influence that Buddhism had on the printing of texts.  In 1446, King Sejong introduced the Hunmin chong um, a text that introduced the new system for writing vernacular Korean.  In the preface to this text, there is a line (“Even the sound of the winds, the cry of the crane, the cackle of fowl and the barking of dogs – all may be written” [Mair, 733]) that is derived from a Sung scholar (Cheng Ch’iao) that “praises the phonological sophistication of the Buddhist monks.”  The fact that Sejong was a devout Buddhist could possibly also be seen as evidence of the Buddhist influence on printing. All but two of the earliest texts using Sejong’s Hunmin chong um were Buddhist texts.  Also, Hunmin chong um is based partly on Phags-pa that can be traced back to Srong-brtsan-sgam-po, the king who introduced Buddhism to [[Tibet]].  “The Buddhist impetus, in turn, carried through to King Sejong’s Hunmin chong um.” (731, 734)   This illustrates that not only did Buddhism wield an influence on printing, but also on language reform, which in turn further influenced printing.  With the introduction of Hunmin chong um, printing using moveable type in Korea became much more practical.

There are a number of differences between China and Korea which rendered moveable type easier for Korea than China. First, China did not have a script reform that made the use of moveable type more practical as in Korea.  The large number of characters used in written Chinese posed a great challenge to the use of moveable type. Instead of making type for every character all at once, why not make new type as it was needed?  In this way a gradual shift to moveable type printing could have been accomplished. Second, the historical record shows that in China there was a preference for that which was already established and familiar (e.g. the preference of bamboo/wood books over the usage of paper books). Chinese moveable type was made from baked clay, rendering it breakable.

== Buddhism and printing in Japan ==
Little is known about the techniques and procedures used for woodblock printing before 1600 in [[Japan]]; printing and publishing in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa]] period became more commercialized and thus there is more information about it.&lt;ref name="Kornicki" &gt;Kornicki, Peter. The Book in Japan:  A Cultural History from the Beginnings to the Nineteenth Century.  Brill, Leiden, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;(47)

First a manuscript is passed to a copyist and a clean copy (''hanshita'') is written out.  Sometimes a [[calligrapher]] would be employed to make a copy when quality calligraphy was desired, although the author often prepared the copy.  Second, the hanshita was given to the block-carver who pasted the hanshita face down onto a wooden block and carved away the white parts leaving the text, illustrations, and borders in relief.  Third, the block was passed to the printer who inked the block, laid a sheet of paper on it, and then rubbed the paper to make the impression.  Sometimes a printing was made for the purpose of proofreading but this seems to have been rather rare.  It is not clear how much proofreading was done but it was done for the more important texts. (52)  Fourth, when enough copies were printed they were passed to someone who aligned the pages.  Lastly, a cover was made and the book was finally bound. (47, 48)

The reproduction of texts was done by the technique called ''[[kabusebori]]''.  Reproduction was an unstable process.  Copies would be made from earlier editions of the text by using the text itself as the hanshita.  The woodblock resulting from this technique of duplication was similar but not an exact replica.  This method was used during the Muromachi period to reproduce Chinese texts and also when a popular text needed to be reprinted but the original woodblocks were worn down, damaged, or lost. (49)  This method was also used when particular pages of a text needed to be replaced such as when some woodblocks were more worn than others or when a family or business needed to update its directories. (52)

Umeki was another technique used to make corrections to a text to avoid censorship or when mistakes were made during the carving process.  A portion of the woodblock would be carved out and removed, then replaced with the corrected text on a portion of wood measuring the same dimensions as that which had been removed. (52)

Print technology was introduced to Japan in the 8th century but it took approximately 1000 years for Japan to become a print culture when printing had finally become commercialized. (112)  Initially printing in Japan was a ritual exercise for the production of devotional texts and it was not until the 11th century that texts were printed for the purpose of reading.  This was much the case in China although calendars and Buddhist texts had been printed for reading for quite some time.  Therefore, printing reached Japan from China in the form of a ritual practice. (113)

The only surviving evidence of printing from the 8th century Japan comes from Nara in the form of the [[Hyakumanto Dharani]]. (115) The Hyakumanto Dharani are slips of paper with Buddhist text printed on them installed in miniature pagoda that were placed at various locations in Nara.  They were apparently made to atone for a rebellion that took place 746.  The rebellion was in response to the growing influence Buddhism had in the Japanese court; a Buddhist monk, Dokyo, had been able to have himself appointed to the position of Chancellor of the Realm.  The interference in courtly matters by the Buddhist clergy led to much resentment and Fujiwara no Nakamaro led a rebellion against Dokyo.  The ex-Empress Shotoku ordered the printing of one million charms to appease the Buddhist monks and temples, although it is unclear whether this order was fully carried out.&lt;ref name="Hickman" &gt;Hickman, Brian.  “A Note on the Hyakumanto Dharani.” Monumenta Nipponica, vol. 30, no. 1, (Spring, 1975), 87-93&lt;/ref&gt;(87-88)  Very few of the dharani survived to this day.&lt;ref name="Hickman" /&gt;(89)  Hyakumanto dharani represent the earliest existing proof (from Japan) that Buddhism was an influence on printing in East Asia.

[[Inbutsu]], religious stamps depicting the Buddha, were common in pre-Heian times and continued to be made through the Heian period.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"/&gt;(117)  Further evidence of printing in the Heian period comes in the form of books and other texts imported from China by Japanese monks returning to Japan from China and Chinese monks and travelers.  Devotional printing was common in [[Heian period|Heian]] Japan.  Fujiwara no Michinaga’s diary (1009 AD) mentions that 1000 copies of the “[[Lotus Sutra]]” were commissioned but none of these survive. It seems that the paper that these devotional texts were printed on was of poor quality and this explains why so few of them exist to this day.  The reason for printing these devotional texts lay in the meritorious act of reproducing sacred texts, not in the reading of them.  Therefore, there was no concern for the fate of the texts after being printed since the act of printing them was what brought about merit. (118)  As described above, Buddhist influence on printing in Japan was initially for gaining merit with the Buddha and great effort was put into printing texts for this reason.  Because Japan during the Nara and Heian periods was primarily a manuscript culture and texts for reading were hand copied, Buddhism’s influence on print had yet to exhibit the influence it did in China.

Practical printing can be dated to the 11th century, during the Heian era when Chinese texts from the [[Song dynasty]] became popular in Japan in the form of commentaries on [[Sūtra|sutras]] and doctrines. [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] became the center of non-devotional printing in Heian Japan and the oldest existing example of this kind is the [[Joyuishikiron]] (a Buddhist text in Chinese) of 1088 printed by the monks of the [[Kofukuji temple]]. [[Kyoto]] became the center of devotional printing because this is where the aristocratic sponsorship for such printing existed. (118-119)

During the [[Kamakura period]] printing became more established and began to shift its emphasis from devotional printing to practical printing.  Inbutsu continued to be produced but their production began to expand to more populist images such as the Amida Buddha and Jizo.  The Kofukuji was important in the shift to practical printing as well as other temples such as Todaiji, Daianji, and Saidaiji.  The monasteries of [[Mt. Koya]] also began printing texts of the Shingon sect, continuously printing up to the 19th century.  It was during the Kamakura period that Kyoto began to be a center of printing.  The 13th-century temple Sen’yuji was one of the most prominent.  Its founder, Shunjo, had brought back books from China and reproduced them using the kabusebori technique.  Texts from Song editions relating to monastic discipline were also printed. Kyoto temples also began printing Pure Land Sect texts during the Kamakura period but the location and dates of production is unknown. (119-121)

It is from the [[Pure Land Sect]] that the first book printed in Japanese, the Kurodani shonin gotoroku (1321), originates. It is most likely due to the populist nature of the Pure Land Sect that this text was printed in Japanese.  It was a collection of sayings by the sect’s founder Honen (1133–1212).  It was printed in hiragana with kanji glossed with furigana.  Later in the 14th century more of Honen’s works were printed.  The Pure Land Sect was one of the first Buddhist sects responsible for reaching out to a general audience through the print medium in the Kamakura period. (121)

[[Zen]] sects had the largest influence on printing during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods.  Texts came from five monasteries in [[Kyoto]] and five in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] and later other Zen temples began to print texts.  It was with the Zen-printed texts that an educational element began to enter into the act of printing.  These texts were reproductions of Zen master sayings intended for the training of novices and disseminating the teachings to lay persons.  Devotionals were still printed but when Zen monasteries printed devotional texts it was at the behest of sponsors rather than the monasteries themselves. (121-122)

Gozan-ban (the name given to texts printed by Zen sects) were for the most part written by Chinese authors but some were by Japanese authors (monks).  They were also kabusebori editions so they looked like Chinese editions.  Chinese monks also assisted in the printing of Gozan-ban.  Eight Chinese monks had traveled to Kyoto in the 14th century (1367) and these monks were mostly block-carvers and printers employed by the Japanese monks and temples.  Some texts, though, were printed at the expense of the Chinese monks.  Most of the Gozan-ban were Zen and other Buddhist texts but some were secular texts of Chinese origin.  It was in the 14th century that the first non-Buddhist texts were printed.  By the 16th century a large number of secular Chinese texts had been printed by Zen temples.  It would seem then that the Zen monks were the custodians of Chinese culture in Japan. (122)

From the 14th to 16th century secular texts are divided into three categories:  1) canonical texts, 2) dictionaries and other sinological reference texts, and 3) poetic texts.  The first secular Chinese text to be printed was [[Confucius]]’ [[Analects]], printed in Sakai in 1364 with commentaries by the third century scholar He Yan.  In 1528, some Chinese medical texts were printed.  Not all the secular texts were printed by Zen monks, but one quarter of the Gozan-ban were secular texts and printed in Japan for the first time.  The Zen monks' interest in secular Chinese literature resulted in much of the Chinese poetry and Confucian literature printed. (123)

By the 16th Century printing was well established but had yet to become commercial.  Prior to this, the printing of books for reading was done primarily by Buddhist monasteries and monks and were mostly Buddhist texts in the original Chinese.  These books may have been made available for sale.  Little is known how the books were circulated before the Tokugawa era. (124-125)

Buddhism influenced both printing and reading.  The earliest references to reading in Japan relates to Buddhist texts. (251) There is a question regarding “reading” because at first Buddhist texts were printed as a meritorious act and “reading” was secondary.  Buddhist texts were studied and there was a ritualized reading of them.  When discussing reading of the sutras and other tests, “reading” takes a number of forms:  silent vs. chanted, individual vs. mass/group.  During the Nara and Heian periods, there was a number of public readings of Buddhist texts for devotional and other religious reasons. (252)

Buddhism played a large role in literacy during the Nara and Heian periods.  Because Buddhism was a scriptural religion, literacy in Chinese was required because texts available to the Japanese were printed in Chinese. During the Heian period it was men who were for the most part literate in Chinese (most likely the “literary Sinetic” that Mair refers to) but there is proof that some women were literate in Chinese as well. After the Heian period Buddhism remained a text-based religion and it was the Zen monks were particularly interested in secular Chinese texts. The literacy in Chinese that was thought to be so important during the Nara and Heian periods became less stringent during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Literacy gave way to the Sino-Japanese kanbun. The literate were most likely to be found in the Zen monasteries during these periods. (270-271) Literacy began to rise during the Tokugawa period as a result of printing becoming commercialized and the Tokugawa bureaucracy had become dependent on printed and written communications among the various government offices in the capital and provinces. (272-273)

So from the Nara period on, literacy in Chinese was important for the Japanese bureaucracy, but more important for the reproduction of Buddhist texts and the production of commentaries on Buddhist texts.  In the 7th and 8th Centuries the greatest efforts at manuscript and printed text (by extension) production was for the copying of Buddhist texts.  There is evidence that the entire Buddhist canon existent in Japan had been copied by 673.  By 700 there was a large number of Buddhist temples and monasteries that required texts.  By 727 the government had established a sutra scriptorium (the Shakyojo) in Nara that was the center of sutra-copying.  It did not survive the move to Heian-kyo.   The number of surviving printed Buddhist texts, as opposed to printed secular texts, helps to illustrate the influence Buddhism had on printing. (91)

== Commerce and Buddhism ==
Buddhism and commerce were also tied closely together.  The two stimulated each other in a cyclical fashion such that, among other things, printing was influenced to a large degree.

The official histories of China, Korea, Japan, and other Asian societies largely neglected to record a number of commercial enterprises that the elite (bureaucracy) were not directly involved with.  The elite (bureaucracy) was only concerned with official missions and held an elitist view regarding the merchants and other commoners that partook in trade with neighboring societies and cultures, which contributes to the manner in which Buddhism was able to infiltrate these societies.  Buddhism followed the same routes the merchants used. As Buddhism spread, so did the demand for religious artifacts and literature. Buddhism also stimulated religious pilgrimages which in turn stimulated trade.  These factors stimulated the growth of local economies and the production of artifacts and the printing of religious texts. This all often went unnoticed by the elite who would otherwise have been vehemently opposed to the spread of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" &gt;Holcombe, Charles.  “Trade-Buddhism:  Maritime Trade, Immigration, and the Buddhist	Landfall in Early Japan.”  Journal of the American Oriental Society.  vol. 119, no.	2, (Apr.-June 1999), 280-292. (pages 280-281)&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the stimulation of commerce and travel, Buddhism assisted trade by providing a social lubricant.  As Holcombe states, “The Buddhist spirit minimized regional differences.”&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(283)  Because of its universalistic philosophy, followers of the religion from different cultures who behaved differently, looked different, and so on, were still able to engage in commerce because they held a common faith.  This in turn helped to propel the spread of Buddhism to other regions.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(282-283)

Buddhist missionaries would accompany private trading caravans and sailing vessels along established trade routes into regions that were untouched by Buddhism.  Sometimes those missionaries would settle in these regions and establish schools/missions or, during the voyage, would convert merchants and traders who would in turn settle in these new regions, raising families, and assisting in the dissemination of the Buddhist faith.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(285)  Sometimes this immigration was accidental, as in the case with Japan. At the time sailing between Japan, China, and Korea was a dangerous affair, so it is understandable that many of these “immigrants” would opt to remain in Japan (or wherever it was they landed), as happened with ten Paekche monks blown off course as they were sailing to China. The elite, for the most part, ignored travelers that were not members of official missions so it is plausible that the number of immigrants such as the Paekche monks was much higher than the official immigrant count indicates.&lt;ref name="Holcombe" /&gt;(288-289)

Commerce and trade facilitated the spread of Buddhism to new regions and with it the spread of Buddhist texts which stimulated the growth of printing industries.  The extensive book trade between Sung China and Korea as well as the employment of Chinese monks by Japanese temples and monasteries was a common practice.  It is very important to keep in mind the role commerce played in the printing of Buddhist texts.

== Conclusion ==
As mentioned above, the Japanese case provides the best example of how Buddhism influenced printing.  In China the religion was a populist one, which actively sought out those that were marginalized by Confucian society.  Korea had a voracious appetite for Buddhist texts and the combination of the scarcity of resources for woodblock printing as well as the Mongol invasions stimulated the use of new printing technologies.  As Mair writes, “There is little doubt that printing in East Asia, from its inception, was primarily a Buddhist phenomenon.”&lt;ref name="Mair" /&gt;(736)  Buddhism, being a universalistic and populist religion, as well as its zealous conversion of the common person to its faith, was able to utilize print technology like no other religion at the time was able to.  The ostensibly oral origins of the religion allowed Buddhism to utilize vernacular language in the printed form to reach a much wider audience than Confucianism, Taoism, or other religions.  So in this way Buddhism was able to wield an influence on print technology that was unknown before its introduction to East Asia.

A '''chute''' is a vertical or [[inclined plane]], channel, or passage through which objects are moved by means of [[gravity]].

==Landform==
A chute, also known as a race, [[flume]], cat, or river canyon, is a steep-sided passage through which water flows rapidly.

Akin to these, man-made chutes, such as the [[timber slide]] and [[log flume]], were used in the [[logging]] industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of [[spillway]]s on some [[dam]]s.  Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes.  These include [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], [[puquios]], and [[acequia]]s.

==Building chute==
Chutes are in common use in tall buildings to allow the rapid transport of items from the upper floors to a central location on one of the lower floors or basement. Chutes may be round, square or rectangular at the top and/or the bottom.

* '''[[Laundry]] chutes''' in [[hotel]]s are placed on each floor to allow the expedient transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel's laundry facility without having to use [[elevator]]s or stairs. In stories, laundry chutes are commonly used as means for the [[protagonist]] to quickly escape, the laundry at the chute's base often serving to cushion the hero's fall.  These chutes are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials.

: Home laundry chutes are placed on each floor of multistory [[home]]s allow the collection of all household members' dirty laundry to one location, conveniently next to the laundry facilities, without the constant transport of laundry bins from story-to-story or room-to-room or up and down stairs. Home laundry chutes may be less common than previously due to building codes or concern regarding [[fireblocking]], the prevention of fire from spreading from floor-to-floor,&lt;ref&gt;Dru Sefton, Sunday, January 23, 2005. .&lt;/ref&gt; as well as child safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.checkthishouse.com/laundry-chutes-a-convenient-way-to-a-disaster.html "Laundry Chutes - a Convenient Way to a … Disaster"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802021555/http://www.checkthishouse.com/laundry-chutes-a-convenient-way-to-a-disaster.html |date=2009-08-02 }}, ''Check This House, Inc.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;January 21, 2009. [http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/fixtures_furnishings/laundry-chute-pros-cons/comment-page-1/#comment-32685 "Laundry Chutes: Pros &amp; Cons"], ''One Project Closer''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction including cabinets, doors, lids, and [[Child safety lock|locks]] may make both risks significantly less than with simple [[stairwell]]s.

* '''Garbage chutes''' are common in high-rise [[apartment building]]s and are used to collect all the building's garbage in the one place. Often the bottom end of the chute is placed directly above a large [[waste receptacle]]. This makes garbage collection more efficient.
* '''[[Mail chute]]s''' are used in some buildings to collect the occupants' mail.  A notable example is the [[Asia Insurance Building]].
* '''[[Escape chute]]s''' are used and proposed for use in evacuation of mining equipment and high-rise buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingstromescapechute.com.au |title=Ingstrom Escape Chute - Building Evacuation Chute |publisher=Ingstromescapechute.com.au |date= |accessdate=2008-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718212321/http://www.ingstromescapechute.com.au/ |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifechute.com/index2.html |title=Baker Life Chute - Rapid, Mass Evacuation from High Rise Structures during Life Threatening Emergencies |publisher=Lifechute.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Construction chutes''' are used to remove [[rubble]] and similar demolition materials safely from taller buildings.  These temporary structures typically consist of a chain of cylindrical or conical plastic tubes, each fitted into the top of the one below and tied together, usually with [[chain]]s.  Together they form a long flexible tube, which is hung down the side of the building.  The lower end of this tube is placed over a [[Skip (container)|skip]] or other receptacle, and waste materials are dropped into the top.  Heavy duty steel chutes may also be used when the debris being deposited is heavy duty and in cases of particularly high buildings.

An [[elevator]] is not a chute since it does not operate by means of gravity.

== Chutes in transportation ==
[[Goust]], a hamlet in southwestern [[France]], is notable for its mountainside chute that is used to transport [[coffin]]s.

Chutes are also found in:
* [[Hopper car]]s
* [[Hopper barge]]s

&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the simulations result in less than 2&amp;nbsp;[[°C]] of warming—near the low end of estimates by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).&lt;ref name="lindsey climate sensitivity frequency distribution"/&gt; Some simulations result in significantly more than the 4&amp;nbsp;°C, which is at the high end of the IPCC estimates.&lt;ref name="lindsey climate sensitivity frequency distribution"/&gt; This pattern (statisticians call it a "right-[[:en:skewness|skewed]] distribution") suggests that if carbon dioxide concentrations double, the probability of very large increases in temperature is greater than the probability of very small increases.&lt;ref name="lindsey climate sensitivity frequency distribution"/&gt;]]

'''Climate sensitivity''' is the [[radiative equilibrium|equilibrium]] temperature change in response to changes of the [[radiative forcing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=PALAEOSENS Project Members|first=|date=|title=Making sense of palaeoclimate sensitivity|url=http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/download/fedora_content/download/ac:162782/CONTENT/Paleosens_Project_Members_2012.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Nature|publication-date=28 November 2012|volume=491|issue=7426|pages=683–91|bibcode=2012Natur.491..683P|doi=10.1038/nature11574|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, climate sensitivity depends on the initial [[climate state]], but potentially can be accurately inferred from precise [[Proxy (climate)|palaeoclimate data]]. Slow [[climate change feedback|climate feedbacks]], especially changes of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, amplify the total Earth system sensitivity by an amount that depends on the time scale considered.&lt;ref name="Hansen et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=James|last2=Sato|first2=Makiko|last3=Russell|first3=Gary|last4=Pushker|first4=Kharecha|date=|title=Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20120294|journal=Royal Society Publishing|publication-date=16 September 2013|volume=371|issue=2001|page=20120294|pages=|arxiv=1211.4846|bibcode=2013RSPTA.37120294H|doi=10.1098/rsta.2012.0294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although climate sensitivity is usually used in the context of radiative forcing by [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), it is thought of as a general property of the climate system: the change in surface air temperature (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) following a unit change in [[radiative forcing]] (RF), and thus is expressed in units of °C/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For this to be useful, the measure must be independent of the nature of the forcing (e.g. from [[greenhouse gases]] or [[solar variation]]); to first order this is indeed found to be so{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

The climate sensitivity specifically due to {{CO2}} is often expressed as the temperature change in °C associated with a doubling of the concentration of [[carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere]].

For coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate models (e.g. [[Coupled model intercomparison project|CMIP5]]) the climate sensitivity is an [[emergent property]]: it is not a model parameter, but rather a result of a combination of model physics and parameters. By contrast, simpler energy-balance models may have climate sensitivity as an explicit parameter.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta T_s = \lambda \cdot RF&lt;/math&gt;

The terms represented in the equation relate radiative forcing (RF) to linear changes in global surface temperature change (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) via the climate sensitivity λ.

It is also possible to estimate climate sensitivity from observations; however, this is difficult due to uncertainties in the forcing and temperature histories.

==Equilibrium and transient climate sensitivity==
The '''equilibrium''' climate sensitivity (ECS) refers to the equilibrium change in global mean near-surface air temperature that would result from a sustained doubling of the atmospheric ([[Carbon dioxide equivalent|equivalent]]) carbon dioxide concentration (ΔT&lt;sub&gt;x2&lt;/sub&gt;). (Here it should be noted that the term "equilibrium," though widely used, is a misused; the climate system is far from the situation of a dynamic equilibrium, which requires equal and opposite fluxes on all paths; it is better characterized as a "steady state" or "near steady state." However the term "equilibrium" is widely used.) As estimated by the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] (''AR5'') "there is ''high confidence'' that ECS is ''extremely unlikely'' less than 1°C and ''medium confidence'' that the ECS is ''likely'' between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and ''very unlikely'' greater than 6°C."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis - IPCC Working Group I Contribution to AR5|author=Bindoff|first=Nathaniel L.|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|year=2013|isbn=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|pages=|chapter=10.8.2 Constraints on Long-Term Climate Change and the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link2=Peter A.

A comprehensive model estimate of equilibrium sensitivity thus requires a very long model integration; fully equilibrating ocean temperatures requires integrations of thousands of model years, although it is possible to produce an approximate estimate more quickly using the method of Gregory et al.

Over the 50–100 year timescale, the climate response to forcing is likely to follow the TCR; for considerations of climate stabilization on the millennial time scale, the ECS is more pertinent.

An estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity may be made from combining the transient climate sensitivity with the known properties of the ocean reservoirs and the surface heat fluxes; this is the '''effective''' climate sensitivity. This "may vary with forcing history and climate state".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

==Earth System Sensitivity==
A less commonly used concept, the '''Earth system sensitivity''' (ESS), can be defined which includes the effects of slower feedbacks, such as the albedo change from melting the large ice sheets that covered much of the northern hemisphere during the [[last glacial maximum]]. These extra feedbacks make the ESS larger than the ECS — possibly twice as large — but also mean that it may well not apply to current conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/|title=Target {{CO2}}|last=|first=|date=7 April 2008|work=RealClimate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824042512/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/04/target-co2/|archive-date=24 August 2017|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESS includes the 'whole' system, but omitting the carbon cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/01/on-sensitivity-part-i/|title=On sensitivity: Part I|publisher=RealClimate.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sensitivity to carbon dioxide forcing ==

Climate sensitivity is often evaluated in terms of the change in equilibrium temperature due to radiative forcing due to the [[greenhouse effect]]. According to the [[Svante Arrhenius#Greenhouse effect|Arrhenius]] relation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Martin E.|date=|title=Earthquakes and Weatherquakes: Mathematics and Climate Change|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201010/rtx101001278p.pdf|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|publication-date=November 2010|volume=57|issue=10|pages=1278–84|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the radiative forcing (and hence the change in temperature) is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of the concentration of [[infrared]]-absorbing gasses in the atmosphere. Thus, the sensitivity of temperature to gasses in the atmosphere (most notably [[carbon dioxide]]) is often expressed in terms of the change in temperature per doubling of the concentration of the gas.

=== Radiative forcing due to doubled {{CO2}} ===

{{CO2}} climate sensitivity has a component directly due to radiative forcing by {{CO2}}, and a further contribution arising from [[climate change feedback|climate feedbacks]], both positive and negative. "Without any feedbacks, a doubling of {{CO2}} (which amounts to a forcing of 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) would result in 1 °C [[global warming]], which is easy to calculate and is undisputed. The remaining uncertainty is due entirely to feedbacks in the system, namely, [[Water vapor feedback#Role of water vapor|the water vapor feedback]], the [[ice-albedo feedback]], the [[cloud feedback]], and the lapse rate feedback";&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2008/&gt; addition of these feedbacks leads to a value of the sensitivity to {{CO2}} doubling of approximately 3&amp;nbsp;°C ± 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C, which corresponds to a value of λ of 0.8 K/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

In the earlier 1979 NAS report&lt;ref name=charney1979/&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;7), the radiative forcing due to doubled {{CO2}} is estimated to be 4 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as calculated (for example) in [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan|Ramanathan]] et al. (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ramanathan|first=V.|author2=Lian|first2=M.S.|author3=Cess|first3=R.D.|date=|title=Increased Atmospheric {{CO2}}: Zonal and Seasonal Estimates of the Effect on Radiative Energy Balance and Surface Temperature|url=http://www-ramanathan.ucsd.edu/files/pr21.pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|publication-date=20 August 1979|volume=84|issue=C8|pages=4949–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the IPCC adopted the revised value of 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the difference attributed to a "stratospheric temperature adjustment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

=== Consensus estimates ===
A committee on [[global warming|anthropogenic global warming]] convened in 1979 by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and chaired by [[Jule Charney]]&lt;ref name=charney1979/&gt; estimated climate sensitivity to be 3&amp;nbsp;°C, plus or minus 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C. Only two sets of models were available; one, due to [[Syukuro Manabe]], exhibited a climate sensitivity of 2&amp;nbsp;°C, the other, due to [[James E. Hansen]], exhibited a climate sensitivity of 4&amp;nbsp;°C. "According to Manabe,
Charney chose 0.5 °C as a not-unreasonable margin of error, subtracted it from Manabe’s number, and added it to Hansen’s. Thus was born the 1.5 °C-to-4.5 °C range of likely climate sensitivity that has appeared in every greenhouse assessment since..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kerr|first=Richard A.|date=13 August 2004|title=Three Degrees of Consensus|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/305/5686/932|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=932–4|doi=10.1126/science.305.5686.932|pmid=15310873|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 4 of the "[[Jule Gregory Charney#Charney Report|Charney report]]" compares the predictions of the models: "We conclude that the predictions ... are basically consistent and mutually supporting.

====Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change====

The 1990 [[IPCC First Assessment Report]] estimated that equilibrium climate sensitivity to {{CO2}} doubling lay between 1.5 and 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C, with a "best guess in the light of current knowledge" of 2.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990),''  Report prepared for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by Working Group I, J.T. Houghton, G.J. Jenkins and J.J. Ephraums (eds.), [https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_05.pdf chapter 5, Equilibrium Climate Change — and its Implications for the Future], pp. 138–9&lt;/ref&gt; This used models with strongly simplified representations of the ocean dynamics. The [[IPCC supplementary report, 1992]] which used full ocean [[General circulation model|GCM]]s nonetheless saw "no compelling reason to warrant changing" from this estimate &lt;ref&gt;IPCC '92 p118 section B3.5&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] found that "No strong reasons have emerged to change" these estimates,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC SAR p 34, technical summary section D.2&lt;/ref&gt; with much of the uncertainty attributed to cloud processes. As noted above, the IPCC TAR retained the likely range 1.5 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="albritton 2001 climate sensitivity"/&gt;

Authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] ([[Gerald Meehl|Meehl]] ''et al.'', 2007)&lt;ref name="meehl 2007 climate sensitivity"&gt;{{citation|author=Meehl, G.A.|first=|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report WG1 2007|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-5.html#box-10-2|volume=|pages=|chapter=Ch. 10: Global Climate Projections; Box 10.2: Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity|display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; stated that confidence in estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity had increased substantially since the TAR. AR4's assessment was based on a combination of several independent lines of evidence, including observed climate change and the strength of known "[[climate change feedback|feedback]]s" simulated in [[global climate model|general circulation models]].&lt;ref name="epa climate sensitivity"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; IPCC authors concluded that the global mean equilibrium warming for doubling {{CO2}} (to a concentration of 560 [[parts per notation|ppmv]]), or equilibrium climate sensitivity, very likely is greater than 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (2.7&amp;nbsp;°F) and likely to lie in the range 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 8.1&amp;nbsp;°F), with a most likely value of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F). For fundamental physical reasons, as well as data limitations, the IPCC states a climate sensitivity higher than 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (8.1&amp;nbsp;°F) cannot be ruled out, but that agreement for these values with observations and [[proxy (climate)|"proxy" climate data]] is generally worse compared to values in the 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 8.1&amp;nbsp;°F) range.&lt;ref name="epa climate sensitivity"/&gt;

The TAR uses the word "likely" in a qualitative sense to describe the likelihood of the 1.5 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C range being correct.&lt;ref name="meehl 2007 climate sensitivity"/&gt; AR4, however, quantifies the probable range of climate sensitivity estimates:&lt;ref name="solomon 2007 uncertainty"&gt;{{citation|author=Solomon, S.|first=|title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis|volume=|pages=|at=[https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2.html Box TS.1: Treatment of Uncertainties in the Working Group I Assessment]|chapter=Technical summary|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC AR4 WG1|2007}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*2–4.5&amp;nbsp;°C is "likely", = greater than 66% chance of being correct
*less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C is "very unlikely" = less than 10%

The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] stated: Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C (high
confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6&amp;nbsp;°C (medium confidence).

==Calculations of {{CO2}} sensitivity from observational data==

=== Sample calculation using industrial-age data ===
Rahmstorf (2008)&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2008/&gt; provides an informal example of how climate sensitivity might be estimated empirically, from which the following is modified. Denote the sensitivity, i.e. the equilibrium increase in global mean temperature including the effects of feedbacks due to a sustained forcing by doubled {{CO2}} (taken as 3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), as ''x'' °C. If [[Earth]] were to experience an equilibrium temperature change of ΔT (°C) due to a sustained forcing of ΔF (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), then one might say that ''x''/(ΔT) = (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(ΔF), i.e. that ''x'' = ΔT * (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/ΔF. The global temperature increase since the beginning of the industrial period (taken as 1750) is about 0.8&amp;nbsp;°C, and the radiative forcing due to {{CO2}} and other long-lived greenhouse gases (mainly methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons) emitted since that time is about 2.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Neglecting other forcings and considering the temperature increase to be an equilibrium increase would lead to a sensitivity of about 1.1&amp;nbsp;°C. However, ΔF also contains contributions due to solar activity (+0.3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), aerosols (−1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ozone (0.3 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and other lesser influences, bringing the total forcing over the industrial period to 1.6 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; according to best estimate of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC AR4]], albeit with substantial uncertainty. Additionally the fact that the climate system is not at equilibrium must be accounted for; this is done by subtracting the planetary heat uptake rate H from the forcing; i.e., ''x'' = ΔT * (3.7 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/(ΔF-H). Taking planetary heat uptake rate as the rate of ocean heat uptake, estimated by the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC AR4]] as 0.2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, yields a value for ''x'' of 2.1&amp;nbsp;°C. (All numbers are approximate and quite uncertain.)

=== Sample calculation using ice-age data ===

In 2008, Farley wrote: "... examine the change in temperature and solar forcing between [[glaciation]] (ice age) and [[interglacial]] (no ice age) periods. The change in temperature, revealed in [[ice core]] samples, is 5&amp;nbsp;°C, while the change in solar forcing is 7.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The computed climate sensitivity is therefore 5/7.1 = 0.7&amp;nbsp;K(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. We can use this empirically derived climate sensitivity to predict the temperature rise from a forcing of 4&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, arising from a doubling of the atmospheric {{CO2}} from pre-industrial levels. The result is a predicted temperature increase of 3&amp;nbsp;°C."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farley|first=John W.|date=|title=The Scientific Case for Modern Anthropogenic Global Warming|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2008/07/01/the-scientific-case-for-modern-anthropogenic-global-warming|journal=[[Monthly Review]]|publication-date=5 July 2008|volume=60|issue=3|pages=|doi=10.14452/MR-060-03-2008-07_5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on analysis of uncertainties in total forcing, in Antarctic cooling, and in the ratio of global to Antarctic cooling of the [[last glacial maximum]] relative to the present, Ganopolski and Schneider von Deimling (2008) infer a range of 1.3 to 6.8&amp;nbsp;°C for climate sensitivity determined by this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Ganopolski|first=Andrey|author2=von Deimling|first2=Thomas Schneider|date=|title=Comment on "Aerosol radiative forcing and climate sensitivity deduced from the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene transition" by Petr Chylek and Ulrike Lohmann|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2008GL033888|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|publication-date=5 December 2008|volume=35|issue=23|pages=L23703|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3523703G|doi=10.1029/2008GL033888|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lower figure was calculated in a 2011 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' paper by Schmittner ''et al.'', who combined temperature reconstructions of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] with climate model simulations to suggest a rate of global warming from doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide of a median of 2.3&amp;nbsp;°C and uncertainty 1.7–2.6&amp;nbsp;°C (66% probability range), less than the earlier estimates of 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C as the 66% probability range. Schmittner et al. said their "results imply less probability of extreme climatic change than previously thought." Their work suggests that climate sensitivities &gt;6&amp;nbsp;°C "cannot be reconciled with paleoclimatic and geologic evidence, and hence should be assigned near-zero probability."&lt;ref name="Schmittner11"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmittner|first=Andreas|author2=Urban|first2=Nathan M.|author3=Shakun|first3=Jeremy D.|author4=Mahowald|first4=Natalie M.|author5=Clark|first5=Peter U.|author6=Bartlein|first6=Patrick J.|author7=Mix|first7=Alan C.|author8=Rosell-Melé|first8=Antoni|date=9 December 2011|title=Climate Sensitivity Estimated from Temperature Reconstructions of the Last Glacial Maximum|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6061/1385.abstract?sid=a7ab01bf-f2e5-413d-bbf0-c2c5ac2362df|journal=Science|volume=334|issue=6061|pages=1385–8|bibcode=2011Sci...334.1385S|doi=10.1126/science.1203513|pmid=22116027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/climate_sensitivity_limited_extreme_projections_186483.html Climate sensitivity to CO2 more limited than extreme projections], news article re Schmittner et al., ''Innovations Report'',  25 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the value of the climate sensitivity in that case is most uncertain, there is a 70 percent chance that it exceeds the maximum IPCC value. This is not good news," said Schlesinger.

&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, "various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3&amp;nbsp;°C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5&amp;nbsp;°C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to difficulties in ruling out higher values."

==Radiative forcing functions==
A number of different inputs can give rise to radiative forcing. In addition to the downwelling radiation due to the greenhouse effect, the [[IPCC First Assessment Report|IPCC First Scientific Assessment Report]] listed solar radiation variability due to orbital changes, variability due to changes in solar irradiance, direct aerosol effects (''e.g.,'' changes in albedo due to cloud cover), indirect aerosol effects, and surface characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;''Climate Change: The IPCC Scientific Assessment (1990),''  Report prepared for Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by Working Group I, J.T. Houghton, G.J. Jenkins and J.J. Ephraums (eds.), [https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_02.pdf chapter 2, Radiative Forcing of Climate], pp. 41–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sensitivity to solar forcing==
[[Solar irradiance]] is about 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; brighter during [[solar maximum]] than during [[solar minimum]]. Analysis by Camp and Tung shows that this correlates with a variation of ±0.1&amp;nbsp;°C in measured average global temperature between the peak and minimum of the 11-year solar cycle.&lt;ref name="solar-climate"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Camp|first=Charles D.|author2=Tung|first2=Ka Kit|date=|title=Surface warming by the solar cycle as revealed by the composite mean difference projection|url=http://depts.washington.edu/amath/research/articles/Tung/journals/GRL-solar-07.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|publication-date=18 July 2007|volume=34|issue=14|pages=L14703|bibcode=2007GeoRL..3414703C|doi=10.1029/2007GL030207|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113025833/http://depts.washington.edu/amath/research/articles/Tung/journals/GRL-solar-07.pdf|archivedate=13 January 2012|accessdate=20 January 2012|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this data (incorporating the Earth's albedo and the fact that the solar absorption cross-section is 1/4 of the surface area of the Earth), Tung, Zhou and Camp (2008) derive a transient sensitivity value of 0.69 to 0.97&amp;nbsp;°C/(W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tung|first=Ka Kit|author2=Zhou|first2=Jiansong|author3=Camp|first3=Charles D.|date=|title=Constraining model transient climate response using independent observations of solar-cycle forcing and response|url=https://www.calpoly.edu/~camp/Publications/Tung_etal_GRL_2008.pdf|format=PDF|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|publication-date=12 September 2008|volume=35|issue=17|pages=L17707|bibcode=2008GeoRL..3517707T|doi=10.1029/2008GL034240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would correspond to a transient climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide doubling of 2.5 to 3.6 K, similar to the range of the current scientific consensus. However, they note that this is the transient response to a forcing with an 11-year cycle; due to lag effects, they estimate the equilibrium response to forcing would be about 1.5 times as high.

The '''ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems''' ('''CHI''') series of academic conferences is generally considered the most prestigious in the field of [[human–computer interaction]] and is one of the top ranked conferences in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenceranks.com/index.html?searchall=Human+Factors+in+Computing+Systems|title=Conference Ranks|author=Boris Schauerte|work=conferenceranks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hosted by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGCHI]], the [[Special Interest Group]] on computer–human interaction. CHI has been held annually since 1982 and attracts thousands of international attendees. CHI 2015 was held in [[Seoul]], South Korea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chi2015.acm.org|title=CHI 2015 - Crossings|author=Juho Kim|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CHI 2016 was held in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], United States from May 7 to May 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chi2016.acm.org/|title=CHI 2016|work=acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHI 2017 was held in Denver, Colorado from May 6–11, 2017.

==History==
The CHI conference series started with the ''Human Factors in Computer Systems'' conference in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland|Gaithersburg]], Maryland, US in 1982, organized by Bill Curtis and [[Ben Shneiderman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=15683.15685 | title=No Members, No Officers, No Dues | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting the formation of the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer–Human Interaction (SIGCHI) was first publicly announced. ACM SIGCHI became the sponsor of the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The first CHI conference was held in Boston, Massachusetts, US, in 1983. The second conference took place in San Francisco, in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://old.sigchi.org/bulletin/1996.1/conf-chairs.html | title=The CHI Conference: Interviews with Conference Chairs | first=Steven | last=Pemberton | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] |year=1996 |accessdate=29 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, CHI conferences have been held annually in spring each year. Until 1992 the conference was held in Canada or the US. In 1993 CHI moved to Europe for the first time and was held in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Past CHI Conferences | url=http://www.chi2007.org/welcome/pastchi.php | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | year=2006 | accessdate=29 September 2008 | work=CHI 2007 website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, CHI has grown in popularity. The 1982 meeting drew 907 attendees. CHI 90 attracted 2,314. Attendance has been fairly stable since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.chi2007.org/attend/2006RegStats.php | year=2006 | last=Wixon | first=Dennis | title=CHI 2006 Registration Statistics | publisher=[[SIGCHI]] | accessdate=29 September 2008 | work=CHI 2007 website }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the early years CHI became highly selective. Since 1993 the acceptance rate for full papers was consistently below 30 percent. After 1992 the average acceptance rate was around 20 percent. The number of accepted full papers is slowly increasing and reached  157 accepted papers with an acceptance rate of 22 percent in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://portal.acm.org/browse_dl.cfm?part=series&amp;idx=SERIES260 | accessdate=2 April 2010 | publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] | work=ACM Digital Library | title=CHI: Papers Acceptance Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; CHI continues to grow, reaching over 3,300 attendees in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sig_chi/status/328768821856985088|title=ACM CHI Conference|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3,800 in 2016.

==Tracks==
The CHI conference consists of multiple tracks, including:

* Academic papers and notes (short papers) on a variety of topics, such as ([[ubiquitous computing]], [[Software visualization|visualization]], [[usability]] and [[user experience design]])
* Posters and demonstrations
* Workshops and courses hosted by domain experts
* Invited panels on relevant topics
* Case studies from industry practitioners

'''Ectomesenchyme''' has properties similar to [[mesenchyme]]. The origin of the ectomesenchyme is disputed. It is either like the mesenchyme, arising from [[mesoderm|mesodermic cells]], or conversely arising from [[neural crest cells]]&lt;ref name="pmid14699583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weston JA, Yoshida H, Robinson V, Nishikawa S, Fraser ST, Nishikawa S |title=Neural crest and the origin of ectomesenchyme: neural fold heterogeneity suggests an alternative hypothesis |journal=Dev.

Ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth, and, notably, the [[branchial arches]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">'''Elicitors''' in plant biology are extrinsic or foreign molecules often associated with plant pests, diseases or synergistic organisms.  Elicitor molecules can attach to special receptor proteins located on plant cell membranes. These receptors are able to recognize the molecular pattern of elicitors and trigger intracellular defence signalling via the [[Octadecanoid pathway]]. This response results in the enhanced synthesis of metabolites which reduce damage and increase resistance to pest, disease or environmental stress. This is an immune response known as pattern triggered immunity or PTI.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic plant defense elicitors|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2014.00804/abstract|journal = Plant Physiology|date = 2015|pmc = 4306307|pmid = 25674095|pages = 804|volume = 5|doi = 10.3389/fpls.2014.00804|first = Yasemin|last = Bektas|first2 = Thomas|last2 = Eulgem}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PTI is effective against necrotrophic microorganisms.

An example is [[chitosan]] which is found in insects, fungi and the shells of crustaceans.  Chitosan is used in agriculture as a natural biocontrol agent, to improve plant health and increase crop yields.

== Effectors and Hormones ==

Effectors and hormones are other signalling molecules often confused with elicitors.  Elicitors and effectors differ from hormones in that they are not produced within the organism that they are triggering a response in, and are usually not naturally occurring in the organism.

=== Plant Hormones ===

[[Plant hormone]]s are signalling molecules produced within the plant (i.e. they are endogenous). Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally and can be moved to other parts of the plant.  Examples of plant hormones are auxins, cytokins, gibberellin, ethylene, abscisic acid, salicylic acid and jasmonates.  Hormones naturally occur in extremely low, finely balanced, concentrations.

Plant hormones act as plant growth regulators or modulators.  Modulators are defined as molecules that "bind to a particular target protein, mainly to an enzyme, thereby directly changing its activity, i.e. increasing or decreasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Natural elicitors, effectors and modulators of plant responses|last = Massimo E. Maffei, Gen-Ichiro Arimura and Axel Mithöfer|first = |date = 2012|journal = Nat. Prod. Rep. |volume=29|pages=1288–1303|doi = 10.1039/C2NP20053H|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is salicylic acid which is a modulator of catalase isozymes activity and jasmonate, which modulates phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salicylic acid is a modulator of catalase isozymes in chickpea plants infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0981942811003652|journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry|date = March 2012|pages = 154–161|volume = 52|doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.12.005|first = S.|last = Gayatridevi|first2 = S. K.|last2 = Jayalakshmi|first3 = K.|last3 = Sreeramulu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effectors ===

Effectors are proteins secreted by microbial pathogens which can either trigger or compromise immunity depending on the ability of perception (presence of suitable receptor) and response (appropriate defence reaction) of the plant. Effector could be extracellular or injected directly into cells.

Microorganisms are able to inject effectors directly into host cells to by-pass induced defences in plants. This compromises the host plant's defence system and is referred to as effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS). The remaining immunity is called basal defense &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The plant immune system|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/nature05286.html|journal = Nature|date = November 16, 2006|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 323–329|volume = 444|issue = 7117|doi = 10.1038/nature05286|first = Jonathan D.

In response to this threat, plant's have evolved effector recognition protein receptors to recognise, or monitor, effectors and initiate effector-triggered immunity (ETI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Plant Immune Responses Against Viruses: How Does a Virus Cause Disease?|url = http://www.plantcell.org/content/25/5/1489|journal = The Plant Cell|date = 2013-05-01|issn = 1040-4651|pmid = 23709626|pages = 1489–1505|volume = 25|issue = 5|doi = 10.1105/tpc.113.111658|first = Kranthi K.|last = Mandadi|first2 = Karen-Beth G.|last2 = Scholthof|pmc=3694688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ETI is a strong immune response that efficiently protects plants from avirulent biotrophic pathogens and is often associated with the hypersensitive reaction (HR), a form of programmed death of plant cells at infection sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Crop Protection and Commercialisation of Elicitors ==
Elicitors can protect crops from diseases, stress and damage. Elicitors do not need to be directly toxic for pathogenic organisms or pests to be of benefit.  Therefore, they are an alternative to conventional pesticides  which are often harmful for the environment, farmers and consumers &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and for which consumers are increasingly seeking safer alternatives.

==Test phase==

The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]]. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the [[Araucanía Region]], (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite book

==First phase==

From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, [[computer]]s, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web

==Future plans==

In 2007,  the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.

Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are [[electronic whiteboard]]s for [[math]], palm pilots or pocket PCs for [[physics]], and projectors for teaching sciences.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[science]] program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI ([[hypothesis]], [[experimentation]], [[Education|instruction]]) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Chile - Enlaces hace la mejor clase de Ciencias.
| publisher = OEI - Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos
| date = 2007-08-04
| url = http://www.oei.es/noticias/spip.php?article795
| accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for [[chemistry]], and animals for dissection for [[biology]]) that many schools in Chile face.

===Adult Education===

Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through [[adult education]]. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a [[word processor]], how to use the [[internet]], and how to create and use an [[email]] account.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6377">'''Ethogenics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|θ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|s}}; "the study of behavior as generated by persons who exhibit a character, an ethos",&lt;ref&gt;Wayne C. Boot (1988), ''The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions, 1967-1988'', University of Chicago Press, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἦθος ''ethos'', "custom, character" and γένος ''genos'', "birth, generation") is an interdisciplinary social scientific approach that attempts to understand the systems of belief or means through which individuals attach significance to their actions and form their identities by linking these to the larger structure of rules (norms) and cultural resources in society. For [[Rom Harré]], the founder of ethogenics, it represents a radical innovation in traditional psychology, even a completely "new psychology" that should take its place.  (Harré et al., 1985: 129).

== Roots of ethogenics ==
The origins of ethogenic social science are in [[microsociology]] and [[symbolic interactionism]]: in particular, Erving Goffman's [[dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical sociology]] and Harold Garfinkel's [[ethnomethodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, Ian. (1991). ''Social Selves: Theories of the Social Formation of Personality.'' London: Sage Publications, 55-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Goffman and Garfinkel looked at the particular ways in which social actors manage authenticity and construct social order through their performances. Therefore, microsociologists working in this tradition are concerned with [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self in everyday life]].

== Ethogenic theories ==
Ethogenicists argue that the unified self (or 'I') emerges through everyday discourse and is enabled through metaphors. Rom Harré states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All that is personal in our mental and emotional lives is individually appropriated from the conversation going on around us and perhaps idiosyncratically transformed. The structure of our thinking and our feeling will reflect, in various ways, the form and content of that conversation. The main thesis of this work is that mind is no sort of entity, but a system of beliefs structured by a cluster of grammatical models. The science of psychology must be reformed accordingly (1983: 20).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Methodologically, ethogenics starts with the social formation as the primary human reality ''and then'' shows how the human self exists within it via personally modified 'templates.'(Harré 1983: 64-65). While Harré makes a distinction between personal and social being, he does not claim that personal being is prior to social being.

By contrast, John Shotter's approach to ethogenics analyzes social action with others (as opposed to individual rule-following and performances), which is said to give individuals 'social powers.' There is no cognitive structure of the social self-independent of social context (Shotter 1983: 33). Therefore, Shotter emphasizes the practical necessities which bring individuals together in moral configurations, which it is necessary to hermeneutically approach. Shotter believes this is a better way to understand the "accounting practices" (and resulting consciousness) of individuals than Harré's methods. 

[[Kenneth Gergen]] argues that scientific activity (theories) also plays a significant role in [[social constructionism|constructing the reality]] and values of individuals. Gergen argues that scientific theories appeal to the common sense within our everyday symbolic world. Societal power relations are affected by groups who try to impose certain frameworks for understanding selfhood, which then guide action (Gergen 1989).

== Critique of mainstream social psychology ==
Ethogenics emerged from a period of crisis in social psychology, representing a rejection of experimental methods (Ginsburg 1995). Such methods apply external "treatments" to groups of individuals rather than studying the personal "sense-making" that individuals must engage in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in order to live in society.

&lt;!-- The summary found in the opening paragraphs give the impression that the article is more concerned with language learning than extensive reading. --&gt;'''Extensive reading''', '''free reading''', '''book flood''', or '''reading for pleasure''' is a way of [[language learning]], including [[foreign language]] learning, through large amounts of reading. As well as facilitating acquisition of vocabulary, it is believed to increase motivation through positive affective benefits. It is believed that extensive reading is an important factor in education. Proponents such as Krashen (1989) claim that reading alone will increase encounters with unknown words, bringing learning opportunities by [[inferencing]]. The learner's encounters with unknown words in specific contexts will allow the learner to infer and thus learn those words' meanings. While the mechanism is commonly accepted as true, its importance in language learning is disputed. ({{harvnb|Cobb|2007|p= }})

[[File:Silent Reading time in a Lao school.jpg|thumb|About half of all children in rural Laos speak a minority ethnic language at home, and have difficulty in school, which is taught only in the Lao language. This primary school in Laos began a daily reading period in September 2013, in which children select a book to read simply for enjoyment. Big Brother Mouse, a literacy project that sponsored the program, began conducting a study in 2013 to measure reading and vocabulary improvements in schools that had this program.]]

In language learning, extensive reading is contrasted with ''intensive reading'', which is slow, careful reading of a small amount of difficult text – it is when one is "focused on the language rather than the text".&lt;ref name="waring"&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/er/what_and_why/what_is_er.htmm Extensive Reading FAQ], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive and intensive reading are two approaches to language learning and instruction, and may be used concurrently;&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt; intensive reading is, however, the more common approach, and often the only one used.&lt;ref name="waring" /&gt;

Extensive reading has been used and advocated in language learning since at least the 19th century (with [[Latin]]; [[#Translation of modern literature|see below]]). In the first language, many connections have been made between reading and vocabulary size, as well as other academic skills.

== Concepts ==
''Free voluntary reading'' refers to using extensive reading in language education. Students are free to choose a book that they like and are allowed to read it at their own pace. The aim of a free voluntary reading program is to help students to enjoy reading, so assessment is usually minimized or eliminated entirely.

The idea behind extensive reading is that a lot of reading of interesting material that is slightly below, at, or barely above the full comprehension level of the reader will foster improved language skills. [[Graded reader]]s are often used. For foreign-language learners, some researchers have found that the use of [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]]es for "difficult" words is advantageous to [[vocabulary]] acquisition ({{harvnb|Rott|Williams|Cameron|2002}}) but at least one study finds it has no effect ({{harvnb|Holley|King|2008}}). A number of studies report significant incidental vocabulary gain in extensive reading in a foreign language ({{harvnb|Huckin|Coady|1999}}). Advocates claim it can enhance skill in speaking as well as in reading.

{{harvnb|Day and Bamford (1988)|pp=7–8|Ref={{harvid|Day|Bamford|1988}}}} gave a number of traits common or basic to the extensive reading approach. Students read as much as possible. Reading materials are well within the reader's grammatical and vocabulary competence.  The material should be varied in subject matter and character.

Students choose their own reading material and are not compelled to finish uninteresting materials. Reading material is normally for pleasure, information or general understanding; reading is its own reward with few or no follow-up exercises after reading; reading is individual and silent.  Reading speed is usually faster when students read materials they can easily understand.

Nation(2005) suggests that learning from extensive reading should meet the following conditions: focusing on the meaning of the English text, understanding the type of learning that can occur through such reading, having interesting and engaging books, getting learners to do large quantities of reading at an appropriate level, and making sure that learning from reading is supported by other kinds of learning. In order to meet the conditions needed for learning from extensive reading at the students’ proficiency levels, it is essential to make use of simplified texts (Nation, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Nation, K. (2005). Children’s reading comprehension difficulties. In M. J. Snowling and C. Hulme (Eds.), The Science of Reading: A Handbook (pp 248–265).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eteachershub.com/2015/05/07/developing-china-students-english-reading-ability-through-extensive-reading/&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher is a role model who also orients the students to the goals of the program, explains the idea and methodology, keeps records of what has been read, and guides students in material selection and maximizing the effect of the program.

Some recent practitioners have not followed all of these traits, or have added to them, for example,  requiring regular follow-up exercises such as story summaries or discussions and the use of audio materials in tandem with the readings ({{harvnb|Bell|1998}}).

== Graded reader series ==
A [[graded reader]] series of books that increase in difficulty from shorter texts using more common words in the first volumes, to longer texts with less common vocabulary in later volumes. {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008}}}} cites Oxford's ''Bookworm series'', which includes the 2,500 most frequent words, The ''Longman Bridge Series'' (1945), with a systematic grading up to 8,000 words, now out of print, and the ''Penguin/Longman Active Reading'' series with its 3,000 word-family target.

Many series of graded readers exist in English, and series exist also in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;ref name="Hill2008"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, readers are notably absent or scarce in Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese,&lt;ref name="Hill2008" /&gt; though since 2006, an extensive reader series is available in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/tadoku-english.html What is Extensive Reading?] {{en icon}} [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/ 日本語多読研究会] (Japanese Extensive Reading Research Society) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html 活動報告] (Report on Activities) [http://www.nihongo-yomu.jp/info.html#2006 2006] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; English readers have primarily been produced by British publishers, rather than American or other Anglophone nations. {{As of|1997}}, only one small series (15 volumes) was published in the United States, and a few in Europe outside the UK, with the majority in the UK.&lt;ref name="Hill1997"&gt;{{Harv|Hill|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation of modern literature ==
For advocates of extensive reading, lack of reading selection is an acute issue in [[classical language]]s such as [[Latin]] – the main readings available being quite difficult and are perceived as dry. To increase the available literature and make more light selection available, modern literature (particularly children's literature, comics, and genre fiction) may be translated into classical languages – see [[list of Latin translations of modern literature]] for examples in Latin. As [[Francis William Newman|F. W. Newman]] writes in his introduction to a Latin translation of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'':
:"[N]o accuracy of reading small portions of Latin will ever be so effective as extensive reading; and to make extensive reading possible to the many, the style ought to be very easy and the matter attractive."&lt;ref&gt;Francis William Newman, ''Rebilius Cruso: Robinson Crusoe, in Latin; A Book to Lighten Tedium to a Learner'', London, Trübner &amp; Co., 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Threshold ==
Laufer suggests that 3,000 [[word family|word families]] or 5,000 lexical items are the threshold ({{harvnb|Laufer|1997|p= }}). Coady &amp; Nation (1998) suggest 98% of lexical coverage and 5,000 word families or 8,000 items for a pleasurable reading ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). After this threshold, the learner leaves the beginner paradox, and enters a [[virtuous circle]] ({{harvnb|Coady &amp; Huckin|1997|p=233}}). Then, extensive reading becomes more efficient.

== Limits ==
{{harvnb|Cobb (2007)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}}, {{harvnb|McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|McQuillan|Krashen|2008|p= }}}}, and {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} offer contrasting perspectives. All agree on the need of lexical input, but Cobb (2007; 2008) supported by {{harvnb|Parry (1997)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Parry|1997|p= }}}} denounces the sufficiency of extensive reading, the current lexical expansion pedagogy, especially for confirmed learners. According to Cobb (2007), {{harvnb|Krashen (1989)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Krashen|1989|p= }}}}'s Input Hypothesis states that extensive reading generates a continuous hidden learning (lexical input), eventually "doing the entire job" of vocabulary acquisition. This hypothesis is without empirical evidence, neither on the extent (% of global [[vocabulary acquisition]]), nor on the sufficiency of extensive reading for [[lexicon]] learning (Cobb 2007).

Cobb (2007) thus proposed a computer-based study to quantitatively assess the efficiency of extensive reading. Cobb estimated the reading quantity of common learners within the L2 language (~175,000 words over two years), then randomly took 10 words in each of the first thousand most frequent words, the second thousand, and the third thousand, to see how many times those words would appear. Those results should be higher than 6 to 10 encounters, the number needed for stable initial word learning to occur. Cobb (2007) summarizes as following: "[the quantitative study] shows the extreme unlikelihood of developing an adequate L2 reading lexicon [above 2,000 words families] through reading alone, even in highly favorable circumstances" since "for the vast majority of L2 learners, free or wide reading alone is not a sufficient source of vocabulary knowledge for reading". Thereafter, Cobb restated the need of lexical input, and stated the possibility to increase it using computing capabilities.

McQuillan &amp; Krashen (2008) answer that learners may read far more than 175,000 words but rather +1,000,000 words in 2 years, but {{harvnb|Cobb (2008)|p=|Ref={{harvid|Cobb|2008|p= }}}} counters that view as being based on excessively successful cases of reading oversimplified texts. Experiments cited by McQuillan &amp; Krashen use easy and fast to read texts, but not material suitable for discovering new vocabulary; unsimplified texts are far harder and slower to read.

== Advocacy and support organizations ==
The Extensive Reading Foundation is a not-for-profit, charitable organization whose purpose is to support and promote extensive reading. One of its initiatives is the annual Language Learner Literature Award for the best new works in English. Another is maintaining a bibliography of research on extensive reading. The Foundation is also interested in helping educational institutions set up extensive reading programs through grants that fund the purchase of books and other reading material.&lt;ref&gt;http://erfoundation.org/wordpress/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Extensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG) of the Japan Association for Language Teaching &lt;ref&gt;[http://jalt.org/ Japan Association for Language Teaching (JALT)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a not-for-profit organization which exists to help promote Extensive Reading in Japan.  Via a website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/ xtensive Reading Special Interest Group (ER SIG)]&lt;/ref&gt; the publications ''Extensive Reading in Japan'' and ''Journal of Extensive Reading'', presentations throughout Japan, and other activities, the ER SIG aims to help teachers set up and make the most of their ER programs and ER research projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ersig.org/drupal-ersig/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensive listening ==
Similar to extensive reading is ''extensive listening'', which is the analogous approach to listening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robwaring.org/el/starting_extensive_listening.htm Starting Extensive Listening], Rob Waring&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/06/24/elt.ccq042.full The primacy of extensive listening], Meredith Stephens, {{doi|10.1093/elt/ccq042}}&lt;/ref&gt; One issue is that listening speed is generally slower than reading speed, so simpler texts are recommended – one may be able to read a text extensively, but not be able to listen to it extensively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36764">{{about|flight dynamics for spacecraft|aircraft flight dynamics|Flight dynamics (aircraft) |attitude control of spacecraft|Attitude control (spacecraft)}}

'''Spacecraft flight dynamics''' is the science of [[space vehicle]] performance, stability, and control. It requires analysis of the [[six degrees of freedom]] of the vehicle's flight, which are similar to those of aircraft: [[translation (geometry)|translation]] in three dimensional axes; and its [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] about the vehicle's center of mass in these axes, known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw'', with respect to a defined [[frame of reference]].

[[dynamics (physics)|Dynamics]] is the modeling of the changing position and orientation of a vehicle, in response to external forces acting on the body. For a spacecraft, these forces are of three types: [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsive]] force (usually provided by the vehicle's engine thrust); [[gravitation]]al force exerted by the Earth or other celestial bodies; and [[aerodynamic force|aerodynamic lift and drag]] (when flying in the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere of the Earth]] or other body, such as Mars or Venus). The vehicle's attitude must be taken into account because of its effect on the aerodynamic and propulsive forces.&lt;ref&gt;Depending on the vehicle's mass distribution, the effects of gravitational force may also be affected by attitude (and vice versa), but to a much lesser extent. See [[Gravity-gradient stabilization]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are other reasons, unrelated to flight dynamics, for controlling the vehicle's attitude in non-powered flight (e.g., thermal control, [[Solar power|solar power generation]], communications, or [[astronomical observation]]).

The principles of flight dynamics are normally used to control a spacecraft by means of an [[inertial navigation system]] in conjunction with an [[attitude control system]]. Together, they create a subsystem of the spacecraft bus often called &lt;abbr title="Attitude Determination and Control System"&gt;ADCS&lt;/abbr&gt;.

==Basic principles==
A spacecraft's flight is determined by application of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[second law of motion]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F''' is the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] sum of all forces exerted on the vehicle, m is its current mass, and '''a''' is the acceleration vector, the instantaneous rate of change of velocity ('''v'''), which in turn is the instantaneous rate of change of displacement. Solving for '''a''', acceleration equals the force sum divided by mass. Acceleration is integrated over time to get velocity, and velocity is in turn integrated to get position.

For powered atmospheric flight, the three main forces which act on a vehicle are [[propulsion|propulsive force]], [[aerodynamic force]], and [[gravity|gravitation]]. Other external forces such as [[centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]], are generally insignificant due to the relatively short time of powered flight, and may generally neglected in simplified performance calculations.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11-154}}

===Propulsion===

===Atmospheric force===
Aerodynamic forces, present near a body with significant atmosphere such as [[Earth]], [[Mars]] or [[Venus]], are analyzed as: [[lift (force)|lift]], defined as the force component perpendicular to the direction of flight (not necessarily upward to balance gravity, as for an airplane); and [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], the component parallel to, and in the opposite direction of flight. Lift and drag are modeled as the products of a coefficient times [[dynamic pressure]] acting on a reference area:{{sfnp|Anderson| pp=257–261}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = C_L q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = C_D q A_\text{ref}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is roughly linear with ''α'', the angle of attack between the vehicle axis and the direction of flight (up to a limiting value), and is 0 at ''α'' = 0 for an axisymmetric body;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; varies with ''α''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; vary with [[Reynolds number]] and [[Mach number]];
*''q'', the dynamic pressure, is equal to 1/2 ''ρv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''ρ'' is atmospheric density, modeled for Earth as a function of altitude in the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (using an assumed temperature distribution, [[hydrostatic pressure]] variation, and the [[ideal gas law]]); and
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is a characteristic area of the vehicle, such as cross-sectional area at the maximum diameter.

===Gravitation===
&lt;!--The force that a celestial body exerts on a spacecraft is given by:--&gt;

==Powered flight==
[[File:Space launch flight diagram improved.png|thumb|right|Velocity, position, and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during launch]]
Flight calculations are made quite precisely for space missions, taking into account such factors as the Earth's [[oblateness]] and non-uniform mass distribution; gravitational forces of all nearby bodies, including the Moon, Sun, and other planets; and three-dimensional flight path. For preliminary performance analysis, some simplifying assumptions can be made: the planet is spherical and uniform; the vehicle can be simulated as a point mass; flight path assumes a two-body [[patched conic approximation]]; and the  local flight path lies in a single plane) with reasonably small loss of accuracy.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

The general case of a launch from Earth must take engine thrust, aerodynamic forces, and gravity into account. The acceleration equation can be reduced from vector to scalar form by resolving it into its tangential (speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) and angular (flight path angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to local vertical) time rate-of-change components relative to the launch pad. The two equations thus become:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha} m - \frac D m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{ F\sin\alpha }{mv} + \frac L {mv} + \left( \frac g v - \frac v r \right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''F'' is the engine thrust;
:''α'' is the angle of attack;
:''m'' is the vehicle's mass;
:''D'' is the vehicle's [[drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]];
:''L'' is its [[lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]];
:''r'' is the radial distance to the planet's center; and
:''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]], which varies with the inverse square of the radial distance:
::&lt;math&gt;g = g_0\left(\frac{r_0}r\right)^2\,&lt;/math&gt;{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

Mass decreases as propellant is consumed and [[multistage rocket|rocket stages]], engines or tanks are shed (if applicable).

[[Numerical integration]] of the two rate equations from time zero (when both ''v'' and ''θ'' are 0) gives planet-fixed values of v and θ at any time in the flight:
:&lt;math&gt;v = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{v}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \int_{t_0}^t \dot{\theta}\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

[[Finite element analysis]] can be used to integrate the equations, by breaking the flight into small time increments.

For most launch vehicles, relatively small levels of lift are generated, and a [[gravity turn]] is employed, depending mostly on the third term of the angle rate equation. At the moment of liftoff, when angle and velocity are both zero, the theta-dot equation is [[indeterminate form|mathematically indeterminate]] and cannot be evaluated until velocity becomes non-zero shortly after liftoff. But notice at this condition, the only force which can cause the vehicle to pitch over is the engine thrust acting at a non-zero angle of attack (first term) and perhaps a slight amount of lift (second term), until a non-zero pitch angle is attained. In the gravity turn, pitch-over is initiated by applying an increasing angle of attack (by means of [[gimbaled thrust|gimbaled engine thrust]]), followed by a gradual decrease in angle of attack through the remainder of the flight.{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}{{sfnp|Glasstone|1965|p=209|loc=§4.97}}

Once velocity and flight path angle are known, altitude &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and downrange distance &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; are computed as:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

[[File:Gravity turn - landing - phase 2.svg|thumb|right|Velocity and force vectors acting on a space vehicle during powered descent and landing]]
:&lt;math&gt;h = \int_{t_0}^t v \cos \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = r_0+h\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s = r_0 \int_{t_0}^t \frac v r \sin \theta\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The planet-fixed values of ''v'' and ''θ'' are converted to space-fixed (inertial) values with the following conversions:{{sfnp|Kromis| p=11:154}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_s = \sqrt{v^2 + 2\omega r v \cos\varphi \sin\theta \sin A_z + (\omega r \cos\theta)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω'' is the planet's rotational rate in radians per second, ''φ'' is the launch site latitude, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the launch [[azimuth]] angle.
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_s = \arccos\left(\frac{ v \cos\theta}{v_s} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r'' must match the requirements of the target orbit as determined by orbital mechanics (see [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]], below), where final ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is usually the required periapsis (or circular) velocity, and final ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is 90 degrees. A powered descent analysis would use the same procedure, with reverse boundary conditions.

==Attitude control==
{{main|Attitude control}}
{{Technical|section|date=December 2011}}

Attitude control is the exercise of control over the orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity (the celestial sphere, certain fields, nearby objects, etc.).  The attitude of a craft can be described using three mutually perpendicular axes of rotation, generally referred to as roll, pitch, and yaw angles respectively (with the roll axis in line with the primary engine direction of thrust).  Orientation can be determined by calibration using an external guidance system, such as determining the angles to a reference star or the Sun, then internally monitored using an inertial system of mechanical or optical [[gyroscopes]].  Orientation is a vector quantity described by three angles for the instantaneous direction, and the instantaneous rates of roll in all three axes of rotation.  The aspect of control implies both awareness of the instantaneous orientation and rates of roll and the ability to change the roll rates to assume a new orientation using either a [[reaction control system]] or other means.
 
Newton's second law, applied to rotational rather than linear motion, becomes:{{sfnp|Beer &amp; Johnston| 1972| p=499}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = I_x\mathbf{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''τ''' is the net [[torque]] (or ''moment'') exerted on the vehicle, I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is its [[moment of inertia]] about the axis of rotation, and '''α''' is the angular acceleration vector in radians per second per second. Therefore, the rotational rate in degrees per second per second is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha} = (180/\pi)\mathbf{T}/I_x,&lt;/math&gt;

and the angular rotation rate '''ω''' (degrees per second) is obtained by integrating '''α''' over time, and the angular rotation '''θ''' is the time integral of the rate, analogous to linear motion. The three principal moments of inertia I&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, I&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and I&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; about the roll, pitch and yaw axes, are determined through the spacecraft's center of mass.

Attitude control torque, absent aerodynamic forces, is frequently applied by a [[reaction control system]], a set of thrusters located about the vehicle. The thrusters are fired, either manually or under automatic guidance control, in short bursts to achieve the desired rate of rotation, and then fired in the opposite direction to halt rotation at the desired position. The torque about a specific axis is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\tau} = \sum_{i=1}^N(r_i \times \mathbf{F_i} ), &lt;/math&gt;

where '''r''' is its distance from the center of mass, and '''F''' is the thrust of an individual thruster (only the component of '''F''' perpendicular to '''r''' is included.)

For situations where propellant consumption may be a problem (such as long-duration satellites or space stations), alternative means may be used to provide the control torque, such as [[reaction wheel]]s or [[control moment gyroscope]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Orbital flight==
{{Further|Orbital mechanics}}

Orbital mechanics are used to calculate flight in orbit about a central body. For sufficiently high orbits (generally at least {{convert|100|nmi|km|disp=flip|sp=us|abbr=off}} in the case of Earth), aerodynamic force may be assumed to be negligible for relatively short term missions (though a small amount of drag may be present which results in decay of orbital energy over longer periods of time.) When the central body's mass is much larger than the spacecraft, and other bodies are sufficiently far away, the solution of orbital trajectories can be treated as a two-body problem.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}}

This can be shown to result in the trajectory being ideally a [[conic section]] (circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola){{sfnp| Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | pp=11-40}} with the central body located at one focus. Orbital trajectories are either circles or ellipses; the parabolic trajectory represents first escape of the vehicle from the central body's gravitational field. Hyperbolic trajectories are escape trajectories with excess velocity, and will be covered under [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Interplanetary flight|Interplanetary flight]] below.

Elliptical orbits are characterized by three elements.{{sfnp |Perry | p=11:151}} The semi-major axis ''a'' is the average of the radius at [[apsis|apoapsis and periapsis]]:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{r_a + r_p} 2 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] ''e'' can then be calculated for an ellipse, knowing the apses:
:&lt;math&gt;e = \frac{r_a} a - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The [[orbital period|time period for a complete orbit]] is dependent only on the semi-major axis, and is independent of eccentricity:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=33 }}

: &lt;math&gt; TP = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{a^3} \mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravitational parameter]] of the central body.

[[File:Orbit1.svg|thumb|200px|right|The angular [[orbital elements]] of a spacecraft orbiting a central body, defining orientation of the orbit in relation to its fundamental reference plane]]
The orientation of the orbit in space is specified by three angles:
*The ''inclination'' ''i'', of the orbital plane with the fundamental plane (this is usually a planet or moon's equatorial plane, or in the case of a solar orbit, the Earth's orbital plane around the Sun, known as the [[ecliptic]].) Positive inclination is northward, while negative inclination is southward.
*The ''longitude of the ascending node'' Ω, measured in the fundamental plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from a reference direction (usually the [[vernal equinox]]) to the line where the spacecraft crosses this plane from south to north. (If inclination is zero, this angle is undefined and taken as 0.)
*The ''argument of periapsis'' ''ω'', measured in the orbital plane counter-clockwise looking southward, from the ascending node to the periapsis. If the inclination is 0, there is no ascending node, so ''ω'' is measured from the reference direction. For a circular orbit, there is no periapsis, so ''ω'' is taken as 0.

The orbital plane is ideally constant, but is usually subject to small perturbations caused by planetary oblateness and the presence of other bodies.

The spacecraft's position in orbit is specified by the ''true anomaly,'' &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, an angle measured from the periapsis, or for a circular orbit, from the ascending node or reference direction. The ''semi-latus rectum'', or radius at 90 degrees from periapsis, is:{{sfnp | Bate, Mueller and White | 1971 | p=24}}
:&lt;math&gt;p = a(1-e^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The radius at any position in flight is:
:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac p {1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the velocity at that position is:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left(\frac 2 r - \frac 1 a\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Types of orbit===
====Circular====
For a circular orbit, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'', and eccentricity is 0. Circular velocity at a given radius is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_c = \sqrt{\frac\mu r}\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Elliptical====
For an elliptical orbit, ''e'' is greater than 0 but less than 1. The periapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1+e)}{a(1-e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the apoapsis velocity is:
:&lt;math&gt;v_a = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(1-e)}{a(1+e)}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The limiting condition is a '''parabolic escape orbit''', when ''e'' = 1 and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes infinite. Escape velocity at periapsis is then
:&lt;math&gt;v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Flight path angle===
The ''specific angular momentum'' of any conic orbit, ''h'', is constant, and is equal to the product of radius and velocity at periapsis. At any other point in the orbit, it is equal to:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=18}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r v\cos\varphi,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''φ'' is the flight path angle measured from the local horizontal (perpendicular to&amp;nbsp;''r''.) This allows the calculation of ''φ'' at any point in the orbit, knowing radius and velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \arccos\left(\frac{r_p v_p}{r v}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Note that flight path angle is a constant 0 degrees (90 degrees from local vertical) for a circular orbit.

===True anomaly as a function of time===
It can be shown that the angular momentum equation given above also relates the rate of change in true anomaly to ''r'', ''v'', and ''φ'', thus the true anomaly can be found as a function of time since periapsis passage by integration:{{sfnp| Bate, Mueller, and White |1971| pp=31-32}}
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = r_p v_p \int_{t_p}^t \frac 1 {r^2} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the time required to reach a given anomaly is:
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac 1 {r_p v_p} \int_0^\nu r^2 \, d\nu&lt;/math&gt;

===Orbital maneuvers===
{{see also|Orbital maneuver}}
Once in orbit, a spacecraft may fire rocket engines to make in-plane changes to a different altitude or type of orbit, or to change its orbital plane. These maneuvers require changes in the craft's velocity, and the [[classical rocket equation]] is used to calculate the propellant requirements for a given [[delta-v]]. A [[delta-v budget|delta-''v'' budget]] will add up all the propellant requirements, or determine the total delta-v available from a given amount of propellant, for the mission.

====In-plane changes====
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

====Change of plane====
Plane change maneuvers can be performed alone or in conjunction with other orbit adjustments. For a pure rotation plane change maneuver, consisting only of a change in the inclination of the orbit, the specific angular momentum, ''h'', of the initial and final orbits are equal in magnitude but not in direction. Therefore the change in specific angular momentum can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta h = 2h\sin\left(\frac {|\Delta i|}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the specific angular momentum before the plane change, and Δ''i'' is the desired change in the inclination angle. From this it can be shown{{sfnp|Hintz|2015|p=112}} that the required delta-''v'' is:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = \frac {2h\sin\frac {|\Delta i|}{2}}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of ''h'', this can also be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = 2v\cos \varphi\sin\left(\frac {\left|\Delta i\right|} 2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' is the magnitude of velocity before plane change and ''φ'' is the flight path angle. Using the [[small-angle approximation]], this becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\Delta v = v \cos(\varphi) \left|\Delta i\right|&lt;/math&gt;

The total delta-''v'' for a combined maneuver can be calculated by a vector addition of the pure rotation delta-''v'' and the delta-''v'' for the other planned orbital change.

==Translunar flight==
[[File:Tli.svg|thumb|200px|right|A typical translunar trajectory]]
Vehicles sent on lunar or planetary missions are generally not launched by direct injection to departure trajectory, but first put into a low Earth [[low Earth orbit|parking orbit]]; this allows the flexibility of a bigger [[launch window]] and more time for checking that the vehicle is in proper condition for the flight. A popular misconception is that escape velocity is required for flight to the Moon; it is not. Rather, the vehicle's apogee is raised high enough to take it to a point (before it reaches apogee) where it enters the Moon's gravitational [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] (though the required velocity is close to that of escape.) This is defined as the distance from a satellite at which its gravitational pull on a spacecraft equals that of its central body, which is

: &lt;math&gt;r_\text{SOI} = D\left(\frac{m_s}{m_c}\right)^{2/5},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' is the mean distance from the satellite to the central body, and
''m''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; are the masses of the central body and satellite, respectively. This value is approximately {{convert|66300|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from Earth's Moon.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller and White| 1971| pp=333–334}}

A significant portion of the vehicle's flight (other than immediate proximity to the Earth or Moon) requires accurate solution as a [[three-body problem]], but may be preliminarily modeled as a [[patched conic approximation]].

===Translunar injection===
{{Main|Translunar injection}}
This must be timed so that the Moon will be in position to capture the vehicle, and might be modeled to a first approximation as a Hohmann transfer. However, the rocket burn duration is usually long enough, and occurs during a sufficient change in flight path angle, that this is not very accurate, requiring instead integration of a simplified version of the velocity and angle rate equations given above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Powered flight|Powered flight]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{v} = \frac{F\cos\alpha}m - g\cos\theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = \frac{F\sin\alpha}{mv} + \left(\frac g v - \frac v r\right) \sin\theta,\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Mid-course corrections===
A simple lunar trajectory stays in one plane, resulting in lunar flyby or orbit within a small range of inclination to the Moon's equator. This also permits a "free return", in which the spacecraft would return to the appropriate position for reentry into the Earth's atmosphere if it were not injected into lunar orbit. Relatively small velocity changes are usually required to correct for trajectory errors. Such a trajectory was used for the [[Apollo 8]], [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 11]], and [[Apollo 12]] manned lunar missions.

Greater flexibility in lunar orbital or landing site coverage (at greater angles of lunar inclination) can be obtained by performing a plane change maneuver mid-flight; however, this takes away the free-return option, as the new plane would take the spacecraft's emergency return trajectory away from the Earth's atmospheric re-entry point, and leave the spacecraft in a high Earth orbit. This type of trajectory was used for the last five Apollo missions (13 through 17).

===Lunar orbit insertion===
{{Expand section|date=November 2011}}

==Interplanetary flight==
In order to completely leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a [[hyperbola|hyperbolic]] trajectory relative to the departure planet is necessary, with excess velocity added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun. The desired heliocentric transfer orbit to a [[superior planet]] will have its [[perihelion]] at the departure planet, requiring the hyperbolic excess velocity to be applied in the posigrade direction, when the spacecraft is away from the Sun. To an [[inferior planet]] destination, [[aphelion]] will be at the departure planet, and the excess velocity is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. For accurate mission calculations, the orbital elements of the planets must be obtained from an [[ephemeris]],{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=359}} such as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|that published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].

For the purpose of preliminary mission analysis and feasibility studies, certain simplified assumptions may be made to enable delta-v calculation with very small error:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}}
*All the planets' orbits except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] have very small eccentricity, and therefore may be assumed to be circular at a constant orbital speed and mean distance from the Sun.
*All the planets' orbits (except Mercury) are nearly coplanar, with very small inclination to the [[ecliptic]] (3.39 degrees or less; Mercury's inclination is 7.00 degrees).
*The perturbating effects of the other planets' gravity is negligible.
*The spacecraft will spend most of its flight time under only the gravitational influence of the Sun, except for brief periods when it is in the [[sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|sphere of influence]] of the departure and destination planets.

Since interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in [[heliocentric orbit]] between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away from each other, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| pp=359, 362}} The patch point between the hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet and the heliocentric transfer orbit occurs at the planet's sphere of influence radius relative to the Sun, as defined above in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]]. Given the Sun's mass ratio of 333,432 times that of Earth and distance of {{convert|149,500,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}}, the Earth's sphere of influence radius is {{convert|924,000|km|nmi|sp=us|abbr=off}} (roughly 1,000,000 kilometers).{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971|p=368}}

===Heliocentric transfer orbit===
The transfer orbit required to carry the spacecraft from the departure planet's orbit to the destination planet is chosen among several options:
* A [[Hohmann transfer orbit]] requires the least possible propellant and delta-v; this is half of an elliptical orbit with [[apsis|aphelion and perihelion]] tangential to both planets' orbits, with the longest outbound flight time equal to half the period of the ellipse. This is known as a [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]-class mission.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |p=3}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} There is no "free return" option, because if the spacecraft does not enter orbit around the destination planet and instead completes the transfer orbit, the departure planet will not be in its original position. Using another Hohmann transfer to return requires a significant loiter time at the destination planet, resulting in a very long total round-trip mission time.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}} Science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] wrote in his 1951 book ''The Exploration of Space'' that an Earth-to-Mars round trip would require 259 days outbound and another 259 days inbound, with a 425-day stay at Mars.
* Increasing the departure apsis speed (and thus the semi-major axis) results in a trajectory which crosses the destination planet's orbit non-tangentially before reaching the opposite apsis, increasing delta-v but cutting the outbound transit time below the maximum.{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White|1971 |pp=362–363}}
* A [[gravity assist]] maneuver, sometimes known as a "slingshot maneuver" or ''Crocco mission'' after its 1956 proposer [[Gaetano Crocco]], results in an [[astronomical opposition|opposition]]-class mission with a much shorter dwell time at the destination.{{sfnp|Mattfeld, Stromgren, et al|2015 |pp=3–4}}{{sfn|Drake, Baker, et al}} This is accomplished by swinging past another planet, using its gravity to alter the orbit. A round trip to Mars, for example, can be significantly shortened from the 943 days required for the conjunction mission, to under a year, by swinging past Venus on return to the Earth.

===Hyperbolic departure===
The required hyperbolic excess velocity ''v''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; (sometimes called ''characteristic velocity'') is the difference between the transfer orbit's departure speed and the departure planet's heliocentric orbital speed. Once this is determined, the injection velocity relative to the departure planet at periapsis is:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=369}}

:&lt;math&gt;v_p = \sqrt{\frac{2\mu}{r_p} + v_\infty^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The excess velocity vector for a hyperbola is displaced from the periapsis tangent by a characteristic angle, therefore the periapsis injection burn must lead the planetary departure point by the same angle:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \arcsin\frac 1 e\,&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric equation for eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be used for a hyperbola. But the eccentricity can be calculated from dynamics formulations as:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=372}}

:&lt;math&gt;e = \sqrt{1+\frac{2\varepsilon h^2}{\mu^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where h is the specific angular momentum as given above in the [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] section, calculated at the periapsis:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;h = r_p v_p,\,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''ε'' is the specific energy:{{sfnp|Bate, Mueller, and White| 1971| p=371}}
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \frac{v^2}2 - \frac \mu r\,&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the equations for r and v given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Orbital flight|Orbital flight]] depend on the semi-major axis, and thus are unusable for an escape trajectory. But setting radius at periapsis equal to the r equation at zero 
anomaly gives an alternate expression for the semi-latus rectum:

:&lt;math&gt;p = r_p(1 + e),\,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a more general equation for radius versus anomaly which is usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{r_p(1 + e)}{1+e\cos\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the alternate expression for p also gives an alternate expression for a (which is defined for a hyperbola, but no longer represents the semi-major axis). This gives an equation for velocity versus radius which is likewise usable at any eccentricity:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \sqrt{\mu\left (\frac{2}{r}-\frac{(1-e^2)}{r_p(1+e)}\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equations for flight path angle and anomaly versus time given in [[Flight dynamics (spacecraft)#Flight path angle|Orbital flight]] are also usable for hyperbolic trajectories.

===Launch windows===
There is a great deal of variation with time of the velocity change required for a mission, because of the constantly varying relative positions of the planets. Therefore, optimum launch windows are often chosen from the results of [[porkchop plot]]s that show contours of characteristic energy (v&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) plotted versus departure and arrival time.

==Atmospheric entry==
{{main|Atmospheric entry}}
''Atmospheric entry'' is the movement of human-made or natural objects as they enter the [[atmosphere]] of a [[celestial body]] from [[outer space]]—in the case of [[Earth]] from an [[altitude]] above the [[Kármán Line]], (100&amp;nbsp;km).  This topic is heavily concerned with the process of controlled ''re''entry of [[spacecraft|vehicles]] which are intended to reach the planetary surface intact, but the topic also includes uncontrolled (or minimally controlled) cases, such as the intentionally or circumstantially occurring, destructive deorbiting of [[Artificial satellites|satellites]] and the falling back to the planet of "[[Space debris|space junk]]" due to [[orbital decay]].

'''Framingham State University''' is a [[public university]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]].  It offers [[undergraduate]] programs in a range of subjects, including art, biology, and communication arts, and [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[MEd]], and [[Master's degree|MS]].

==History==
[[File:Cyrus Peirce 1790-1860.jpg|thumb|[[Cyrus Peirce]], first president]]
As the first secretary of the newly created Board of Education in [[Massachusetts]], [[Horace Mann]] instituted school reforms that included the creation of an experimental [[normal school]], the first one in the [[United States]], in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], in July 1839. [[Cyrus Peirce]] was its first principal or president.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html Framingham State College – 150 Years in Framingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620132902/http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second normal school was opened in September 1839 in West Barre (the school later moved to Westfield) followed by [[Bridgewater State College]] the next year. Growth forced the first normal school's relocation to [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] in 1843, followed in 1853 by a move to the present site on Bare Hill in Framingham.

In 1922, the Framingham Normal School granted its first [[Bachelor of Science]] in Education degrees in conjunction with a four-year study program. Ten years later, with degreed teachers becoming the norm, the normal schools were renamed State Teachers Colleges.  The name was changed in 1960 to the State College at Framingham when [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees were added. At present, [[Master's degree|Masters']] of Education, Arts, and Science degrees are granted as well. In 2007, the college began offering the Master's of Business Administration (MBA) degree. In October 2010, seven of the state colleges became state universities, unaffiliated with the [[University of Massachusetts]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/186history/h04864.htm Bill Details – H4864&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] on July 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=818 Public Relations – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php Salem State University: University Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002323/http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In 2007, the school signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment. That year, Massachusetts issued Executive Order No. 484, which mandated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption for all state agencies and institutions. Greenhouse gases must be reduced 80% by 2050.  In 2010, the school adopted a plan to convert its heating plant to natural gas and to
convert its central chilled water plant to electric chillers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.framingham.edu/presidents-office/documents/ClimateActionPlan2010.pdf|title=2010 Climate Action Plan|publisher=Framingham State University|accessdate=2010-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117100524/http://framingham.edu/presidents-office/documents/ClimateActionPlan2010.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24932">'''Gene deserts''' are regions of the genome that are devoid of protein-coding genes. Gene deserts constitute an estimated 25% of the entire genome, leading to the recent interest in their true functions.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ovcharenko, Ivan|title=Evolution and Functional Classification of Vertebrate Gene Deserts|journal=Genome Research|date=December 2004|volume=15|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1101/gr.3015505 |pmc=540279}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally believed to contain inessential and “junk” DNA due to their inability to create proteins, gene deserts have since been linked to several vital regulatory functions, including distal enhancing and conservatory inheritance. Thus, an increasing number of risks that lead to several major diseases, including a handful of cancers, have been attributed to irregularities found in gene deserts. One of the most notable examples is the 8q24 gene region, which, when affected by certain [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]], lead to a myriad of diseases. The major identifying factors of gene deserts lay in their low GpC content and their relatively high levels of repeats, which are not observed in coding regions. Recent studies have even further categorized gene deserts into variable and stable forms; regions are categorized based on their behavior through recombination and their genetic contents. Although current knowledge of gene deserts is rather limited, ongoing research and improved techniques are beginning to open the doors for exploration on the various important effects of these noncoding regions.

==History==

Although the possibility of function in gene deserts was predicted as early as the 1960s, genetic identification tools were unable to uncover any specific characteristics of the long noncoding regions, other than that no coding occurred in those regions.&lt;ref name="Gene Islands"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montavon|first1=Thomas|last2=Duboule|first2=Denis|title= Landscapes and Archipelagos: Spatial Organization of Gene Regulation in Vertebrates |journal=Trends in Cell Biology|date=July 2012|volume=22|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2012.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the completion of the human genome in 2001 through the Human Genome Project, most of the early associative gene comparisons relied on the belief that essential housekeeping genes were clustered in the same areas of the genome for ease of access and tight regulation. This belief later constructed a hypothesis that gene deserts are therefore previous regulatory sequences that are highly linked (and hence do not undergo recombination), but have had substitutions between them over time.&lt;ref name="Gene Islands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Desert Functions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=James|title= Clues to Function in Gene Deserts |journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=19 April 2005|volume=23|issue=6|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; These substitutions could cause tightly conserved genes to separate over time, thus forming regions of nonsense codes with a few essential genes. However, uncertainty due to differential gene conservation rates in different portions of chromosomes prevented accurate identification. 
Later associations were remodeled when regulatory sequences were associated with transcription factors, leading to the birth of large-scale genome-wide mapping. Thus began the hunt for the contents and functions of gene deserts. Recent advancements in the screening of chromatin signatures on chromosomes (for instance, [[chromosome conformation capture]], also known as 3C) have allowed the confirmation of the long-range gene activation model, which postulates that there are indeed physical links between regulatory enhancers and their target promoters.&lt;ref name="Gene Islands"/&gt; Research on gene deserts, although centralized on human genetics, has also been applied to mice, various birds, and Drosophila melanogaster.&lt;ref name="Drosophila"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Monica|last2=Kennison|first2=James|title= Molecular Genetic Analyses of Polytene Chromosome Region 72A-D in Drosophila melanogaster Reveal a Gene Desert in 72D|journal=PLOS ONE|date=August 2011|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023509|page=e23509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hox Genes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montavon, Thomas|title= A Regulatory Archipelago Controls Hox Genes Transcription in Digits|journal=Cell|date=23 November 2011|volume=147|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.023|pages=1132–1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although conservation is variable among selected species’ genomes, orthologous gene deserts function similarly. Thus, the prevailing the contention of gene deserts is that these noncoding sequences harbor active and important regulatory elements.

==Possible functions==

One study focused on a regulatory archipelago, a region with “islands” of coding sequences surrounded by vast noncoding regions. The study, which explored the effects of regulation on the [[hox gene]]s, initially focused on two enhancer sequences, GCR and Prox, which are located 200 basepairs and 50 basepairs respectively upstream of the Hox D locus.&lt;ref name="Hox Genes"/&gt; To manipulate the region, the study inverted the two enhancer sequences and discovered no major effects on the transcription of the Hox D gene, even though the two sequences were the closest sequences to the gene. Thus, the turned to the gene desert that flanked the GCR sequence upstream and found 5 regulatory islands within it that could regulate the gene. To select the most likely candidate, the study then applied several individual and multiple deletions to the five islands to observe the effects. These varied deletions only resulted in minor effects including physical abnormalities or a few missing digits. 
When the experiment was taken a step further and applied a deletion of the entire 830 kilobase gene desert, the functionality of the entire Hox D locus was rendered inactive.&lt;ref name="Hox Genes"/&gt; This indicates that the neighboring gene desert, as an entire 830 kilobase unit (including the five island sequences within it), serves as an important regulator of a single gene that spans merely 50 kilobases. Therefore, these results hinted at the regulatory effects of flanking gene deserts. This study was supported by a later observation through a comparison between [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] and chromosome conformation capture which discovered that the Hox D locus was the most decondensed portion in the region. This meant that it had relatively higher activity in comparison to the flanking gene deserts.&lt;ref name="FISH"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson, Iain|title= Spatial Genome Organization: Contrasting Views From Chromosome Conformation and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization |journal=Genes &amp; Development|date=30 October 2014|volume=28|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1101/gad.251694.114|pmc=4265680}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the Hox D could be regulated by specific nearby enhancer sequences that were not expressed in unison. However, the does caution that proximity is inaccurate when either analytical method is used.&lt;ref name="FISH"/&gt; Thus, associations between regulatory gene deserts and their target promoters seem to have variable distances and are not required to act as borders. [[File:Gene Looping.PNG|thumb|Loop formation bring enhancer complexes close to their target promoters. This indicates that the gene “islands” harbored by the gene deserts have essential regulatory functions.]]
The variability in distance demonstrates that distance may be another important factor that is determined by gene deserts. For instance, distal enhancers may interact with their target promoters through looping interactions which must act over a certain distance.&lt;ref name="Long Range"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanyal|first1=Amartya|last2=Lajoie|first2=Bryan|last3=Jain|first3=Gaurav|last4=Dekker|first4=Job|title=The Long-Range Interaction Landscape of Gene Promoters |journal=Nature|date=6 September 2012|volume=489|doi=10.1038/nature11279|pages=109–113|pmc=3555147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, proximity is not an accurate predictor of enhancers: enhancers do not need to border their target sequence to regulate them. While this leads to a variation in distances, the average distance between transcription start sites and the interaction complex mediated by their enhancer elements is 120 kilobases upstream of the start site.&lt;ref name="Long Range"/&gt; Gene deserts may play a role in constructing this distance to allow maximal looping to occur. Given that the mechanism of enhancer complex formation is a fairly simply regulated mechanism (the structures that are recruited into the enhancing complex have various regulatory controls that control construction), more than 50% of promoters have several long-range interactions. Certain core genes even have up to 20 possible enhancing interactions. There is a curious bias for complexes to form only upstream of the promoters.&lt;ref name="Long Range"/&gt; Thus, given the correlation that many regulatory gene deserts appear upstream of their target promoters, it is possible that the more immediate role that gene deserts play is in long-range regulation of key sequences. 
As the ideal formation of enhancer interactions requires specific constructs, a possible side-product of the regulatory roles of gene deserts may be the conservation of genes: to retain the specific lengths of loops and order of regulating genes hidden in gene deserts, certain portions of gene deserts are more highly conserved than others when passing through inheritance events. These [[Conserved non-coding sequence|conserved noncoding sequences]] (CNS) are directly associated with syntenic inheritance in all vertebrates.&lt;ref name="CNS"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolfe|first1=Adam|last2=Elgar|first2=Greg|title= Organization of Conserved Elements Near Key Developmental Regulators in Vertebrate Genomes|journal=Advances in Genetics |date=2008|volume=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the presence of these CNSs could serve to conserve of large regions of genes. Although distance may vary in regulatory gene deserts, distance appears to have an upper limit in conservative gene deserts. CNSs were initially thought to occur close to their conserved genes: earlier estimates placed most CNSs in proximity of gene sequences.&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt; However, the expansion of genetic data has revealed that several CNSs reside up to 2.5 megabases from their target genes, with the majority of CNSs falling between 1 and 2 megabases. This range, which was measured for the human genome, is varied among different species. For instance, in comparison to humans, the Fugu fish has a smaller range, with an estimated maximum distance of a few hundred kilobases. Regardless of the difference in lengths, CNSs work in similar methods in both species.&lt;ref name="CNS"/&gt; Thus, as functions differ between gene deserts, so do their contents.

==Stable and variable gene deserts==

[[File:Slide7.PNG|thumb|Stable gene deserts that house more essential genes are more readily conserved over time, passing this conservation to nearby genes. Variable gene deserts with fewer essential genes are thus subjected to frequent SNPs, most of which are neutral.]]Certain gene deserts are heavy regulators, while others may be deleted without any effect. As a possible classification, gene deserts can be broken down into two subtypes: stable and variable.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"/&gt; Stable gene deserts have fewer repeats and have relatively higher Guanine to Cytosine (GpC) content than observed in variable gene deserts.

Guanine and cytosine content is indicative of protein-coding functionality. For example, in a study on chromosomes 2 and 4, which have been linked to several genetic diseases, there were elevated GpC content in certain regions.&lt;ref name="2 and 4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillier, LaDeana|title= Generation and Annotation of the DNA Sequences of Human Chromosomes 2 and 4|journal=Nature|date=7 April 2005|volume=434|doi=10.1038/nature03466|display-authors=etal|pages=724–731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutations in these GC-rich regions caused a variety of diseases, revealing the necessary integrity of these genes. High density CpG regions serve as regulatory regions for DNA methylation.&lt;ref name="Methylation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skinner|first1=Michael|last2=Bosagna|first2=Carlos|title= Role of CpG Deserts in the Epigenetic Transgenerational Inheritance of Differential DNA Methylation Regions |journal=BMC Genomics |date=2014|volume=15|issue=692|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-15-692}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, essential coding genes should be represented by high-CpG regions. In particular, regions with high GC content should tend to have high densities of genes that are devoted mainly to the essential housekeeping and tissue specific processes.&lt;ref name="GC Poor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaghloul, Lamia |title= Large Replication Skew Domains Delimit GC-poor Gene Deserts in Human |journal=Computational Biology and Chemistry |date=11 July 2014|volume=53|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes would require the most protein production to express functionality. Stable gene deserts, which have higher levels of GC content, should therefore contain the essential enhancer sequences. This could determine the conservatory functions of stable gene deserts.

On the other hand, approximately 80% of gene deserts have low GpC contents, indicating that they have very few essential genes.&lt;ref name="2 and 4"/&gt; Thus, the majority of gene deserts are variable gene deserts, which may have alternate functions. One prevalent theory regarding the origins of gene deserts postulates that gene deserts are accumulations of essential genes that act as a distance.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Methylation"/&gt; This may hold true, as given the low numbers of essential genes within them, these regions would have been less conserved. As a result, due to the prevalence of cytosine to thymine conversions, the [http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/SNP_Call_Set_Properties most common SNP], would cause a gradual separation between the few essential genes within variable gene deserts. These essential sequences would have been maintained and conserved, leading to small regions of high density that regulate at a distance.&lt;ref name="Methylation"/&gt; GC content is therefore indication for the presence of coding or regulatory processes in DNA. [[File:Stable vs Variable Gene Deserts.PNG|thumb|A comparison GC contents and recombination rates between stable and variable gene deserts separated by a coding gene. The general ratios displayed are independent of each other; the exact values do not reflect the scales.]]

While stable gene deserts have higher GC content, this relative value is only an average. Within stable gene deserts, although the ends contain very high levels of GC content, the main bulk of the DNA contains even less GC content than observed in variable gene deserts. This indicates that there are very few highly conserved regions in stable gene deserts that do not recombine, or do so at very low rates.&lt;ref name="2 and 4"/&gt; Given that the ends of the stable gene deserts have particularly high levels of GC contents, these sequences must be extremely conserved. This conservation may in turn cause the flanking genes to also have higher conservation rates. Thus, stable genes should be directly linked to at least one of their flanking genes and cannot be separated from coding sequences by recombination events.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"/&gt; Most gene deserts appear to cluster in pairs around a small number of genes. This clustering creates long loci that have very low gene density; small regions with high numbers of genes are surrounded by long stretches of gene deserts, creating a low gene average. Therefore, the minimized probability of recombination events in these long loci creates syntenic blocks that are inherited together over time.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"/&gt; These syntenic blocks can be conserved for very long periods of time, preventing loss of essential material, even while the distance between essential genes may grow in time.

Although this effect should theoretically be amplified through the even lower GC-content in variable gene deserts (thereby truly minimalizing gene density), the gene conservation rates in variable gene deserts are even lower than observed in stable gene deserts—in fact, the rate is far lower than the rest of the genome. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that variable gene deserts may be recently evolved regions that have not yet been fixed into stable gene deserts.&lt;ref name="Gene Desert Classification"/&gt; Therefore, shuffling may still occur before stabilizing regions within the variable gene deserts begin to cluster as whole units. There are a few exceptions to this minimal rate of conservation, as a few GC gene deserts are subjected to hypermethylation, which greatly reduces the accessibility to the DNA, thus effectively protecting the region from recombination.&lt;ref name="GC Poor"/&gt; However, these occur rarely in observation.

Although stable and variable gene deserts differ in content and function, both wield conservatory abilities. It is possible that since most variable gene deserts have regulatory elements that can act at a distance, conservation of the entire gene desert into a sytenic locus would not have been necessary, so long as these regulatory elements themselves were conserved as units. Given the particularly low levels of GC content, the regulatory elements would therefore be in a minimal gene density situation as observed similarly in flanking stable gene deserts, with the same effect. Thus, both types of gene deserts serve to retain essential genes within the genome.

==Genetic diseases==

The conservative nature of gene deserts confirms that these stretches of noncoding bases are essential to proper functioning. Indeed, a wide range of studies on irregularities in the noncoding genes discovered several associations to genetic diseases. One of the most studied gene deserts is the 8q24 region. Early genome wide association studies were focused on the 8q24 region (residing on [[Chromosome 8 (human)|chromosome 8]]) due to the abnormally high rates of SNPs that seem to occur in the region. These studies found that the region was linked to increased risks for a variety of cancers, notably in the prostate, breast, ovaries, colonic, and pancreas.&lt;ref name="8q24 Cancer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghoussaini, Maya |title= Multiple Loci with Different Cancer Specificities Within the 8q24 Gene Desert |journal=Brief Communications |date=2 July 2008|volume=100|issue=13|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="8q24 Desert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huppi |first1=Konrad |last2=Pitt |first2=Jason |last3=Wahlberg |first3=Brady |last4=Caplen |first4=Natasha |title=The 8q24 Gene Desert: An Oasis of Noncoding Transcriptional Activity|journal=Frontiers in Genetics |date=April 2012|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fgene.2012.00069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using inserts of the gene desert into bacterial artificial chromosomes, one study was able to produce enhancer activity in certain regions, which were isolated via cloning systems.&lt;ref name="8q24 Prostate"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wasserman |first1=Nora |last2=Aneas|first2=Ivy |last3=Nobrega |first3=Marcelo |title= An 8q24 Gene Desert Variant Associated with Prostate Cancer Risk Confers Differential in vivo Activity to a MYC Enhancer |journal=Genome Research|date=3 June 2010|volume=20 |doi=10.1101/gr.105361.110 |pmc=2928497}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study successfully identified an enhancer sequence hidden in the region. Within this enhancer sequence, an SNP that conferred risk for prostate cancer, labeled SNP s6983267, was discovered in diseased mice. However, the 8q24 region is not solely limited to conferred risks of prostate cancer. A study in 2008 screened human subjects (and controls) with variations in the gene desert region, discovering five different regions that conferred different risks when affected by different SNPs.&lt;ref name="8q24 Cancer"/&gt; This study used identified SNP markers in the gene desert to identify risk conference from each of the regions to a specific tissue expression. Although these risks were successfully linked to various forms of cancer, Ghoussaini, M., et al. note their uncertainty in whether the SNPs functioned merely as markers or were the direct causants of the cancers.

These varied effects occur due to the different interactions between the SNPs in this region and MYC promoters of different organs. The MYC promoter, which is located at a short distance downstream of the 8q24 region, is perhaps the most studied oncogene due to its association with a myriad of diseases.&lt;ref name="8q24 Desert"/&gt; Normal functioning of the MYC promoter ensures that cells divide regularly. The study postulates that the 8q region, which underwent a chromosomal translocation in humans, could have moved an essential enhancer for the MYC promoter.&lt;ref name="8q24 Desert"/&gt;  This areas around this region could have been subjected to recombination that may have hidden the essential MYC enhancer within the gene desert through time, although its enhancing effects are still very much retained. This analysis stems from disease associations observed in several mice species where this region is retained at proximity to the MYC promoter.&lt;ref name="8q24 Desert"/&gt; Thus, the 8q24 gene desert should have been somewhat linked to the MYC promoter. The desert resembles a stable gene desert that has had very little recombination after the translocation event. Thus, a potential hypothesis is that SNPs affecting this region disrupt the important tissue-specific genes with the stable gene desert, which could explain the risks of cancer in various tissue forms. This effect of hidden enhancer elements can also be observed in other locations in the genome. For instance, SNPs in the 5p13.1 deregulate the PTGER4 coding region, leading to Crohn’s Disease.&lt;ref name="5p13.1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Libioulle, Cecile |title= Novel Crohn Disease Locus Identified by Genome-Wide Association Maps to a Gene Desert on 5p13.1 and Modulates Expression of PTGER4 |journal=PLoS Genetics |date=April 2007|volume=3|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another affected region in the 9p21 gene desert causes several coronary artery diseases.&lt;ref name="9p21"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harismendy, Olivier |title= 9p21 DNA Variants Associated with Coronary Artery Disease Impair Interferon-Gamma Signaling Response |journal=Nature|date=10 February 2011|volume=470 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nature09753 |pages=264–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these risk-conferring gene deserts seem to be affected as much as the 8q24 regions. Current studies are still unsure about the SNP-affected processes in the 8q24 region that result in particularly amplified responses to the MYC promoter. With the aid of a more accessible population and more specific markers for genome wide association mapping, an increasing number of risk alleles are now being marked in gene deserts, where small, isolated, and seemingly-unimportant regions of genes may moderate important genes.

==A caveat==

It is crucial to note that although most of the gene deserts explored here are essential, it could be that the majority of the contents in gene deserts are still likely to be inessential and disposable. Naturally, this is not to say that the roles that gene deserts play are inessential or unimportant, rather than their functions may include buffering effects. An example of essential gene deserts with inessential DNA content are the [[telomere]]s that protect the ends of genomes. Telomeres can be categorized as true gene deserts, given that they solely contain repeats of TTAGGG (in humans) and do not have apparent protein-coding functions. Without these telomeres, human genomes would be severely mutated within a fixed number of cell cycles. On the other hand, since telomeres do not code for proteins, their loss ensures that there is no effect in important processes. Therefore, the term “junk” DNA should no longer be applied to any region of the genome; every portion of the genome should play a role in protecting, regulating, or repairing the protein coding regions that determine the functions of life. Although there is still much to learn about the nooks and crannies of the immense (yet limited) human genome, with the aid of various new technologies and the synthesis of the full human genome, we may perhaps unravel a great collection of secrets in the approaching years about the marvels of our genetic code.

'''Giants' tomb''' (Italian: ''[[:wiktionary:Tomba|Tomba]] dei giganti'', [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]: ''Tumba de zigantes'' / ''gigantis'') is the name given by [[Sardinians|local people]] and [[archaeologist]]s to a type of [[Sardinia]]n [[megalithic]] [[gallery grave]] built during the [[Bronze Age]] by the [[Nuragic civilization]]. They were collective tombs and can be found throughout [[Sardinia]], with 800 being discovered there.&lt;ref name=Atzeni.I&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2572124/ASPETTI_E_PROBLEMATICHE_DEL_RITUALE_FUNERARIO_DI_ETA_NURAGICA  Aspetti e problematiche del rituale funarario di età nuragica]&lt;/ref&gt;

A stone [[cairn]] lies over the burial chambers, with some examples having a cup-shaped entrance similar to the [[court cairn]] tombs of [[Ireland]].

==Types==
[[File:Giants' grave Coddu Vecchiu (Sardegna).jpg|right|500px|thumb|Coddu Vecchju - [[Arzachena]]]]

There are two general types of giants' tomb. In the so-called "slab type", uncut slabs are buried on end in the ground, and are arranged side-by-side. There is usually a central [[stele]], which is the largest slab (up to 4&amp;nbsp;m in height) and has a doorway cut through it.

In the more primitive slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is unmodified aside from the entrance that is cut through it at the base, or else there is a crude dolmen-like arrangement of 3 uncut rocks to form the entrance (Osono, Sortali, Lolghi, Pescaredda). In more advanced slab-type giants tombs, the central slab is modified so as to be rounded on top, and has a simple design carved into the front surface (Dorgali, Goronna, Santu Bainzu, Coddu Vecchju).

The [[sepulchre]]s have a characteristic rectangular plan with an [[apse]]. The burial chamber is usually 5 to 15 metres long and 1 to 2 metres high. The structures were originally covered by a mound resembling the shape of an overturned ship. Near the entrance an [[obelisk]] (''betile'' in [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]]) is usually found, which symbolizes the gods or ancestors who watched over the dead.

The so-called "block type" tombs are made of rectangular-cut blocks (Bidistili, Madau II, Seleni II, Iloi, Mura Cuata).

There are also structures similar to the block-type giants tombs on the island of [[Malta]], in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/scotland/arran/ancient-sites/giants-graves.html Giant's Graves]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Menorca]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Lilliu, La civiltà nuragica, Sassari 1982 p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University''', also commonly referred to as '''HBOI''' or '''HBOI at FAU''', is a [[non-profit]]  [[Oceanography|oceanographic institution]] operated by [[Florida Atlantic University]] in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]], [[Florida]], United States.  HBOI traces its history to a 1971 entity which partnered with FAU in 2007.

==History==
HBOI was founded in 1971 by [[J. Seward Johnson, Sr.]] in collaboration with [[Edwin Link|Edwin A. Link]] as a non-profit research organization, then known as '''Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution'''.

In December 2007, the assets and parcels of land of the research institute were transferred to FAU and took its current name. To fund the acquisition, the State of Florida allocated $44.6 million in one-time construction costs plus $8.5 million in annual operating funds. The governing board of the former HBOI then became the governing board of the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation which retained other parcels of land, an endowment funded by the J. Seward Johnson, Sr. Charitable Trust Endowment Fund and the Seward Johnson Trust Fund for Oceanography,and as the legislatively-dictated recipient of four Florida Specialty License plates. The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation exists today with a mission to support the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.

==Features==
[[File:Johnson Sealink.png|thumb|The ''[[Johnson Sea Link]]''.]]
HBOI is located on a {{convert|146|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus along the [[Indian River Lagoon]] north of Fort Pierce, Florida.

HBOI research and education focuses on biological oceanography, estuarine to deep sea ecology, aquaculture, discovery and development of natural products for medicines and other uses, and ocean engineering. Its staff includes more than 160 scientists, engineers, mariners, and support personnel. Funding sources include grants and Florida state educational and general funds, Florida specialty license plates, donations, and other institutional support. Institute assets include the ''[[Johnson Sea Link]]'' submersible, capable of reaching more than a half-mile under the ocean, and libraries of marine [[sponge]]s and microbial creatures numbering in the tens of thousands.

Since August 2007, HBOI has been home to Westwood High School’s Marine and Oceanographic Academy (MOA), a magnet school with a diverse student body from across the St. Lucie County School District. The school, formed through a partnership between HBOI and the school district, infuses a marine and oceanographic focus into the core high school curriculum.

Since May 2009, HBOI has been the headquarters of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration’s Cooperative Institute for Ocean Exploration, Research &amp; Technology (CIOERT), which is co-managed by University of North Carolina Wilmington and includes partners SRI International, the Rosenstiel School of Marine &amp; Atmospheric Science, and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIOERT priorities include development of advanced underwater technologies, exploration and research of frontier regions of the eastern US continental shelf and beyond, improved understanding of vulnerable deep and shallow coral ecosystems, and improved ocean literacy.

The '''Harbor Branch Ocean Discovery Center''' is open to the public in [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]].  The Center features interactive exhibits about the environment of the ocean, live marine creatures, a video theater, and displays about the research activities of the Institute.  The Center is closed on Sundays and major holidays.

The '''Hockney–Falco thesis''' is a theory of [[art history]], advanced by artist [[David Hockney]] and physicist [[Charles M. Falco]]. Both claimed that advances in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] and accuracy in the history of Western art since the [[Renaissance]] were primarily the result of [[optical instrument]]s such as the [[camera obscura]], [[camera lucida]], and [[curved mirror]]s, rather than solely due to the development of [[artist]]ic technique and skill. Nineteenth-century artists' use of photography had been well documented.&lt;ref&gt;In [[Aaron Scharf]]'s 1968 book ''Art and Photography'' (Allen Lane, The Penguin Press), referred to by Hockney in his 1977 painting ''My Parents'' (Tate, London) in which his father attentively reads the volume. Scharf notes in his introduction (p.1); 'In 1568 Daniele Barbaro, the Venetian writer on architecture, recommended the camera Obscura as an aid to artists: "By holding the paper steady you can trace the whole perspective outline with a pen, shade it, and delicately colour it from nature."'&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 book, ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', Hockney analyzed the work of the [[Old Masters]] and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by "eyeballing it".  Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods. The hypothesis led to a variety of conferences and heated discussions.

==Setup of the 2001 publication==
Part of Hockney's work involved collaboration with Charles Falco, a [[condensed matter physics|condensed matter physicist]] and an expert in [[optics]].  While the use of optical aids would generally enhance accuracy, Falco calculated the types of [[distortion]] that would result from specific optical devices; Hockney and Falco argued that such errors could in fact be found in the work of some of the Old Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Falco, [http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220210253/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/FAQ.html |date=February 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

Hockney's book prompted intense and sustained debate among artists, art historians, and a wide variety of other scholars.  In particular, it has spurred increased interest in the actual methods and techniques of artists among scientists and [[history of science|historians of science]], as well as general historians and [[art historian]]s.  The latter have in general reacted unfavorably, interpreting the Hockney–Falco thesis as an accusation that the Old Masters "cheated" and intentionally obscured their methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=125–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicist David G. Stork and several co-authors have argued against the Hockney–Falco thesis from a technical standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Antonio |last=Criminisi |first2=David G. |last2=Stork |chapter=Did the great masters use optical projections while painting?

Hockney and Falco's theory has already inspired an increase in research regarding the use of optics throughout the history of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punk Playthings: Provocations for 21st Century Game Makers|last=Taylor|first=Sean|last2=Lowthorpe|first2=Chris|publisher=CRC Press|year=2017|isbn=9781315350035|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, there was the case of the decade-long research on [[Rembrandt]]'s works conducted by painter Francis O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Neill|first=Francis|last2=Palazzo-Corner|first2=Sofia|date=August 2016|title=Rembrandt’s self-portraits|url=|journal=Journal of Optics|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the published paper he wrote with Sofia Palazzo Corner entitled, ''Rembrandt's Self-portraits'', O'Neill presented recurring themes in the painter's works that serve as evidence in his use of mirrors, particularly, in his self-portraits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/science/rembrandt-old-master-optics-mirrors.html|title=The Mirrors Behind Rembrandt’s Self-Portraits|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=July 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the use of [[chiaroscuro]], which is a signature of the lighting conditions necessary for projections as well as Rembrandt's off-center gaze in his self-portraits, which - according to O'Neill - indicated that the artist might have been looking at a projection surface off to the side rather than straight onto a flat mirror.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origins of the thesis==
As described in ''Secret Knowledge'', in January 1999 during a visit to the [[National Gallery, London]], Hockney conceived of the idea that optical aids were the key factor in the development of artistic realism.  He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and became convinced that Ingres had used a [[camera lucida]] or similar device.  From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of optical aids in earlier paintings, creating what he called the ''Great Wall'' in his studio  by organizing images of great realistic art by time period.  What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney–Falco thesis.&lt;ref name=svensixseven&gt;{{harvnb|Dupré|2005|pp=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Falco and Hockney published an analysis ("Optical Insights into Renaissance Art") of the likely use of concave mirrors in Jan van Eyck's work in ''Optics &amp; Photonics News'', vol. 11.  In 2001, Hockney published an extended form of his argument in ''Secret Knowledge''.

The hypothesis that technology was used in the production of Renaissance Art was not much in dispute in early studies and literature.&lt;ref name=id&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Don Ihde |first=Don |last=Ihde |chapter=Art Precedes Science: or Did the Camera Obscura Invent Modern Science? |editor-first=Helmar |editor-last=Schramm |editor2-first=Ludger |editor2-last=Schwarte |editor3-first=Jan |editor3-last=Lazardzig |title=Instruments in Art and Science: On the Architectonics of Cultural Boundaries in the 17th Century |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=HP-FNOpBCGUC&amp;pg=PA383 |year=2008 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-020240-3 |pages=384–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1929 [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] contained an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cited [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; The discussion started by the Hockney–Falco thesis ignored the abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices, at least in the Renaissance, and, e.g., [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt;

==Hockney's argument==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 008.jpg|thumb|Detail of the chandelier and mirror from Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', one of Hockney's key examples]]
In ''Secret Knowledge'', Hockney argues that early [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance artists]] such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Lorenzo Lotto]] used concave mirrors; as evidence, he points to the chandelier in Van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', the ear in Van Eyck's [[portrait of Cardinal Albergati]], and the carpet in Lotto's ''Husband and Wife''.  Hockney suggests that later artists, beginning with [[Caravaggio]], used [[convex mirrors]] as well, to achieve a large field of view.

''Secret Knowledge'' recounts Hockney's search for evidence of optical aids in the work of earlier artists, including the assembly of a "Great Wall" of the [[history of Western art]].  The 15th century work of Jan van Eyck seems to be the turning point, he argues, after which elements of realism became increasingly prominent.  He correlates shifts toward increased realism with advances in optical technologies.  The argument of ''Secret Knowledge'' is primarily a visual one, as Hockney was largely unable to determine when and how optical aids were used by textual or direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jane |last=Partner |title=Review: David Hockney: Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |journal=Cambridge Quarterly |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=345–9 |year=2002 |doi=10.1093/camqtly/31.4.345 |url=http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/345.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falco and Ibn al-Haytham==
At a scientific conference in February 2007, Falco further argued that the Arabic physicist [[Ibn al-Haytham]]'s (965–1040) work on [[optics]], in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', may have influenced the use of optical aids by Renaissance artists. Falco said that his and Hockney's examples of Renaissance art "demonstrate a continuum in the use of optics by artists from c. 1430, arguably initiated as a result of Ibn al-Haytham's influence, until today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Charles M. Falco |last=Falco |first=Charles M. |chapter=Ibn al-Haytham and the Origins of Modern Image Analysis |chapterurl=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4555635 |title=9th International Symposium on Signal Processing and Its Applications, 2007. ISSPA 2007 |publisher=IEEE |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4244-0778-1 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1109/ISSPA.2007.4555635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Artist's skill===
Art historians and others have criticized Hockney's argument on the grounds that the use of optical aids, though well-established in individual cases, has little value for explaining the overall development of Western art, and that historical records and paintings and photographs of art studios (sans optical devices), as well as present-day realist artists, demonstrate that high levels of realism are possible without optical aids.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Optical distortion===
In addition to incredulity on the part of art historians and critics of modern art, some of the harshest criticism of the Hockney–Falco thesis came from another expert in optics, image processing and pattern recognition, David G. Stork.  Stork analyzed the images used by Falco and Hockney, and came to the conclusion that they do not demonstrate the kinds of optical distortion that curved mirrors or converging lenses would cause.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Stork, [http://www.diatrope.com/stork/FAQs.html FAQ] (accessed March 16, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Falco has claimed that Stork's published criticisms have relied on fabricated data and misrepresentations of Hockney and Falco's theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rex |last=Dalton |title=Tempers blaze over artistic integrity |journal=Nature |volume=440 |issue=7081 |page=134 |year=2006 |doi=10.1038/440134a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7081/full/440134a.html |pmid=16525432}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stork has rebutted this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David G. |last=Stork |first2=Marco |last2=Duarte |title=Revisiting computer vision and art |journal=IEEE Multimedia |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=108–9 |year=2007 |doi=10.1109/MMUL.2007.62 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4287425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance optics===
Critics of the Hockney–Falco theory claim that the quality of mirrors and optical glass for the period before 1550 and a lack of textual evidence (excluding paintings themselves as "documentary evidence") of their use for image projection during this period casts doubt on the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics|last=Smith|first=Mark|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2015|isbn=9780226174761|location=Chicago|pages=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are more inclined to agree about the possible relevance of the thesis between 1550 and the invention of the telescope, and cautiously supportive after that period, when there clearly was interest and capacity to project realistic images; 17th century painters such as [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Gaspar van Wittel]] used optical devices in a variety of ways, though not the ways postulated by Hockney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sven |last=Dupré |title=Introduction. The Hockney–Falco Thesis: Constraints and Opportunities |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=125–136 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088141 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088141 |jstor=4130307 |ref=harv}} pp. 128–135; quotation from p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving the technical optical arguments aside, historians of science investigated several aspects of the historical plausibility of the thesis in a 2005 set of articles in ''Early Science and Medicine''.  In his introduction to the volume, Sven Dupré claimed the Hockney–Falco analysis rests heavily on a small number of examples, "a few dozen square centimeters" of canvas that seem to show signs that optical devices were used.&lt;ref name=svensixseven/&gt;

===Image projection===
&lt;!--One critic{{Who|date=October 2014}} argued that the optical ideas of opticians at the time were somewhat incompatible with image projection, though artists might have been more receptive.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}  Two other scholars{{Who|date=October 2014}} showed that Renaissance painting treatises and Leonardo's manuscripts also lack any reference to image projection.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}} However, his--&gt;Leonardo's notebooks include several designs for creating concave mirrors&lt;!--, even if this alone is not evidence of their use for image projection--&gt;. Leonardo also describes a [[camera obscura]] in his ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' of 1478–1519.

The camera obscura was well known for centuries and documented by [[Ibn al-Haitham]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' of 1011–1021. In 13th-century England [[Roger Bacon]] described the use of a camera obscura for the safe observation of [[solar eclipses]], exactly because the viewer looks at the projected image and not the sun itself.

David Lindberg's ''A Catalogue of Medieval and Renaissance Optical Manuscripts'' (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974) lists 61 manuscripts written in the years 1000–1425. These manuscripts not only describe methods for making mirrors and parabolic mirrors but also discuss their use for image projection.

===Optical glass===
Sara J. Schechner claimed that surviving glassware from the 15th and 16th centuries is far too imperfect to have been used to create realistic images, while "even thinking about projecting images was alien to the contemporary conceptual frame of mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sara J. |last=Schechner |title=Between Knowing and Doing: Mirrors and their Imperfections in the Renaissance |journal=Early Science and Medicine |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=137–162 |year=2005 |doi=10.1163/1573382054088187 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/1573382054088187 |jstor=4130308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vincent Ilardi, a historian of Renaissance optical glass, subsequently argued against Schechner's conclusions based on surviving glassware, suggesting that the present condition of Renaissance glassware is not likely to reflect the optical quality of such glassware when it was new.  Ilardi documents [[Lorenzo Lotto]]'s purchase of a high-priced crystal mirror in 1549, bolstering the Hockney–Falco thesis in Lotto's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Vincent |last=Ilardi |title=Renaissance Vision, From Spectacles to Telescopes |series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=2007 |isbn=0-87169-259-7 |pages=197–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, even normal eyeglasses (spectacles) can also project images of sufficient optical quality to support the Hockney–Falco thesis and such eyeglasses, along with magnifying glasses and mirrors, were not only available at the time, but actually pictured in 14th century paintings by artists such as [[Tommaso da Modena]].

Dutch draper and pioneering microbiologist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723), a contemporary of artist Vermeer (and an executor for Vermeer when he died in 1675) in Delft was known to have exceptional lens making skills, having created single small lenses capable of 200x magnification, far exceeding those of more complex compound microscopes of the period. Indeed, his feats of lens making were not matched for a considerable time as he kept aspects of their construction secret; in the 1950s, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing to recreate Leeuwenhoek design microscopes.  It was long believed that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a master lens grinder (a notion repeated in the recent BBC television documentary "Cell"). However, it is now believed{{By whom|date=October 2014}} that he came upon a relatively simple method of making small, high quality glass spheres by heating and manipulating a small rod of soda lime glass.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2014}}

===Metal mirrors===
On his website, Falco also claims Schechner overlooked manuscript evidence for the use of mirrors made from steel and other metals, as well as numerous metal artifacts that belie the claim that sufficiently large and reflective metal mirrors were unavailable, and that other contributors to the ''Early Science and Medicine'' volume relied on Schechner's mistaken work in dismissing the thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Charles Falco|title=Objections |url=http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |accessdate=April 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625201014/http://www.optics.arizona.edu/ssd/faq.html#Objections |archivedate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier evidence of the use of optical tools==
[[File:Annunciation_-_Virgin_and_Angel_-_Jan_van_Eyck_-_1434_-_NG_Wash_DC.jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' (van Eyck, Washington)]] with three crown glass windows behind Mary]]
[[File:The_Arnolfini_Portrait,_détail_(2).jpg|thumb|Mirror depicted in the 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'']]
[[Don Ihde]] called the hypothesis being 'hyped' and referred to clear evidence about the use of optical tools by, e.g., [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and others. As well the 1929 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref name=id/&gt; contains an extensive article on the [[camera obscura]] and cites [[Leon Battista Alberti]] as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437.&lt;ref name=id/&gt; Ihde states abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices at least in the Renaissance and e.g. in [[Early Netherlandish painting]].&lt;ref name=delft/&gt; [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 painting ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' shows a convex mirror in the centre of the painting. Van Eyck also left his signature above this mirror,&lt;ref name=delft&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert D. |last=Huerta |title=Giants of Delft: Johannes Vermeer and the Natural Philosophers : the Parallel Search for Knowledge During the Age of Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIelMWzUR6gC |year=2003 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |isbn=978-0-8387-5538-9}} the book mentions various (previous) studies stating a broad use of technology in the Renaissance and does not refer to the hypothesis and the hype around it at all&lt;/ref&gt; showing the importance of the tool. The painting includes a [[Crown glass (window)|crown glass window]] in the upper left side, a rather expensive luxury at the time. Van Eyck was rather fascinated by glass and its qualities, which was as well of high symbolic importance for his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carola |last=Hicks|author-link=Carola Hicks |title=Girl in a Green Gown: The History and Mystery of the Arnolfini Portrait |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9o4mZl_jVacC |year=2012 |publisher=VINTAGE |isbn=978-0-09-952689-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early optical instruments were comparatively expensive in the Medieval age and  the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |first=Mark |last=Pendergrast |title=Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair with Reflection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C |year=2009 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-7867-2990-6 |origyear=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Expanding vacuum state with high potential energy
* Phase transition to true vacuum
* Slow roll and reheating

===Expanding vacuum state with high potential energy===

In [[quantum field theory]], a [[vacuum state]] or vacuum is a state of quantum fields which is at locally minimal potential energy. Quantum particles are excitations which deviate from a minimal potential energy state, therefore a vacuum state has no particles in it. Depending on the specifics of a quantum field theory, it can have more than one vacuum state. Different vacua, despite all "being empty" (having no particles), will generally have different [[vacuum energy]]. Quantum field theory stipulates that the pressure of the vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to its energy density.

Inflationary theory postulates that there is a vacuum state with very large vacuum energy, caused by a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field. Any region of space in this state will rapidly expand. Even if initially it is not empty (contains some particles), very rapid exponential expansion dilutes particle density to zero.

===Phase transition to true vacuum===

Inflationary theory further postulates that this "inflationary" vacuum state is not the state with globally lowest energy – it's a [[false vacuum]]. This is also known as a [[metastable]] state. For each observer in any chosen point of space, false vacuum eventually tunnels into a state with the same potential energy, but which isn't a vacuum (it is not at a local minimum of the potential energy, it "can decay"). This state can be seen as a true vacuum, filled with a large number of inflaton particles. However, rate of expansion of the true vacuum does not change at this moment – only its exponential character changes to much slower expansion of [[FLRW metric]]. This ensures that expansion rate precisely matches the energy density.

===Slow roll and reheating===

In true vacuum, inflaton particles decay, eventually giving rise to the observed Standard Model particles. The shape of the potential energy function near "tunnel exit" from false vacuum state must have a shallow slope, otherwise particle production will be confined to the boundary of expanding true vacuum bubble, which contradicts observation (our Universe is not built of huge completely void bubbles). In other words, the quantum state should "roll to the bottom slowly".

When complete, the decay of inflaton particles fills the space with hot and dense Big Bang plasma.

==Field quanta==

Just like every other quantum field, excitations of the inflaton field are expected to be quantized.  The field quanta of the inflaton field are known as '''inflatons'''.  Depending on the modeled potential energy density, the inflaton field's [[ground state]] may or may not be zero.

The term ''inflaton'' follows the typical naming style{{clarify|date=October 2016}} of other quantum particles (such as [[photon]], [[gluon]], [[boson]] and [[fermion]]), deriving from the word ''inflation''. The term was first used in a paper entitled ‘After Primordial Inflation’ by, D.V. Nanopoulos, K.A. Olive and M. Srednicki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370269383916246 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(83)91624-6 | volume=127 | title=After primordial inflation | year=1983 | journal=Physics Letters B | pages=30–34 | author=Nanopoulos D.V., Olive K.A., Srednicki M.| bibcode=1983PhLB..127...30N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of the inflaton field is currently not known. One of the obstacles for narrowing its properties down is the inability of QFTs to correctly predict vacuum energy based on the particle content of a chosen theory (see [[Cosmological constant problem|vacuum catastrophe]]). Atkins (2012) has suggested that it is even possible that no new field is necessary, that a modified version of the [[Higgs field]] could act as an inflaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Atkins, Michael|title=Could the Higgs Boson Be the Inflaton?|date=March 2012|url=http://indico.cern.ch/event/180122/material/slides/0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-minimally coupled inflation==

'''Non-minimally coupled inflation''' is an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] model in which the constant which couples [[gravity]] to the [[inflaton field]] is not small. The [[coupling constant]] is usually represented by &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; ([[Xi (letter)|Xi]]), which features in the [[action (physics)|action]] (constructed by modifying the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]):&lt;ref name=hertzberg12&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2143">The [[France|French]] '''''Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire''''' (IRSN) ("Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute") located in [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]] is a public official establishment with an industrial and commercial aspect (EPIC) created by the AFSSE Act ({{ill|Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de l'environnement et du travail|fr|Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de l'environnement et du travail}} - French Agency of Sanitary Environmental Security) and by  February 22, 2002 decreed n°2002-254. The IRSN is placed under the conjoint authority of the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Defence minister]], the [[Minister of the Environment (France)|Environmental minister]], the [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Industry minister]] and the [[Minister of Health (France)|Health]] and [[Minister of National Education (France)|Research minister]].

The IRSN gathers more than 1500 experts and researchers from the [[Institut de protection et de sûreté nucléaire]] (IPSN - Protection and Nuclear Safety Institute) and the [[Office de protection contre les rayonnements ionisants]] (OPRI - Ionizing radiations protection office). These scientists are thus competent on [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear]] safety, [[radioactivity|radioactive]] protection and control of nuclear and sensitive materials.

The IRSN realize investigations, expertise assessments and studies on the fields of nuclear safety, protection against [[ionizing radiation]], protection and control of nuclear material, and protection against voluntary ill-advised acts.

The '''Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics (ITAMP)''' is an international scientific learned society based at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It was established in 1988 to alleviate a perceived shortage of theorists in [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]] (AMO) at major universities throughout America. AMO concerns the study of matter-matter and light-matter interactions at the scale of one or a few atoms. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/itamp-history|title=Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics - History|publisher=Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics|accessdate= 20 June 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The stated objectives of the Institute are:
* To attract and train scientists of the highest quality in theoretical atomic, molecular, and optical physics 
* To maintain an active visitors' program to bring senior researchers together for scientific collaboration
* To establish a strong post-doctoral fellowship program.

The objectives are tackled by fostering an intellectually stimulating environment, developing pioneering research areas, facilitating closer interactions between AMO theory and experiment and promoting AMO theory within the general physics community.

It has been involved in some capacity in most of the National Research Council target areas, i.e. precision measurements and tests of fundamental laws, ultracold physics, the development and application of ultra-intense, short wavelength light sources, ultra-fast quantum control of atoms, molecules and electrons, nanoscience, and quantum information science.

The Institute is sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]], the [[Center for Astrophysics]] and [[Harvard University]].

==History==
The Armstrong Report in 1987 on "The State of Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Sciences in the United States" (National Academy Press, 1987) recommended the setting up of an institute to facilitate the exchange of scientific knowledge and ideas in the AMO field. ITAMP, originally the '''Institute for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics''' was set up in 1988 at Harvard University under its first director [[Alexander Dalgarno]] to fulfil that need. The name was changed in 2002 to the '''Institute for Theoretical Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics''' although the established ITAMP acronym remained unchanged.

Dalgarno handed control over to [[Eric J. Heller|Rick Heller]] in 1993, who left the post in 1998. It was then directed (from 2001) by Kate Kirby, who was later joined as joint director by [[Mikhail Lukin|Misha Lukin]]. In 2016 the director is Hossein Sadeghpour. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Dalgarno Celebratory Symposium|first=James|last=Babb|page= 367 et seq}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Winter University (IWU) Kassel''' is a short-term program that is held during the winter season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. The IWU inspired from the international short-term programs held in Germany, then [[International Summer University (ISU) Kassel]] began the establishment of IWU in response to growing interest of international students to study in Germany. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; Uni Kassel organizes both of ISU and IWU as one of its internationalization strategies. The program of IWU Kassel is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971.

The uniqueness of IWU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and cultural heritage. While IWU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program has been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, IWU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and Development of the Programme==
Following the success of ISU, the International Winter University (IWU) was established in 2005/06 to offer international students an alternative time frame to experience [[education in Germany]]. It is a pioneer of short-term winter programs in Germany and is one of the short-term programs bearing the DAAD&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.germany.daad.org/ DAAD] page.&lt;/ref&gt; Quality Seal.

Besides, IWU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of Uni Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, IWU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to IWU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, IWU has received on average some 50 international students each year. The number of students is on the rise with its growing popularity among partnering universities. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries. 

==Program of Study==
The study program of IWU Kassel includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in '''teaching German as a foreign language'''. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for engineering module usually cover the following topics: an introduction to international climate policy, renewable energy and energy systems from a German and European perspective, environment protection measures, solar-thermal technologies and systems, [[photovoltaic]], the history and future of wind energy, [[wind farm management]], [[biomass]], [[natural gas storage]], and rational and efficient energy usage: low energy housing and sustainable building. Seminar for German culture module usually covers topics such as German history, literature, and art of the 19th and 20th centuries, which all activities will explore how contemporary German culture has been shaped by historical developments in the past 200 years, the "Age of Goethe" (Goethe-Zeit), the end of the 19th century ([[nietzsche]]), and the [[revolutionary]] [[art movement]] ([[bauhaus]] and [[expressionism]]).

Students will be awarded 6 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [https://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


Kassel is a mid-sized city located in northern Hesse in the centre of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000 which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''James Marvin Herndon''' (born 1944) is an [[United States|American]] interdisciplinary scientist, who earned his BA degree in [[physics]] in 1970 from the [[University of California, San Diego]] and his Ph.D. degree in [[nuclear chemistry]] in 1974 from [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography 64: 45-49, 2003, https://web.archive.org/web/20050205193822/http://nuclearplanet.com/profile.htm, similar link: [http://www.nuclearplanet.com/JMH%20Biography.html J. Marvin Herndon's Brief Biography] at January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For three years, J. Marvin Herndon was a [[post-doctoral]] assistant to [[Hans Suess]] and [[Harold C. Urey]] in [[geochemistry]] and [[cosmochemistry]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. He has been profiled in ''[[Current Biography]]'', and dubbed a “maverick geophysicist” by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Gugliotta. [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-239077.html Is Earth's Core a Nuclear Fission Reactor?], ''The Washington Post'', March 24, 2003, p. A06&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories on Earth ==
Herndon suggested that the composition of the [[inner core]] of Earth is nickel [[silicide]]; the conventional view is that it is iron–nickel alloy&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1979) The nickel silicide inner core of the Earth. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A368, 495-500.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, he has suggested "[[georeactor]]" planetocentric [[nuclear fission reactor]]s as energy sources for the [[gas giant]] [[outer planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1992) ''Nuclear fission reactors as energy sources for the giant outer planets'', [[Naturwissenschaften]] 79, 7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 
as the energy source and production mechanism for the geomagnetic field &lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (2007) Nuclear georeactor generation of Earth’s geomagnetic field. Current Science, V. 93, No. 11, 1485-1487.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stellar ignition]] by [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, J. M. (1994) Planetary and protostellar nuclear fission: Implications for planetary change, stellar ignition and dark matter. Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond., A455, 453-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Herndon postulated what he calls [[Expanding Earth|whole-earth decompression dynamics]], which he describes as a unified theory combining elements of [[plate tectonics]] and [[Expanding Earth|Earth expansion]]. He suggests that Earth formed from a [[Jupiter]]-sized [[gas giant]] by catastrophic loss of its gaseous atmosphere with subsequent decompression and expansion of the rocky remnant planet resulting in ''decompression cracks'' at continental margins which are filled in by basalts from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=Herndon&gt;J. Marvin Herndon, ''Whole-earth decompression dynamics,'' Current Science, V. 89, No. 11, 10 Dec. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.downloadtheuniverse.com/dtu/2012/07/ebooks-and-the-democratization-of-crackpottery.html |title= eBooks and the democratization of crackpottery |author=  John Timmer |author-link=  John Timmer |publisher= [[Download the Universe]] |date= 9 July 2012 |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://boingboing.net/2012/07/10/crackpots-geniuses-and-how-t.html |title= Crackpots, geniuses, and how to tell the difference |publisher= [[Boing Boing]] |author= |date= 10 July 2012 |accessdate= 3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent measuments of "[[geoneutrino]]" fluxes in the KamLAND and Borexino experiments have placed stringent upper limits on Herndon's "[[georeactor]]" hypothesis on the presence of an active nuclear fission reactor in the Earth's inner core, so that such reactor would produce less than 3 TW.&lt;ref name="Borexino2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Borexino Collaboration|title=Observation of geo-neutrinos|journal=Phys.

== Chemtrail theory proponent ==

More recently, Herndon has become a proponent of the [[chemtrail conspiracy theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herndon|first1=Marvin J|title=January 16, 2015 Email to San Diego Mayor, Copies to City Council Members|url=http://www.nuclearplanet.com/mayor1.pdf|website=Nuclearplanet.com|accessdate=20 February 2017|quote=Almost every day jet airliners are spraying innumerable so-called “chemtrails”  and they persist after release behind the jets to gradually form clouds.

Those concerted efforts to cause said retractions prove
that the high officials who ordered the spraying know very well that they are poisoning humanity and want to hide that fact".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nuclearplanet.com/explainretractions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1197">'''Lavizan-Shian''' was an alleged undeclared nuclear site north-eastern [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. The site was under investigation by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] as a potential undeclared nuclear site. According to Reuters, claims by the US that topsoil has been removed and the site had been sanitized could not be verified by IAEA investigators who visited Lavizan. In Paragraph 39 of the IAEA's November 2005 report on Iran, the IAEA stated "The information provided by Iran appeared to be coherent and consistent with its explanation of the razing of the Lavisan-Shian area."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">'''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tones, [[tints and shades]] ) of a single [[hue]]. [[File:CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg|frame|Example of a monochromatic color scheme]]
Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, grey or black.

Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility.

The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color. The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Z.|title=Colour Combination Techniques|date=2014|publisher=Design Research Associates|location=Sydney AUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in comparison to polychromatic). That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = the definition of monochromatic|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/monochromatic|website = Dictionary.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, monochromatic also has another meaning similar to “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word.

== Recommends for CUD  ==
It is also be recommended to use monochromatic color for [[Color Universal Design]] (CUD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Web |url=http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/ |title=Color Universal Design (CUD) - How to make figures and presentations that are friendly to Colorblind people - |access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image with enough [[contrast ratio]] monochromatic color also compatible with [[color blindness]] people.

The historical Tahakhana is located at the [[Gauḍa (region)]] in Firozpur area in the west of a big pond. It is 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Chapai Nawabganj District]] in Shahbajpur Union at [[Shibganj Upazila, Chapai Nawabganj|Shibganj Upazila]].&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin, Mohammad (6 March 2010)। "শাহ নিয়ামতুল্লাহ (রঃ) এর মাজার"। ''গৌড়বঙ্গ ও চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ এর প্রাচীন নিদর্শন'' (2 সংস্করণ)। ঢাকা, বাংলাদেশ: জাতীয় সাহিত্য পরিষদ। পৃ:&amp;nbsp;১০১।&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Sultan of Bengal]], [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] founded this palace as a 'Temperature Control Unit' in honour of his [[Murshed]] Shah Syed Niyamatullah, mainly for comfort in winter. Son of [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]], Shah Shuja founded this palace between 1619 and 1658 (or 1639–1660).&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Rajinikanth (January 1999)। [http://50.30.47.15/ebook/bangla/Gourer_Itihas.pdf ''গৌড়ের ইতিহাস''] (PDF) (1 &amp; 2 সংস্করণ)। Bankim Chatterjee Street, Calcutta 700 073: Dev's Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; There is a saying that, when he came to meet with [[Murshed]] used the middle wider room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shahabajpurup.chapainawabganj.gov.bd "সোনামসজিদ তোহাখানা মাজার শরিফ"]। মন্ত্রিপরিষদ বিভাগ, এটুআই, বিসিসি ও বেসিস&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of unknown graves inside the 'Tahakhana Complex' considered as companions or Khadems of Shah Syed Niyamatullah.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Structure ==
Ancient architecture like [[Gauḍa (region)|Gauḍa]] is rarely found except Tahakhana. Her ceiling and partition are coagulated on the beam by concrete casting. The Mosque and Tahakhana are on the lake name 'Dafe-ul-Balah'. Two stare cases are sank into the lake. Two more structures are on the north west side of the palace, nearer one is a three domed mosque and another one is one domed tomb with bolted veranda. All the buildings are founded by the same time for a specific purpose and considered as a complex unit. Main materiel of the building is brick. Black stone is used for the threshold and wooden vim used for plain roof. The building seems to be single storied from the west side but assumed double storied from the east side, extended by the rooms directly raised the archway from the lake. A [[Turkish bath|hammam]] is in the west of the building supplied water from an octagonal reservoir. A small family mosque is in the north and at its back side an open room which connected with an octagonal tower. This tower possibly used for [[contemplation]]. This octagonal tower balanced the complex. The palace is plastered and engraved by the crafts following [[Mughal architecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">The '''Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile''' is a spatial mass distribution of [[dark matter]] fitted to dark matter halos identified in [[N-body]] simulations by [[Julio Navarro (astrophysicist)|Julio Navarro]], [[Carlos Frenk]] and [[Simon White]].&lt;ref name="NAVARROETAL1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Navarro, Julio F.|author2=Frenk, Carlos S.|author3=White, Simon D. M.|title=The Structure of Cold Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=462|pages=563|date=May 10, 1996|bibcode=1996ApJ...462..563N|doi=10.1086/177173|arxiv=astro-ph/9508025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFW profile is one of the most commonly used model profiles for dark matter halos.&lt;ref name="BERTONE2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bertone|first=Gianfranco|title=[[Particle Dark Matter|Particle Dark Matter: Observations, Models and Searches]]|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2010|pages=762|isbn=978-0-521-76368-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Density distribution==

In the NFW profile, the density of dark matter as a function of radius is given by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\rho (r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1~+~\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and the "scale radius", ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', are parameters which vary from halo to halo.

The integrated mass within some radius ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[
\ln\left(\frac{R_s+R_\max}{R_s}\right)-\frac{R_\max}{R_s+R_\max}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mass is divergent, but it is often useful to take the edge of the halo to be the [[Virial theorem#Galaxies and cosmology .28virial mass and radius.29|virial radius,]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;vir&lt;/sub&gt;, which is related to the "concentration parameter", ''c'', and scale radius via

: &lt;math&gt;
R_\mathrm{vir}=cR_s
&lt;/math&gt;

The virial radius is often referred to as &lt;math&gt; R_{200} &lt;/math&gt;, and is defined as the radius at which the average density within this radius is 200 times the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In this case, the total mass in the halo within &lt;math&gt; R_\mathrm{vir} &lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
M=\int_0^{R_\mathrm{vir}} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r) \, dr=4\pi \rho_0 R_s^3 \left[\ln(1+c) - \frac{c}{1+c}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''c'' is roughly 10 or 15 for the Milky Way, and may range from 4 to 40
for halos of various sizes.

The integral of the ''squared density'' is

: &lt;math&gt;
\int_0^{R_\max} 4\pi r^2 \rho (r)^2 \, dr=\frac{4\pi}{3} R_s^3 \rho_0^2
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

so that the mean squared density inside of ''R''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\max}=\frac{R_s^3\rho_0^2}{R_\max^3}
\left[1-\frac{R_s^3}{(R_s+R_\max)^3}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

which for the virial radius simplifies to

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_\mathrm{vir}}=\frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
\left[1-\frac{1}{(1+c)^3}\right]
\approx \frac{\rho_0^2}{c^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the mean squared density inside the scale radius is simply

: &lt;math&gt;
\langle \rho^2 \rangle_{R_s}=\frac{7}{8}\rho_0^2
&lt;/math&gt;

===Gravitational potential===
Solving Poisson's equation gives the gravitational potential
: &lt;math&gt;
\Phi(r) = - \frac{4\pi G \rho_0 R_s^3}{r} \ln \left( 1+ \frac{r}{R_s} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
with the limits &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to \infty} \Phi=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to 0} \Phi=-4\pi G\rho_0 R_s^2&lt;/math&gt; .

===Radius of the maximum circular velocity===
The radius of the maximum circular velocity (confusingly sometimes also referred to as &lt;math&gt;R_\max&lt;/math&gt;) can be found from the maximum of &lt;math&gt;M(r)/r&lt;/math&gt; as
: &lt;math&gt;
R^\max_{\mathrm{circ}} = \alpha R_s
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx 2.16258&lt;/math&gt; is the positive root of 
: &lt;math&gt;
\ln \left( 1 + \alpha \right) =  \frac{\alpha (1+2\alpha)}{(1+\alpha)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;.

==Dark matter simulations==
Over a broad range of halo mass and redshift, the NFW profile approximates the [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] configuration of dark matter halos produced in simulations of [[collision]]less dark matter particles by numerous groups of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y. P. Jing|title=The Density Profile of Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 May 2000|volume=535|issue=1|pages=30–36|bibcode=2000ApJ...535...30J|doi=10.1086/308809|arxiv=astro-ph/9901340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the dark matter [[virial theorem|virializes]], the distribution of dark matter deviates from an NFW profile, and significant substructure is observed in simulations both during and after the collapse of the halos.

Alternative models, in particular the [[Einasto profile]], have been shown to represent the dark matter profiles of simulated halos as well as or better than the NFW profile by including an additional third parameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Merritt, David |author-link=David Merritt|display-authors=4|author2=Graham, Alister|author3=Moore, Benjamin|author4=Diemand, Jurg|author5=Terzić, Balsa|title=Empirical Models for Dark Matter Halos|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=20 December 2006|volume=132|issue=6|pages=2685–2700|doi=10.1086/508988|arxiv=astro-ph/0509417|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2685M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merritt|first1=David|authorlink1=David Merritt|display-authors=etal|title=A Universal Density Profile for Dark and Luminous Matter?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=May 2005|volume=624|issue=2|pages=L85–L88|doi=10.1086/430636|arxiv=astro-ph/0502515|bibcode=2005ApJ...624L..85M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Einasto profile has a finite (zero) central slope, unlike the NFW profile which has a divergent (infinite) central density. Because of the limited resolution of N-body simulations, it is not yet known which model provides the best description of the central densities of simulated dark-matter halos.

Simulations assuming different cosmological initial conditions produce halo populations in which the two parameters of the NFW profile follow different mass-concentration relations, depending on cosmological properties such as the density of the universe and the nature of the very early process which created all structure. Observational measurements of this relation thus offer a route to constraining these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Navarro, Julio |author-link=Julio Navarro |author2=Frenk, Carlos |author3=White, Simon |title=A Universal Density Profile from Hierarchical Clustering |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=1 December 1997 |volume=490 |issue=2 |pages=493-508 |doi=10.1086/304888 |arxiv=astro-ph/9611107 |bibcode=1997ApJ...490..493N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations of halos==
The dark matter density profiles of massive galaxy clusters can be measured directly by gravitational lensing and agree well with the NFW profiles predicted for cosmologies with the parameters inferred from other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Okabe|first1=Nobuhiro|display-authors=etal|title=LoCuSS: The Mass Density Profile of Massive Galaxy Clusters at z = 0.2|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=June 2013|volume=769|pages=L35–L40|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1302.2728|bibcode=2013ApJ...769L..35O}}&lt;/ref&gt; For lower mass halos, gravitational lensing is too noisy to give useful results for individual objects, but accurate measurements can still be made by averaging the profiles of many similar systems. For the main body of the halos, the agreement with the predictions remains good down to halo masses as small as those of the halos surrounding isolated galaxies like our own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Wenting|display-authors=etal|title=A weak gravitational lensing recalibration of the scaling relations linking the gas properties of dark haloes to their mass|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=March 2016|volume=456|pages=2301-2320|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2809/2041-8205/769/2/L35|arxiv=1509.05784|bibcode=2016MNRAS.456.2301W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner regions of halos are beyond the reach of lensing measurements, however, and other techniques give results which disagree with NFW predictions for the dark matter distribution inside 
the visible galaxies which lie at halo centers.

Observations of the inner regions of bright galaxies like the [[Milky Way]] and [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] may be compatible with the NFW profile,&lt;ref name="KLYPIN2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klypin, Anatoly|author2=Zhao, HongSheng|author3=Somerville, Rachel S.|title=ΛCDM-based Models for the Milky Way and M31.

This is known as the cusp-core or [[cuspy halo problem]].
It is currently debated whether this discrepancy is a consequence of the nature of the dark matter, of the influence of dynamical processes during galaxy formation, or of shortcomings in dynamical modelling of the observational data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oman|first1=Kyle|display-authors=etal|title=The unexpected diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=October 2015|volume=452|pages=3650-3665|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv1504|arxiv=1504.01437|bibcode=2015MNRAS.452.3650O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[power engineering]], '''nodal admittance matrix''' (or just '''admittance matrix''') or '''Y Matrix''' or '''Ybus''' is an ''N x N'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] describing a power system with ''N'' [[Bus (power engineering)|buses]].  It represents the nodal [[admittance]] of the buses in a power system.  In realistic systems which contain thousands of buses, the Y matrix is quite sparse. Each bus in a real power system is usually connected to only a few other buses through the [[electric power transmission|transmission line]]s.  The Y Matrix is also one of the data requirements needed to formulate a [[power flow study]].

== Context ==
[[Power engineering|Electric power transmission]] needs optimization in order to determine the necessary real and reactive power flows in a system for a given set of loads, as well as the voltages and currents in the system. Power flow studies are used not only to analyze current power flow situations, but also to plan ahead for anticipated disturbances to the system, such as the loss of a transmission line to maintenance and repairs. The power flow study would determine whether or not the system could continue functioning properly without the transmission line. Only [[computer simulation]] allows the complex handling required in power flow analysis because in most realistic situations the system is very complex and extensive and would be impractical to solve by hand. The Y Matrix is a tool in that domain. It provides a method of systematically reducing a complex system to a matrix than can be solved by a computer program.  The equations used to construct the Y matrix come from the application of Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law to a circuit with steady-state sinusoidal operation. These laws give us that the sum of currents entering a node in the circuit is zero, and the sum of voltages around a closed loop starting and ending at a node is also zero. These principles are applied to all the nodes in a power flow system and thereby determine the elements of the admittance matrix, which represents the admittance relationships between nodes, which then determine the voltages, currents and power flows in the system.


== Construction ==

Starting from the [[One-line diagram|single line diagram]] of a power system, there are three main steps before writing the equations that form the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; Matrix.  First, the single line diagram is converted to an impedance diagram. Next, all voltage sources are converted to their equivalent current source representations. From here, the impedance diagram is then converted to an admittance diagram. Following these three steps, the admittance matrix can be created in a straightforward manner: For an admittance diagram with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; buses, the admittance between the bus in consideration, ''k'', and another bus, ''i'', connected to ''k'', can be described by &lt;math&gt;y_{ik} = g_{ik} + j b_{ik}&lt;/math&gt;. The term &lt;math&gt;y_k&lt;/math&gt; should be introduced here; this term accounts for the admittance of linear loads connected to bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; as well as the admittance-to-ground at bus &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The general mathematical expression follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y_{ij} = \begin{cases}
  y_{i} + \sum_{k=1, 2, \ldots, N \atop k \neq i} {y_{ik}}, &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i = j \\
  -y_{ij},  &amp; \mbox{if} \quad i \neq j
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero only where a physical connection exists between two buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCalley|first1=James|title=The Power Flow Equations|url=http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~jdm/ee458_2011/PowerFlowEquations.pdf|website=Iowa State Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consideration is not seen in the following example because each node is connected to both of the other nodes. Each &lt;math&gt;y_{ki}&lt;/math&gt; defines one element of the &lt;math&gt;N\times{N}&lt;/math&gt; matrix. From the general case where N is greater than 2, it is desirable to solve these equations as a system, namely through matrix algebra. The general matrix appears as follows:
The nodal admittance matrix form:
&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{bmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1n} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2n} \\ 
  \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots \\
  Y_{n1} &amp; Y_{n2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:3 bus network.jpg|400px|thumbnail|The admittance diagram of a three bus network.]]

Once the admittance matrix has been formed, the admittance matrix can be input to solve the matrix form of Ohm's Law--the equation &lt;math&gt;Y*V=I&lt;/math&gt;. In this instance &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of the voltage at each node and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;N\times{1}&lt;/math&gt; vector of corresponding currents. In matrix form, Ohm's Law is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  Y_{11} &amp; Y_{12} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{1N} \\
  Y_{21} &amp; Y_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{2N} \\
  \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots \\
  Y_{NN} &amp; Y_{N2} &amp; \cdots &amp; Y_{NN} \\
\end{pmatrix} *

\begin{pmatrix}
 V_1 \\
 V_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 V_N \\
\end{pmatrix} =

\begin{pmatrix}
 I_1 \\
 I_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 I_N \\
\end{pmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;
To illustrate this process with the admittance matrix of the three bus network in the figure would be:

:&lt;math&gt;
Y = \begin{pmatrix}
  y_{1} + y_{12} + y_{13} &amp; - y_{12} &amp; - y_{13} \\
  -y_{12} &amp; y_{2} + y_{12} + y_{23} &amp; - y_{23} \\
  -y_{13} &amp; - y_{23} &amp; y_{3} + y_{13} + y_{23} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The Y Matrix diagonal elements &lt;math&gt;Y_{11}, Y_{22}, ..., Y_{nn}&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''self-admittances'' at the nodes, and each equals the sum of all the admittances terminating on the node identified by the repeated subscripts. The other admittances are the ''mutual admittances'' of the nodes, and each equals the negative of the sum of all admittances connected directly between the nodes identified by the double subscripts. The admittance matrix &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is typically a [[symmetric matrix]] as &lt;math&gt;y_{mn} = y_{nm}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, extensions of the line model and models of other components such as transformers may make &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; asymmetrical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John |last1=Grainger |year=1994 |title=Power System Analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math |isbn=978-0070612938 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Power-System-Analysis-John-Grainger/dp/0070612935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For small transmission systems of about less than 10 nodes or buses, the Y matrix can be calculated manually. But for a realistic system with relatively large number of nodes or buses, say 1000 nodes, a computer program for computing Y is more practical to use. 

[[File:Node Network.gif|thumb|Node Network Courtesy of scialert.net]]
To help motivate the importance of using a system of equations in matrix form, see the adjacent figure. Not only does it become impractical to calculate the current vector &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; by hand, it becomes necessary to use computational power to form the admittance matrix itself. 


Example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grainger|first1=John|title=Power System Analysis|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math|isbn=978-0070612938|pages=240-241|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two Node Power Flow Diagram.png|thumb|left|Two node power flow diagram courtesy of Grainger and Stevenson]]
To take a look at a generalizable &lt;math&gt;2\times2&lt;/math&gt; matrix, consider the figure of the two-node network. By [[Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_current_law_.28KCL.29|Kirchhoff's Current Law]], it can be shown that :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} * I_a &lt;/math&gt; since there are no other currents entering or exiting nodes &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage drop across the line can be expressed as :&lt;math&gt; V_a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 * -1 \\ \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. Next, use [[Ohm's Law]] with admittance instead of impedance. Using substitution to get :&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} Y_a &amp; -Y_a \\ -Y_a &amp; Y_a \end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix} V_m \\ V_n \\ \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} I_m \\ I_n \\ \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. To reintroduce some generality, &lt;math&gt; Y_{11} = Y_{mm}, Y_{21} = Y_{nm},Y_{12} = Y_{mn},&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Y_{22} = Y_{nn} &lt;/math&gt;. Thus, this example can be taken as a first step in understanding how to generally construct an &lt;math&gt;NxN&lt;/math&gt; matrix by hand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4081">'''Online patient education''', also known as '''online patient engagement''', is a method of providing medical information and education to patients using [[learning management systems]] delivered through the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Evaluation of bariatric Centers of Excellence Web sites for functionality and efficacy. Surg Obes Relat Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;4(5):571-4&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of computer-based instruction and includes web seminars, downloadable materials, interactive learning courses, and audio/visual presentations. Generally, online patient education is supplemented with in-person consultations tailored to each individual.

==General usage==
Health professionals use online patient education to prepare patients for medical procedures, administer intake and informed consent paperwork, educate patients about health conditions, provide information about preventive care, encourage healthy behavior and lifestyle changes, etc. Health insurance companies use online patient education to inform patients about coverage policies. 

Online patient education is gaining popularity as home Internet access becomes more common and medical practices increasingly utilize digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Issues in patient education Journal of Midwifery &amp; Women's Health, Volume 49, Issue 3, Pages 203-209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers in Patient Education. Comput Inform Nurs 21(2):88-96, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Patients either view online patient education programs and materials in a medical office or from their homes or other remote locations with Internet access. Content may include interactive features such as quizzes, live question and answer sessions (in moderated web seminars), and the ability to complete and submit forms.

==Patient education by type==

===On location===
Any education delivered verbally by a healthcare provider to a single patient or group of patients can be considered as On Location patient education. Although this is still the most commonly used patient education method it is time consuming, can have consistency problems, and relies heavily on the individual patient ability to absorb, understand, and retain the verbal information.

===Paper based===
The second most common method. Any information brochure at a healthcare provider office falls under this category. The benefits of printed materials is that patients can refer back to the information

===Web based===
Patient education that is made available by a healthcare provider via his/her website, specific portal, or EHR. Web based education can be provided in an [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] and [[Synchronous learning|Synchronous]] styles.

==Advantages==
Educating patients with online technology can be advantageous&lt;ref&gt;Online patient education: A superior alternative to in-person information seminars Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases, Volume 5, Issue 3, Pages S44-S45&lt;/ref&gt; for both medical practices and patients because it gives health care providers the opportunity to create comprehensive educational materials that are consistently presented, rather than relying on face-to-face meetings in which information is presented by a staff member.&lt;ref&gt;Patients Postoperatively Forget Aspects of Preoperative Patient Education. Obesity Surgery, 15, 2005 1066-1069&lt;/ref&gt; Patients need not possess advanced computer/web skills to use this method of learning. A survey of 3200 patients revealed that even patients who are not computer literate are satisfied with online patient education as means of learning about medical care.

The '''[[Paul Scherrer]] Institute''' (PSI) is a multi-disciplinary research institute which belongs to the [[ETH Domain|Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain]] covering also [[ETH Zurich]] and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. It was established in 1988 through the merger of EIR (''Eidgenössisches Institut für Reaktorforschung'', Federal Institute for Reactor Research, established in 1960) and SIN (''Schweizerisches Institut für Nuklearphysik'', Swiss Institute for Nuclear Physics, established in 1968). It is based in [[Villigen]] and [[Würenlingen]].

The PSI is a multi-disciplinary research centre for the natural sciences and technology. In national and international collaboration with universities, other research institutes and industry, PSI is active in solid-state physics, materials sciences, elementary particle physics, life sciences, nuclear and non-nuclear energy research, and energy-related ecology.

It is the largest Swiss national research institute with about 1,900 members of staff {{asof|2014|lc=y}}, and is the only one of its kind in Switzerland.&lt;ref name=PSI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/facts-and-figures |title=Overview: Facts and figures of the Paul Scherrer Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Paul Scherrer Institute |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PSI is a User Laboratory, offering access to its facilities to researchers affiliated to many different institutions, and it runs several [[particle accelerator]]s. The 590&amp;nbsp;MeV [[cyclotron]], with its 72&amp;nbsp;MeV companion pre-accelerator, is one of them. {{asof|2011}}, it delivers a proton beam of up to 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA, which is the world record for such proton cyclotrons. It drives the spallation neutron source complex. The [[Swiss Light Source]] (SLS), built in 2001, is a [[synchrotron light]] source with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GeV electron [[storage ring]]. It is one of the world's best with respect to electron beam brilliance and stability.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Aerial view of the PSI.jpg|thumb|422px|Aerial view of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psi.ch/media/schweizer-spitzenforschung-allemand]&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt; An X-ray [[free-electron laser]] called [[SwissFEL]] is currently under construction and is slated to begin operation in 2016.&lt;ref name=swissfel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel |title=Overview: SwissFEL – the new large-scale facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Paul Scherrer Institute |accessdate=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917084615/http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel|archive-date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proton accelerators are also used for the [[proton therapy]] program.

Injector 1 is a variable energy cyclotron built by the Dutch company [[Philips]] Gloeilampen-Fabrieken. Its one-piece magnet has an azimuthally varying magnetic field for vertical focusing even at relativistic energies. The beam energy goes up to 72 MeV for protons and 120 MeV Z2/A for ions with charge Z and mass number A. Equipped with several ion sources, Injector 1 offers a wide variety of beams ranging from protons and deuterons to light and heavy ions. Polarized beams of protons and deuterons are also available. In 1994 an ECR ion source was installed to extend its ability to accelerate heavy ions. This machine has been decommissioned on 1 December 2010.

The Injector 2 cyclotron has been built to replace the multiparticle variable energy Injector 1. It provides high intensity, high quality beams of 72&amp;nbsp;MeV protons to be injected into the 590 MeV Ring cyclotron.

The Injector 2 is itself a ring cyclotron, but with 4 sectormagnets and with an extremely low injection energy of 870&amp;nbsp;keV. The 870&amp;nbsp;keV proton beam is achieved by extracting protons from an [[ion source]] with 60&amp;nbsp;kV and additional acceleration of the particles by means of a [[Cockcroft Walton|Cockcroft-Walton]] type accelerator operated at 810&amp;nbsp;kV.

It was put in operation in 1984.

The Ring Cyclotron is a separated sector cyclotron with a fixed beam energy of 590&amp;nbsp;MeV, built by PSI and commissioned in 1974. The 72&amp;nbsp;MeV beam from either one of two injector cyclotron enters from the back of the cyclotron, is injected into an orbit in the center of the Ring, accelerated over about 186 revolutions and extracted at the full energy.

The design is based on criteria that allow operation at very high beam intensities: an open structure of four large and powerful RF-cavities providing a high acceleration voltage, and a flat-top cavity operating at the third harmonic of the accelerating RF-voltage. The resulting strong, phase-independent energy gain per revolution gives good turn separation and hence beam extraction with low beam losses. This is a mandatory condition for high current operation in a cyclotron. Presently, a continuous beam current of 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA at 590&amp;nbsp;MeV can be extracted from the ring cyclotron. This corresponds to a beam power of approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;MW turning the PSI-proton facility into the world's most powerful accelerator complex at the moment.{{When|date=March 2016}}

==Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)==
[[Neutron scattering]] is one of the most effective ways to obtain information on both the structure and the dynamics of condensed matter. A wide scope of problems, ranging from fundamental to solid state physics and chemistry, and from materials science to biology, medicine and environmental science, can be investigated with neutrons. Aside from the scattering techniques, non-diffractive methods like imaging techniques can also be applied with increasing relevance for industrial applications.

The spallation neutron source [http://www.psi.ch/sinq SINQ] is a continuous source – the first of its kind in the world – with a flux of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Beside thermal neutrons, a cold moderator of liquid deuterium (cold source) slows neutrons down and shifts their spectrum to lower energies. These neutrons have proved to be particularly valuable in materials research and in the investigation of biological substances. SINQ is a user facility. Interested groups can apply for beamtime on the various instruments by using the SINQ proposal system.

==Spallation Ultracold Neutron Source (UCN)==

Neutrons from the spallation target are brought to [[Thermal neutron|thermal energies]] by means of a [[heavy water]]. Some of the neutrons are further cooled down to [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energies]] below 300&amp;nbsp;neV by means of a solid [[deuterium]] moderator.&lt;ref&gt;http://ucn.web.psi.ch/posters/UCN-Source08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucn.web.psi.ch/ucn_source_project.htm |title=UCN Home Page |publisher=Ucn.web.psi.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ultra cold neutrons are used by the nEDM experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nedm.web.psi.ch/ |title=EDM Home Page |publisher=Nedm.web.psi.ch |date=2001-09-12 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe the [[Neutron electric dipole moment]] at scales below the current upper limit

==Swiss Light Source (SLS)==

{{main|Swiss Light Source}}

{{wide image|Panorama sls.jpg|1000px|Panorama of the [[Swiss Light Source]]}}

==Swiss Muon Source (SμS)==

Thanks to the high proton current (2200&amp;nbsp;μA), the Swiss Muon Source is the world's most intense continuous beam muon source today.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) :: Large Scale Facilities {{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429220301/http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}, retrieved 2011-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main applications of these intense muon beams is [[Muon spin spectroscopy]]. [[Mu to E Gamma]] and [[Mu3e]] use the beam as well.

== Proton Therapy Programme ==
Since 1984 PSI operates the OPTIS facility for treatment of eye tumours. It was the first such installation in Western Europe, developed by PSI physicists. In close cooperation with the 'Hôpital Opthalmique' of the University of Lausanne by March 2008 nearly 5000 patients have been treated at PSI with this unique method, in which a proton beam is directed accurately onto the eye tumour.

Since 1996 PSI has also operated the only compact scanning gantry in the world for proton radiation therapy of deep-seated tumours. The spot-scanning technique developed at PSI enables malignant tumours to be targeted with high precision deep inside in the body, and their growth successfully stopped, without damaging healthy tissue around the target area. By March 2008, 320 patients, suffering from brain, head and neck, skull-base, spinal cord or abdominal tumours, had been treated at Gantry 1.

The excellent and promising results of patient treatment have led to the (Project [http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/proscan.html PROSCAN]) with the objectives to install a dedicated and compact [[superconducting]] proton accelerator
and to develop a new Gantry ([http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/forschung.html Gantry 2]) with advanced 2-dimensional and fast parallel scanning features. The new compact superconducting cyclotron has been in operation since February 2007, and patient treatment at Gantry 2 began in November 2013. With these expansions, PSI is able to offer year-round treatment at its Center for Proton Therapy (CPT). {{asof|2015}}, work is ongoing on a third gantry with a similar specification to Gantry 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psi.ch/protontherapy/proton-therapy-at-psi |title= Proton Therapy at PSI |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of these developments are to increase radiation precision of even moving tumours and to transfer the knowledge and proton therapy technology into hospital-based projects.

With the expansion of the facility, PSI will be able to strengthen the clinical research program and to treat more than 500 patients per year, including those with eye tumours.

==Heartland Institute incident==

On February 20, 2012, Gleick announced he was responsible for the unauthorized distribution of [[The Heartland Institute#February 2012 document misappropriation|documents]] from [[The Heartland Institute]] in mid-February. Gleick reported he had received "an anonymous document in the mail describing what appeared to be details of the Heartland Institute's climate program strategy", and in trying to verify the authenticity of the document, had "solicited and received additional materials directly from the Heartland Institute under someone else's name".&lt;ref name="gleick120220"&gt;Gleick, P.H., [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-h-gleick/-the-origin-of-the-heartl_b_1289669.html "The Origin of the Heartland Documents"], 2012-02-20, [[Huffington Post]].&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to the leak, The Heartland Institute said one of the documents released, a two-page 'Strategy Memo', had been forged.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.02.15"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillis|first=Justin|last2=Kaufman|first2=Leslie|title=Leak Offers Glimpse of Campaign Against Climate Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/science/earth/in-heartland-institute-leak-a-plan-to-discredit-climate-teaching.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gleick denied forging the document. Gleick described his actions as "a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics" and said that he "deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case" and "offer[ed his] personal apologies to all those affected". He stated that "My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts – often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated – to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved."&lt;ref name=gleick120220/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/science/earth/activist-says-heartland-climate-papers-obtained-by-deceit.html "Activist Says He Lied to Obtain Climate Papers"], ''New York Times'', published February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a "temporary short-term leave of absence" from the Institute.&lt;ref name='PIleave'&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldenberg | first = Suzanne | title = Peter Gleick on leave from Pacific Institute over Heartland leak | date = 2012-02-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/25/peter-gleick-leave-pacific-institute-heartland-leak | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20040326 "Peter Gleick requests short-term leave of absence from Oakland's Pacific Institute"], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Feb 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors stated it was "deeply concerned regarding recent events" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/statement.html Pacific Institute Board of Directors statement], Feb 27, 2012.

It was subsequently replaced by the Feb 27, 2012 statement.&lt;/ref&gt; Gleick was reinstated following an investigation, in which the institute found no evidence to support charges of forgery and "supported what Dr. Gleick has stated publicly regarding his interaction with the Heartland Institute."&lt;ref name='PIreinstate'&gt;{{cite news | first = Suzanne | last = Goldenberg | title = Peter Gleick reinstated by Pacific Institute following Heartland exposé | date = 2012-06-07 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/07/peter-gleick-reinstated-heartland-expose | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title = Pacific Institute Board of Directors Statement | url = http://pacinst.org/news/379/ | date = June 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">The '''phyllochron''' is the intervening period between the sequential emergence of [[leaf|leaves]] on the main [[plant stem|stem]] of a [[plant]], also rendered as ''leaf appearance&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. This measurement is used by [[botany|botanists]] and [[agronomy|agronomists]] to describe the growth and [[plant development|development of plants]], especially [[cereals]]. The term phyllochron was first described in 1966.&lt;ref name=Bunting1966 /&gt; The interval between leaf appearances can be recorded in both standard measurements of [[time]] as well as thermal time (e.g. [[Growing degree-day|growing degree units]]).&lt;ref name=Wilhelm1995 /&gt; One [[Phytomer|phytomer unit]] is added over the course of one phyllochron. No significantly robust equation to predict phyllochrons has been developed.&lt;ref name=McMaster2005 /&gt;

Increases in phyllochron in cereals correlates with growing degree units in a slightly [[nonlinear regression|curvilinear]] fashion.&lt;ref name=McMaster1997 /&gt; In all cultivars of cereals, fluctuations in [[temperature]] are the primary factor that affects the length of the phyllochron.&lt;ref name=McMaster2005 /&gt; Less important secondary factors emerge in a number of different and sometimes contradictory studies on phyllochron response to variation in light, [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] level, [[irrigation]], [[nitrogen]] availability, [[salinity]], [[Soil#Physical properties of soils|soil properties]], planting depth, planting time, and [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=McMaster2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McMaster1997 /&gt; In [[cereals]], the phyllochron may vary in speed between the main stem and the [[Tiller (botany)|tillers]].&lt;ref name=McMaster1997 /&gt; The phyllochron may or may not be equal to the length of time taken for one leaf to grow.&lt;ref name=Wilhelm1995 /&gt; It is more accurate to determine the value in a laboratory study than in the field,&lt;ref name=Singh2010/&gt; as field studies have not always noted the non-linear relationship of temperature and leaf appearance.&lt;ref name=McMaster2005 /&gt;

'''Shape grammars''' in computation are a specific class of [[production system (computer science)|production system]]s that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. The foundation of shape grammars has been defined in a seminal article by [[George Stiny]] and [[James Gips]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="stiny1972"&gt;Stiny, G. &amp; Gips, J. (1972). Shape grammars and the generative specification of painting and sculpture. In Information Processing 71, 1460–1465. North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A shape grammar consists of ''shape rules'' and a ''generation engine'' that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the ''Left-Hand Side'' (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the ''Right-Hand Side'' (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a ''start rule'', at least one transformation rule, and a ''termination rule''. The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars a major respect: the production rules may be applied serially (as with Chomsky grammars) or in parallel (not allowed in [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky grammars]]), similar to the way "productions" are done in [[L-System]]s.

A shape grammar system additionally has a working area where the created geometry is displayed. The generation engine checks the existing geometry, often referred to as ''Current Working Shape'' (CWS), for conditions that match the LHS of the shape rules. Shape rules with matching LHS are eligible for use. If more than one rule applies, the generation engine has to choose which rule to apply. In the alternative scenario, the engine first chooses one of the grammar rules and then tries to find all matches of the LHS of this rule in the CWS. If there are several matches, the engine can (depending on its configuration/implementation)
*apply the rule to all matches in parallel, 
*apply the rule to all matches serially (which might lead to inconsistencies) or 
*choose one of the detected matches and apply the rule to only this match.

Shape grammars are most useful when confined to a small, well-defined generation problem such as housing layouts and structure refinement. Because shape rules typically are defined on small shapes, a shape grammar can quickly contain a lot of rules. The palladian villas shape grammar presented by William Mitchell&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. (1990). The Logic of Architecture. MIT Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; for example contains 69 rules, that are applied throughout eight stages.

'''Parametric shape grammars''' are an extension of shape grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Stiny, G. (1980). Introduction to shape and shape grammars. Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 7(3), 343-351.&lt;/ref&gt; The new shape in the RHS of the shape rule is defined by [[parameter]]s so that it can take into account more of the context of the already existing shapes. This typically affects internal proportions of the new shape so that a greater variety of forms can be created. In this way, attempts are made to make shape grammars respond to structural conditions, for example the width of beams in roof structures which depends on span.

Despite their popularity and applicability in academic circles, shape grammars have not found widespread use in generic [[Computer Aided Design]] applications.

==Applications==
Shape grammars were originally presented for painting and sculpture&lt;ref name="stiny1972" /&gt; but have been studied in particular in architecture ([[computer-aided architectural design]]), as they provide a formalism to create new designs. Other important domains shape grammars have been applied in are decorative arts, industrial design and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, J. (2001). Engineering Shape Grammars: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going?. In: Antonsson, E. K. &amp; Cagan, J. (eds). Formal Engineering Design Synthesis. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Supine and prone 2012-02-20.jpg|thumb|Supine position and [[prone position]]]]
The '''supine position''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|p|aɪ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|p|aɪ|n}}) means lying horizontally with the face and torso facing up, as opposed to the [[prone position]], which is face down. When used in surgical procedures, it allows access to the [[peritoneal]], [[thoracic]] and [[pericardium|pericardial]] regions; as well as the head, neck and extremities.&lt;ref&gt;Rothrock, J. C. (2007) ''Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery 13th Ed.'' Mobsy Elsevier: St Louis, Missouri. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[anatomical terms of location]], the dorsal side is down, and the ventral side is up, when supine.

== Semi-supine ==
In scientific literature "semi-supine" commonly refers to positions where the upper body is tilted (at 45° or variations) and not completely horizontal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16869446 |year=2006 |last1=Petropoulou |first1=E |last2=Lancellotti |first2=P |last3=Piérard |first3=LA |title=Quantitative analysis of semi-supine exercise echocardiography--influence of age on myocardial Doppler imaging indices |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=271–7 |journal=Acta Cardiologica |doi=10.2143/ac.61.3.2014827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to sudden infant death syndrome ==
{{main|Sudden infant death syndrome}}
The decline in death due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is said to be attributable to having babies sleep in the supine position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcarelli|first1=Rebekah|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Could Be Prevented By Making Sure Baby Sleeps On Back|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/30403/20140503/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-could-be-prevented-by-making-sure-infant-sleeps-on-back.htm|website=hngn.com|publisher=Headlines &amp; Global News|accessdate=25 March 2016|date=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that in the prone position babies are more at risk to re-breathe their own [[carbon dioxide]]. Because of the immature state of their [[central chemoreceptors]], infants do not respond to the subsequent [[respiratory acidosis]] that develops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=L'Hoir MP, Engelberts AC, van Well GT, McClelland S, Westers P, Dandachli T, Mellenbergh GJ, Wolters WH, Huber J | title = Risk and preventive factors for cot death in The Netherlands, a low-incidence country | journal = Eur.

== Obstructive sleep apnea ==
[[Obstructive sleep apnea]] (OSA) is a form of [[sleep apnea]] that occurs more frequently and is most severe when individuals are sleeping in the supine position. Studies and evidence show that OSA related to sleeping in the supine position is related to the [[Airway management|airway positioning]], reduced [[lung volume]], and the inability of [[airway]] muscles to dilate enough to compensate as the airway collapses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joosten|first=Simon A.|last2=O'Driscoll|first2=Denise M.|last3=Berger|first3=Philip J.|last4=Hamilton|first4=Garun S.|date=2014-02-01|title=Supine position related obstructive sleep apnea in adults: pathogenesis and treatment|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=18|issue=1|pages=7–17|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2013.01.005|issn=1532-2955|pmid=23669094}}&lt;/ref&gt; With individuals who have OSA, many [[health care providers]] encourage their [[patients]] to avoid the supine position while asleep and sleep [[Lateral (anatomy)|laterally]] or sleep with the head of their bed up in a 30 or 45 degree angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuomilehto|first=Henri|last2=Seppä|first2=Juha|last3=Partinen|first3=Markku|last4=Uusitupa|first4=Matti|date=2009-07-01|title=Avoiding the Supine Posture during Sleep for Patients with Mild Obstructive Sleep Apnea|url=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/ajrccm.180.1.101a|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=180|issue=1|pages=101–102|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.180.1.101a|issn=1073-449X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5893">'''Toehold mediated strand displacement (TMSD)''' is an enzyme-free molecular tool to exchange one strand of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] (output) with another strand (input). It is based on the hybridization of two complementary strands of DNA or RNA via Watson-Crick base pairing (A-T/U and C-G) and makes use of a process called [[branch migration]]  &lt;ref name=Yurke2000 &gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yurke |first1=Bernard |title=A DNA-fuelled molecular machine made of DNA |journal=Nature |date=2000 |volume=406 |issue=6796 |page=605}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although [[branch migration]] has been known to the scientific community since the 1970s, TMSD has not been introduced to the field of DNA nanotechnology until 2000 when Yurke et al. was the first who took advantage of TMSD &lt;ref name=Yurke2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guo2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guo |first1=Yijun |last2=Wei |first2=Bing |last3=Xiao |first3=Shiyan |last4=Yao |first4=Dongbao |last5=Li |first5=Hui |last6=Xu |first6=Huaguo |last7=Song |first7=Tingjie |last8=Li |first8=Xiang |last9=Liang |first9=Haojun |title=Recent advances in molecular machines based on toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction |journal=Quantitative Biology |date=2017 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=25-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He used the technique to open and close a set of DNA tweezers made of two DNA helices using an auxiliary strand of DNA as fuel &lt;ref name=Yurke2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidYu2011 /&gt;. Since its first use, the technique has been modified for the construction of autonomous molecular motors, catalytic amplifiers, reprogrammable DNA nanostructures and [[Molecular logic gate|molecular logic gates]] &lt;ref name=DavidYu2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=David Yu |last2=Seelig |first2=Georg |title=Dynamic DNA nanotechnology using strand-displacement reactions |journal=Nature Chemistry |date=2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidYu2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=David Yu |last2=Winfree |first2=Erik |title=Control of DNA strand displacement kinetics using toehold exchange |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=2009 |volume=131 |issue=47 |pages=17303–17314}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has also been used in conjunction with RNA for the production of kinetically-controlled ribosensors &lt;ref name="Burke2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Cassandra R |last2=Sparkman- Yager |first2=David |last3=Carothers |first3=James M |title=Multi-state design of kinetically-controlled RNA aptamer ribosensors |url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/11/03/213538.full.pdf |website=bioRxiv |publisher=bioRxiv |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. TMSD starts with a double-stranded DNA complex composed of the original strand and the protector strand &lt;ref name=Guo2017 /&gt;. The original strand has an overhanging region the so-called “toehold” which is complementary to a third strand of DNA referred to as the “invading strand”. The invading strand is a sequence of [[single-stranded DNA]] (ssDNA) which is complementary to the original strand &lt;ref name=DavidYu2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Guo2017 /&gt;. The toehold regions initiate the process of TMSD by allowing the complementary invading strand to hybridize with the original strand, creating a DNA complex composed of three strands of DNA &lt;ref name=DavidYu2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yurke |first1=Bernard |last2=Millis |first2=Allen P |title=Using DNA to power nanostructures |journal=Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines |date=2003 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=111–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This initial endothermic step is rate limiting &lt;ref name=Yurke2000 /&gt; and can be tuned by varying the strength (length and sequence composition e.g. G-C or A-T rich strands) of the toehold region &lt;ref name=DavidYu2011 /&gt;. The ability to tune the rate of strand displacement over a range of 6 orders of magnitude generates the backbone of this technique and allows the kinetic control of DNA or RNA devices &lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;. 
After the binding of the invading strand and the original strand occurred, [[branch migration]] of the invading domain then allows the displacement of the initial hybridized strand (protector strand)  &lt;ref name=Yurke2000 /&gt;. The protector strand can possess its own unique toehold and can, therefore, turn into an invading strand itself, starting a [[DNA nanotechnology#Strand displacement cascades|strand-displacement cascade]]  &lt;ref name=Guo2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=David Yu |title=Engineering entropy-driven reactions and networks catalyzed by DNA |journal=Science |date=2007 |volume=318 |issue=5853 |pages=1121–1125}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The whole process is energetically favored and although a reverse reaction can occur its rate is up to 6 orders of magnitude slower &lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;. 
Additional control over the system of toehold mediated strand displacement can be introduced by toehold sequestering &lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;.

== Toehold sequestering ==
Toehold sequestering is a technique to “mask” the toehold region, rendering its accessibility.&lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DavidYu2011 /&gt;. There are several ways to do so but the most common approaches are hybridizing the toehold with a complementary strand &lt;ref name="Zhang2007" /&gt; or by designing the toehold region to form a [[Stem-loop|hairpin loop]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Simon J |last2=Lubrich |first2=Daniel |last3=Turberfield |first3=Andrew J |title=DNA hairpins: fuel for autonomous DNA devices |journal=Biophysical Journal |date=2006 |volume=91 |issue=8 |pages=2966–2975}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Masking and unmasking of the toehold domains together with the ability to precisely control the kinetics of the reaction makes toehold mediated strand displacement a valuable tool in the field of [[DNA nanotechnology|DNA nanotechnology ]]&lt;ref name=DavidYu2009 /&gt;.
