      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6653">The '''Art dans Tout''' movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Felix Aubert, Art dans Tout, and Art Nouveau Lace|jstor = 40662780|journal = Studies in the Decorative Arts|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 37–76|volume = 8|issue = 2|first = ROSSELLA|last = FROISSART-PEZONE|first2 = Richard|last2 = Wittman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer [[Félix Aubert]], sculptor and craftsman [[Alexandre Charpentier]], sculptor and medalist [[Jean Dampt]], sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect [[Charles Plumet]], it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter [[Étienne Moreau-Nélaton]] and architect and decorator [[Tony Selmersheim]]. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: A Research Guide for Design Reform in France, Belgium, England, and the United States|last = Weisberg|first = Gabriel P.|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = 184, 238|last2 = Menon|first2 = Elizabeth K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jules Desbois, a sculptor, [[Paul Follot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ketterer Kunst,  Art auctions, Book auctions Munich, Hamburg &amp; Berlin|url = http://www.kettererkunst.com/bio/paul-follot-1877.php|website = www.kettererkunst.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, [[Henri Sauvage]], an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.&lt;ref name="Arwas"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Art Nouveau: The French Aesthetic|last = Arwas|first = Victor|publisher = Papadakis Publisher|year = 2002|isbn = 9781901092370|location = |pages = 321, 616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Historical context ==

With the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc]]. Followers of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]] believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger [[Art Nouveau]] style.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'ART DANS TOUT - Les arts décoratifs en France et l'utopie d'un Art nouveau|last=Froissart Pezone|first=Rossella|publisher=CNRS Éditions|year=2005|isbn=9782271062819|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Décoration &amp; Le Rationalisme Architecturaux a L'Exposition Universelle|last = Clausen|first = M. L.|publisher = Brill Archive|year = 1987|isbn = 9789004078796|location = |pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Les Cinq ==
Les Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Les Six ==
In December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.

== Art dans Tout ==
The group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Post-group activities ==

Although the group disbanded in 1901 due to financial issues, and an inability to convince major furniture manufacturers to use their designs, several group members continued to collaborate, notably Plumet and Selmersheim.&lt;ref name="Arwas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = L'utopie de l'art pour tous {{!}} L'Histoire|url = http://www.histoire.presse.fr/actualite/infos/l-utopie-de-l-art-pour-tous-01-06-2005-6471|website = www.histoire.presse.fr|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bette Korber''' is an American [[computational biologist]] focusing on the molecular biology and population genetics of the [[HIV virus]] that causes infection and eventually AIDS. She has contributed heavily to efforts to obtain an effective HIV vaccine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Bette Korber created a database at Los Alamos National Laboratory that has enabled her to design novel mosaic HIV vaccines, one of which is currently in human testing in Africa.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  The database contains thousands of  HIV genome sequences and related data.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Bette Korber grew up in Southern California and received the BS in Chemistry in 1981 from [[California State University, Long Beach]], where her father was a sociology professor, her mother graduated in nursing, and her sister graduated in journalism.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/alumni/|title=2001 Distinguished Alumna Bette Korber|last=|first=|date=|website=California State University at Long Beach|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1981 to 1988, she was in the graduate program at [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technolog]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y, where she worked with [[Iwona Stroynowski]] in [[Leroy Hood]]'s laboratory&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  receiving her PhD in Chemistry in 1988.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Her work focused on regulation of the expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex Type 1 genes, producing cell surface proteins that participate in the [[Transplant rejection|rejection]] of tissue transplants, by [[Interferon]] induced by virus infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=B.

== Research ==
[[File:HIV Release.jpg|thumb|HIV Release from Infected Cell]]
Bette Korber conducts her research at Los Alamos National Laboratory where she began in 1990.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Her approach involves applying computational biology to the design of a [[vaccine]] against [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] virus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  She first became interested in HIV when a close friend of Korber's and her fiancé's at California Institute of Technology contracted one of the first cases of AIDS in Pasadena, CA.  She said,“We learned a lot about HIV while he was sick. But there was no treatment for him and he died in 1991. I decided when I graduated from my PhD program that I wanted to work on HIV.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation|last=McEnerny|first=R.|date=2010|title=Tracking HIV Evolution|work=IAVI Report|volume=14|issue=3|pages=4–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later, looking back on this event, she described its effects this way: “I ''hate'' HIV,” she says, .... “I lost a couple friends to it. HIV kills in horrible ways. I think of what the epidemic has done to Africa and it motivates me.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:HIV-SIV-phylogenetic-tree1.svg|thumb|Phylogenetic Tree Showing HIV compared to SIV]]

=== HIV database ===
Korber oversees the HIV [[Database]] and Analysis Project at Los Alamos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She and her team have built a global HIV database of over 840,000 sequences from publications of the viral genome.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswise.com/articles/promising-los-alamos-innovations-take-the-spotlight-|title=Promising Los Alamos Innovations Take the Spotlight: Bette Korber receives 2018 Richard P Feynman Innovation Award for HIV vaccine designs|last=|first=|date=|website=Newswise Los Alamos|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the database focuses on the small regions (called [[epitope]]s) within the virus that can be recognized by [[antibodies]], and evaluates the evidence for the strength of each epitope in eliciting immune responses.  Also, there are data on the immunological profiles of individuals resistant to HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She and many other researchers have applied the data to devise possible treatments and vaccines against HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her work has resulted in design of vaccines now being tested in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== HIV vaccine design ===
Creating a vaccine against HIV has been challenging because the virus [[Mutation|mutates]] rapidly, creating multiple variants that may not be recognized by immune system components specific to the original infecting virus.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/lanl-biologist-cautiously-optimistic-about-hiv-vaccine/article_0e0a6c0d-e98c-5df8-879b-ef11f710de8b.html|title=LANL biologist 'cautiously' optimistic about HIV vaccine|last=Edge|first=S.|date=December 2, 2017|website=Santa Fe New Mexican|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most variable region is the surface of the virus but there is also some variation of the internal proteins involved in virus replication, which may be attacked by the [[Cell-mediated immunity|cellular immunity]] system or [[T cell]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korber|first1=B.|last2=Levin|first2=N.|last3=Haynes|first3=B.|date=2009|title=T-cell vaccine strategies for human immunodeficiency virus, the virus with a thousand faces|journal=Journal of Virology|volume=83|issue=17|pages=8306–8314}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent approach that Korber and collaborators have taken is to design mosaic antigens.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Bette Korber developed a novel mosaic HIV vaccine that may slow or prevent HIV infection and is currently in human testing in Africa.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The goal of the mosaic antigen vaccine is to protect the vaccinated person against the great variety of HIV variants encountered.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Since the proteins of HIV vary so much, mosaic test proteins are designed to represent the most common forms of HIV-1 virus that can be recognized by antibodies or cellular immune responses (epitopes).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.ornl.gov/info/news/pulse/no401/feature.shtml|title="New global HIV vaccine design shows promise in monkeys"|last=|first=|date=November 18, 2018|website=DOE (Department of Energy) Pulse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Korber described the process this way, “I create sort of little Frankenstein proteins that look and feel like HIV proteins but they don’t exist in nature.” &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Sainani|first=K.|date=2009|title=Evolution and HIV: Using computational phylogenetics to close in on a killer|publisher=Symbios, the NIH National Center for Physics-based Simulation of Biological Structures|magazine=Biomedical Computation Review|pages=20–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the major variations are included in each molecule of protein, thus producing a variant protein antigen that probably doesn't exist in the wild virus population but should cross react with variants that do exist.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Korber has taken two different approaches to designing such antigens.  Her group has developed a [[computer algorithm]] to choose epitopes to combine into a mosaic molecule for the mosaic antigens.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33987|title=Epigraph: A vaccine design tool applied to an HIV therapeutic vaccine and a pan-filovirus vaccine|last1=Theiler|first1=J.|last2=Yoon|first2=H.|last3=Yusim|first3=K.|last4=Picker|first4=L. J.|last5=Fruh|first5=K.|last6=Korber|first6=B.|date=October 5, 2016|website=Nature Scientific Reports|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she described a designed mosaic protein this way, "People didn’t know if it would fold properly, if it would be antigenic, or if it would have the same sites that recognized by killer T cells."  They found that the newly designed antigens did fold properly and acted as a strong antigen and were recognized by the [[cytotoxic T cell]]s (killer cells).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Also, Korber and her collaborators have developed a graphical analysis called Epigraph that can generate promising antigens with a mixture of epitopes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Korber explains that the approach of designing a protein via computer, combining bits of known proteins that provoke immune responses, had never been tried.  She says, “Even after it worked, it was hard to convince people that this novel thing could be a vaccine because it hadn’t been done before.” &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In collaboration with Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], some of these antigens have been tested in [[monkey]]s as possible vaccines.  With one series of tests, Barouch checked a number of possible ways to deliver the virus genes and chose to use the common cold virus as a vehicle.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The tested mosaic vaccine routinely slowed monkey infection with the closely related virus SIV, and for 66% of monkeys exposed multiple times, no infection resulted.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Next, in collaboration with the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies]] (a division of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]), and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]],  the researchers tested a mosaic vaccine for safety in human subjects; it passed that test too.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In 2017, the group of collaborators announced a human efficiency test with that safe mosaic protein preparation, vaccinating 2,600 women in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub Saharan Africa]], who will be examined for several years to show how efficiently, if at all, the virus interferes with infection.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Korber cautioned that effectiveness of this strategy in monkeys is not a guarantee that a human vaccine will work.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In recognition of her research, Korber received the 2018 Feynman Award for Innovation, the first woman at Los Alamos National Laboratory to receive one.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lanl.gov/discover/news-stories-archive/2018/March/0322-history-of-women.php|title=A short history of women at Los Alamos|last=|first=|date=March 22, 2018|website=Los Alamos National Laboratory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled that at CalTech when few women were there, she took a class with physicist [[Richard Feynman]] and became friends with him. She said, "'At a time when kindness seemed rare, I really appreciated his generous spirit and encouragement. I think he would have been pleased about this award.'”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Origin of HIV-1 ===
In the [[history of HIV/AIDS]] virus with regard to when and where HIV originated, [[Edward Hooper (journalist)|Edward Hooper]] had postulated in a best-selling book called ''The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS'' in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hooper|first=E.|year=1999|title=The River: A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|location=Boston, New York, and London|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; that HIV could have jumped from chimpanzees to humans because of an accidental contamination by chimpanzee Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) of the oral polio vaccine (CHAT) used in Africa in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hooper|first=E.|date=2003|title=AIDS and the polio vaccine: Edward Hopper finds new evidence|journal=London Review of Books|volume=25|issue=7|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bette Korber and her colleagues employed the Los Alamos National Laboratory database's [[Genomics|genomic]] data to calculate when the HIV [[Molecular evolution|sequence evolution]] began, using a model of evolution based on the mutation rate of HIV strains and assuming that variable was the same on all branches of the evolutionary tree, and in 2000 they published an estimate of approximately 1930 for the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/10/the-hunt-for-the-origin-of-aids/306490/|title=The hunt for the origin of AIDS|last=Cohen|first=J.|date=October 2000|website=The Atlantic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their research was covered widely as establishing a new date for the origin of the human virus, [[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories|discrediting the oral polio virus theory]], and therefore refuting concerns about using oral polio vaccine ([[OPV AIDS hypothesis|OPV)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/02/scientists-find-origin-of-aids/|title=Scientists find origin of AIDS|last=|first=|date=February 1, 2000|website=Wired|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/02/us/aids-virus-originated-around-1930-study-says.html|title=AIDS Virus Originated Around 1930, Study Says|last=Altman|first=L.|date=February 2, 2000|website=New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/02/news/mn-60177|title=HIV Crossed to Humans 70 Years Ago, Analysis Says|last=Maugh II|first=T.|date=February 2, 2000|website=Los Angeles Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/2000-02/02/006r-020200-idx.html?noredirect=on|title=Theories on AIDS origin argued|last=Brown|first=D.|date=February 2, 2000|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/288/5472/1757|title=Origins of HIV|last=Hillis|first=D.|date=June 9, 2000|website=Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two concepts of the origin of this virus plus other related theories continued to compete for scientific credibility.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/virus/origins.html|title=Theories of HIV Origins|last=Carmichael|first=M.|date=May 30, 2006|website=WGBH educational foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Worobey and collaborators used a computer modeling approach similar to Korber's but with a relaxed evolutionary model and two older samples, collected earlier than any genomes included in Korber's study, and found an origin date for HIV of approximately 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worobey|first1=M.|last2=Gemmel|first2=M.|last3=Teuwen|first3=D.|last4=Haselkorn|first4=T.|last5=Kunstman|first5=K.|last6=Bunce|first6=M.|last7=Muyembe|first7=J.|last8=Kabongo|first8=J.|last9=Kalengayi|first9=R.|last10=Van Marck|first10=E.|last11=Gilbert|first11=M.

== Personal life ==
Bette Korber married James Theiler in 1988.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They have two sons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Out of her concern for the impact of AIDS on those with few financial resources, Korber contributed $50,000 from her EO Lawrence Award to help establish, along with family and friends, an AIDS orphanage in [[South Africa]], working through Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has joined the Board of NOAH.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.noahorphans.org/meet-our-board|title=Meet Our Board: Dr. Bette Korber, Director|last=|first=|date=|website=Nurturing Orphans of AIDS for Humanity (NOAH) website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also contributed to the distribution of Earth Boxes of maintenance-free portable gardens to orphanages, clinics, and schools in Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5225">'''Biblical grammarians''' were linguists whose understanding of the [[Bible]] at least partially related to the science of [[Hebrew language]]. [[Tannaitic]] and Ammoraic [[exegesis]] rarely toiled in [[grammatical]] problems; grammar was a borrowed science from the [[Arab world]] in the [[medieval period]]. Despite its foreign influence, however, [[Hebrew grammar]] was a strongly [[Jewish]] product and developed independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have continued to study grammar throughout the ages, until the present. Those mentioned in this article are a few of the most eminent grammarians.

== Early influences ==
=== Masoretes ===
The [[Masoretes]], who solidified the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], vocalized and punctuated the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the work of the Masoretes is generally anonymous, though we know several names of Masoretes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While their work essentially focused on establishing the correct text and not the principles of grammar, the Masoretes contributed to the future study of biblical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many future grammarians continued the efforts of the Masorah and gave it a “central place in their works.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval grammarians ==
=== Saadia Ga’on ===
Saadia Ga’on dealt with [[inflections]] and roots in his grammatical work. These contributions laid essential foundations for future grammarians. He also wrote about exceptions. His contemporary, [[Menahem ben Saruk]], elaborated upon the study of roots, and was also the first grammarian to write in Hebrew. A pupil of Saadia’s, [[Dunash ben Labrat]], criticized both [[Menahem]] and Saadia’s works but made many important contributions to understanding roots. Defenses of both sides by scholars such as Rabben Tam and ibn Ezra continued for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rashi ===
[[Rashi]]'s commentary attempted to explain the simple meaning of the biblical text. In many places in his commentary, Rashi explains a linguistic or grammatical rule, providing several examples of other places in which that rule applies. Many of his principles he derives from the work of Menahem and Dunash. Evidence shows that Rashi understood the difference between [[biblical Hebrew]] and [[rabbinic Hebrew]]. Rashi also utilized [[Old French]] to explain the meaning of words that could not be otherwise explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Rashi"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abraham ibn Ezra ===
In his introduction to the [[Pentateuch]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] writes that his commentary is “bound by the cords of grammar.” The way to appreciating the text is to understand the simple meaning, and he opposed explanations of the text that do not explain the original intent. Generally, he limited applying predecessors’ laws to understanding the text and avoided outlandish explanations of exceptions. A specific opposition ibn Ezra had was to the explanation of “plene versus defective spelling.” The Spanish commentator also wrote several grammatical works outside his biblical commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Ibn Ezra, Abraham"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Joseph Kimhi ===
[[Joseph Kimhi]] of the 12th century composed Sefer Zikkaron, introducing a new understanding of vowels. His two sons, Moses and David, also were grammarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimhis were exegets who relied most on [[peshat]] and avoided homileteical interpretations, and especially for David, [[philology]] played a large role in that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Kimhi, David"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern grammarians ==
=== The ''maskilim'' ===
The ''maskilim'' abandoned the use of rabbinic Hebrew and returned to biblical Hebrew. They felt serious grammar was of major import for modernization. [[Naphtali Herz Wessely]] and Judah Leib Ben Ze’ev were major perpetrators of this movement of Hebrew, which may have led to modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Hebrew Language"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study of Hebrew grammar had been neglected for nearly two centuries until the arrival of Moses Mendelssohn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5325">'''BioPAX''' (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]-based
standard language to represent [[biological pathway]]s
at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data.
Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but
its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid
interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many
databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this
problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.
BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and
gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,
millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a
growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a
computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.

It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. [[Reactome]]) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]].

==Governance and development==

The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups.

[[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]] is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and [[systems biology]] terms (such as [[Systems Biology Ontology]]). SBPAX export has been implemented by the [[biological pathway|pathway]] databases [[Signaling Gateway (website)#Molecule Pages Database|Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages]]&lt;ref name="pmid21505029"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SABIO-Reaction Kinetics Database]]. SBPAX import has been implemented by the cellular modeling framework [[Virtual Cell]].

They often contain expansive amounts of [[Cellular material|base cell material]] that can be utilized for various projects. Cell banks can be used to generate detailed characterizations of cell lines and can also help mitigate [[Cell culture#Cell line cross-contamination|cross-contamination]] of a [[cell line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Novel vaccination strategies |last=Kaufmann |first=Stefan H.E. |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location= |isbn= |page=283 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eH950PyUQYC&amp;pg=PA283&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing cell banks also reduces the cost of cell culture processes, providing a cost-efficient alternative to keeping cells in culture constantly. Cell banks are commonly used within fields including stem cell research and pharmaceuticals, with [[cryopreservation]] being the traditional method of keeping cellular material intact.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harel|first=Adrian|date=2013-02-13|title=Cryopreservation and Cell Banking for Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapies|url=http://la-press.com/cryopreservation-and-cell-banking-for-autologous-mesenchymal-stem-cell-article-a3541|journal=Cell &amp; Tissue Transplantation &amp; Therapy|language=en|volume=2013|issue=5|doi=10.4137/CTTT.S11249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell banks also effectively reduce the frequency of a cell sample diversifying from natural cell divisions over time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atcc.org/~/media/PDFs/Technical%20Bulletins/tb03.ashx "Cryogenic Storage of Animal Cells"]. 2010. Retrieved March 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
Before putting the donated cell lines into storage, they are first [[Cell proliferation|proliferated]] and multiplied into a large number of identical cells before being stored in a number of [[Vial|cryovials]].  Along with the cells, cryoprotection agents are also added to the vials to protect the cells from rupturing from ice crystals during the freezing process. 10% DMSO solution is a common cryoprotection agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Rosa|first=Alfredo|last2=De Francesco|first2=Francesco|last3=Tirino|first3=Virginia|last4=Ferraro|first4=Giuseppe A.|last5=Desiderio|first5=Vincenzo|last6=Paino|first6=Francesca|last7=Pirozzi|first7=Giuseppe|last8=D'Andrea|first8=Francesco|last9=Papaccio|first9=Gianpaolo|date=2009-03-02|title=A New Method for Cryopreserving Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: An Attractive and Suitable Large-Scale and Long-Term Cell Banking Technology|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0674|journal=Tissue Engineering Part C: Methods|volume=15|issue=4|pages=659–667|doi=10.1089/ten.tec.2008.0674|issn=1937-3384}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cryovials are then placed into a tray, labeled with the cell line's genetic data, and placed into cryogenic freezers. The freezers contain nitrogen in either liquid or vapor form, and the cells are frozen at a rate of -1 to -3 degrees Celsius per minute until a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius is reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Behme"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiUBBra9ebUC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8LNETqSkFMnd0QH4g7SOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false|title=Manufacturing of pharmaceutical proteins: from technology to economy|last=Behme|first=Stefan|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=|pages=46–47|authorlink=|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius, metabolic processes within the cells are significantly slowed to stop all cell growth, thus preserving the cell line, which is especially useful when the cell line has a limited number of cell divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cell Banking (MCB, WCB, Cryopreservation)|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli|url=http://www.cellbanking.net/frequently-asked-questions/|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells can be stored for an extended amount of time in this state, reducing the rate of degradation of cellular material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Freezing==
The general freezing process for mammalian cells involves suspending a small density of the cells of interest in a solution of cryopreservation agents in a cryovial and freezing the cells to a temperature of -196 degrees Celsius. A slow freezing rate is important to maintaining the health of the cell culture. Freezing the cells at a rate of -1 to -3 degrees Celsius per minute is generally acceptable in maintaining cell culture health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;7.1-7.4." Fundamental Techniques in Cell Culture Laboratory Handbook – 2nd Edition. N.p.: Health Protection Agency, n.d. 20-23''. Public Health England.'' Web. 24 Jan. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing too quickly risks damaging the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryopreservation: Technologies, Applications and Risks/Outcomes|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/17981/3/Coopman%20final%20with%20refs.pdf|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|pages=91-108|last1=Coopman|first1=K|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a freezing rate of -5 degrees Celsius per minute, significant decreases of the thawed cell culture is observed. Even more pronounced decreases in cell culture health is observed at faster freezing rates, to the point that the cell culture cannot maintain a cell density.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thirumala|first=Sreedhar|last2=Goebel|first2=W. Scott|last3=Woods|first3=Erik J.|date=2013-05-01|title=Manufacturing and banking of mesenchymal stem cells|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2013.763925|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|volume=13|issue=5|pages=673–691|doi=10.1517/14712598.2013.763925|issn=1471-2598|pmid=23339745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cryopreservation agents is also key to the freezing process. A common cryoprotection agent used is 10% solution of DMSO, which acts to protect the cells from the rupturing caused by ice crystals during freezing and during thawing. DMSO has been observed agent to be toxic to cells, and requires dilution after the cells are thawed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Thawing==
Rapid thaws are recommend in bringing the cells out of cryopreservation and starting up their normal metabolic processes. Minimizing the exposure of the cryovial and its contents to room, or ambient temperatures is important. Rapid thaws are important to prevent the contents of the vial from melting and refreezing rapidly, which could cause ice crystals to form rupture the cells in the vial. Thaws can be performed in a few minutes within a water bath at a temperature around 37&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Experimentation has shown that a slower thaw in a controlled environment such as an incubator can be also be used to safely thaw cryofrozen cells.Thawing in an incubator avoids the risk of contamination involved in thawing in a water bath, however takes a significantly longer amount of time and resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Post thaw, the cells need to be transferred from the cryovial into another vessel and resuspended in media. By diluting the concentration of the cryoprotection agent present, negative effects such as toxicity from the cryprotection agents on metabolically active cells can be mitigated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Originally, scientists kept collections of cellular material for their own use, but not for the scientific community at large. The first person accredited with making a cell bank for widespread use was Kral, a [[Czechoslovakian]] scientist who created his cell bank collection in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name="Hug"&gt;{{cite book |title=Translational Stem Cell Research: Issues Beyond the Debate on the Moral Status of the Human Embryo |last=Hug |first=Kristina |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=225–237 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=955hap0emMUC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ggdLTqqoNar-sQKYsNSJDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are a large number of "culture collections and bioresource centers" that serve an individual part of the process of [[bioengineering]]. Some examples of these include the [[World Federation for Culture Collections]] and the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories.&lt;ref name="Hug"/&gt; In January 2003, the [[UK Stem Cell Bank]] was established to serve as a central unit for specimen collection and human testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stem Cell Wars: Inside Stories from the Frontlines |last=Herold |first=Eve |authorlink= |author2=Daley, George |year=2007 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location= |isbn= |page=205 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBQgMTqIseQC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Stem Cell Bank was established in October 2005 in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in order to serve as a repository specifically for stem cell lines. It currently hosts 13 of the 21 stem cell lines that exist in the world and are listed on the Stem Cell Registry hosted by the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of stem cell research, Volume 2 |last=Svendsen |first=Clive |authorlink= |author2=Ebert, Allison D. |year=2008 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=369–370 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhvtbMmxXeAC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;dq=%22stem+cell+bank%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IzRLTsSTDqKqsALH76i3CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22stem%20cell%20bank%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the [[World Health Organization]] established a reference cell bank to provide a resource for the development of vaccines and other biological medicines. Another reference cell bank was established by the World Health Organization in 2007 as a result of stability issues with [[MRC-5]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/WHO_reference_cell_banks/en/|title=WHO {{!}} WHO Reference Cell Banks (RCBs)|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Biological classification}}

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], '''class''' ({{lang-la|classis}}) is  a [[taxonomic rank]], as well as a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank.{{efn|When the term denotes taxonomic units, the plural is classes (Latin ''classes'').}} Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with class fitting between phylum and order. As for the other well-known ranks, there is the option of an immediately lower rank, indicated by the prefix ''sub-'': subclass (Latin: ''subclassis''). For example, [[dog]]s are in the class [[Mammalia]].

The composition of each class is determined by a [[taxonomist]]. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists taking different positions. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing a class, but for well-known animals there is likely to be consensus. 

In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the [[APG system]] in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the [[flowering plant]]s up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal [[clade]]s. Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |last2=Reveal |first2=James L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchy of ranks ==
For some clades, a number of alternative classifications are used.

===History of the concept===
The class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''top-level genus'' ''(genus summum)'') was first introduced by the [[France|French]] [[botanist]] [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his classification of plants that appeared in his ''Eléments de botanique'', 1694.

In the first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr E.]] (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] divided all three of his [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of Nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) into classes. Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient "artificial key" according to his ''[[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|Systema Sexuale]]'', largely based on the arrangement of flowers.

The class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until [[George Cuvier]]'s ''embranchements'', first called [[Phylum|Phyla]] by [[Ernst Haeckel]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.G., Valentine, J.W. (2001). [http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/7403/1/Collins_Valentine_EvDev2001.pdf "Defining phyla: evolutionary pathways to metazoan body plans."] ''Evol. Dev''. '''3''': 432-442.&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced in the early nineteenth century.

A '''clastogen''' is a [[mutagenic]] agent giving rise to or inducing disruption or breakages of [[chromosome]]s, leading to sections of the chromosome being deleted, added, or rearranged.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefort C., Fauth E., Zankl H.: Micronuclei induced by aneugens and clastogens in mononucleate and binucleate cells using cytokinesis block assay. Mutagenesis 19, pp. 277-284 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This process is a form of [[mutagenesis]], and can lead to [[carcinogenesis]], as cells that are not killed by the clastogenic effect may become cancerous. Known clastogens include [[acridine yellow]], [[benzene]], [[ethylene oxide]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphine]] and [[mimosine]]. Exposure to clastogens increases frequency of abnormal germ cells in paternal males, contributing to developmental effects in the fetus upon fertilization.

: &lt;u&gt;Illustrative sentence&lt;/u&gt;: "This leads to the conclusion that a chemical that fails to induce a significant response in an ''in vitro'' clastogenicity assay is unlikely to be clastogenic ''in vivo,'' in bone marrow assays."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, John. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5lMP9ivOoxcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Clastogenic&amp;lr=  ''Environmental Toxicology: Current Developments,'' p. 64.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The term "clastogenic" refers to volcanic eruptions which cause a particular type of [[ejecta]].
: &lt;u&gt;Illustrative sentence&lt;/u&gt;: "The complex features of this eruption can be explained by rapid deposition of coarse pyroclasts near the vent and the subsequent flowage of clastogenic lavas which were accompanied by a high eruption plume generating pumice falls and/or pyroclastic flows."&lt;ref&gt;Yasui, Maya and Takehiro Koyaguchi.

The '''cloud drop effective radius''' (alternatively '''cloud effective radius''' or '''effective radius''') is a [[weighted mean]] of the size distribution of cloud droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |title=Cloud Effective Radius |work=Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155507/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined in 1974 by [[James E. Hansen]] and [[Larry Travis]] as the ratio of the third to the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a droplet size distribution to aid in the [[inverse problem|inversion]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen., J.E. and L.D. Travis |title=Light scattering in planetary atmospheres |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=16 |issue =4 |year=1974 |doi=10.1007/BF00168069 |pages=527–610 |bibcode=1974SSRv...16..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the cloud drop particles.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;r_e = \dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^3 \cdot n(r)\,dr}{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot n(r)\,dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The global effective particle radius has different values for water and ice clouds: the former is around 14 μm, whereas for ice it is around 25 μm. Studies also indicate that the effective cloud droplet radius is larger over oceans than over ground by 15%-20%. By contrast, the difference in the ice particle size over land and oceans is much smaller (only 5%).&lt;ref name = "2013stubenrauch"&gt;

'''Cognitive engineering''' is a method of study using [[cognitive psychology]] to design &amp; develop engineering systems to support the cognitive processes of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.1204/abstract|title=Cognitive engineering|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiley Online Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was an engineering method used in the 1970s at [[Bell Labs]], focused on how people form a [[cognitive model]] of a system based upon common metaphors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/condon.htm|title=Interview with Joseph H. Condon (transcript)|last=|first=|date=|website=History of Science, Princeton University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As explained, by [[Joseph Henry Condon]]:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|sign=[[Joseph Henry Condon]]|source={{Cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/condon.htm|title=Interview with Joseph H.

You present them with some instruments, tools, like a faucet, electric stove or something like that and demonstrate how it works. They then form in their heads a model that shows how it works inside to help them remember how to use it in the future. It may be a totally erroneous model of what is going on inside the black box."}}

According to Condon, the ideas of cognitive engineering were developed later than, and independent from, the early work on the [[Unix]] operating system.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/transcripts/condon.htm|title=Joseph H. Condon|publisher=[[Princeton University]] History of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Norman]] cited principles of cognitive engineering in his 1981 article, "The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid." Norman criticized the [[user interface]] of Unix as being "a disaster for the casual user."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Norman | first1 = Don | title = The truth about Unix: The user interface is horrid | url = http://www.bradleymonk.com/File:The_truth_about_Unix_Don_Norman.pdf | work = Datamation | issue = 27(12) | date = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘'''critical spatial practice'''’ refers to forms of design practice between art and architecture. [[Jane Rendell]] introduced therm in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘A Place Between Art, Architecture and Critical Theory’, Proceedings to Place and Location (Tallinn, Estonia, 2003), pp. 221-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Rendell later consolidated and developed the term as one that defined practices located at a three-way intersection: between theory and practice, public and private, and art and architecture. For Rendell, critical spatial practice is informed by Michel de Certeau’s [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1980, translated into English in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;Certeau, Michel De, The Practice of Everyday Life (University of California Press, 2011) &lt;http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271456&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Lefebvre]]’s The Production of Space (1974, translated into English in 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri, The Production of Space (Wiley-Blackwell, 1991) &lt;http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0631181776.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the critical theory of the Frankfurt School,&lt;ref&gt;	Corradetti, Claudio, ‘Frankfurt School and Critical Theory | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy’, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Rome, Italy: Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy) &lt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; but her definition aims to transpose the key qualities of critical theory – self-reflection and social transformation – into practice. In Rendell’s work, critical spatial practices are those that question and transform the social conditions of the sites into which they intervene, as well as test the boundaries and procedures of their own disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, Art and Architecture (London: IB Tauris, 2006), pp. 1–2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 66 and 191. &lt;http://www.janerendell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Critical_Spatial_Practice.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘Critical Spatial Practice as Parrhesia’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.13&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Other theorists and practitioners have since worked with the term, evolving it in different directions. For example, there was the reading group and blog spot initiated by Nicholas Brown in the early 2000s, which came out of discussions around Brown’s own artistic walking practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://www.walkinginplace.org/iprh/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senn, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice: January 2006’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.blogspot.co.uk/2006_01_01_archive.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Nikolaus Hirsch and [[Markus Miessen]] started a book series with Sternberg Press called Critical Spatial Practice, which focused on architectural discourse and practice. In the first publication, they asked, "What is Critical Spatial Practice?"&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, and Nikolaus Hirsch, What Is Critical Spatial Practice?, Critical Spatial Practice 1 (Sternberg Press, 2012) &lt;http://www.sternberg-&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hirsch and Miessen set up a website site called criticalspatialpractice.org to archive their work in this area since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, ‘Architecture and Critical Spatial Practice (ACSP)’, Critical Spatial Practice &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.org/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The MaHKUscript, Journal of Fine Art Research published a special issue on critical spatial practice in 2016, where many of the contributors enact critical spatial practices concerned with political and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Slager, Henk, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.14&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel A. Vallero''' is an American environmental author&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/Daniel-Vallero/ELS_1007685/ Author page at Elsevier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470259603.fmatter/summary/ Author page at John Wiley &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. He was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from [[Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville]].  He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the [[University of Kansas]] and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from [[Duke University]] with a thesis on "“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cee.duke.edu/faculty/daniel-vallero Faculty page at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/cee/faculty/daniel.vallero/files/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Vallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing [[plastic recycling]] on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on [[MSNBC]], and current state of ethics in research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/articles/2012/05/31/ethics-courses-trending-at-graduate-engineering-schools?page=2 U.S. News &amp; World Report]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/vallero_daniel_sed.pdf Researcher page at EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at [[Duke University]] from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been  adjunct Professor of  Engineering Ethics at  Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and  the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].
 
In his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged [[biomedical engineering]] with [[environmental engineering]]. He stresses the need to incorporate the [[social sciences]] into every engineering and design project.  As a leader in [[engineering ethics]], he has served the [[National Academy of Engineering]] as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised [[Sigma Xi]], universities and other institutions on science and [[research ethics]] and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

Vallero is editor for the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]' journal, ''Process Safety and Environmental Protection'', as well as the [[MDPI]] journal, ''Sustainability''. He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]] and the ''McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology''.

== Works ==

Vallero is a pioneer of [[green engineering]] and the application of [[life cycle analysis]] to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). Teaching green engineering: The case of ethanol life cycle analysis. Bulletin of
Science, Technology &amp; Society. 28 (3): 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like [[switchgrass]] (Panicum virgatum).

In the book, "DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath," &lt;ref&gt;P.J. Lioy (2010). DUST: The Inside Story of Its Role in the September 11th Aftermath (Forward By Tom Kean). Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|1-4422-0148-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late American scientist [[Paul Lioy]] credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the [[9/11]] attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero  and P. Lioy (2012). The 5-R’s: Reliable Post-Disaster Exposure Assessment. Leadership and Management and Engineering. 12 (4):  247-253. (October 2012). {{DOI|10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term "synthovation," as a new design process for green engineering and [[green architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional "concept to completion" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of [[design for environment]] (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the [[sustainability]] of the project over its entire [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]].

In her book, "Hormone Deception",&lt;ref&gt;L. Berkson (2010), Hormone Deception. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition, {{ISBN|1453741275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply [[exposure science]] to [[endocrine disruptors]].

'''Diauxic growth''' or [[diauxie]] is any cell growth characterized by cellular growth in two phases, and can be illustrated with a [[diauxic growth curve]].  Diauxic growth, meaning double growth, is caused by the presence of two sugars on a culture growth media, one of which is easier for the target bacterium to metabolize.  The preferred sugar is consumed first, which leads to rapid growth, followed by a lag phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Editors|first=AccessScience|date=2015|title=Diauxic growth (diauxie)|url=https://www.accessscience.com/content/diauxic-growth-diauxie/BR0105151|journal=Access Science|language=en|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.BR0105151}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the lag phase the cellular machinery used to metabolize the second sugar is activated and subsequently the second sugar is metabolized.

This can also occur when the bacterium in a closed batch culture consumes most of its nutrients and is entering the stationary phase when new nutrients are suddenly added to the growth media. The bacterium enters a lag phase where it tries to ingest the food. Once the food starts being utilized, it enters a new log phase showing a second peak on the growth curve.

A '''diauxic growth curve''' refers to the [[growth curve (biology)|growth curve]] generated by an [[organism]] which has two growth peaks.  The theory behind the diauxic growth curve stems from [[Jacques Monod|Jacques Monod's]] Ph.D. research in 1940.

A simple example involves the [[bacterium]] ''Escherichia coli'' (''E. coli''), the best understood bacterium.  The bacterium is grown on a [[growth media]] containing two types of [[sugars]], one of which is easier to [[metabolism|metabolize]] than the other (for example [[glucose]] and [[lactose]]).  First, the bacterium will metabolize all the glucose, and grow at a higher speed.  Eventually, when all the glucose has been consumed, the bacterium will begin the process of expressing the [[gene]]s to metabolize the lactose.  This will only occur when all glucose in the media has been consumed.  For these reasons, '''diauxic growth''' occurs in multiple phases.

The first phase is the ''fast growth phase'', since the bacterium is consuming (in the case of the above example) exclusively glucose, and is capable of rapid growth.  The second phase is a ''lag phase'' while the genes used in lactose metabolism are expressed and observable cell growth stops.  This is followed by another ''growth phase'' which is slower than the first because of the use of lactose as the primary energy source.  The final stage is the ''saturation phase''. This process can also refer to the positive control of the lac operon.

'''Direct Behavior Rating''' ('''DBR''') is a [[behavior]] [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] method that educational professionals, such as [[school psychologist]]s and [[teacher]]s, use to monitor student behavior. It is characterized by:
* Recording a rating immediately after a specified observation period
* Using a rater with firsthand experience with the rated individual for the duration of the observation period (e.g., a teacher in a classroom where one student is the target)
* Requiring "minimal inference" from the rater to discern relevant behaviors&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Christ, T.J. |year=2009 |title=Direct Behavior Rating (DBR): An emerging method for assessing social behavior within a tiered intervention system |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=195–200 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a teacher was concerned about a student's disruptive behavior during [[math]] class and wanted to collect data on their behavior, they could explicitly define "disruptive behavior", observe the student's behavior during typical math instruction, and at the end of class, record for what percentage of time the student displayed disruptive behavior. This is an example of DBR using a Single Item Scale, or DBR-SIS.

Direct Behavior Rating typically involves four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sugai G. |year=2007 |title=School Based Behavior Assessment: Informing Instruction and Intervention |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafouleas |first=S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=McDougal, J.|year=2002|title=Good, bad, or in-between: How does the daily behavior report card rate? |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=39 |pages=157–169 |doi=10.1002/pits.10027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Specify a target behavior to monitor
# Rate that behavior after a specific [[observation]] period
# Share the information with concerned individuals (e.g., [[parent]]s, teachers, [[student]]s)
# Use [[outcome data]] to monitor the target behavior over time 

Direct Behavior Rating represents an amalgamation of characteristics from two major types of behavior collection systems: systematic direct observation and behavior rating scales.&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt; According to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] performed in 2006, over 60% of classroom teachers report that they employ DBR or DBR-like tools within their [[classroom]]s and view it as a highly acceptable intervention tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sassu, K.A. |year=2006 |title=Acceptability and reported use of Daily Behavior Report Cards among teachers |journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions |volume=8 |pages=174–182 |doi=10.1177/10983007060080030601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[research]] further indicates the acceptability of the measure to school psychologists who are frequently responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of research-based classroom interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author2=Chafouleas, S.M. |author3=Eckert, T. |year=2008 |title=Daily Behavior Report Cards and Systematic Direct Observation: An Investigation of the Acceptability, Reported Training and Use, and Decision Reliability among School Psychologists |journal= Journal of Behavioral Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DBR is not restricted to a single form of assessment. Rather, it is a methodology that can be used with a wide range of behaviors, contexts, and applications. One common distinction is made between DBR scales that consist of solely one item representing a behavioral construct (i.e., disruptive behavior) (Single Item Scales, or DBR-SIS) and those that consist of multiple items that are individually scored and then aggregated to depict a single construct (i.e., "Inappropriately calls out during instruction," "Pokes other students during instruction") (Multiple Item Scales, or DBR-MIS).&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christ, T.J. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Chafouleas, S.M. |year=2009 |title=Foundation for the development and use of Direct Behavior Rating (DBR) to assess and evaluate student behavior |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=201–213 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of DBR research has focused on the Single Item Scale format, the content of which is intended to be flexibly determined based on the rating's context and then graphed and summarized independently of other Single Item Scales. While each DBR-SIS individually measures a single behavioral construct, the utility of using multiple Single Item Scales as general outcome measures for school-based social behavior has also been examined.&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"/&gt;

Research has also investigated the feasibility of incorporating DBR into intervention packages. One study used DBR as a combined intervention and assessment tool through its use as a [[self-monitoring]] intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gureasko-Moore, S.P. |author2=DuPaul, G.J. |author3=White, G. |year=2007 |title=Self-management of classroom preparedness and homework: Effects on school functioning of adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |pages=647–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature examining the use of daily behavior report cards or daily progress reports often use DBR methodology as an integral part of their intervention and assessment construction. More resources regarding behavior report cards are available at:

Given its promising [[psychometric]] properties, contextual relevance, and usability by practitioners with restricted resources (e.g., teachers), DBR has also been suggested as a possible assessment tool within multi-tiered intervention frameworks such as [[Response to Intervention]].&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt;

'''Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling'''&lt;ref name="Dodd1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779863446 |title=The essential guide to telecommunications |last=Z. |first=Dodd, Annabel |date=2012 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=9780137058914 |edition=5th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |oclc=779863446}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''DTMF''') is an [[in-band]] [[Signalling (telecommunications)|telecommunication signaling]] system using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between [[telephone]] equipment and other communications devices and [[Automatic telephone exchange|switching centers]]. DTMF was first developed in the [[Bell System]] in the United States, and became known under the trademark '''Touch-Tone''' for use in [[push-button telephone]]s supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963.  DTMF is standardized as [[ITU-T]] Recommendation Q.23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |series=Recommendation |id=Q.23 |title=Technical features of push-button telephone sets |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.23/en |publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in the UK as ''MF4''.

The Touch-Tone system using a [[telephone keypad]] gradually replaced the use of [[rotary dial]] and has become the industry standard for  [[landline]] and mobile service. Other [[multi-frequency]] systems are used for internal signaling within the telephone network.

==Multifrequency signaling==
Prior to the development of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as [[pulse dialing]] (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the [[local loop]] between the telephone exchange and the [[calling party]]'s telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the [[rotary dial]] as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special [[subscriber trunk dialing]] equipment. Operators used an earlier type of [[multi-frequency]] signaling.

'''Multi-frequency signaling''' ('''MF''') is a group of signaling methods that use a mixture of two [[pure tone]] (pure [[sine wave]]) sounds. Various MF signaling [[Communications protocol|protocols]] were devised by the [[Bell System]] and [[CCITT]]. The earliest of these were for [[in-band]] signaling between switching centers, where [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]] used a 16-[[Numerical digit|digit]] [[keypad]] to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance [[telephone call]]s, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.

The DTMF system uses a set of eight audio frequencies transmitted in pairs to represent 16 signals, represented by the ten digits, the letters A to D, and the symbols ''#'' and ''*''. As the signals are audible tones in the voice frequency range, they can be transmitted through electrical repeaters and amplifiers, and over radio and microwave links, thus eliminating the need for intermediate operators on long-distance circuits.

AT&amp;T described the product as "a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path."&lt;ref&gt;AT&amp;T, ''Compatibility Bulletin No. 105''&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ from all of the pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, [[R2 signalling|R2]], CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by [[Signalling System No 7|SS7]] digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark ''Touch-Tone''. The term was first used by AT&amp;T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first [[push-button telephone]] was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&amp;T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[Q.23]]. In the UK, it is also known as MF4.

Other vendors of compatible telephone equipment called the Touch-Tone feature ''tone dialing'' or ''DTMF'', or used their other trade names such as ''Digitone'' by [[Northern Electric Company]] in Canada.

As a method of [[in-band signaling]], DTMF signals were also used by [[cable television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] to indicate the start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies. Until [[out-of-band signaling]] equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Previously, terrestrial television stations used DTMF tones to control remote transmitters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  In [[IP telephony]], DTMF signals can also be delivered as either in-band or out-of-band tones,&lt;ref&gt;H. Schulzrinne and T. Taylor, ''RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals'', IETF RFC 4733, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or even as a part of signaling protocols,&lt;ref&gt;C. Holmberg, E. Burger, H. Kaplan, ''Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework'', IETF RFC 6086, January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as long as both endpoints agree on a common approach to adopt.

The engineers had envisioned telephones being used to access computers and automated response systems.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Houston |title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R2SAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage|date=24 September 2013 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-24154-9 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consulted with companies to determine the requirements. This led to the addition of the [[number sign]]&lt;nowiki&gt; (#, ''pound'' or "diamond" in this context, "hash", "square" or "gate" in the UK, and "&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[octothorpe]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'' by the original engineers) and &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[asterisk]] or "star" (*) keys as well as a group of keys for menu selection: A, B, C and D. In the end, the lettered keys were dropped from most phones, and it was many years before the two symbol keys became widely used for [[vertical service code]]s such as *67 in the United States of America and Canada to suppress [[caller ID]].

Public [[payphone]]s that accept credit cards use these additional codes to send the information from the [[magnetic strip]].

The [[Autovon|AUTOVON]] telephone system of the [[United States Armed Forces]] used these signals to assert certain privilege and priority levels when placing telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tech-faq.com/abcd.shtml "What are the ABCD tones?" — Tech FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Precedence is still a feature of military telephone networks, but using number combinations. For example, entering 93 before a number is a priority call.

Present-day uses of the A, B, C and D signals on telephone networks are few, and are exclusive to network control. For example, the A key is used on some networks to cycle through different carriers at will. The A, B, C and D tones are used in radio phone patch and repeater operations to allow, among other uses, control of the repeater while connected to an active phone line.

The *, #, A, B, C and D keys are still widely used worldwide by [[amateur radio]] operators and commercial two-way radio systems for equipment control, repeater control, remote-base operations and some telephone communications systems.

DTMF signaling tones can also be heard at the start or end of some [[VHS]] (Video Home System) cassette tapes. Information on the master version of the video tape is encoded in the DTMF tone. The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.

DTMF tones are used in some [[caller ID]] systems to transfer the caller ID information, but in the United States only [[Bell 202 modem|Bell 202]] modulated [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signaling is used to transfer the data.

==Keypad==
[[File:MultiTone1.png|thumb|right|Combination of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz sine waves, representing DTMF "1"]]
The DTMF [[telephone keypad]] is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low  frequency component and each column represents the high frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the ''1'' key produces a superimposition of a 697 [[hertz|Hz]] low tone and a 1209 Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact. The tones are decoded by the switching center to determine the keys pressed by the user.

==Decoding==
[[File:1&amp;1 NetXXL powered by FRITZ! - CMD CM8870CSI on mainboard-1833.jpg|thumb|Two CMD CM8870CSI DTMF Receivers]]
DTMF was originally decoded by tuned filter banks. By the end of the 20th century, [[digital signal processing]] became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the [[Goertzel algorithm]]. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (''twist'').&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Reeves, ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook—Analog'', IEEE (1992), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other multiple frequency signals==
National telephone systems define other tones, outside the DTMF specification, that indicate the status of lines, equipment, or the result of calls. Such [[call-progress tone]]s are often also composed of multiple frequencies and are standardized in each country. The Bell System defined them in the [[Precise Tone Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;AT&amp;T, ''Notes on Distance Dialing'', 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Escapism''' is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of [[Everyday life|daily life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escapism&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or general [[sadness]].

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word "escapism" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[OED]] defined escapism as "The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. A. Shipley, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. [[C. S. Lewis]] was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Nicolay, ''Tolkien and the Modernists'' (2014) p. 79 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Pratchett]] considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Briggs, ''The Discworld Companion'' (2012) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literature, [[music]] has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Der Welt abhanden kommen. Über musikalischen Eskapismus''. In: ''Merkur'' 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological escapes==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] considered a quota of escapist [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] a necessary element in the life of humans: "[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', [[Theodor Fontane]] once said".&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted [[Mood (psychology)|moods]], especially anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)#Psychic retreat|psychic retreats]], the results will often be negative and even pathological.&lt;ref&gt;R. Britton, ''Belief and Imagination'' (2003) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what [[Juvenal]] called “bread and the [[Gladiatorial games|games]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Escapist societies appear often in literature. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes [[capitalism]], or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' society, television and "seashell radios" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'' and the game "Society" in the 2009 American science fiction film ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', a play on the real-life [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] game ''[[Second Life]]''. Other escapist societies in literature include ''The Reality Bug'' by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.

Social philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere "daydreaming" or "escapism" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an "immature, but honest substitute for revolution".

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state ([[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation ([[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]]). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the "escape scale" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenseng|first1=Frode|last2=Rise|first2=Jostein|last3=Kraft|first3=Pål|title=Activity Engagement as Escape from Self: The Role of Self-Suppression and Self-Expansion|journal=Leisure Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.1080/01490400.2012.633849|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2012.633849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
[[Alan Brinkley]], author of ''Culture and Politics in the Great Depression'', presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by [[Great Depression|the stock market crash in 1929]]: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give "no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director [[Preston Sturges]] aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]''. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how "foolish and vain and self-indulgent" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films "consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. Culture and Politics in the Great Depression. Waco, Tx: Markham Press Fund, 1999. http://www.uvm.edu/~pblackme/Brinkley.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exposome''' encompasses the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) [[Exposure assessment|exposure]]s from conception onwards, complementing the [[genome]],  first proposed in 2005 by a [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]]. As of 2016 it may not be possible to measure or model.

==Definition==
The exposome was first proposed in 2005 by  [[Epidemiology of cancer|cancer epidemiologist]] Christopher Paul Wild in an article entitled "Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wild |first=CP |title= Complementing the genome with an "exposome": the outstanding challenge of environmental exposure measurement in molecular epidemiology |journal= Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention |date= Aug 2005 |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=1847–50 |pmid= 16103423 |doi= 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the exposome and how to assess it has led to lively discussions with varied views in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Rappaport SM, Smith MT |year=2010 |title= Epidemiology.

New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199976737}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 2005 article, Wild stated, "At its most complete, the exposome encompasses life-course [[environmental exposure]]s (including [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors), from the [[prenatal]] period onwards." The concept was first proposed to draw attention to the need for better and more complete environmental exposure data for causal research, in order to balance the investment in genetics. According to Wild,  even incomplete versions of the exposome could be useful to [[epidemiology]]. In 2012, Wild outlined methods, including personal sensors, [[biomarker]]s, and '[[omics]]' technologies, to better define the exposome.&lt;ref name="Wild 24–32"/&gt; He described three overlapping domains within the exposome:
# a general [[external environment]] including the [[urban environment]], [[education]], [[climate]] factors, [[social capital]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]],
# a specific external environment with specific [[contaminant]]s, [[radiation]],  [[infection]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] factors (e.g. [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]]), [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[physical activity]], etc.
# an internal environment to include internal biological factors such as [[metabolic]] factors, [[hormones]], [[gut microflora]], [[inflammation]], [[oxidative stress]].
In late 2013, this definition was explained in greater depth in the first book on the exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Gary Miller |isbn= 978-0124172173
|date= 2 December 2013 |pages=118 |title= The Exposome: A Primer |publisher= Elsevier |url= https://www.elsevier.com/books/the-exposome/miller/978-0-12-417217-3|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=G x E = ?| url=http://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/g-x-e/|author= Gary Miller|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Elsevier|work=Sci Connect|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2014, the same author revised the definition to include the body's response with its endogenous metabolic processes which alter the processing of chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Miller Gary W. |author2=Jones Dean P. |date= January 2014 |title= The Nature of Nurture: Refining the Definition of the Exposome |journal= [[Toxicological Sciences]] |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages= 1–2 |pmid= 24213143 |doi= 10.1093/toxsci/kft251 | pmc=3871934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
For complex disorders, specific genetic causes appear to account for only 10-30% of the disease incidence, but there has been no standard or systematic way to measure the influence of environmental exposures. Some studies into the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in the incidence of [[diabetes]] have demonstrated that "environment-wide association studies" (EWAS, or exposome-wide association studies) may be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Bhattacharya, J |author3=Butte, AJ |title=An Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on type 2 diabetes mellitus.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=May 20, 2010| volume=5| issue=5| pages=e10746| pmid=20505766|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010746|pmc=2873978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patel|first=CJ|author2=Chen, R |author3=Kodama, K |author4=Ioannidis, JP |author5= Butte, AJ |title=Systematic identification of interaction effects between genome- and environment-wide associations in type 2 diabetes mellitus| url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/676/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00439-012-1258-z.pdf?auth66=1425526047_d503d7888be4f8f7c25b85cac0e83d09&amp;ext=.pdf | journal=Human Genetics| date=20 January 2013| pmid=23334806|accessdate=4 March 2015 |doi=10.1007/s00439-012-1258-z |volume=132 |issue=5 |pages=495–508 |pmc=3625410}}{{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not clear what data sets are most appropriate to represent the value of "E".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith Martyn T. |author2=Rappaport Stephen M. | date = August 2009 | title = Building Exposure Biology Centers to Put the E into "G × E" Interaction Studies | journal = [[Environmental Health Perspectives]] | volume = 117 | issue = 8| pages = A334–A335 | pmc=2721881 | pmid=19672377 | doi=10.1289/ehp.12812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research initiatives==
As of 2016, it may not be possible to measure or model the full exposome, but several European projects have started to make first attempts.
In 2012, the [[European Commission]] awarded two large grants to pursue exposome-related research.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/daily-dose-of-toxics-to-be-tracked-1.11901 |title=Daily dose of toxics to be tracked |journal=Nature |volume=491 |issue=7426 |pages=647 |last1=Callaway|first1=  Ewen |date=27 November 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2013|doi=10.1038/491647a |pmid=23192121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HELIX project at the [[Barcelona]]-based Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology was launched around 2014, and aimed to develop an early-life exposome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrijheid |first1=M |last2=Slama |first2=R |last3=Robinson |first3=O |last4=Chatzi |first4=L |last5=Coen |first5=M |last6=van den Hazel |first6=P |last7=Thomsen |first7=C |last8=Wright |first8=J |last9=Athersuch |first9=TJ |last10=Avellana |first10=N |last11=Basagaña |first11=X |last12=Brochot |first12=C |last13=Bucchini |first13=L |last14=Bustamante |first14=M |last15=Carracedo |first15=A |last16=Casas |first16=M |last17=Estivill |first17=X |last18=Fairley |first18=L |last19=van Gent |first19=D |last20=Gonzalez |first20=JR |last21=Granum |first21=B |last22=Gražulevičienė |first22=R |last23=Gutzkow |first23=KB |last24=Julvez |first24=J |last25=Keun |first25=HC |last26=Kogevinas |first26=M |last27=McEachan |first27=RR |last28=Meltzer |first28=HM |last29=Sabidó |first29=E |last30=Schwarze |first30=PE |last31=Siroux |first31=V |last32=Sunyer |first32=J |last33=Want |first33=EJ |last34=Zeman |first34=F |last35=Nieuwenhuijsen |first35=MJ |title=The human early-life exposome (HELIX): project rationale and design. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |date=June 2014 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=535–44 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1307204 |pmid=24610234 |pmc=4048258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A second project, Exposomics, based at [[Imperial College London]], launched in 2012, aimed to use smartphones utilizine GPS and environmental sensors to assess exposures.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exposomicsproject.eu/ About Exposomics] EU&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
In late 2013, a major initiative called the "Health and Environment-Wide Associations based on Large Scale population Surveys" or HEALS, began. Touted as the largest environmental health-related study in Europe, HEALS proposes to adopt a paradigm defined by interactions between DNA sequence, epigenetic DNA modifications, gene expression, and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALS-EU.|url=http://www.heals-eu.eu/|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] hosted a meeting entitled "Emerging Technologies for Measuring Individual Exposomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academy of Sciences meeting|url=http://nas-sites.org/emergingscience/meetings/exposome/|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] overview,  "Exposome and Exposomics", outlines the three priority areas for researching the occupational exposome as identified by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) has invested in technologies supporting exposome-related research including biosensors, and supports research on [[gene-environment interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIEHS Gene-Environment studies|url=http://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/science/gene-env/index.cfm|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genes and Environment Initiative|url=http://www.genome.gov/19518663|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed Human Exposome Project (HEP)==

The idea of a Human Exposome Project, analogous to the [[Human Genome Project]], has been proposed and discussed in numerous scientific meetings, but as of 2017, no such project exists. Given the lack of clarity on how science would go about pursuing such a project, support has been lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud, Celia Henry (16 August 2010).

The concept of the exposome has contributed to the 2010 proposal of a new [[paradigm]] in disease [[phenotype]], "the unique disease principle": Every individual has a unique disease process different from any other individual, considering uniqueness of the exposome and its unique influence on molecular pathologic processes including alterations in the [[interactome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Lochhead P, Chan AT, et al | year = 2013 | title = Molecular pathological epidemiology of epigenetics: emerging integrative science to analyze environment, host, and disease | url = | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1038/modpathol.2012.214 | pmid=23307060 | pmc=3637979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle was first described in neoplastic diseases as "the unique tumor principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ogino S, Fuchs CS, Giovannucci E | year = 2012 | title = How many molecular subtypes?

The '''Forest Research Institute Malaysia''' ('''FRIM'''; [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Institut Penyelidikan Perhutanan Malaysia'') is a statutory [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of Malaysia]], under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. FRIM promotes sustainable management and optimal use of [[forestry|forest]] resources in [[Malaysia]] by generating knowledge and technology through research, development and application in tropical forestry. FRIM is located in [[Kepong]], near Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref name=frim-gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute Malaysia {{!}} Official Portal|url=http://www.frim.gov.my/|publisher=frim.gov.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tourismselangor&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM), Kepong|url=http://www.tourismselangor.my/forest-research-institute-of-malaysia/|publisher=tourismselangor.my|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926, the Chief Conservator of the Forest (equivalent to today's Director of Forestry), G.E.S Cubitt, asked Dr. F.W. Foxworthy to establish a separate forest research unit for the Forestry Department. It was Foxworthy who selected the present site, at Kepong. He was also to become the institutes's first Chief Research Officer.

The site comprised an area that was practically stripped of its original [[forest cover]] except for a few remnant trees at the more inaccessible localities. Lalang-grass scrub on the hillsides made way to vegetable terraces on the lower slopes, while the valley cradled a few ponds, the left-overs of a past tin-mining operation.

Within two years in 1928, the first {{convert|42|ha}} of experimental plantation (mainly [[dipterocarp]]s, tall hardwood species) were in place, carefully nurtured into being using "nurse" trees of other species as shade and food providers (being nitrogen-fixers). By that time the construction of the main building had begun. Completed the following years, this building was to remain the sole centre for the laboratories, [[herbarium]], and museum, as well as the Chemistry, Zoology and Sivilculture sections of the institute, until new buildings were added after World War II. The herbarium collection, that was also moved to Kepong, numbered 1,500 accessions.

The end of the decade saw some 125 hectares of plantation established at the Institute. Plantation trials with exotic species started in the early 1930s. The plantations covered 154 hectares just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe in 1939, and before the Japanese occupation of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in 1941–1945. By this time the dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta contained 75 species (represented by 360 individual trees), while the Herbarium collection numbered nearly 40,000 accessions.

=== Establishment ===
Just before [[Federation of Malaya Independence Act 1957|Malaysia won independence]] from the [[British Empire]] in 1957, some 220 hectares of plantations had been established at the institute, while the Dipterocarp and non-Dipterocarp arboreta held 201 and 168 species respectively. The herbarium collection had grown to 53,600 accessions. The Timber Research Branch had moved from [[Sentul, Kuala Lumpur|Sentul]] to become a part of the Institute at Kepong.

Six years later, Encik Abdul Rahman Mohd. Ali was appointed the Institute's first Malaysian Director and Chief Research Officer. The ground of the Institute expanded by a further 192 hectares in 1962 and 1964 to total 600 hectares.

In 1977 Dr. Salleh Mohd. Nor was appointed to his present post of director general of the institute. Eight years later, the institute was transformed into a statutory body. Through an Act of Parliament, the Malaysia Forestry Research and Development Board (MFRDB) was formed to administer the Institute, which was now named FOREST RESEARCH INSTITUTE of MALAYSIA (FRIM). This historic change was announced by the EX-Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Bin Muhammad when he visited FRIM on 11 June 1984. The formal inauguration of FRIM took place later, on 5 April 1986.

[[Image:Ecosystem Componants.jpg|thumb|Components of the Maharashtra freshwater ecosystem]]

The state of [[Maharashtra]] in India has several major river systems including those of the [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] rivers. The ecology of these rivers and associated wetlands is covered in this article.

==Introduction==
Ecology is the science of interrelationship. Various components of the ecosystem interact together and thus maintain the proper ecosystem functioning. To create the holistic picture of the any given area one should have to consider various components of the ecosystem. These components could be [[Habitats]] (Land and Waterscapes), Species, people/institutions, people's various practices, their various aspirations and issues ecological history etc.
Here an attempt has been made to create a rather holistic picture of the fresh water ecological scenario of Maharashtra state. Maharashtra is well known for its varied biodiversity, habitat diversity, people and culture etc. In this page we are trying to put all available information regarding fresh water ecology of the Maharashtra region. The political boundary of Maharashtra is chosen only to facilitate the systematic data compilation. More specifically in terms of river basins, [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] basins are the premises of the information.

==Landscape ecology==
[[Image:Adan river Ramgaon.JPG|thumb|left|Adan river from the north Eastern Godavari basin]]
Habitats play an important role in shaping the biotic communities. The major reason behind the extinction of the flora and fauna is habitat loss, [[Habitat fragmentation]] and destruction.
[[Landscape ecology]] is a sub-discipline of ecology and geography that address how spatial variation in the landscape affects ecological processes such as the distribution and flow of energy, materials and individuals in the environment (which, in turn, may influence the distribution of landscape "elements" themselves such as hedgerows). Landscape ecology typically deals with problems in an applied and holistic context.

=== Geography of Maharashtra ===
{{Main|Geography of Maharashtra}}
Located in the north center of [[Peninsular India]], with a command of the Arabian Sea through its port of [[Mumbai]], Maharashtra has a remarkable physical homogeneity, enforced by its underlying geology. The dominant physical trait of the state is its plateau character. Maharashtra is a plateau of plateaux, its western upturned rims rising to form the [[Sahyadri]] Range and its slopes gently descending towards the east and southeast. The major rivers and their master tributaries have carved the plateaux into alternating broad-river valleys and intervening higher lever interfluves, such as the [[Ahmednagar]], [[Buldana]], and [[Yavatmal]] plateau.

The Sahyadri Range is the physical backbone of Maharashtra. Rising on an average to an elevation of 1000&amp;nbsp;m, it falls in steep cliffs, to the [[Konkan]] on the west. Eastwards, the hill country falls in steps through a transitional area known as [[Malwa]] to the plateau level. The series of crowning plateaux on the crest forms a distinctive feature of the Sahyadri Range.

The Konkan, lying between the Arabian Sea and the Sahyadri Range is narrow coastal lowland, barely 50&amp;nbsp;km wide. Though mostly below 200&amp;nbsp;m, it is far from being a plain country. Highly dissected and broken, the Konkan alternates between narrow, steep-sided valleys and low laterite plateaux.

The [[Satpuras]], hills along the northern border, and the Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri Ranges on the eastern border form physical barriers preventing easy movement, but also serve as natural limits to the state.

==Waterscape of Maharashtra==

===River basins of Maharashtra===
[[File:Adan river, Maharashtra, India (11 October, 2005).jpg|thumb|left|Adan River]]
There are 4 principal rivers of this region, 2 of which runs towards west and 2 towards the east coast. [[Narmada River|Narmada]], [[Tapti River|Tapti]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]] and [[Krishna River|Krishna]] drain this region. All the rivers are monsoonal rivers.
Brief description of these 4 basins is given here, link given to river names will provide detailed information about the same.

==== Narmada River basin ====

''[[Image:India rivers and lakes map.svg|thumb|Map of the major rivers, lakes and reservoirs in India]]
The Narmada is a river in central India in Indian subcontinent. It forms the traditional boundary between North India and South India, and is a total of {{convert|1289|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. It is one of only three major rivers in peninsular India that run from east to west, along with the Tapti and the Mahi River. It is the only river in India that flows in a rift valley. It rises on the summit of Amarkantak Hill in Madhya Pradesh state, and for the first {{convert|320|km|mi}} of its course winds among the Mandla Hills, which form the head of the Satpura Range; then at Jabalpur, passing through the 'Marble Rocks', it enters the Narmada Valley between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges, and pursues a direct westerly course to the Gulf of Cambay. It flows through the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, and empties into the Arabian Sea in the Bharuch District of Gujarat.
Its longest tributary is the Tawa, which joins the Narmada at Bandra Bhan in Hoshangabad District, Madhya Pradesh. After leaving Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the river widens out in the fertile district of Bharuch. Below Bharuch city it forms a 20 kilometres wide estuary where it enters the Gulf of Cambay. The Narmada river is not only used for irrigation, but for navigation. In the rainy season boats of considerable size sail about 100 kilometres above Bharuch city. Seagoing vessels of about 70 tons frequent the port of Bharuch, but they are entirely dependent on the tide.

====Tapti River basin====

The Tapti River (also Tapi River) is a river in central India. It is one of the major rivers of peninsular India with a length of around 724&amp;nbsp;km. It is one of only three rivers – the others being the Narmada River and the Mahi River that runs from east to west
The river rises in the Eastern Satpura Range of Southern Madhya Pradesh state, and flows westward, draining Madhya Pradesh's Nimar region, Maharashtra's Kandesh and east Vidarbha regions in the northwest corner of the Deccan Plateau and South Gujarat before emptying into the Gulf of Cambay of the Arabian Sea, in the State of Gujarat. The Western Ghats or Sahyadri range starts south of the Tapti River near the border of Gujarat and Maharashtra.
State	Catchment area 	Percentage
Madhya Pradesh	9804 	15.1
Maharashtra 	51100 	78.8
Gujarat	3970	6.1
Grand Total	64874 	100

==== Godavari River basin ====

The [[Godavari]] (गोदावरी नदी) River is a major waterway in central India, originating in the [[Western Ghats]] and flowing eastwardly across the [[Deccan Plateau]] between the states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], then crossing the latter state and turning to flow in a southeast direction until it empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through two mouths. Its tributaries include [[Indravati River]], [[Manjira River]], [[Bindusara River]], [[Sabari River]] etc. 
Although the river arises only 80 kilometres from the [[Arabian Sea]], it flows 1,465&amp;nbsp;km to empty into the Bay of Bengal. Just above [[Rajahmundry]] there is a dam that provides water for irrigation. Below Rajahmundry, the river divides into two streams that widen into a large river delta which has an extensive navigable irrigation-canal system, Dowleswaram Barrage that links the region to the Krishna River delta to the southwest.
The [[Indrawati]], the [[Wainganga]], the [[Wardha]], the [[Pench River|Pench]], the [[Kanhan River|Kanhan]] and [[Penganga]] rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the Godavari system.
The Godavari River has a drainage area of 313,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in seven states- Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, [[Karnataka]], Madhya Pradesh, [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Orissa, India|Orissa]].

====Krishna River basin====
[[Krishna]] Basin extends over an area of 258,948&amp;nbsp;km² which is nearly 8% of total geographical area of the country. The basin lies in the states of [[Karnataka]] (113,271&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Andhra Pradesh]] (76,252&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Maharashtra]] (69,425&amp;nbsp;km²).
[[Krishna river]] rises in the Western Ghats at an elevation of about 1337 m just north of Mahabaleshwar, about 64&amp;nbsp;km from the Arabian Sea and flows for about 1400&amp;nbsp;km and outfalls into the Bay of Bengal. The principal tributaries joining Krishna are the Ghataprabha, the Malaprabha, the Bhima, the Tungabhadra and the Musi.
Most part of this basin comprises rolling and undulating country except the western border which is formed by an unbroken line of ranges of the Western Ghats. The important soil types found in the basin are black soils, red soils, laterite and lateritic soils, alluvium, mixed soils, red and black soils and saline and alkaline soils.
An average annual surface water potential of 78.1&amp;nbsp;km³ has been assessed in this basin. Out of this, 58.0&amp;nbsp;km³ is utilisable water. Culturable area in the basin is about 203,000&amp;nbsp;km², which is 10.4% of the total culturable area of the country.
Most important tributary of Krishna are Tungabhadra River, which is itself formed by the Tunga River and Bhadra River that originate in the Western Ghats. Other tributaries include the Koyna River, Bhima River (and its tributaries such as the Kundali River feeding into the Upper Bhima River Basin), Malaprabha River, Ghataprabha River, Yerla River, Warna River, Dindi River, Musi River and Dudhganga River.
Two big dams have been constructed on the river, one at Srisailam called Srisailam Dam and the other at Nagarjuna Hill. The latter, the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam, is considered to be the largest earth dam in the world with a natural reservoir

===Fishing communities in Maharashtra===
{{Main|Fishing Communities in Maharashtra}}
[[Image:Bhoi.jpg|thumb|left|Bhoi people of Maharashtra]]
Maharashtra is famous for its varied fresh water resources, including lakes, tanks and rivers. A number of fishing communities have developed in response to these favourable factors. These communities can be divided into:

* Specialists or indigenous groups who depend completely on fish and other aquatic resources for their subsistence
* Subsistence fishers or opportunists who depend partly on fish, and
* Groups who have recently started fishing.

===Traditional knowledge about natural history of fishes===
{{Main|Traditional knowledge about natural history of fishes}}
Humans may have discovered complex, symbolic language in its present form about 60 thousand years ago, thereby initiating the development of knowledge in the modern mode. At these early stages, until the beginning of agriculture and village society some ten thousand years ago, human population were organised into largely autonomous-endogamous tribes of perhaps 2 to 10 thousand people each. There would be considerable social inter course within a tribe, but little across tribes, who would often speak mutually incomprehensible languages. There would then be common pools of knowledge limited to individual tribes; pools of different tribes may greatly diverge with little in common. However, even within tribes there may be people, such as Shamans especially concerned with development and systematic management of knowledge, in charge of pools of specialised knowledge such as that of movements of celestial bodies or March of seasons, or of herbal remedies (Gadgil 2001b). 
With the beginning of agriculture and animal husbandry, human societies changed radically, with a breakdown of boundaries between erstwhile endogamous tribal groups. Due to this, there may occurs amalgamation of the many streams of the knowledge and there may have developed a variety of specialised groups of people concerned with management of particular stocks of knowledge, such as that dealing with fashioning of tools or use of herbal medicines. Merging of different knowledge streams and their use has led to rapid expansion of the total flow as the hunter-gatherers societies transformed into agrarian one (Gadgil 2001b). For thousands of years, aboriginal peoples around the world have used knowledge of their local environment to sustain themselves and to maintain their cultural identity. Only in the past decade, however, has this knowledge been recognised by the Western scientific community as a valuable source of ecological information. 
This knowledge is variously labelled as 'folk ecology', ‘ethno-ecology’, 'traditional environmental knowledge' or 'ecological knowledge', 'indigenous knowledge', 'customary law', and 'knowledge of the land'. Traditional environmental or ecological knowledge is probably the most common term; however, there remains no universally accepted definition of the concept. For this work, 'traditional knowledge’ (TK) and some time 'folk knowledge' terms are used interchangeably.
In this linked page traditional knowledge of [[Dhivar]] and [[Gondi people|Gond]] people of eastern Maharashtra has been described.

===Fishing techniques===
[[Image:Dhir.jpg|thumb|left|Dhir: A traditional fishing instrument used by the Gond tribal of Central India]]
Fishing is probably oldest and one of the important activity of humankind. Ancient remains of spears, hooks and fishnet have been found in ruins of the Stone Age. The people of the early civilisation drew pictures of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the upper bills of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and thorns of plant. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or some times with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. Ancient fishing nets were rough in design and material but they were amazingly, as if some now use (Parker 2002). 
Literature on the indigenous fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the Solomon Island. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from New Caledonia (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. 
Tribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212 AD King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant piscicides, and by the fifteenth century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974). All over the globe, indigenous people use various fish poisons to kill the fishes, documented in America (Jeremy 2002) and among Tarahumara Indian (Gajdusek 1954).
An ecological niche refers to the way in which a species utilises the resources of its environment and its relation to other species in the biological community. In biological community, no two coexisting species share the same niche. Similarly, no two coexisting castes have the same traditional niche in rural India; their niches are so differentiated as to preempt excessive competition for the same resources (Gadgil 2001a). The concept of the ecological niche has been used in a number of ways in anthropology: as a specialized part of human society, as synonymous with culture, and as a segment of the habitat (Donald 1972). Indian society is an agglomeration of several thousand endogamous groups or castes each with a restricted geographical range and a hereditarily determine mode of subsistence. These reproductively isolated castes may be compared to biological species, and the society thought of as a biological community with each caste having its specific ecological niche (Gadgil and Malhotra 1983).

===Traditional conservation practices===

India has deep-rooted tradition of nature worship, which provide base for the conservation from the grass root. However, this tradition is collapsing very rapidly. The reasons behind these are mainly, dilution of the belief systems, composite impacts of development in the form of population pressure, resource crunch, market economy, etc. In the present day context, it is important to see the present status of the 'folk conservation practices' so as to devise the strategies of its renovation.

===Traditional knowledge about landscape ecology===
For most of the evolutionary history, human societies have been organised in hunting-gathering tribes each with its own exclusive territory. This territoriality persisted in one form or the other with all Indian casts until recent times (Gadgil 1987). Continually searching for the food man acquires the knowledge of the different landscapes surrounding him. Gadgil (1996a) suggests 5000 Km2 resource catchment area probably required during hunting – gathering mode of life. The resource catchment should sustain a band of about 50 – 60 people by hunting the animals and collecting edible plants. In this above said area, he might have identified different patches of landscapes and waterscape elements. As languages evolved, man gave different names to different land and waterscape elements and gathered very good deal of the knowledge about the same. To preserve the ecological wellbeing of the habitat and to extend his notion of the kinship and reciprocity he attached sacred values to the habitats.

[[Image:Electropherogram trace.jpg|thumb|200px|DNA electropherogram trace]]
'''Nucleic acid electrophoresis''' is an analytical technique used to separate [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] fragments by size and reactivity. Nucleic acid molecules which are to be analyzed are set upon a viscous medium, the [[gel]], where an [[electric field]] induces the nucleic acids (which are negatively charged due to their sugar-[[phosphate]] backbone) to migrate toward the [[anode]] (which is positively charged because this is an [[Electrolytic cell|electrolytic]] rather than [[galvanic cell]]). The separation of these fragments is accomplished by exploiting the mobilities with which different sized molecules are able to pass through the gel. Longer molecules migrate more slowly because they experience more resistance within the gel. Because the size of the molecule affects its mobility, smaller fragments end up nearer to the anode than longer ones in a given period. After some time, the voltage is removed and the fragmentation gradient is analyzed. For larger separations between similar sized fragments, either the voltage or run time can be increased. Extended runs across a low voltage gel yield the most accurate resolution. Voltage is, however, not the sole factor in determining electrophoresis of nucleic acids.

The nucleic acid to be separated can be prepared in several ways before separation by electrophoresis. In the case of large DNA molecules, the DNA is frequently cut into smaller fragments using a DNA [[restriction endonuclease]] (or restriction enzyme). In other instances, such as [[PCR]] amplified samples, enzymes present in the sample that might affect the separation of the molecules are removed through various means before analysis. Once the nucleic acid is properly prepared, the samples of the nucleic acid solution are placed in the wells of the gel and a voltage is applied across the gel for a specified amount of time.

The DNA fragments of different lengths are visualized using a [[fluorescent dye]] specific for DNA, such as [[ethidium bromide]]. The gel shows bands corresponding to different nucleic acid molecules populations with different molecular weight.  Fragment size is usually reported in "nucleotides", "base pairs" or "kb" (for thousands of base pairs) depending upon whether single- or double-stranded nucleic acid has been separated. Fragment size determination is typically done by comparison to commercially available [[molecular weight size marker|DNA markers]] containing linear DNA fragments of known length.

The types of gel most commonly used for nucleic acid electrophoresis are [[agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose]] (for relatively long DNA molecules) and [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|polyacrylamide]] (for high resolution of short DNA molecules, for example in [[DNA sequencing]]).  Gels have conventionally been run in a "slab" format such as that shown in the figure, but [[capillary electrophoresis]] has become important for applications such as high-throughput DNA sequencing.  Electrophoresis techniques used in the assessment of [[DNA damage]] include [[alkaline gel electrophoresis]] and [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]].

For short DNA segments such as 20 to 60 bp double stranded DNA, running them in Polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) will give better resolution(native condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaguva Vasudevan|first=Ananda Ayyappan|author2=Mario Perkovic |author3=Yannick Bulliard |author4=Klaus Cichutek |author5=Didier Trono |author6=Dieter Häussinger |author7=Carsten Münk |title=Prototype Foamy Virus Bet Impairs the Dimerization and Cytosolic Solubility of Human APOBEC3G|journal=Journal of Virology|date=August 2013|volume=87|issue=16|pages=9030–9040|doi=10.1128/JVI.03385-12|pmid=23760237|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/87/16/9030.long |pmc=3754047}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, RNA and single stranded DNA can be run and visualised by PAGE gels containing denaturing agents such as Urea. [[PAGE|PAGE gels]] are widely used in techniques such as DNA foot printing, [[Electrophoretic mobility shift assay|EMSA]] and other DNA-protein interaction techniques.

The measurement and analysis are mostly done with a specialized gel analysis software.  Capillary electrophoresis results are typically displayed in a trace view called an [[electropherogram]].

==Factors affecting migration of nucleic acids==

A number of factors can affect the migration of nucleic acids: the dimension of the gel pores, the voltage used, the ionic strength of the buffer, and the concentration [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] dye such as ethidium bromide if used during electrophoresis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=G. Lucotte |author2=F. Baneyx |title= Introduction to Molecular Cloning Techniques |page=32 | year=1993 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0471188490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size of DNA===
The gel sieves the DNA by the size of the DNA molecule whereby smaller molecules travel faster. Double-stranded DNA moves at a rate that is approximately inversely proportional to the [[logarithm]] of the number of base pairs.  This relationship however breaks down with very large DNA fragments and it is not possible to separate them using standard [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  The limit of resolution depends on gel composition and field strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |page=5.2 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel.&lt;ref name="Aaij C, Borst P 1972 192–200"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biochim Biophys Acta |year=1972 |volume=269 |issue=2 |pages=192–200 |title=The gel electrophoresis of DNA |vauthors=Aaij C, Borst P |pmid=5063906 |doi=10.1016/0005-2787(72)90426-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Separation of very large DNA fragments requires [[pulse field gel electrophoresis]] (PFGE).  In field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE, a kind of PFGE), it is possible to have "band inversion" - where large molecules may move faster than small molecules.

[[File:Plasmid miniprep.jpg|thumb|280px|Gels of plasmid preparations usually show a major band of supercoiled DNA with other fainter bands in the same lane.  Note that by convention DNA gel is displayed with smaller DNA fragments near the bottom of the gel.  This is because historically DNA gel were run vertically and the smaller DNA fragments move downwards faster.]]

===Conformation of DNA===
The [[Chemical structure|conformation]] of the DNA molecule can significantly affect the movement of the DNA, for example, [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled DNA]] usually moves faster than relaxed DNA because it is tightly coiled and hence more compact.  In a normal plasmid DNA preparation, multiple forms of DNA may be present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6Yd-qYvx9UC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=DNA Structure and Function |author= Richard R. Sinden |page= 97 |publisher=Academic Press Inc |isbn=978-0126457506}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gel from the electrophoresis of the plasmids would normally show a main band which would be the negatively supercoiled form, while other forms of DNA may appear as minor fainter bands.  These minor bands may be nicked DNA (open circular form) and the relaxed closed circular form which normally run slower than [[supercoiled DNA]], and the single-stranded form (which can sometimes appear depending on the preparation methods) may move ahead of the supercoiled DNA.  The rate at which the various forms move however can change using different electrophoresis conditions, for example linear DNA may run faster or slower than supercoiled DNA depending on conditions,&lt;ref name=sambrook1&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author1=Joseph Sambrook |author2=David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 5, protocol 1 |pages=5.5-5.6 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mobility of larger circular DNA may be more strongly affected than linear DNA by the pore size of the gel.&lt;ref name="Aaij C, Borst P 1972 192–200"/&gt;  Unless supercoiled [[Molecular weight size marker|DNA markers]] are used, the size of a circular DNA like plasmid therefore may be more accurately gauged after it has been linearized by [[restriction digest]].

DNA damage due to increased [[cross-link]]ing will also reduce electrophoretic DNA migration in a dose-dependent way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/S0887-2333(00)00022-9 |vauthors=Blasiak J, Trzeciak A, Malecka-Panas E, Drzewoski J, Wojewódzka M | title=In vitro genotoxicity of ethanol and acetaldehyde in human lymphocytes and the gastrointestinal tract mucosa cells | journal=Toxicology in Vitro | volume=14 | issue=4 | year=2000 | pages=287–295  | id= | pmid=10906435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1093/mutage/gep008 |vauthors=Lu Y, Morimoto K | title=Is habitual alcohol drinking associated with reduced electrophoretic DNA migration in peripheral blood leukocytes from ALDH2-deficient male Japanese? | journal=Mutagenesis  | volume=24 | issue=4 | year=2009 | pages=303–308  | url = http://mutage.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/303.long |id= | pmid=19286920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration of ethidium bromide===

Circular DNA are more strongly affected by ethidium bromide concentration than linear DNA if ethidium bromide is present in the gel during electrophoresis.  All naturally occurring DNA circles are underwound, but ethidium bromide which intercalates into circular DNA can change the charge, length, as well as the superhelicity of the DNA molecule, therefore its presence during electrophoresis can affect its movement in gel. Increasing ethidium bromide intercalated into the DNA can change it from a negatively supercoiled molecule into a fully relaxed form, then to positively coiled superhelix at maximum intercalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biochemistry |author1=Donald Voet |author2=Judith G. Voet |edition=2nd |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=877–878 |year=1995 |isbn=978-0471586517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agarose gel electrophoresis can be used to resolve circular DNA with different supercoiling topology.

===Gel concentration===

The concentration of the gel determines the pore size of the gel which affect the migration of DNA.  The resolution of the DNA changes with the percentage concentration of the gel. Increasing the agarose concentration of a gel reduces the migration speed and improves separation of smaller DNA molecules, while lowering gel concentration permits large DNA molecules to be separated. For a standard agarose gel electrophoresis, a 0.7% gives good separation or resolution of large 5–10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2–1kb fragments.  Up to 3% can be used for separating very tiny fragments but a vertical [[polyacrylamide gel]] would be more appropriate for resolving small fragments.  High concentrations gel however requires longer run times (sometimes days) and high percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly. High percentage agarose gels should be run with PFGE or FIGE.  Low percentage gels (0.1−0.2%) are fragile and may break. 1% gels are common for many applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agarose gel electrophoresis (basic method)|url=http://www.methodbook.net/dna/agarogel.html|work=Biological Protocols|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied field===
At low voltages, the rate of migration of the DNA is proportional to the voltage applied, i.e. the higher the voltage, the faster the DNA moves.   However, in increasing electric field strength, the mobility of high-molecular-weight DNA fragments increases differentially, and the effective range of separation decreases and resolution therefore is lower at high voltage. For optimal resolution of DNA greater than 2kb in size in standard gel electrophoresis, 5 to 8 V/cm is recommended.&lt;ref name=sambrook1/&gt;  Voltage is also limited by the fact that it heats the gel and may cause the gel to melt if a gel is run at high voltage for a prolonged period, particularly for low-melting point agarose gel.

The mobility of DNA however may change in an unsteady field.  In a field that is periodically reversed, the mobility of DNA of a particular size may drop significantly at a particular cycling frequency.&lt;ref name="zimm"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics |year= 1992 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=171–204 |title=Problems and prospects in the theory of gel electrophoresis of DNA |vauthors=Zimm BH, Levene SD |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/teaching/ufk_papers/electrokinetics/zimm.pdf |pmid= 1518924 |doi=10.1017/s0033583500004662}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon can result in band inversion whereby larger DNA fragments move faster than smaller ones in PFGE.

==Mechanism of migration and separation==

The negative charge of its phosphate backbone moves the DNA towards the positively charged anode during electrophoresis. However, the migration of DNA molecules in solution, in the absence of a gel matrix, is independent of molecular weight during electrophoresis, i.e. there is no separation by size without a gel matrix.&lt;ref name="old &amp; primrose"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principle of Gene Manipulation - An Introduction to Genetic Engineering |author1=Robert W. Old |author2=Sandy B. Primrose |page=9 |publisher=Blackwell Scientific |edition=5th |isbn=9780632037124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrodynamic interaction between different parts of the DNA are cut off by streaming counterions moving in the opposite direction, so no mechanism exists to generate a dependence of velocity on length on a scale larger than screening length of about 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="zimm"/&gt; This makes it different from other processes such as sedimentation or diffusion where long-ranged hydrodynamic interaction are important.

The gel matrix is therefore responsible for the separation of DNA by size during electrophoresis, however the precise mechanism responsible the separation is not entirely clear.  A number of models exists for the mechanism of separation of biomolecules in gel matrix, a widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve consisting of randomly distributed network of inter-connected pores.&lt;ref name="microfluidics"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wyBp-vKbdcC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Microfluidics for Biological Applications |editor1=Tian, Wei-Cheng |editor2=Finehout, Erin |chapter=Chapter 4 - Genetic Analysis in Miniaturized Electrophoresis Systems |author1=Li Zhu |author2=Hong Wang |page=125 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-09480-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A globular protein or a [[random coil]] DNA moves through the connected pores large enough to accommodate its passage, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this process of sieving.&lt;ref name="zimm" /&gt;

The Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule.  For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a [[reptation]] model (or its variants) is most commonly used.  This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a "snake-like" fashion (hence "reptation") through the pores as an elongated molecule.  At higher electric field strength, this turned into a biased reptation model, whereby the leading end of the molecule become strongly biased in the forward direction, and this leading edge pulls the rest of the molecule along.  In the fully biased mode, the mobility reached a saturation point and DNA beyond a certain size cannot be separated.&lt;ref name="microfluidics" /&gt;  Perfect parallel alignment of the chain with the field however is not observed in practice as that would mean the same mobility for long and short molecules.&lt;ref name="zimm" /&gt; Further refinement of the biased reptation model takes into account of the internal fluctuations of the chain.&lt;ref name=viovy /&gt;

The biased reptation model has also been used to explain the mobility of DNA in PFGE.  The orientation of the DNA is progressively built up by reptation after the onset of a field, and the time it reached the steady state velocity is dependent on the size of the molecule.  When the field is changed, larger molecules take longer to reorientate, it is therefore possible to discriminate between the long chains that cannot reach its steady state velocity from the short ones that travel most of the time in steady velocity.&lt;ref name=viovy&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume= 72 |pages= 813–872 |year=2000 |title=Electrophoresis of DNA and other polyelectrolytes: Physical mechanisms|author=Jean-Louis Viovy  |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.72.813 |bibcode=2000RvMP...72..813V}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other models, however, also exist.

Real-time fluorescence microscopy of stained molecules showed more subtle dynamics during electrophoresis, with the DNA showing considerable elasticity as it alternately stretching in the direction of the applied field and then contracting into a ball, or becoming hooked into a U-shape when it gets caught on the polymer fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith SB, Aldridge PK, Callis JB  |title=Observation of individual DNA molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis |journal=Science |volume=243 |issue=4888 |pages=203–206 |year=1989 |pmid= 2911733 |doi=10.1126/science.2911733|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..203S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature |year=1989|volume=338 |issue=6215|pages=520–2 |title=Conformational dynamics of individual DNA molecules during gel electrophoresis |vauthors=Schwartz DC, Koval M |pmid=2927511 |doi=10.1038/338520a0|bibcode = 1989Natur.338..520S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This observation  may be termed the "caterpillar" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Physical Biochemistry: Principles and Applications |author= David Sheehan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AxxbYlsuZrwC&amp;pg=PT352&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=181|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn= 978-0470856031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other model proposes that the DNA gets entangled with the polymer matrix, and the larger the molecule, the more likely it is to become entangled and its movement impeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electrophoresis |year=2009 |volume=30 |issue=12 |pages=2014–24 | doi=10.1002/elps.200900264 |title=DNA migration mechanism analyses for applications in capillary and microchip electrophoresis |vauthors=Forster RE, Hert DG, Chiesl TN, Fredlake CP, Barron AE |pmid=19582705 |pmc=2762034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualization==
[[File:Gel electrophoresis 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|DNA gel electrophoresis]]
The most common dye used to make DNA or RNA bands visible for agarose gel electrophoresis is [[ethidium bromide]], usually abbreviated as EtBr. It fluoresces under UV light when intercalated into the major groove of DNA (or RNA). By running DNA through an EtBr-treated gel and visualizing it with UV light, any band containing more than ~20&amp;nbsp;ng DNA becomes distinctly visible. EtBr is a known [[mutagen]]{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, and safer alternatives are available, such as [[GelRed]], produced by [[Biotium]], which binds to the minor groove.&lt;ref&gt;[https://biotium.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GelRed-GelGreen-PAGE-Gel-Stains-flyer.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SYBR Green|SYBR Green I]] is another dsDNA stain, produced by [[Invitrogen]]. It is more expensive, but 25 times more sensitive, and possibly safer than EtBr, though there is no data addressing its mutagenicity or toxicity in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp07567.pdf SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SYBR Safe]] is a variant of SYBR Green that has been shown to have low enough levels of mutagenicity and toxicity to be deemed nonhazardous waste under U.S. Federal regulations.&lt;ref name="probes.invitrogen.com"&gt;[http://probes.invitrogen.com/media/pis/mp33100.pdf SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has similar sensitivity levels to EtBr,&lt;ref name="probes.invitrogen.com"/&gt; but, like SYBR Green, is significantly more expensive. In countries where safe disposal of hazardous waste is mandatory, the costs of EtBr disposal can easily outstrip the initial price difference, however.

Since EtBr stained DNA is not visible in natural light, scientists mix DNA with negatively charged '''loading buffers''' before adding the mixture to the gel. Loading buffers are useful because they are visible in natural light (as opposed to UV light for EtBr stained DNA), and they co-sediment with DNA (meaning they move at the same speed as DNA of a certain length). [[Xylene cyanol]] and [[Bromophenol blue]] are common dyes found in loading buffers; they run about the same speed as DNA fragments that are 5000 bp and 300 bp in length respectively, but the precise position varies with percentage of the gel. Other less frequently used progress markers are [[Cresol Red]] and [[Orange G]] which run at about 125 bp and 50 bp, respectively.

Visualization can also be achieved by transferring DNA after [[SDS-PAGE]] to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by exposure to a [[hybridization probe]]. This process is termed [[Southern blot]]ting.

For fluorescent dyes, after electrophoresis the gel is illuminated with an [[ultraviolet]] lamp (usually by placing it on a light box, while using protective gear to limit exposure to ultraviolet radiation). The illuminator apparatus mostly also contains imaging apparatus that takes an image of the gel, after illumination with UV radiation. The [[ethidium bromide]] [[fluorescence|fluoresces]] reddish-orange in the presence of DNA, since it has intercalated with the DNA. The DNA band can also be cut out of the gel, and can then be dissolved to retrieve the purified DNA.
The gel can then be photographed usually with a digital or polaroid camera. Although the stained nucleic acid fluoresces reddish-orange, images are usually shown in black and white (see figures). UV damage to the DNA sample can reduce the efficiency of subsequent manipulation of the sample, such as ligation and cloning. Shorter wavelength UV radiations (302 or 312 nm) cause greater damage, for example exposure for as little as 45 seconds can significantly reduce [[transformation efficiency]]. Therefore if the DNA is to be use for downstream procedures, exposure to a shorter wavelength UV radiations should be limited, instead  higher-wavelength UV radiation (365 nm) which cause less damage should be used. Higher wavelength radiations however produces weaker fluorescence, therefore if it is necessary to capture the gel image, a shorter wavelength UV light can be used a short time. Addition of [[Cytidine]] or [[guanosine]] to the electrophoresis buffer at 1 mM concentration may protect the DNA from damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Biotechniques |year=1996 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=898–903 |title=Protection of DNA during preparative agarose gel electrophoresis against damage induced by ultraviolet light |author=Gründemann D, Schömig E. |pmid =8922632 |url=http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00009/96215rr02_9961a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a blue light excitation source with a blue-excitable stain such as [[SYBR Green]] or [[GelGreen]] may be used.

Gel electrophoresis research often takes advantage of software-based image analysis tools, such as [[ImageJ]].

One of the key elements of these standards is the definition of [[Transducer electronic data sheet]]s (TEDS) for each transducer. The TEDS is a memory device attached to the transducer, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.  The goal of the IEEE 1451 family of standards is to allow the access of transducer data through a common set of interfaces whether the transducers are connected to systems or networks via a wired or wireless means.

== Transducer electronic data sheet ==

A '''transducer electronic data sheet''' (TEDS) is a standardized method of storing [[transducer]] ([[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s) identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  TEDS formats are defined in the IEEE 1451 set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society]]'s Sensor Technology Technical Committee that describe a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers  to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.

One of the key elements of the IEEE 1451 standards is the definition of TEDS for each transducer. The TEDS can be implemented as a memory device attached to the transducer and containing information needed by a measurement instrument or control system to interface with a transducer. TEDS can, however, be implemented in two ways.  First, the TEDS can reside in embedded memory, typically an [[EEPROM]], within the transducer itself which is connected to the measurement instrument or control system.  Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a data file accessible by the measurement instrument or control system. A virtual TEDS extends the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where embedded memory may not be available.

A sub-system of Intellipublia is the Joint Product Line.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Intellipublia's Joint Product Line (JPL) combines official agency review with emergent content for joint or "purple" output. Users can consume and compare "authorized" versions to the emergent "living" version. Agency logos quickly denote that official vetters have reviewed the content. In addition to agency logos, the "authority" and roles of vetters are denoted by color-coded stamps such as "team leader" and "final authority." Once the official vetters sign off on the content, their agency logo will become un-ghosted at the top. Ghosted logos show that someone from that agency has made edits but doesn't have a higher vetting function. This is modified MediaWiki software and shown in the edit history mode.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Rasmussen's Flickr account, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/97111850@N00/4390235472/ see graphic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Joke theft''' is the act of performing and taking credit for comic material written by another person without their [[consent]]. This is a form of [[plagiarism]] and can, in some cases, be [[copyright infringement]]. 
==History==
===Vaudeville years===
In [[music hall]]s and [[vaudeville]], it was common for performers to "borrow" material. According to [[Milton Berle]], [[etiquette]] only required that "the borrower add to the joke and make it his own".&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"&gt;Berle, Milton (1989) ''Private joke file'', ''Introduction'', p.xxiii quotation: {{quotation|Of course, in the days of vaudeville, it wasn't uncommon for a performer to "borrow" a joke from another performer. Etiquette demanded only that the borrower add to the joke and make it his own. Bert Williams, a star of the Ziegfeld Follies, pilfered a story about fish and added enough laughs to turn it into a classic fifteen-minute routine. Naturally, that routine happens to be in my file.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade. Most jokes at the time were one-liners and there was little in the way of proof of a joke's origin, but the value of each joke was immeasurable to a comedian.&lt;ref name="radartake"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Berle and [[Bob Hope]] had a long-standing feud due to Hope's accusation that Milton Berle had stolen some of his jokes.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt; Berle never disputed the claim, but instead embraced the title "The Thief of Bad Gag".

Even the most famous of comics have found themselves, knowingly or unknowingly, stealing material. [[Bill Cosby]] admitted to stealing a joke by George Carlin involving an uneducated football player doing a television commercial. Cosby said that what makes the routine his own is the surreal phrase "little tiny hairs".&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24,1,6252669,full.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |title=Funny, that was my joke |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Welkos |first=Robert W. |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221013725/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-et-joketheft24jul24%2C1%2C6252669%2Cfull.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=5&amp;cset=true |archivedate=21 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Cosby, Bill|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AikgyewBn8k|title=Late Show with David Letterman – Bill Cosby's Race Against George Carlin|publisher=[[CBS]]|medium=TV|date=2009-06-01|accessdate=2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years later, [[Carlos Mencia]] performed a bit about athletes and their parents that hearkened back to a Cosby bit from his album ''[[Bill Cosby: Himself]]''.

===1970s===
In the 1970s, joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The 1980s and 1990s saw the popularity of [[stand-up comedy]] continue to increase. The advent of pay-cable networks afforded comics the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft in which the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.

[[Robin Williams]] was accused of stealing material from another comic. [[David Brenner]] claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.&lt;ref name="Comedy at the Edge"&gt;{{cite book | title=Comedy at the Edge | author=Richard Zoglin | year=2008 | publisher=Bloomsbury USA | isbn=978-1582346243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
For many years, [[Denis Leary]] had been friends with fellow comedian [[Bill Hicks]]. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1993 album ''No Cure For Cancer'', he felt Leary had stolen his act and material, and the friendship ended abruptly as a result.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bill Hicks: Agent of Evolution | author=[[Kevin Booth]] and Michael Bertin | year=2005 | publisher=Harper Collins | isbn=0-00-719829-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude.&lt;ref name="evolutionBook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170  |title=Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief | author=Joe Rogan | publisher=JoeRogan.net | year=2005 | accessdate=2006-10-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218140900/http://www.joerogan.net/main.php?archives=1&amp;article=44170 |archivedate = 2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |title=Joe Rogan answers 20 Questions | last=Rogan | first=Joe | work=Playboy Magazine |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hicksfaq"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320081614/http://www.billhicks.com/darktimes/other/darktimes20/faq/faq.html | title=Dark Times: Bill Hicks: Frequently Asked Questions | author=Tim McIntire | year=1998 | publisher=BillHicks.com | archivedate=2006-03-20 | accessdate=2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from [[pancreatic cancer]], an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; "Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer").&lt;ref name="hicksfaq" /&gt;

In a 2008 appearance on ''The Opie and Anthony Show'', comedian [[Louis C.K.]] claimed that Leary stole his "I'm an asshole" routine, which was then expanded upon and turned into a hit song by Leary.&lt;ref name="Berle1989xxiii"/&gt; On a later episode of the same show, Leary challenged this assertion by claiming that he (Leary) co-wrote the song with Chris Phillips.&lt;ref name="radartake"/&gt;

In his memoir ''[[Gasping for Airtime]]'', [[Jay Mohr]] admitted that he lifted an entire routine from [[Rick Shapiro]]'s act for a 1995 ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued the show and was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Jay|title=Gasping for Airtime: Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live|date=2004|publisher=Hyperion Books|isbn=1401300065|pages=276–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s and 2010s===
Louis C.K. has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with [[Dane Cook]] over three bits on Cook's album, ''Retaliation'', that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on C.K.'s album ''Live in Houston''.  C.K. and Cook portray this rivalry with comedy and sincerity in an episode of C.K.'s series ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecomicscomic.com/2011/08/05/dane-cook-confronts-louis-ck-in-an-honest-way-about-joke-theft-read-the-transcript-watch-the-video/ | title = Dane Cook confronts Louis CK in an honest way about joke theft.

[[George Lopez]] has accused Carlos Mencia of plagiarizing his material and claimed that the two once had a physical altercation over the alleged plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |author=Goldyn, Debra |title=Is Carlos Mencia a thief? |work=Advocate |publisher=[[University of Colorado at Denver]] |date=2007-05-02 |accessdate=2007-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007092111/http://media.www.ucdadvocate.com/media/storage/paper538/news/2007/05/02/BonusBytes/Is.Carlos.Mencia.A.Thief-2891990.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fellow comedian Ted Sarnowski countered this claim and stated that it was he, not Lopez, who had originally penned the joke and that he had given Mencia permission to use it when he discovered that Lopez had stolen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216161529/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=5264&amp;IssueNum=199|archivedate=16 February 2008|author=Kozlowski, Carl|title=Carlos Mencia Just Said That|work=|publisher=Los Angeles CityBeat|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Italian comic and satirist [[Daniele Luttazzi]] was accused by anonymous bloggers of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as [[George Carlin]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[Chris Rock]], [[Bill Hicks]] and [[Robert Schimmel]].&lt;ref name="rep_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/2010/06/09/news/luttazzi-secopia-4703064/ |title=La Rete contro Luttazzi: "Copia" I dubbi dei fan, il tam-tam cresce – Repubblica.it |accessdate=2010-06-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |title=Luttazzi copia – Parte 1 |accessdate=2010-06-11 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612084318/http://video.unita.it/media/Politica/Luttazzi_copia_Parte_1_1395.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a personal blog entry published five years prior, Luttazzi himself offered his blog readers a prize if they were able to identify a "nugget" (i.e. a reference to a famous joke), calling the game a "treasure hunt".&lt;ref name="blo_lut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://danieleluttazzi.blogspot.com/|title=Caccia al tesoro|author=Luttazzi, Daniele}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against [[La7]] broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show "Decameron", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. Luttazzi got 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros as compensation.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_10/satira-tv-luttazzi-vince-causa-contro-la-7-franco_69183226-6a83-11e1-8b63-010bde402ef9.shtml|title=Luttazzi vince la causa contro La7|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012|publisher=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this ruse "the [[Lenny Bruce]] trick" (named for the comic of same name).  Luttazzi asserts that the jokes he references are not "plagiarized" but "calqued", which is a fair use of original material. In 2014, an academic paper explained why Luttazzi's jokes are his own and not "plagiarised" ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caimotto|first1=M.Cristina|title=Transcreating a New Kind of Humor: the case of Daniele Luttazzi|url=http://www.cultusjournal.com/index.php/archive/16-issue-2014-v-7-transcreation-and-the-professions|website=cultusjournal.com|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[Australia's Got Talent]]'' contestant Jordan Paris presented an act of stand-up comedy and quickly proceeded to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, G 2011, '[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/comedy/australias-got-plagiarism-ripoff-comic-exposed-20110526-1f50v.html Australia's Got Plagiarism: rip-off comic exposed]', ''Brisbane Times'' 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians [[Lee Mack]] and [[Geoff Keith]]. The television network gave him a chance to redeem himself and allowed him to compete in the semi-finals using his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well – "I just sacked my two writers – Copy and Paste" – had been done in 2009 by comedian [[Jeffrey Ross]], about [[Brad Garrett]], at a roast of [[Joan Rivers]]. Ross had said, "This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste."&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, D 2011, [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/oops-he-did-it-again-ripoff-comic-plunders-joke-about-plagiarism-20110629-1gq1d.html 'Oops.

In January 2012, blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the [[social networking]] site Facebook&lt;ref name="facebook1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Occupy-Troy-Holm/217011661714006 |title=Occupy Troy Holm |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for stealing jokes and stories from comedian [[Doug Stanhope]] and posting them to his blog from 2010, [[plagiarism|claiming them as his own work]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701002315/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/working-hardprisondrug-war.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; including Stanhope's "Fuck someone uglier than you" routine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103154727/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/07/fuck-someone-ugly.html |archivedate=3 January 2012 |title=Fuck Someone Ugly|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was found on Stanhope's ''Acid Bootleg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Doug+Stanhope/ACID+Bootleg |title=ACID Bootleg – Doug Stanhope – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute&lt;ref&gt;[[Sicko (album)]]&lt;/ref&gt; nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701001921/http://exmypa.blogspot.com/2010/06/hooker-story-and-dmt-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the "Occupy Troy Holm" Movement.&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;  Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that "To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that ''isn't'' mine?"&lt;ref name="facebook1"/&gt;

==In other media==
Joke theft is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often jokes in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.
[[Dick Cavett]] wrote about joke theft in his autobiography. He'd written a bit about eating Chinese-German food and, an hour later, being hungry for power. After a few days of performing the bit, he discovered a column by [[Earl Wilson (columnist)|Earl Wilson]] which attributed the joke to [[Rip Taylor]]. However, after calling Taylor to ask him to stop using the bit, he discovered that not only had Taylor never performed the bit, he had never even heard it and laughed heartily at the joke's humor. It was then that Cavett discovered that some journalists often falsely attribute jokes to the wrong comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cavett | author=Dick Cavett, Christopher Porterfield | year=1974| publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |pages=227–228| isbn=978-0151161300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavett and [[Woody Allen]] often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other. Allen's jokes, when he still lacked access to television, were regularly stolen by top mainstream shows ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh In]]''.&lt;ref name="Cavett interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheckymagazine.com/cavett.htm |title=SHECKY! Interview: DICK CAVETT! |publisher=Sheckymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-07-11}} quotation: {{quotation|Woody's best lines would show up, while he was still confined to little Village clubs, on the Red Skelton show and that alleged entertainment, Laugh-In.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proved extremely painful to Allen.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', including "[[Missionary: Impossible]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XIII]]" and "[[The Italian Bob]]" have poked fun at ''[[Family Guy]]'', implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from the Simpsons. However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771 | title = Interview: Matt Groening | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | author = Nathan Rabin | date = 2006-04-26 | work = The A.V.

In 2017 the Australian television show host [[Grant Denyer]] was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Grill Team]]'', which is on [[2MMM]]. In the interview, ''The Grill Team''{{'}}s co-host [[Matty Johns]] told an amusing anecdote about introducing a child to the board game ''[[Test Match (board game)|Test Match]]''. Later that morning, Grant Denyer was interviewed on the radio programme ''[[The Kyle and Jackie O Show]]'', which is on [[KIIS 106.5]]. In that interview, he told the same anecdote about ''Test Match'', passing it off as his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://au.be.yahoo.com/entertainment/celebrity/a/34283262/grant-denyer-banned-from-triple-m-and-kiis-fm-radio-stations-for-stealing-story-yahoo7-be/#page1 | title = Grant Denyer Banned From Triple M and KIIS FM Radio Stations For Stealing Story | accessdate = 2017-01-28 | author = Leah Cohen | date = 2017-01-28 | work = Yahoo7Be | publisher = Yahoo!7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recourse and consequences==
There is, historically, very little [[legal recourse]] taken in cases of joke theft. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. [[W. C. Fields]] reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a thieving comic's legs broken.&lt;ref name="radartake" /&gt;

"You have a better chance of stopping a serial killer than a serial thief in comedy," said comedian [[David Brenner]]. "If we could protect our jokes, I'd be a retired billionaire in Europe somewhere – and what I just said is original."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/24/entertainment/et-joketheft24|title=Funny, that was my joke|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|date=2007-07-24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2018 study in the ''American Sociological Review'', "most instances of possible joke theft are ambiguous owing to the potential for simultaneous and coincidental discovery".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Patrick|date=2018-08-17|title=No Laughter among Thieves: Authenticity and the Enforcement of Community Norms in Stand-Up Comedy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418791174|journal=American Sociological Review|language=en|pages=000312241879117|doi=10.1177/0003122418791174|issn=0003-1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"that accusations are not strongly coupled to jokes’ similarity, and enforcement depends mainly on the extent to which insiders view the comic in question as being authentic to the community. Comics who are oriented toward external rewards, have a track record of anti-social behavior, and exhibit lackluster on-stage craft are vulnerable to joke theft accusations even in borderline cases because those inauthentic characteristics are typical of transgressors. Vulnerability is greatest for comics who enjoy commercial success despite low peer esteem."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Details==
The mechanism exploits the [[critical slowing down]] in the neighbourhood of the critical point, this is, the divergence of the [[relaxation time]] of the system.
As the system approaches the critical point from the high symmetry phase, its dynamics becomes increasingly slow, and eventually ceases to be [[adiabatic]]. 
Under a linear quench of the control parameter, this happens at the freeze-out time scale, when the relaxation time matches the time left for the system to reach  the critical point.  KZM predicts the typical size of the domains in the broken symmetry phase to be fixed by the value of the equilibrium correlation length at freeze-out time. The inverse of this length scale can be used as an estimate of the density of topological defects, and it obeys a power law in the quench rate. This prediction is universal, and the power exponent is given in terms of the [[critical exponents]] of the transition.

The KZM generally applies to spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios where a [[global symmetry]] is broken.
For [[Gauge symmetry (mathematics)|gauge symmetries]] defect formation can arise through the KZM and the flux trapping mechanism  proposed by Hindmarsh and Rajantie.&lt;ref name=HR00&gt;

==Derivation of the defect density==
Let us consider a system that undergoes a continuous phase transition at the critical value &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \lambda_c = 0&lt;/math&gt; of a control parameter. 
The theory of critical phenomena states that, as the control parameter is tuned closer and closer to its critical value, the correlation length and the relaxation time of the system tend to diverge as
&lt;math display='block'&gt;
\xi  \sim \lambda^{-\nu}, \qquad
\tau \sim \lambda^{-z\nu},
&lt;/math&gt;
respectively. The KZM describes the nonadiabatic dynamics resulting from driving a high symmetry phase &lt;math&gt;\lambda\ll0&lt;/math&gt; to a broken symmetry phase at &lt;math&gt;\lambda\gg0&lt;/math&gt;. If the control parameter varies linearly in time, &lt;math&gt;\lambda(t) = vt&lt;/math&gt;, equating the time to the critical point to the relaxation time, we obtain the freeze out time &lt;math&gt;\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math display='block'&gt;
\bar{t} = [\lambda(\bar{t})]^{-z\nu} \Rightarrow \bar{t} \sim v^{-z\nu / (1+z\nu)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This time scale is often referred to as the freeze-out time. As the system approaches the critical point, it ''freezes'' as a result of the critical slowing down and falls out of equilibrium.  Adiabaticity is lost 
around &lt;math&gt;-\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Adiabaticity is restored in the broken symmetry phase after &lt;math&gt;+\bar{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The correlation length at this time provides a length scale for coherent domains,
&lt;math display='block'&gt;
\bar{\xi} \equiv \xi[\lambda(\bar{t})] \sim v^{-\nu/(1+z\nu)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The size of the domains in the broken symmetry phase is set by &lt;math&gt;\bar{\xi}&lt;/math&gt;. The density of defects immediately follows, using &lt;math&gt;\rho \sim \bar{\xi}^{-d}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is achieved through developing school based [[curricula]] that "engage students interactively with their surrounding environment". Ideally, learnscapes incorporate educational, environmental and social outcomes that reflect the character of the community as well as the school site.

'''NuCaptcha''' is an early fraud detection service which utilises behavior analytics to provision threat appropriate, animated video [[CAPTCHA]]'s. NuCaptcha is developed and operated by [[Canada|Canadian]]-based firm, NuData Security.&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/07/01/animated_captcha/|title=Animated CAPTCHA tech aims to fox spambots|work=[[The Register]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/NuCaptcha-Flash-CAPTCHAs-to-combat-spambots-1032147.html|title=NuCaptcha Flash CAPTCHAs to combat spambots|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Company-Looks-to-Slow-Spammers-With-Video-CAPTCHA-Technology-127193/|title=Spammers to Face Video CAPTCHA Technology - Security from eWeek|work=[[eWeek]]|accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit|url=http://agendabuilder.gartner.com/SEC19/webpages/VendorDetail.aspx?Vendor=96|work=[[Gartner]]|accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Static image-based CAPTCHAs are routinely used to prevent automated sign-ups to websites by using text or images of words disguised so that [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) software has trouble reading them.&lt;ref name="reg" /&gt; However, in common CAPTCHA systems, users often fail to correctly solve the CAPTCHA 7% - 25% of the time.&lt;ref name="captcha-evaluation"&gt;{{cite web |first=Elie|last=Bursztein |author2=Bethard, Steven |author3=Fabry, Celine |author4=Mitchell, John C. |author5= Jurafsky, Dan  |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/burszstein_2010_captcha.pdf|title= How Good are Humans at Solving CAPTCHAS? A Large Scale Evaluation|publisher=Stanford University |date=March 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; NuCaptcha uses animated video technology that it claims make puzzles easier for humans to solve, but harder for bots and hackers to decipher.&lt;ref name="reg" /&gt;
[[File:NuCaptcha logo.png|right|frameless]]

== Technology ==
NuCaptcha attempts to solve usability of static image-based CAPTCHAS using two main technologies: 1) video animation to display CAPTCHA puzzles, and 2) a behaviour analysis system to monitor interactions with the platform.
# Video animation. CAPTCHAS are displayed as a video, and rendered in the web browser.  A variety of technologies can be used to display the animated CAPTCHA, such as Flash video, HTML5, or GIF.  Standard CAPTCHA techniques such as character crowding, once animated, are easier for humans to detect because of an innate motion-detecting ability.
# Behavior Analysis. Using machine-learning algorithms, NuCaptcha monitors platform interactions to tune the security of each CAPTCHA delivered to the user. Suspected attackers are given progressively more secure CAPTCHAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/nucatpcha_introduces_video_CAPTCHAS_better_securit.php|title=Video CAPTCHAs Promise Better Security, Less Frustration|work=Read, Write, Web|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security ==
Security researcher [[Elie Bursztein]] demonstrated a practical attack against NuCaptcha's video CAPTCHA scheme by employing [[optical flow]] techniques to isolate individual CAPTCHA characters. The proposed attack is able to break the video CAPTCHAs in more than 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="elinucaptcha"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bursztein|first=Elie|title=How we broke the NuCaptcha video scheme and what we propose to fix it|url=http://elie.im/blog/security/how-we-broke-the-nucaptcha-video-scheme-and-what-we-propose-to-fix-it/|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, NuCaptcha noted that Bursztein’s findings underscore the need for CAPTCHA puzzles to be part of a larger security construct, such as behavior monitoring to assess the risk of individual users. NuCaptcha also pointed out that the CAPTCHAS analyzed in Bursztein's blog post were middle-security puzzles focused on usability, and not the stronger puzzles presented to high-risk users.  In addition to this, NuCaptcha noted that the optical flow technique relies on static non-animated features of the puzzle.  Changes were made to NuCaptcha puzzles to remove the static non-animated features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9OASUKWKndeMmZlZDYzNDEtZjBhOS00N2NhLTgwNGYtMWYyYmJlYzRhNjQ2/edit|title= NuCaptcha’s Thoughts on Elie Bursztein’s Document|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
NuCaptcha APIs are currently available in [[PHP]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Plugins are available for [[WordPress]], [[Drupal]], [[Codelgniter]], [[vBulletin]], and [[phpBB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.nuCAPTCHA.com |title= NuCaptcha Docs |work=NuCaptcha|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, NuCaptcha announced its CAPTCHA solutions for mobile devices across all platforms, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nuCAPTCHA.com/press-release/nuCAPTCHA-extends-user-friendly-CAPTCHAS-to-mobile-phones-tablets-and-other-connected-devices |title= NuCaptcha Extends User-Friendly Captchas to Mobile Phones, Tablets and other Connected Devices |work=Press Release|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nurturant parent model''' also "Nurturing Parent" is a metaphor, for a belief system, which is built upon an underlying value system.  In this Nurturant Parenting contrasts with Stern Father parenting (Strict Father) as two distinct metaphors each used as icons of contrasting value and political systems, i.e. Regressive (Strict Father) and Nurturing Parent as Progressive .  

The Nurturant Parent metaphor draws on [[Parenting styles|parenting style]].  The ideal, effective Nurturing Parent gives his children both "roots in the ground and wings to fly." He or she does this by imparting, conveying, role-modeling and enforcing boundaries which encourage the child towards personal freedom (try out your new wings).  The Nurturant Parent model has a healthy respect for children's inherent intelligence.  As safe and appropriate, they can and should be allowed to explore their environment. Parents are responsible for protecting their child from serious mistakes, by offering guidance. A child will be picked up if the child cries because the parent wants the child to feel safe and supported. If a child grows up believing its needs are likely to be met, it will be more confident when facing challenges.

At the same time or alternately as appropriate, the Nurturant Parent encourages the child to have deep and peaceful roots in the ground thru managed exercise of the child's own self-discipline, self-connection, age-appropriate house chores, limited allowance, discussion of both Feelings and Thoughts and mutually healthy boundaries with strangers, friends and adults generally. 

The above was originally expressed more simply as 'a family model where children are expected to explore their surroundings; at the same time, being protected by their parents.' 

Other ideas:

* True discipline is much more than strict, unquestioning obedience.  Mutual [[respect]] and [[compassion]] are also rights.
* The outside world is no more inherently hostile than it is inherently friendly; stay alert, the world  commands respect
* Mutual respect and compassion is best taught by example.

== Research ==

This model is based on a study conducted by the Boston College Graduate Program in [[Human development (psychology)|Human Development]]{{fact|date=August 2012}} where researchers were investigating the [[Parenting styles|parenting style]] preferred by parents of extraordinarily creative children. Most parenting books recommend the [[Parenting_styles#Authoritative_parenting|authoritative style]].{{fact|date=August 2012}} The researchers discovered another parenting style which they called "the nurturing parent" that focuses on responsibility, [[empathy]], and [[creativity]]. The basic approach these parents used was to:

* Trust in their children's fairness and good judgment
* Respect their children's [[autonomy]], thoughts and feelings
* Support their children's interests and goals
* Enjoy their children's company
* Protect their children from doing injury to self or others, not by establishing rules but by communicating values and discussing their children's behavior with them
* Modeling the [[self-control]], [[Sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] they believe their children will need&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dacey |first=J. S. |last2=Packer |first2=A. J. |year=1992 |title=The Nurturing Parent: How to Raise Creative, Loving, Responsible Children |location=New York |publisher=Fireside, Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-671-77145-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further mentions ==

Herbert Jay Rosenfield ([[Social_work|LCSW]]) in his unfinished book ''Caring Parents: a Guide to Successful Parenting'' encourages use of the acronym "RECEPEE", for "'''R'''easonable '''E'''xpectations, '''C'''learly '''E'''xpressed, '''P'''erformed '''E'''veryday and by '''E'''xample". "The factors that children need to develop good self-esteem...are primarily 'gifts' from us parents!" writes Rosenfield, who offers another acronym "UCARE":

* '''U'''niqueness that is positive, achieved through praise, encouragement, and positive feedback
* '''C'''onnectiveness to family, to extended family, and to a neighborhood that is safe, healthy and moderate
* '''A'''ge-appropriate autonomy: responsibilities and privileges that parallel their age and capabilities
* '''R'''ole '''E'''xamples: parent models with good self-esteem and behavior, whom they can emulate

Reverend George Englehardt stated succinctly, in 1991, that "parental responsibility is to provide their children with a safe, loving, nurturing environment".

The nurturant parent model is also discussed by [[George Lakoff]] in his books, including ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and ''Whose Freedom?'' In these books, the nurturant parent model is contrasted with the [[strict father model]]. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then [[progressivism|progressive]] politics correspond to the nurturant parent model. For example, progressives want the government to make sure that the citizens are protected and assisted to achieve their potential. This might take the form of tough environmental regulations or healthcare assistance.

The model is also consistent with [[slow parenting]] in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow parenting might go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.

'''''Printing and the Mind of Man''''' is a book first published in 1967 and based on an exhibition in 1963. 

'''''PMM''''', as it is usually abbreviated, is regarded as a standard [[Bibliography|bibliographical]] reference, and offers a survey of the impact of [[printing|printed books]] on the development of [[western culture|western civilization]].

The book developed from an exhibition put on at two locations to coincide with the 1963 [[International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition]] (IPEX). At the behest of typographer [[Stanley Morison]] it was decided to put together an exhibition of the contribution printing had made to the enlargement of human knowledge. A display at [[Earls Court]] concentrated on the technical side of printing, while a display at the [[British Museum]] looked more at fine printing. However, both displays had the quite novel intention of promoting the study of books for their role in advancing factual knowledge, rather than for their aesthetics. [[Ian Fleming]], who lent 40 books from his library, was among the private collectors who contributed to the exhibition.

The catalogue, (which might be considered the pre-first edition of ''PMM'') was printed by [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[John_Carter_(author)|John Carter]], Stanley Morison, Percy H. Muir and others and entitled: ''Catalogue of a display of printing mechanisms and printed materials arranged to illustrate the history of Western civilization and the means of the multiplication of literary texts since the 15th century, organised in connection with the eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, under the title Printing and the Mind of Man, assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16–27 July 1963''.

A book-length edition, revised and enlarged, was printed at [[Cambridge University Press]] and published in 1967 by [[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]] in London and Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston in New York. This first book edition was entitled '''''Printing and the Mind of Man, a descriptive catalogue illustrating the impact of print on the evolution of Western civilization during five centuries'''''. It was edited by John Carter and Percy H. Muir and expanded upon the theme of the impact of printing on human thought.

A second revised edition was published in 1983 by Karl Pressler in [[Munich]] ({{ISBN|3-9800047-3-2}}).

      <comment>I added some information on what exactly the progress zone does and how different periods of time in it can effect limb development with a reference to back the information up.</comment>

The '''progress zone''' is a layer of [[mesodermal]] cells immediately beneath the [[apical ectodermal ridge]] in the developing [[limb bud]]. The fate of the mesodermal cells is thought to be patterned by the length of time spent in the progress zone during limb outgrowth.&lt;ref name="refname1" group="Ref"/&gt; However, some recent evidence using [[microinjection|microinjected]] embryos suggests that the cells are prespecified early in limb bud development.&lt;ref name = "refname2" group = "Ref"/&gt;

The '''progress zone''' acts as positional information to tell which cells to develop into the limb. If cells spend a very short time in this area as they receive signals from the ridge, then more proximal limb structures are not able to develop even if distal ones can. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|date=2002|title=The Progress Zone Model for specifying Positional Information|url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper.php?doi=12455622&amp;a=f|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|volume=46|pages=869-870|via=ijdb.ehu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''reducing atmosphere''' is an [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] condition in which [[oxidation]] is prevented by removal of [[oxygen]] and other oxidizing gases or vapours, and which may contain actively [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] such as [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and gases such as [[hydrogen sulphide]] that would be oxidized by any present oxygen.

== Materials processing ==
In metal processing, a reducing atmosphere is used in [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] ovens for relaxation of metal [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] without corroding the metal. A non oxidizing gas, usually [[nitrogen]], is used, or for more extreme conditions, hydrogen gas.

A reducing atmosphere is also used to produce specific effects on [[ceramic]] wares being fired. A [[redox|reduction]] atmosphere is produced in a fuel fired kiln by reducing the draft and depriving the kiln of [[oxygen]]. This diminished level of oxygen causes incomplete combustion of the fuel and raises the level of carbon inside the kiln. At high temperatures the carbon will bond with and remove the oxygen in the metal oxides used as colorants in the glazes. This loss of oxygen results in a change in the color of the glazes because it allows the metals in the glaze to be seen in an unoxidized form. A reduction atmosphere can also affect the color of the clay body. If iron is present in the clay body, as it is in most [[stoneware]], then it will be affected by the reduction atmosphere as well.

In most commercial [[Incineration|incinerator]]s, exactly the same conditions are created to encourage the release of carbon bearing fumes. These fumes are then oxidized in reburn tunnels where oxygen is injected progressively. The exothermic oxidation reaction maintains the temperature of the reburn tunnels. This system allows lower temperatures to be employed in the incinerator section, where the solids are volumetrically reduced.

== Planetary atmospheres ==
The same principle applies to planets. Many scientists think the early Earth had a reducing atmosphere, along with Mars and Venus. This would have proven to be a good environment for ''[[Cyanobacteria]]'' to evolve the first [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic metabolic pathways]] which gradually increased the oxygen portion of the atmosphere, changing it to what is known as an oxidizing atmosphere. With increased levels of oxygen, the evolution of the more efficient aerobic respiration might have been enabled, allowing animal life to evolve and thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14820078.300-structure-of-the-earths-atmosphere.html?full=true|title=Structure of the Earth's atmosphere |accessdate= |author=Gribbin, J. |date=1995-12-09|work= |publisher=New Scientist, 2007 |pages=1 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most scientists conceive of the early atmosphere as reducing, a 2011 article in ''Nature'' found that [[cerium]] oxidation in [[zircon]]—which comprises the oldest rocks on Earth at roughly 4.4 billion years of age—was comparable to that of present-day lava.  This observation implies that [[Hadean]] atmospheric oxygen levels were similar to those of today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7375/full/nature10655.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The results do not, however, run contrary to existing theories on life’s journey from anaerobic to aerobic organisms. The results quantify the nature of gas molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur in the earliest atmosphere, but they shed no light on the much later rise of free oxygen in the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://nai.nasa.gov/articles/2011/12/2/earths-early-atmosphere-an-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a hard vacuum, [[interplanetary space]] is reducing, because [[solar wind]] consists mostly of [[hydrogen]] plasma. The Moon is directly exposed to solar wind, such that sodium is reduced and evaporated to produce the [[sodium tail of the Moon]] (see [[atmosphere of the Moon]]).

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Robbins algebra''' is an [[Universal algebra#Basic idea|algebra]] containing a single [[binary operation]], usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;, and a single [[unary operation]] usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;. These operations satisfy the following [[Universal algebra#Equations|axioms]]:

For all elements ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'':
# [[Associativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor \left(b \lor c \right) = \left(a \lor b \right) \lor c&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Commutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor b = b \lor a&lt;/math&gt;
# ''Robbins equation'': &lt;math&gt;\neg \left( \neg \left(a \lor b \right) \lor \neg \left(a \lor \neg b \right) \right) = a&lt;/math&gt;

For many years, it was conjectured, but unproven, that all Robbins algebras are [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.  This was proved in 1996, so the term "Robbins algebra" is now simply a synonym for "Boolean algebra".

== History ==
In 1933, [[Edward Huntington]] proposed a new set of axioms for Boolean algebras, consisting of (1) and (2) above, plus: 
*''Huntington's equation'': &lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg a \lor b) \lor \neg(\neg a \lor \neg b) = a.&lt;/math&gt;
From these axioms, Huntington derived the usual axioms of Boolean algebra.

Very soon thereafter, [[Herbert Robbins]] posed the "Robbins conjecture", namely that the Huntington equation could be replaced with what came to be called the Robbins equation, and the result would still be [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; would interpret Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|join]] and &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|complement]]. Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|meet]] and the constants 0 and 1 are easily defined from the Robbins algebra primitives. Pending verification of the conjecture, the system of Robbins was called "Robbins algebra."

Verifying the Robbins conjecture required proving Huntington's equation, or some other axiomatization of a Boolean algebra, as theorems of a Robbins algebra. Huntington, Robbins, [[Alfred Tarski]], and others worked on the problem, but failed to find a proof or counterexample.

[[William McCune]] proved the conjecture in 1996, using the [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem prover]] [[EQP]]. For a complete proof of the Robbins conjecture in one consistent notation and following McCune closely, see Mann (2003). Dahn (1998) simplified McCune's machine proof.

"'''Sit on My Face'''" is a short song by the members of the comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] which originally appeared on the album ''[[Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album]]'' and later appeared on the compilation ''[[Monty Python Sings]]''. Written by [[Eric Idle]], the song's lyrics are sung to the [[melody]] of "[[Sing As We Go]]" by [[Gracie Fields]]. The opening gives way to the voices of [[The Fred Tomlinson Singers]] singing "Sit on my face and tell me that you love me." The remaining lyrics contain numerous references to [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]], such as "when I'm between your thighs you blow me away" and "life can be fine if we both [[69 (sex position)|69]]".

The song opened the 1982 film ''[[Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]'', where it was lip-synched by [[Graham Chapman]], [[John Cleese]], [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Terry Jones]] dressed as waiters in a performance which, at the suggestion of Python touring member [[Neil Innes]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]'', episode 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ended with them revealing their bare backsides. In 2002, a similar rendition was mimed by Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Neil Innes at the [[Concert for George]], a memorial concert for [[George Harrison]] which took place at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. At the end of this rendition the four men turned their backs to face a portrait of [[George Harrison]], thereby revealing their naked [[buttocks]] and effectively [[mooning]] the Albert Hall audience. More recently it was featured as an animated number in ''[[A Liar's Autobiography: The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman|A Liar's Autobiography]]'', performed by the London Gay Men's Chorus, both on the recorded soundtrack and live, as a flash mob, during the screening shown during the London Film Festival. The song also opened the second half of Monty Python's [[Monty Python Live (mostly)|2014 reunion shows]] where it accompanied a suggestive dance routine by the 20-strong dance ensemble, with Eric Idle and Michael Palin encouraging an audience singalong. 

==Legal issues==
Prior to the album's release, Monty Python received legal threats for alleged [[copyright infringement]] due to the use of the tune of "Sing as We Go". Nonetheless, the Pythons decided to retain the song.

The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has ruled that the song is [[Actionable indecency|actionably indecent]], concluding that "despite English accent and 'ambient noise' … the lyrics were sufficiently understandable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/eb/Orders/2001/fcc01090.doc |title=Industry Guidance On the Commission’s Case Law Interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 1464 and Enforcement Policies Regarding Broadcast Indecency |accessdate=30 August 2007 |author=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |date=6 April 2001 |format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, it pursued legal action against [[KGB-FM]], a [[San Diego]], [[California]] [[classic rock]] [[radio station]], for playing the song,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Blecha|title=Taboo Tunes: A History of Banned Bands &amp; Censored Songs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5zCKz7aj9eQC&amp;pg=PA116 |year=2004 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-792-9 |page=116 |accessdate=7 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually forcing the station to pay [[US$]]9,200 in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/graphics/web-fcc970.html |title=FCC Indecency Fines, 1970-2004 |accessdate=30 August 2007 |last=Ahrens |first=Frank |year=2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French adaptation==
A [[French language]] rendition of the song presented in [[Edinburgh]] in 2003 translated the title as "Cum in My Mouth". According to [[record producer|producer]] Rémy Renoux, "Cum in My Mouth is … what Monty Python would have written today." Renoux also pointed out that a literal translation into French would not fit the melody of the song, and claimed that the translation met with the approval of the Monty Python team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ce perroquet est mort: Monty Python in French?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2178">'''Smelfungus''' is a name given by [[Laurence Sterne]] to [[Tobias Smollett]] as author of a volume of ''[[Travels through France and Italy]],'' for the snarling abuse he heaps on the institutions and customs of the countries he visited. 

The term "[[wikt:smellfungus|smellfungus]]" (pl. "smellfungi") thereafter passed into broader use to describe a grumbling traveller, and might even be applied to a faultfinder in general.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) pp. 76–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smollett in Europe==
Smollett's 1764 journey to the Continent took place in the wake of a family bereavement, and while he was in poor health—matters which may explain the sharp tone of many of his comments on people, things and places he saw.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 887 and p. 953&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example he described the [[Venus de Medici]] as having "no beauty in the features" and having an attitude which "is awkward and out of character"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;—prompting Sterne's remark that "he had fallen foul upon the goddess, and used her worse than a common strumpet".&lt;ref&gt;G. Petrie ed., ''Lawrence Sterne: A Sentimental Journey'' (1979) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; 

Revisionists have argued however that the "Smollett" in the ''Travels'' book is a character Smollett intentionally created, rather than him speaking in his own voice as Sterne (facetiously) implies.&lt;ref&gt;O. M. Brach ed., ''Tobias Smollett, Scotland's First Author'' (2007) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlyle's usage==

In the 19th century Smelfungus was adopted by [[Thomas Carlyle]] as a pen-name when he had any seriously severe criticisms to offer on things, particularly those that have gone or are going to the bad. Patrick Proctor Alexander also used the name in his book ''Mill and Carlyle'', which contrasted Carlyle's views with those of [[John Stuart Mill]]. Proctor's ''Occasional Discourse on Sauertieg by Smelfungus'' attacks Carlyle's more brutal ideas.

[[File:SoriDicksonia.jpg|thumb|The underside of a fertile frond of ''[[Dicksonia antarctica]]''. Each circular brown structure is an individual sorus.]]

A '''sorus''' (pl. '''sori''') is a cluster of [[sporangium|sporangia]] (structures producing and containing [[spore]]s) in [[fern]]s and [[fungi]]. This [[New Latin]] word is from [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:σωρός|σωρός]] (''sōrós'' 'stack, pile, heap').

In [[lichen]]s and other fungi, the sorus is surrounded by an external layer.  In some red algae it may take the form of a depression into the thallus.

In ferns, these form a yellowish or brownish mass on the edge or underside of a fertile [[frond]]. In some species, they are protected during development by a scale or film of tissue called the '''indusium''', which forms an umbrella-like cover. 

Sori occur on the [[sporophyte]] generation, the sporangia within producing [[haploid]] meio[[spore]]s. As the sporongia mature, the indusium shrivels so that spore release is unimpeded. The sporangia then burst and release the spores.

The shape, arrangement, and location of the sori are often valuable clues in the identification of fern [[taxa]]. Sori may be circular or linear. They may be arranged in rows, either parallel or oblique to the costa, or randomly. Their location may be marginal or set away from the margin on the frond lamina. The presence or absence of indusium is also used to identify fern taxa.

Soft X-rays have energies in the 0.09 to 2.5 [[keV]] range, whereas hard X-rays are in the 1–20 keV range.&lt;ref name=Supersoft&gt;{{ cite web |title=Supersoft X-Ray Sources |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27930/supersoft.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607122110/http://library.thinkquest.org/27930/supersoft.htm |archivedate=2008-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSSs emit few or no photons with energies above 1 keV, and most have effective temperatures below 100 eV. This means that the radiation they emit is highly ionizing and is readily absorbed by the interstellar medium. Most SSSs within our own galaxy are hidden by interstellar absorption in the galactic disk.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; They are readily evident in external galaxies, with ~10 found in the Magellanic Clouds and at least 15 seen in M31.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

As of early 2005, more than 100 SSSs have been reported in ~20 external galaxies, the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC), [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (SMC), and the [[Milky Way]] (MW).&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt; Those with luminosities below ~3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s are consistent with steady [[Stellar surface fusion|nuclear burning]] in accreting [[white dwarf]]s (WD)s or post-novae.&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt; There are a few SSS with luminosities ≥10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s.&lt;ref name=Kahabka/&gt;

Super soft X-rays are believed to be produced by steady [[nuclear fusion]] on a [[white dwarf]]'s surface of material pulled from a [[binary star|binary companion]],&lt;ref name=SSXSmpe&gt;{{ cite web |title=Super Soft X-ray Sources - Discovered with ROSAT |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/sss/sss_high.html |author=Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called close-binary supersoft source (CBSS).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; This requires a flow of material sufficiently high to sustain the fusion. Contrast this with the [[nova]], where less flow causes the material to only fuse sporadically. Super soft X-ray sources can evolve into [[type Ia supernova]], where a sudden fusion of material destroys the white dwarf, and neutron stars, through collapse.&lt;ref name=SSXSws&gt;{{ cite web |title=Proceedings of the Workshop on Supersoft X-ray Sources |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/sss/sssw.html |author=Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Close-binary supersoft source (CBSS)==

The CBSS model invokes steady [[Stellar surface fusion|nuclear burning on the surface]] of an accreting [[white dwarf]] (WD) as the generator of the prodigious super soft X-ray flux.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; As of 1999, eight SSXSs have orbital periods between ~4 hr and 1.35 d: RX J0019.8+2156 (MW), [[RX J0439.8−6809|RX J0439.8-6809]] (MW halo near LMC), RX J0513.9-6951 (LMC), RX J0527.8-6954 (LMC), RX J0537.7-7034 (LMC), CAL 83 (LMC), CAL 87 LMC), and 1E 0035.4-7230 (SMC).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

==Symbiotic binary==
{{main|Symbiotic variable star}}
A '''symbiotic binary''' star is a [[variable star|variable]] [[binary star]] system in which a [[red giant]] has expanded its outer envelope and is [[stellar wind|shedding mass]] quickly, and another hot star (often a [[white dwarf]]) is ionizing the gas.&lt;ref name=Darling&gt;{{ cite web |title=David Darling site symbiotic star description |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/symbiotic_star.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three symbiotic binaries as of 1999 are SSXSs: AG Dra (BB, MW), [[RR Telescopii|RR Tel]] (WD, MW), and RX J0048.4-7332 (WD, SMC).&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

==Noninteracting white dwarfs==

The youngest, hottest WD, [[KPD 0005+5106]], is very close to 100,000 K, of type DO and is the first single WD recorded as an X-ray source with ROSAT.&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Fleming TA|author2=Werner K |author3=Barstow MA |journal=Astrophys.

==Cataclysmic variables==

"Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red-dwarf secondary transferring matter via the Roche lobe overflow."&lt;ref name=Kato&gt;{{ cite journal |author=Kato T|author2=Ishioka R|author3=Uemura M |title=Photometric Study of KR Aurigae during the High State in 2001 |journal=Publ.

Apparently the only SSXS nonmagnetic cataclysmic variable is [[V Sagittae]]: bolometric luminosity of (1–10) x 10&lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;, a binary including a blackbody (BB) accretor at T &lt; 80 eV, and an orbital period of 0.514195 d.&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt;

The accretion disk can become thermally stable in systems with high mass-transfer rates (Ṁ).&lt;ref name=Kato/&gt; Such systems are called nova-like (NL) stars, because they lack outbursts characteristic of dwarf novae.&lt;ref name=Osaki&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/133689 |last1=Osaki |first1=Yoji |title=Dwarf-Nova Outbursts |journal=Publ. Astron. Soc. Pac. |date=1996 |volume=108 |pages=39 |bibcode=1996PASP..108...39O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==VY Scl cataclysmic variables==

Among the NL stars is a small group which shows a temporary reduction or cessation of Ṁ from the secondary. These are the VY Scl-type stars or anti-dwarf novae.&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{ cite book |author=Warner B |date=1995 |title=Cataclysmic Variable Stars |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |bibcode=1995cvs..book.....W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===V751 Cyg===

V751 Cyg (BB, MW) is a VY Scl CV, has a bolometric luminosity of 6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s,&lt;ref name=Greiner/&gt; and emits soft X-rays at quiescence.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1086/317973 |display-authors=4 |author=Patterson J |author2=Thorstensen JR |author3=Fried R|author4=Skillman DR |author5=Cook LM |author6=Jensen L |title=Superhumps in Cataclysmic Binaries. XX. V751 Cygni |journal=Publ. Astron. Soc. Pac. |date=Jan 2001 |volume=113 |issue=779 |pages=72–81 |bibcode=2001PASP..113...72P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a weak soft X-ray source of V751 Cyg at minimum presents a challenge as this is unusual for CVs which commonly display weak hard X-ray emission at quiescence.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

The high luminosity (6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s) is particularly hard to understand in the context of VY Scl stars generally, because observations suggest that the binaries become simple red dwarf + white dwarf pairs at quiescence (the disk mostly disappears).&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; "A high luminosity in soft X-rays poses an additional problem of understanding why the spectrum is of only modest excitation."&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; The ratio He II λ4686/Hβ did not exceed ~0.5 in any of the spectra recorded up to 2001, which is typical for accretion-powered CVs and does not approach the ratio of 2 commonly seen in supersoft binaries (CBSS).&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

Pushing the edge of acceptable X-ray fits toward lower luminosity suggests that the luminosity should not exceed ~2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/s, which gives only ~4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; ergs/s of reprocessed light in the WD about equal to the secondary's expected nuclear luminosity.&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;

==Magnetic cataclysmic variables==
{{main|Polar (cataclysmic variable)}}
X-rays from magnetic cataclysmic variables are common because accretion provides a continuous supply of coronal gas.&lt;ref name=Trimble/&gt; A plot of number of systems vs. orbit period shows a statistically significant minimum for periods between 2 and 3 hr which can probably be understood in terms of the effects of magnetic braking when the companion star becomes completely convective and the usual dynamo (which operates at the base of the convective envelope) can no longer give the companion a magnetic wind to carry off angular momentum.&lt;ref name=Trimble/&gt; The rotation has been blamed on asymmetric ejection of planetary nebulae and winds&lt;ref name=Spruit&gt;{{ cite journal |title=Origin of the rotation rates of single white dwarfs |author=Spruit HC |date=1998 |journal=Astron.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24224">In [[music]], '''transcription''' can mean [[Musical notation|notating]] a piece or a sound which was previously unnotated, as, for example, an improvised jazz solo. When a musician is tasked with creating [[sheet music]] from a recording and they write down the notes that make up the song in [[music notation]], it is said that they created a ''musical transcription'' of that recording. Transcription may also mean rewriting a piece of music, either solo or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]], for another instrument or other instruments than which it was originally intended. The [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|Beethoven Symphonies]] by [[Franz Liszt]] are a good example. Transcription in this sense is sometimes called ''[[arrangement]]'', although strictly speaking transcriptions are faithful adaptations, whereas arrangements change significant aspects of the original piece.
 
Further examples of music transcription include [[Ethnomusicology|ethnomusicological]] notation of [[oral tradition]]s of folk music, such as [[Béla Bartók]]'s and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' collections of the national folk music of [[Hungary]] and [[England]] respectively. The [[France|French]] [[composer]] [[Olivier Messiaen]] transcribed [[bird song|birdsong]] in the wild, and incorporated it into many of his compositions, for example his ''[[Catalogue d'oiseaux]]'' for solo piano. Transcription of this nature involves scale degree recognition and harmonic analysis, both of which the transcriber will need [[Relative pitch|relative]] or [[perfect pitch]] to perform.

In popular music and rock, there are two forms of transcription. Individual performers copy a note-for-note guitar solo or other melodic line. As well, music publishers transcribe entire recordings of guitar solos and bass lines and sell the sheet music in bound books. Music publishers also publish PVG (piano/vocal/guitar) transcriptions of popular music, where the melody line is transcribed, and then the accompaniment on the recording is arranged as a piano part. The guitar aspect of the PVG label is achieved through guitar chords written above the melody. Lyrics are also included below the melody.

Some composers have rendered homage to other composers by creating "identical" versions of the earlier composers' pieces while adding their own creativity through the use of completely new sounds arising from the difference in instrumentation.  The most widely known example of this is [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s arrangement for orchestra of [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s piano piece ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]''.  [[Anton Webern|Webern]] used his transcription for orchestra of the six-part [[ricercar]] from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[The Musical Offering]]'' to analyze the structure of the Bach piece, by using different instruments to play different subordinate [[motif (music)|motifs]] of Bach's themes and melodies.

In transcription of this form, the new piece can simultaneously imitate the original sounds while recomposing them with all the technical skills of an expert composer in such a way that it seems that the piece was originally written for the new medium.  But some transcriptions and arrangements have been done for purely pragmatic or contextual reasons.  For example, in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s time, the overtures and songs from his popular operas were transcribed for small [[wind ensemble]] simply because such ensembles were common ways of providing popular entertainment in public places.  Mozart himself did this in his opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', transcribing for small wind ensemble several arias from other operas, including one from his own opera ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. A more contemporary example is [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]´s transcription for four hands piano of ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', to be used on the ballet's rehearsals.  Today musicians who play in cafes or restaurants will sometimes play transcriptions or arrangements of pieces written for a larger group of instruments.

Other examples of this type of transcription include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s arrangement of [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s four-violin concerti for four keyboard instruments and orchestra; Mozart's arrangement of some Bach [[fugue]]s from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' for string [[trio (music)|trio]]; [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] arrangement of his ''[[Große Fuge]]'', originally written for [[string quartet]], for [[piano]] duet, and his arrangement of his [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Violin Concerto]] as a [[piano concerto]]; [[Franz Liszt]]'s piano arrangements of the works of many composers, including the [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|symphonies of Beethoven]]; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s arrangement of four Mozart piano pieces into an [[orchestral suite]] called "[[Orchestral Suite No. 4 Mozartiana (Tchaikovsky)|Mozartiana]]"; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'s re-orchestration of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] symphonies; and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s arrangement for orchestra of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s piano quintet and Bach's "St. Anne" Prelude and Fugue for organ.

Since the piano became a popular instrument, a large literature has sprung up of transcriptions and arrangements for piano of works for orchestra or chamber music ensemble.  These are sometimes called "[[reduction (music)|piano reduction]]s", because the multiplicity of orchestral parts—in an orchestral piece there may be as many as two dozen separate instrumental parts being played simultaneously—has to be reduced to what a single pianist (or occasionally two pianists, on one or two pianos, such as the different arrangements for [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'') can manage to play.

Piano reductions are frequently made of orchestral accompaniments to choral works, for the purposes of rehearsal or of performance with keyboard alone.

Many orchestral pieces have been transcribed for [[concert band]].

==Transcription aids==

===Notation software===
Since the advent of desktop publishing, musicians can acquire [[music notation software]], which can receive the user's mental analysis of notes and then store and format those notes into standard music notation for personal printing or professional publishing of sheet music. Some notation software can accept a Standard [[MIDI]] File (SMF) or MIDI performance as input instead of manual note entry. These notation applications can export their scores in a variety of formats like [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Often the software contains a sound library which allows the user's score to be played aloud by the application for verification.

===Slow-down software===
Prior to the invention of digital transcription aids, musicians would slow down a record or a tape recording to be able to hear the melodic lines and chords at a slower, more digestible pace. The problem with this approach was that it also changed the pitches, so once a piece was transcribed, it would then have to be transposed into the correct key. Software designed to slow down the tempo of music without changing the pitch of the music can be very helpful for recognizing pitches, melodies, chords, rhythms and lyrics when transcribing music. However, unlike the slow-down effect of a record player, the pitch and original octave of the notes will stay the same, and not descend in pitch. This technology is simple enough that it is available in many free software applications.

The software generally goes through a two-step process to accomplish this.  First, the audio file is played back at a lower sample rate than that of the original file.  This has the same effect as playing a tape or vinyl record at slower speed - the pitch is lowered meaning the music can sound like it is in a different key.  The second step is to use [[Digital signal processing|Digital Signal Processing (or DSP)]] to shift the pitch back up to the original pitch level or musical key.

===Pitch tracking software===
{{main|pitch tracker}}
As mentioned in the Automatic music transcription section, some commercial software can roughly track the pitch of dominant melodies in polyphonic musical recordings. The note scans are not exact, and often need to be manually edited by the user before saving to file in either a proprietary file format or in Standard [[MIDI]] File Format. Some pitch tracking software also allows the scanned note lists to be animated during audio playback.

==Automatic music transcription==
The term "automatic music transcription" was first used by audio researchers James A. Moorer, Martin Piszczalski, and Bernard Galler in 1977. With their knowledge of digital audio engineering, these researchers believed that a computer could be programmed to analyze a digital recording of music such that the pitches of melody lines and chord patterns could be detected, along with the rhythmic accents of percussion instruments. The task of automatic music transcription concerns two separate activities: making an analysis of a musical piece, and printing out a score from that analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Eric David Scheirer (October 1998): "Music Perception Systems", Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, pp 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a simple goal, but one that would encourage academic research for at least another three decades. Because of the close scientific relationship of speech to music, much academic and commercial research that was directed toward the more financially resourced speech recognition technology would be recycled into research about music recognition technology. While many musicians and educators insist that manually doing transcriptions is a valuable exercise for developing musicians, the motivation for automatic music transcription remains the same as the motivation for sheet music: musicians who do not have intuitive transcription skills will search for sheet music or a chord chart, so that they may quickly learn how to play a song. A collection of tools created by this ongoing research could be of great aid to musicians. Since much recorded music does not have available sheet music, an automatic transcription device could also offer transcriptions that are otherwise unavailable in sheet music.  To date, no software application can yet completely fulfill James Moorer’s definition of automatic music transcription. However, the pursuit of automatic music transcription has spawned the creation of many software applications which can aid in manual transcription. Some can slow down music while maintaining original pitch and octave, some can track the pitch of melodies, some can track the chord changes, and others can track the beat of music.

Automatic transcription most fundamentally involves identifying the pitch and duration of the performed notes. This entails tracking pitch and identifying note onsets. After capturing those physical measurements, this information is mapped into traditional music notation, i.e., the sheet music.

[[Digital signal processing|Digital Signal Processing]] is the branch of engineering that provides software engineers with the tools and algorithms needed to analyze a digital recording in terms of pitch (note detection of melodic instruments), and the energy content of un-pitched sounds (detection of percussion instruments). Musical recordings are sampled at a given recording rate and its frequency data is stored in any digital wave format in the computer. Such format represents sound by [[Sampling (signal processing)|digital sampling]].

===Pitch detection===
[[Pitch detection]] is often the detection of individual [[Musical note|note]]s that might make up a [[melody]] in music, or the notes in a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. When a single key is pressed upon a piano, what we hear is not just ''one'' [[frequency]] of sound vibration, but a ''composite'' of multiple sound vibrations occurring at different mathematically related frequencies. The elements of this composite of vibrations at differing frequencies are referred to as [[harmonic]]s or partials.

For instance, if we press the Middle C key on the piano, the individual [[Frequency|frequencies]] of the composite's [[harmonic]]s will start at 261.6&amp;nbsp;Hz as the [[fundamental frequency]], 523&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 2nd Harmonic, 785&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 3rd Harmonic, 1046&amp;nbsp;Hz would be the 4th Harmonic, etc. The later harmonics are integer multiples of the [[fundamental frequency]], 261.6&amp;nbsp;Hz ( ex:  2 x 261.6 = 523,   3 x 261.6 = 785,   4 x 261.6 = 1046 ). While only about eight [[harmonic]]s are really needed to audibly recreate the note, the total number of harmonics in this mathematical series can be large, although the higher the harmonic's numeral the weaker the magnitude and contribution of that harmonic. Contrary to intuition, a musical recording at its lowest physical level is not a collection of individual [[Musical note|note]]s, but is really a collection of individual [[harmonic]]s. That is why very similar-sounding recordings can be created with differing collections of instruments and their assigned notes. As long as the total [[harmonic]]s of the recording are recreated to some degree, it does not really matter which instruments or which notes were used.

A first step in the detection of notes is the transformation of the sound file's digital data from the [[time domain]] into the [[frequency domain]], which enables the measurement of various frequencies over time. The graphic image of an audio recording in the frequency domain is called a [[spectrogram]] or sonogram. A musical note, as a composite of various [[harmonic]]s, appears in a [[spectrogram]] like a vertically placed ''comb'', with the individual teeth of the comb representing the various harmonics and their differing frequency values. A [[Fourier transform|Fourier Transform]] is the mathematical procedure that is used to create the [[spectrogram]] from the sound file’s digital data.

The task of many note detection algorithms is to search the [[spectrogram]] for the occurrence of such ''comb patterns'' (a composite of harmonics) caused by individual notes. Once the pattern of a note's particular comb shape of [[harmonic]]s is detected, the note's [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] can be measured by the vertical position of the comb pattern upon the [[spectrogram]].

There are basically two different classes of digital music which create very different demands for a [[pitch detection]] algorithm: ''monophonic'' music and ''polyphonic'' music. Monophonic music is a passage with only one instrument playing one note at a time, while polyphonic music can have multiple instruments and vocals playing at once. [[Pitch detection]] upon a monophonic recording was a relatively simple task, and its technology enabled the invention of guitar tuners in the 1970s. However, [[pitch detection]] upon polyphonic music becomes a much more difficult task because the image of its [[spectrogram]] now appears as a vague cloud due to a multitude of overlapping comb patterns, caused by each note's multiple [[harmonic]]s.

Another method of [[pitch detection]] was invented by Martin Piszczalski in conjunction with Bernard Galler in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process attempts to roughly mimic the biology of the human inner [[ear]] by finding only but a few of the loudest [[harmonic]]s at a given instant. That small set of found [[harmonic]]s are in turn compared against all the possible resultant pitches' harmonic-sets, to hypothesize what the most probable [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] could be given that particular set of [[harmonic]]s.
 
To date, the complete note detection of polyphonic recordings remains a mystery to audio engineers, although they continue to make progress by inventing algorithms which can partially detect some of the notes of a polyphonic recording, such as a [[melody]] or bass line.

===Beat detection===
Beat tracking is the determination of a repeating time interval between perceived pulses in music. Beat can also be described as 'foot tapping' or 'hand clapping' in time with the music. The beat is often a predictable basic unit in time for the musical piece, and may only vary slightly during the performance. Songs are frequently measured for their Beats Per Minute (BPM) in determining the tempo of the music, whether it be fast or slow.

Since notes frequently begin on a beat, or a simple subdivision of the beat's time interval, beat tracking software has the potential to better resolve note onsets that may have been detected in a crude fashion. Beat tracking is often the first step in the detection of percussion instruments.

Despite the intuitive nature of 'foot tapping' of which most humans are capable, developing an algorithm to detect those beats is difficult. Most of the current software algorithms for beat detection use a group competing hypothesis for beats-per-minute, as the algorithm progressively finds and resolves local peaks in volume, roughly corresponding to the foot-taps of the music.

===How automatic music transcription works===
To transcribe music automatically, several problems must be solved:

1. Notes must be recognized - this is typically done by changing from the time domain into the frequency domain.  This can be accomplished through the [[Fourier transform]].  Computer algorithms for doing this are common.  The [[Fast Fourier transform]] algorithm computes the frequency content of a signal, and is useful in processing musical excerpts.

2. A beat and tempo need to be detected ([[Beat detection]])- this is a difficult, many-faceted problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The method proposed in Costantini et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on note events and their main characteristics: the attack instant, the pitch and the final instant. [[Onset detection]] exploits a binary time-frequency representation of the audio signal. Note classification and offset detection are based on [[constant Q transform]] (CQT) and [[support vector machines]] (SVMs). An audio example can be found [http://www.massimilianotodisco.eu/research/pianotrans.html here]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

This in turn leads to a “pitch contour” namely a continuously time-varying line that corresponds to what humans refer to as melody. The next step is to segment this continuous melodic stream to identify the beginning and end of each note.
After that each “note unit” is expressed in physical terms (e.g., 442&amp;nbsp;Hz,  .52 seconds).  The final step is then to map this physical information into familiar music-notation-like terms for each note (e.g., an A4, quarter note).

===Detailed computer steps behind automatic music transcription===
In terms of actual computer processing, the principal steps are to 1) digitize the performed, analog music, 2) do successive short-term, [[Fast Fourier Transform]] (FFTs) to obtain the time-varying spectra, 3) identify the peaks in each spectrum, 4) analyze the spectral peaks to get pitch candidates, 5) connect the strongest individual pitch candidates to get the most likely time-varying, pitch contour, 6) map this physical data into the closest music-notation terms.

The most controversial and difficult step in this process is detecting pitch

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most successful pitch methods operate in the frequency domain, not the time domain. While time-domain methods have been proposed, they can break down for real-world musical instruments played in typically reverberant rooms.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; again mimics human hearing.  It follows how only certain sets of partials “fuse” together in human listening. These are the sets that create the perception of a single pitch only. Fusion occurs only when two partials are within 1.5% of being a perfect, harmonic pair (i.e., their frequencies approximate a low-integer pair set such as 1:2, 5:8, etc.)  This near harmonic match is required of all the partials in order for a human to hear them as only a single pitch.

'''Two-hybrid screening''' (originally known as '''yeast two-hybrid system''' or '''Y2H''') is a [[molecular biology]] technique used to discover [[protein–protein interaction]]s (PPIs)&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young KH | title = Yeast two-hybrid: so many interactions, (in) so little time | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–11 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9475380 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod58.2.302 | url = http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927133205/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/reprint/58/2/302 | archivedate = 27 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DNA-binding protein#Protein–DNA interactions|protein–DNA interactions]]&lt;ref name="joung"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joung JK, Ramm EI, Pabo CO | title = A bacterial two-hybrid selection system for studying protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 13 | pages = 7382–7 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10852947 | pmc = 16554 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.110149297 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/13/7382 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...97.7382J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurt JA, Thibodeau SA, Hirsh AS, Pabo CO, Joung JK | title = Highly specific zinc finger proteins obtained by directed domain shuffling and cell-based selection | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 21 | pages = 12271–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14527993 | pmc = 218748 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.2135381100 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/100/21/12271 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..10012271H }}&lt;/ref&gt; by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two [[protein]]s or a single protein and a [[DNA]] molecule, respectively.

The premise behind the test is the activation of [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] [[reporter gene]](s) by the binding of a [[transcription factor]] onto an [[upstream activating sequence]] (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the DNA-binding domain (DBD or often also abbreviated as BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the [[protein domain|domain]] responsible for [[DNA-binding protein|binding]] to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The Y2H is thus a [[protein-fragment complementation assay]].

== History ==

Pioneered by [[Stanley Fields (biologist)|Stanley Fields]] and Ok-Kyu Song in 1989, the technique was originally designed to detect protein–protein interactions using the [[Gal4]] transcriptional activator of the yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. The [[Gal4]] protein activated transcription of a gene involved in galactose utilization, which formed the basis of selection.&lt;ref name="fields"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fields S, Song O | title = A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions | journal = Nature | volume = 340 | issue = 6230 | pages = 245–6 | date = July 1989 | pmid = 2547163 | doi = 10.1038/340245a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6230/abs/340245a0.html;jsessionid=2F9E056F57E5547D17D2D6658C9B0437 | format = abstract | bibcode = 1989Natur.340..245F }} Abstract is free; full-text article is not.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the same principle has been adapted to describe many alternative methods, including some that detect protein–DNA interactions or DNA-DNA interactions, as well as methods that use different [[#Host organism|host organisms]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or mammalian cells instead of yeast.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo Y, Batalao A, Zhou H, Zhu L | title = Mammalian two-hybrid system: a complementary approach to the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 350–2 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9043710 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/97222pf02_10525a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premise ==

The key to the two-hybrid screen is that in most [[eukaryotic]] transcription factors, the activating and binding domains are modular and can function in proximity to each other without direct binding.&lt;ref name="verschure"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verschure PJ, Visser AE, Rots MG | title = Step out of the groove: epigenetic gene control systems and engineered transcription factors | journal = Advances in Genetics | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 163–204 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16735158 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2660(06)56005-5 | isbn = 9780120176564 | series = Advances in Genetics }} {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that even though the transcription factor is split into two fragments, it can still activate transcription when the two fragments are indirectly connected.

The most common screening approach is the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this approach the researcher knows where each prey is located on the used medium (agar plates). Millions of potential interactions in several organisms have been screened in the latest decade using  [[high-throughput screening]] systems (often using robots) and over thousands of interactions have been detected and categorized in databases as [https://thebiogrid.org BioGRID].&lt;ref name="Brückner"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brückner A, Polge C, Lentze N, Auerbach D, Schlattner U | title = Yeast two-hybrid, a powerful tool for systems biology | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 2763–88 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19582228 | pmc = 2705515 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10062763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gietz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gietz RD, Triggs-Raine B, Robbins A, Graham KC, Woods RA | title = Identification of proteins that interact with a protein of interest: applications of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 172 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 67–79 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9278233 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006859319926 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t5w6u8667583641p/?p=163f5ecf5cff441b940a429da9d83187&amp;pi=0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system often utilizes a [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] strain of yeast in which the [[biosynthesis]] of certain nutrients (usually [[amino acid]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s) is lacking. When grown on media that lacks these nutrients, the yeast fail to survive. This mutant yeast strain can be made to incorporate foreign DNA in the form of [[plasmid]]s. In yeast two-hybrid screening, separate bait and prey plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the mutant yeast strain or a mating strategy is used to get both plasmids in one host cell.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

The second high-throughput approach is the library screening approach. In this set up the bait and prey harboring cells are mated in a random order. After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

Plasmids are engineered to produce a protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is engineered to produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may be referred to as the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a [[Library (biology)|library]] of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then transfected into the cells chosen for the screening method.&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is transfected with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.

If the bait and prey proteins interact (i.e., bind), then the AD and BD of the transcription factor are indirectly connected, bringing the AD in proximity to the transcription start site and transcription of reporter gene(s) can occur. If the two proteins do not interact, there is no transcription of the reporter gene. In this way, a successful interaction between the fused protein is linked to a change in the cell phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The challenge of separating cells that express proteins that happen to interact with their counterpart fusion proteins from those that do not, is addressed in the following section.

==Fixed domains==

In any study, some of the protein domains, those under investigation, will be varied according to the goals of the study whereas other domains, those that are not themselves being investigated, will be kept constant. For example, in a two-hybrid study to select DNA-binding domains, the DNA-binding domain, BD, will be varied while the two interacting proteins, the bait and prey, must be kept constant to maintain a strong binding between the BD and AD. There are a number of domains from which to choose the BD, bait and prey and AD, if these are to remain constant. In protein–protein interaction investigations, the BD may be chosen from any of many strong DNA-binding domains such as [[Zif268]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A frequent choice of bait and prey domains are residues 263–352 of yeast Gal11P with a N342V mutation&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; and residues 58–97 of yeast Gal4,&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; respectively. These domains can be used in both yeast- and bacterial-based selection techniques and are known to bind together strongly.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The AD chosen must be able to activate transcription of the reporter gene, using the cell's own transcription machinery. Thus, the variety of ADs available for use in yeast-based techniques may not be suited to use in their bacterial-based analogues. The herpes simplex virus-derived AD, VP16 and yeast Gal4 AD have been used with success in yeast&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; whilst a portion of the α-subunit of ''E. coli'' RNA polymerase has been utilised in ''E. coli''-based methods.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

Whilst powerfully activating domains may allow greater sensitivity towards weaker interactions, conversely, a weaker AD may provide greater stringency.

==Construction of expression plasmids==

A number of engineered genetic sequences must be incorporated into the host cell to perform two-hybrid analysis or one of its derivative techniques. The considerations and methods used in the construction and delivery of these sequences differ according to the needs of the assay and the organism chosen as the experimental background.

There are two broad categories of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A [[cDNA library]] is constituted by the cDNA produced through [[reverse transcription]] of mRNA collected from specific cells of types of cell. This library can be ligated into a construct so that it is attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including [[Site-directed mutagenesis#Cassette mutagenesis|cassette mutagenesis]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is [[DNA ligase|ligated]] into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate [[restriction endonucleases]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===''E. coli''-specific considerations===

By placing the hybrid proteins under the control of [[IPTG]]-inducible [[lac promoter|''lac'' promoter]]s, they are expressed only on media supplemented with IPTG. Further, by including different antibiotic resistance genes in each genetic construct, the growth of non-transformed cells is easily prevented through culture on media containing the corresponding antibiotics. This is particularly important for counter selection methods in which a ''lack'' of interaction is needed for cell survival.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

The reporter gene may be inserted into the ''E. coli'' genome by first inserting it into an [[episome]], a type of plasmid with the ability to incorporate itself into the bacterial cell genome&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; with a copy number of approximately one per cell.&lt;ref name="whipple"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whipple FW | title = Genetic analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 26 | issue = 16 | pages = 3700–6 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9685485 | pmc = 147751 | doi = 10.1093/nar/26.16.3700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid expression phagemids can be electroporated into ''E. coli'' XL-1 Blue cells which after amplification and infection with VCS-M13 [[helper phage]], will yield a stock of library phage. These phage will each contain one single-stranded member of the phagemid library.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Recovery of protein information==

Once the selection has been performed, the [[primary structure]] of the proteins which display the appropriate characteristics must be determined. This is achieved by retrieval of the protein-encoding sequences (as originally inserted) from the cells showing the appropriate phenotype.

===''E. coli''===

The phagemid used to transform ''E. coli'' cells may be "rescued" from the selected cells by infecting them with VCS-M13 helper phage. The resulting phage particles that are produced contain the single-stranded phagemids and are used to infect XL-1 Blue cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; The double-stranded phagemids are subsequently collected from these XL-1 Blue cells, essentially reversing the process used to produce the original library phage. Finally, the DNA sequences are determined through [[dideoxy sequencing]].&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Controlling sensitivity==

The ''Escherichia coli''-derived [[TetR|Tet-R]] repressor can be used in line with a conventional reporter gene and can be controlled by tetracycline or doxicycline (Tet-R inhibitors). Thus the expression of Tet-R is controlled by the standard two-hybrid system but the Tet-R in turn controls (represses) the expression of a previously mentioned reporter such as ''HIS3'', through its Tet-R promoter. Tetracycline or its derivatives can then be used to regulate the sensitivity of a system utilising Tet-R.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be controlled by varying the dependency of the cells on their reporter genes. For example, this may be affected by altering the concentration of histidine in the growth medium for ''his3''-dependent cells and altering the concentration of streptomycin for ''aadA'' dependent cells.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; Selection-gene-dependency may also be controlled by applying an inhibitor of the selection gene at a suitable concentration. [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole]] (3-AT) for example, is a competitive inhibitor of the ''HIS3''-gene product and may be used to titrate the minimum level of ''HIS3'' expression required for growth on histidine-deficient media.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

Sensitivity may also be modulated by varying the number of operator sequences in the reporter DNA.

==Non-fusion proteins==

A third, non-fusion protein may be co-expressed with two fusion proteins. Depending on the investigation, the third protein may modify one of the fusion proteins or mediate or interfere with their interaction.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Co-expression of the third protein may be necessary for modification or activation of one or both of the fusion proteins. For example, ''S. cerevisiae'' possesses no endogenous tyrosine kinase. If an investigation involves a protein that requires tyrosine phosphorylation, the kinase must be supplied in the form of a tyrosine kinase gene.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

The non-fusion protein may mediate the interaction by binding both fusion proteins simultaneously, as in the case of ligand-dependent receptor dimerization.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

For a protein with an interacting partner, its functional homology to other proteins may be assessed by supplying the third protein in non-fusion form, which then may or may not compete with the fusion-protein for its binding partner. Binding between the third protein and the other fusion protein will interrupt the formation of the reporter expression activation complex and thus reduce reporter expression, leading to the distinguishing change in phenotype.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid==

One limitation of classic yeast two-hybrid screens is that they are limited to soluble proteins. It is therefore impossible to use them to study the protein–protein interactions between insoluble [[integral membrane protein]]s. The split-ubiquitin system provides a method for overcoming this limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stagljar I, Korostensky C, Johnsson N, te Heesen S | title = A genetic system based on split-ubiquitin for the analysis of interactions between membrane proteins in vivo | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 9 | pages = 5187–92 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9560251 | pmc = 20236 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.9.5187 | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9560251 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.5187S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the split-ubiquitin system, two integral membrane proteins to be studied are fused to two different [[ubiquitin]] moieties: a C-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Cub", residues 35–76) and an N-terminal ubiquitin moiety ("Nub", residues 1–34). These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a [[transcription factor]] (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific [[protease]]s. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the transcription factor, allowing it to induce the transcription of [[reporter gene]]s.&lt;ref name="Snider2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snider J, Kittanakom S, Curak J, Stagljar I | title = Split-ubiquitin based membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) system: a powerful tool for identifying protein-protein interactions | journal = Journal of Visualized Experiments | issue = 36 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20125081 | pmc = 2818708 | doi = 10.3791/1698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fluorescent two-hybrid assay ==
Zolghadr and co-workers presented a fluorescent two-hybrid system that uses two hybrid proteins that are fused to different fluorescent proteins as well as LacI, the [[lac repressor]]. The structure of the fusion proteins looks like this: FP2-LacI-bait and FP1-prey where the bait and prey proteins interact and bring the fluorescent proteins (FP1 = [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], FP2=[[mCherry]]) in close proximity at the binding site of the LacI protein in the host cell genome.&lt;ref name="Zolghadr2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zolghadr K, Mortusewicz O, Rothbauer U, Kleinhans R, Goehler H, Wanker EE, Cardoso MC, Leonhardt H | title = A fluorescent two-hybrid assay for direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 2279–87 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18622019 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M700548-MCP200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can also be used to screen for inhibitors of protein–protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Yurlova2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yurlova L, Derks M, Buchfellner A, Hickson I, Janssen M, Morrison D, Stansfield I, Brown CJ, Ghadessy FJ, Lane DP, Rothbauer U, Zolghadr K, Krausz E | title = The fluorescent two-hybrid assay to screen for protein-protein interaction inhibitors in live cells: targeting the interaction of p53 with Mdm2 and Mdm4 | journal = Journal of Biomolecular Screening | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 516–25 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24476585 | doi = 10.1177/1087057113518067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enzymatic two-hybrid systems: KISS ==
While the original Y2H system used a reconstituted transcription factor, other systems create enzymatic activities to detect PPIs. For instance, the KInase Substrate Sensor ("KISS"), is a mammalian two-hybrid approach has been designed to map intracellular PPIs. Here, a bait protein  is fused to a [[kinase]]-containing portion of [[TYK2]] and a prey is coupled to a [[gp130]] [[cytokine receptor]] fragment. When bait and prey interact, TYK2 phosphorylates [[STAT3]] docking sites on the prey chimera, which ultimately leads to activation of a [[reporter gene]].&lt;ref name="Lievens2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lievens S, Gerlo S, Lemmens I, De Clercq DJ, Risseeuw MD, Vanderroost N, De Smet AS, Ruyssinck E, Chevet E, Van Calenbergh S, Tavernier J | title = Kinase Substrate Sensor (KISS), a mammalian in situ protein interaction sensor | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 3332–42 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25154561 | pmc = 4256487 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M114.041087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One-, three- and one-two-hybrid variants==

===One-hybrid===

The one-hybrid variation of this technique is designed to investigate [[protein–DNA interaction]]s and uses a single fusion protein in which the AD is linked directly to the binding domain. The binding domain in this case however is not necessarily of fixed sequence as in two-hybrid protein–protein analysis but may be constituted by a library. This library can be selected against the desired target sequence, which is inserted in the promoter region of the reporter gene construct. In a positive-selection system, a binding domain that successfully binds the UAS and allows transcription is thus selected.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

Note that selection of DNA-binding domains is not necessarily performed using a one-hybrid system, but may also be performed using a two-hybrid system in which the binding domain is varied and the bait and prey proteins are kept constant.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

===Three-hybrid===

[[Image:Three-hybrid-system.svg|thumb|350px|Overview of three-hybrid assay.]]

RNA-protein interactions have been investigated through a three-hybrid variation of the two-hybrid technique. In this case, a hybrid RNA molecule serves to adjoin together the two protein fusion domains—which are not intended to interact with each other but rather the intermediary RNA molecule (through their RNA-binding domains).&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Techniques involving non-fusion proteins that perform a similar function, as described in the 'non-fusion proteins' section above, may also be referred to as three-hybrid methods.

===One-two-hybrid===

Simultaneous use of the one- and two-hybrid methods (that is, simultaneous protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction) is known as a one-two-hybrid approach and expected to increase the stringency of the screen.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

==Host organism==

Although theoretically, any living cell might be used as the background to a two-hybrid analysis, there are practical considerations that dictate which is chosen. The chosen cell line should be relatively cheap and easy to culture and sufficiently robust to withstand application of the investigative methods and reagents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The latter is especially important for doing [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput studies]]. Therefore the yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' has been the main host organism for two-hybrid studies. However it is not always the ideal system to study interacting proteins from other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Tournu H, Tavernier J, Van Dijck P | title = Diversity in genetic in vivo methods for protein-protein interaction studies: from the yeast two-hybrid system to the mammalian split-luciferase system | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 331–82 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22688816 | pmc = 3372256 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.05021-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeast cells often do not have the same post translational modifications, have a different codon use or lack certain proteins that are important for the correct expression of the proteins. To cope with these problems several novel two-hybrid systems have been developed. Depending on the system used agar plates or specific growth medium is used to grow the cells and allow selection for interaction. The most common used method is the agar plating one where cells are plated on selective medium to see of interaction takes place. Cells that have no interaction proteins should not survive on this selective medium.&lt;ref name="Brückner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamdi A, Colas P | title = Yeast two-hybrid methods and their applications in drug discovery | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–18 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22130009 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2011.10.008 | url = http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/abstract/S0165-6147(11)00195-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''S. cerevisiae''===

The yeast ''S. cerevisiae'' was the model organism used during the two-hybrid technique's inception. It is commonly known as the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable internal environment.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

A number of yeast strains have been created specifically for Y2H screens, e.g. [[Y187]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fromont-Racine M, Rain JC, Legrain P | title = Toward a functional analysis of the yeast genome through exhaustive two-hybrid screens | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–82 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9207794 | doi = 10.1038/ng0797-277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AH109]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu L, Horstmann H, Ng C, Hong W | title = Regulation of Golgi structure and function by ARF-like protein 1 (Arl1) | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = Pt 24 | pages = 4543–55 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11792819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both produced by [[Takara Holdings|Clontech]].  Yeast strains R2HMet and BK100 have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khadka S, Vangeloff AD, Zhang C, Siddavatam P, Heaton NS, Wang L, Sengupta R, Sahasrabudhe S, Randall G, Gribskov M, Kuhn RJ, Perera R, LaCount DJ | title = A physical interaction network of dengue virus and human proteins | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = M111.012187 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21911577 | pmc = 3237087 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M111.012187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Candida albicans''===

[[Candida albicans|''C. albicans'']] is a yeast with a particular feature: it translates the CUG codon into serine rather than leucine. Due to this different codon usage it is difficult to use the model system ''S. cerevisiae'' as a Y2H to check for protein-protein interactions using ''C. albicans'' genes. To provide a more native environment a ''C. albicans'' two-hybrid (C2H) system was developed. With this system protein-protein interactions can be studied in ''C. albicans'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stynen B, Van Dijck P, Tournu H | title = A CUG codon adapted two-hybrid system for the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 38 | issue = 19 | pages = e184 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20719741 | pmc = 2965261 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent addition was the creation of a high-throughput system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoeters |first1=Floris |last2=Munro |first2=Carol A. |last3=d’Enfert |first3=Christophe |last4=Van Dijck |first4=Patrick |last5=Mitchell |first5=Aaron P. |title=A High-Throughput                            Two-Hybrid System |journal=mSphere |date=22 August 2018 |volume=3 |issue=4 |doi=10.1128/mSphere.00391-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Legrand |first1=Mélanie |last2=Bachellier-Bassi |first2=Sophie |last3=Lee |first3=Keunsook K |last4=Chaudhari |first4=Yogesh |last5=Tournu |first5=Hélène |last6=Arbogast |first6=Laurence |last7=Boyer |first7=Hélène |last8=Chauvel |first8=Murielle |last9=Cabral |first9=Vitor |last10=Maufrais |first10=Corinne |last11=Nesseir |first11=Audrey |last12=Maslanka |first12=Irena |last13=Permal |first13=Emmanuelle |last14=Rossignol |first14=Tristan |last15=Walker |first15=Louise A |last16=Zeidler |first16=Ute |last17=Znaidi |first17=Sadri |last18=Schoeters |first18=Floris |last19=Majgier |first19=Charlotte |last20=Julien |first20=Renaud A |last21=Ma |first21=Laurence |last22=Tichit |first22=Magali |last23=Bouchier |first23=Christiane |last24=Van Dijck |first24=Patrick |last25=Munro |first25=Carol A |last26=d’Enfert |first26=Christophe |title=Generating genomic platforms to study Candida albicans pathogenesis |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |date=10 August 2018 |doi=10.1093/nar/gky747}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''E. coli''===

Bacterial ''E. coli''-based two hybrid methods  (abbreviated as B2H) have several characteristics that may make them preferable to yeast-based homologues. The higher transformation efficiency and faster rate of growth lends ''E. coli'' to the use of larger libraries (in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; A low false positive rate of approximately 3x10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;, the absence of requirement for a [[nuclear localisation signal]] to be included in the protein sequence and the ability to study proteins that would be toxic to yeast may also be major factors to consider when choosing an experimental background organism.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

It may be of note that the methylation activity of certain ''E. coli'' [[DNA methyltransferase]] proteins may interfere with some DNA-binding protein selections. If this is anticipated, the use of an ''E. coli'' strain that is defective for a particular methyltransferase may be an obvious solution.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt; Important to mention is that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and when studying eukaryotic protein-protein interactions (e.g. human proteins) the results need to be carefully approached.

===Mammalian cells===

In recent years a mammalian two hybrid (M2H) system has been designed to study mammalian protein-protein interactions in a cellular environment that closely mimics the native protein environment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/promega-notes/66/the-checkmatetm-mammalian-two-hybrid-system.pdf?la=en&lt;/ref&gt; Transiently transfected mammalian cells are used in this system to find protein-protein interactions.&lt;ref name="Feng"&gt;{{cite book

The post-translational modifications, phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation are similar. The intracellular localization of the proteins is also more correct compared to using a yeast two hybrid system.&lt;ref name="Buckholz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buckholz RG, Gleeson MA | title = Yeast systems for the commercial production of heterologous proteins | journal = Bio/Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 | pages = 1067–72 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1367623 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1191-1067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Arabidopsis thaliana''===

In 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of ''A. thaliana''  protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible.
The system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system.&lt;ref name="Ehlert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehlert A, Weltmeier F, Wang X, Mayer CS, Smeekens S, Vicente-Carbajosa J, Dröge-Laser W | title = Two-hybrid protein-protein interaction analysis in Arabidopsis protoplasts: establishment of a heterodimerization map of group C and group S bZIP transcription factors | journal = The Plant Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 890–900 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16709202 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02731.x/epdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Aplysia californica''===

The sea hare [[California sea hare|''A californica'']] is a model organism in neurobiology to study among others the molecular mechanisms of long-term memory. To study interactions, important in neurology, in a more native environment a two-hybrid system has been developed in ''A californica'' neurons. A GAL4 AD and BD are used in this system.&lt;ref name="Choi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choi JH, Lee JA, Yim SW, Lim CS, Lee CH, Lee YD, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = Using an aplysia two-hybrid system to examine the interactions between transcription factors involved in long-term facilitation in the nervous system of aplysia | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–3 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12551962 | pmc = 196654 | doi = 10.1101/lm.55303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JA, Lee SH, Lee C, Chang DJ, Lee Y, Kim H, Cheang YH, Ko HG, Lee YS, Jun H, Bartsch D, Kandel ER, Kaang BK | title = PKA-activated ApAF-ApC/EBP heterodimer is a key downstream effector of ApCREB and is necessary and sufficient for the consolidation of long-term facilitation | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–38 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16966424 | pmc = 2064337 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200512066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Bombyx mori''===

An insect two-hybrid (I2H) system was developed in  a silkworm cell line from the larva or caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth, ''[[Bombyx mori]]'' (BmN4 cells). This system uses the GAL4 BD and the activation domain of mouse NF-κB P65. Both are under the control of the OpIE2 promoter.&lt;ref name="Mon"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mon H, Sugahara R, Hong SM, Lee JM, Kamachi Y, Kawaguchi Y, Kusakabe T | title = Analysis of protein interactions with two-hybrid system in cultured insect cells | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 392 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–2 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19481053 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2009.05.033 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003269709003674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Determination of sequences crucial for interaction===

By changing specific amino acids by mutating the corresponding DNA base-pairs in the plasmids used, the importance of those amino acid residues in maintaining the interaction can be determined.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

After using bacterial cell-based method to select DNA-binding proteins, it is necessary to check the specificity of these domains as there is a limit to the extent to which the bacterial cell genome can act as a sink for domains with an affinity for other sequences (or indeed, a general affinity for DNA).&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

===Drug and poison discovery===

Protein–protein signalling interactions pose suitable therapeutic targets due to their specificity and pervasiveness. The random drug discovery approach uses compound banks that comprise random chemical structures, and requires a high-throughput method to test these structures in their intended target.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

The cell chosen for the investigation can be specifically engineered to mirror the molecular aspect that the investigator intends to study and then used to identify new human or animal therapeutics or anti-pest agents.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamdi"/&gt;

===Determination of protein function===

By determination of the interaction partners of unknown proteins, the possible functions of these new proteins may be inferred.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; This can be done using a single known protein against a library of unknown proteins or conversely, by selecting from a library of known proteins using a single protein of unknown function.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt;

===Zinc finger protein selection===

To select [[zinc finger proteins]] (ZFPs) for [[protein engineering]], methods adapted from the two-hybrid screening technique have been used with success.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt; A ZFP is itself a DNA-binding protein used in the construction of custom DNA-binding domains that bind to a desired DNA sequence.&lt;ref name="gommans"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gommans WM, Haisma HJ, Rots MG | title = Engineering zinc finger protein transcription factors: the therapeutic relevance of switching endogenous gene expression on or off at command | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 354 | issue = 3 | pages = 507–19 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16253273 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.06.082 | url = http://www.rug.nl/farmacie/onderzoek/basiseenheden/therapeuticgenemodulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/!find?path=/farmacie/onderzoek/basisEenheden/THErapeuticGeneModulation/publicaties/publicaties2004/2005_6.pdf&amp;params=as=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By using a selection gene with the desired target sequence included in the UAS, and randomising the relevant amino acid sequences to produce a ZFP library, cells that host a DNA-ZFP interaction with the required characteristics can be selected. Each ZFP typically recognises only 3–4 base pairs, so to prevent recognition of sites outside the UAS, the randomised ZFP is engineered into a 'scaffold' consisting of another two ZFPs of constant sequence. The UAS is thus designed to include the target sequence of the constant scaffold in addition to the sequence for which a ZFP is selected.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurt"/&gt;

A number of other DNA-binding domains may also be investigated using this system.&lt;ref name="joung"/&gt;

==Strengths==

*Two-hybrid screens are low-tech; they can be carried out in any lab without sophisticated equipment.
*Two-hybrid screens can provide an important first hint for the identification of interaction partners.
*The assay is scalable, which makes it possible to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the matrix approach.
*Yeast two-hybrid data can be of similar quality to data generated by the alternative approach of [[coaffinity purification]] followed by [[mass spectrometry]] (AP/MS).&lt;ref name="yu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Braun P, Yildirim MA, Lemmens I, Venkatesan K, Sahalie J, Hirozane-Kishikawa T, Gebreab F, Li N, Simonis N, Hao T, Rual JF, Dricot A, Vazquez A, Murray RR, Simon C, Tardivo L, Tam S, Svrzikapa N, Fan C, de Smet AS, Motyl A, Hudson ME, Park J, Xin X, Cusick ME, Moore T, Boone C, Snyder M, Roth FP, Barabási AL, Tavernier J, Hill DE, Vidal M | title = High-quality binary protein interaction map of the yeast interactome network | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5898 | pages = 104–10 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18719252 | pmc = 2746753 | doi = 10.1126/science.1158684 | bibcode = 2008Sci...322..104Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Auerbach"/&gt;

==Weaknesses==
*The main criticism applied to the yeast two-hybrid screen of protein–protein interactions are the possibility of a high number of false positive (and false negative) identifications. The exact rate of false positive results is not known, but earlier estimates were as high as 70%. This also, partly, explains the often found very small overlap in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems.&lt;ref name="Auerbach"&gt;{{cite book

|year=2005
|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F0-387-24532-4_2
|doi=10.1007/0-387-24532-4_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deane"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deane CM, Salwiński Ł, Xenarios I, Eisenberg D | title = Protein interactions: two methods for assessment of the reliability of high throughput observations | journal = Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–56 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12118076 | doi = 10.1074/mcp.M100037-MCP200 | url = http://www.mcponline.org/cgi/content/full/1/5/349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason for this high error rate lies in the characteristics of the screen:
*Certain assay variants overexpress the fusion proteins which may cause unnatural protein concentrations that lead to unspecific (false) positives.
*The hybrid proteins are fusion proteins; that is, the fused parts may inhibit certain interactions, especially if an interaction takes place at the N-terminus of a test protein (where the DNA-binding or activation domain is typically attached).
*An interaction may not happen in yeast, the typical host organism for Y2H. For instance, if a bacterial protein is tested in yeast, it may lack a chaperone for proper folding that is only present in its bacterial host. Moreover, a [[mammalian]] protein is sometimes not correctly modified in yeast (e.g., missing [[phosphorylation]]), which can also lead to false results.
*The Y2H takes place in the nucleus. If test proteins are not localized to the nucleus (because they have other localization signals) two interacting proteins may be found to be non-interacting.
*Some proteins might specifically interact when they are co-expressed in the yeast, although in reality they are never present in the same cell at the same time. However, in most cases it cannot be ruled out that such proteins are indeed expressed in certain cells or under certain circumstances.

Each of these points alone can give rise to false results. Due to the combined effects of all error sources yeast two-hybrid have to be interpreted with caution. The probability of generating false positives means that all interactions should be confirmed by a high confidence assay, for example [[co-immunoprecipitation]] of the endogenous proteins, which is difficult for large scale protein–protein interaction data. Alternatively, Y2H data can be verified using multiple Y2H variants&lt;ref name="Chen2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YC, Rajagopala SV, Stellberger T, Uetz P | title = Exhaustive benchmarking of the yeast two-hybrid system | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 667–8; author reply 668 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805792 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nmeth0910-667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or bioinformatics techniques. The latter test whether interacting proteins are expressed at the same time, share some common features (such as [[gene ontology]] annotations or certain [[network topologies]]), have homologous interactions in other species.&lt;ref name="Koegl2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koegl M, Uetz P | title = Improving yeast two-hybrid screening systems | journal = Briefings in Functional Genomics &amp; Proteomics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 302–12 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18218650 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/bfgp/elm035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''V. G. Khlopin Radium Institute''', also known as the '''First Radium Institute''', is a research and production institution located in [[Saint Petersburg]] specializing in the fields of [[nuclear physics]], [[radiochemistry|radio-]] and [[geochemistry]], and on [[ecology|ecological topics]], associated with the problems of nuclear power engineering, [[radioecology]], and [[isotope]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istc.ru/istc/db/inst.nsf/wsu/i0001614?OpenDocument&amp;lang=Eng Institution] – ISTC.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a subsidiary company of the [[Rosatom]] Russian state corporation.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">'''The Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities''', located in Seattle, Washington, is one of the largest and most comprehensive [[humanities]] centers in the United States. Housed in the College of Arts and Sciences at the [[University of Washington]] (UW), it offers UW scholars a spectrum of local opportunities for intellectual community and grant support that advances [[crossdisciplinarity]], [[collaboration]], and research while networking them nationally and internationally.

==History==
In 1987, the UW's College of Arts and Sciences established the University of Washington Center for the Humanities with a mandate to support interdisciplinary activities. Ron Moore and [[Leroy Searle]] served as formative leaders of the Center. In 1997, Barclay and Sharon Simpson endowed the Center, which was renamed the Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities, in tribute to Barclay Simpson's father, a lifelong supporter of humanistic education. [[Kathleen Woodward]] was named Director of the Center in 2000; she continues to lead it today.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/about/history]

==Programs and Initiatives==
===Collaboration and Crossdisciplinarity===
All Center programs are grounded in [[collaboration]] and [[crossdisciplinarity]]. The Center provides funding and support for fellowship programs, research clusters, graduate student interest groups, conferences, and symposia, allowing faculty and graduate students to exchange ideas and develop individual and collaborative projects together with other faculty, students, visiting scholars, and community practitioners.

Between 2000 and 2013, the Simpson Center funded 126 faculty fellowships and 51 dissertation fellowships supporting scholars from 30 campus units across the humanities, arts, social sciences, and professional schools.

The Center also supports large-scale projects funded by major foundations and agencies. Recent examples include the American Music Partnership with [[KEXP-FM]] of Seattle ([[Paul G. Allen Family Foundation]], 2009–2011), the Sawyer Seminar on Now Urbanism ([[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], 2010–2012), and Biological Futures in a Globalized World ([[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], 2011–2012).

===Public Scholarship===
The Simpson Center has gained national recognition for its work advancing scholarship as a publicly engaged practice, a field often referred to as the [[public humanities]]. Undertaken with and for diverse communities, public scholarship promotes mutually-beneficial partnerships between higher education and organizations in the public and private sectors.

The Certificate in Public Scholarship is a portfolio- and project-based program that enables graduate students and faculty mentors to integrate their scholarly, social, and political commitments in the context of their intellectual and professional development.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/programs/curriculum/certificate-in-public-scholarship]

Center grants support humanities-based research, teaching, and engagement projects that encourage dialogue, exchange, and collaboration among UW scholars and community members.

The Center hosts the Solomon Katz Distinguished Lectures in the Humanities, which feature leading thinkers such as [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Robin D. G. Kelley]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Anne Balsamo]], and [[Cathy Davidson]] in events that are free and open to the public.

===Digital Humanities===
In 2008, the Simpson Center received a $625,000 Challenge Grant by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), an endorsement for its plans to raise funds to establish the Digital Humanities Commons, a fellowship program that will support inventive and experimental research inspired by new and emerging technologies in the [[digital humanities]]. In 2010, the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] gave $600,000 to underwrite the Digital Humanities Commons fund-raising efforts.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/programs/initiatives/digital-humanities-commons] The fundraising goal was met in February 2013,[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/news/2013/02/simpson-center-meets-digital-humanities-fundraising-goal] and  beginning Summer 2014, the Simpson Center Digital Humanities Commons will enable UW faculty and graduate students to collaborate with librarians, engineers, and designers in the development, innovation, and exchange of digital research and scholarship.

Simpson Center Initiatives, such as the 2011 Digital Research Summer Institute and the Puget Sounds archives for rare performances of Northwest popular music, are helping to build campus communities of scholarly digital practice.

==Affiliations==
The Simpson Center maintains affiliations with national and international scholarly organizations, such as the [[Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes]]; [[HASTAC]] (Humanities, Arts, Science, Technology Advanced Collaboratory); Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life; the National Humanities Alliance; and the Western Humanities Alliance.

{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |title=Data on Women in S&amp;E |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819125228/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/cwsem/index.htm|title=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|publisher=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Brian|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/11-47.pdf|website=ASEE|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,
[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates Women Lead in Doctorates], ''Inside Higher Ed,'' September 14, 2010 (accessed June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; then to 22.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).

'''Xylem''' is one of the two types of transport [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] in [[vascular plant]]s, [[phloem]] being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport [[water]] from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports  [[plant nutrition|nutrients]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|title=Xylem and phloem|url=https://www.basicbiology.net/plants/physiology/xylem-phloem/|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504195130/https://www.basicbiology.net/plants/physiology/xylem-phloem/|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Plant Science |volume= 1 |editor= Keith Roberts |edition= illustrated |publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2007 |isbn= 9780470057230 |page= 185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "xylem" is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ξύλον}} (''xylon''), meaning "wood"; the best-known xylem tissue is [[wood]], though it is found throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Providing for Energy: Report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on United States Energy Policy |author= Richard B.

== Structure ==
{{plain image with caption|Xylem cells.svg|Cross section of some xylem cells|400px|right}}
The most distinctive xylem [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are the long tracheary elements that transport water. [[Tracheid]]s and [[vessel element]]s are distinguished by their shape;  vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called ''vessels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raven, Peter A. |author2=Evert, Ray F. |author3=Eichhorn, Susan E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1999|title=Biology of Plants|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|pages=576–577|isbn=978-1-57259-611-5|nopp= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xylem also contains two other cell types: [[parenchyma]] and [[ground tissue#Fibres|fibers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650951/xylem Xylem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916145301/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650951/xylem |date=2011-09-16 }}. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

Xylem can be found:
* in [[vascular bundle]]s, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants
* in secondary xylem, laid down by a [[meristem]] called the [[vascular cambium]] in woody plants
* as part of a [[stele (biology)|stelar arrangement]] not divided into bundles, as in many [[fern]]s.

In transitional stages of plants with [[secondary growth]], the first two categories are not mutually exclusive, although usually a vascular bundle will contain ''primary xylem'' only.

The branching pattern exhibited by xylem follows [[Murray's law]].&lt;ref name="mcculloh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCulloh|first=Katherine A.|author2=John S. Sperry|author3=Frederick R. Adler|title=Water transport in plants obeys Murray's law|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature01444|volume=421|pages=939–942|year=2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6926/full/nature01444.html|pmid=12607000|issue=6926|bibcode=2003Natur.421..939M|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106040520/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6926/full/nature01444.html|archivedate=2009-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary and secondary xylem ==
'''Primary xylem''' is formed during primary growth from [[procambium]]. It includes protoxylem and metaxylem. Metaxylem develops after the protoxylem but before secondary xylem. Metaxylem has wider vessels and tracheids than protoxylem.

'''Secondary xylem''' is formed during secondary growth from [[vascular cambium]]. Although secondary xylem is also found in members of the [[gymnosperm]] groups [[Gnetophyta]] and [[Ginkgophyta]] and to a lesser extent in members of the [[Cycadophyta]], the two main groups in which secondary xylem can be found are:
#[[conifers]] (''Coniferae''): there are some six hundred species of conifers. All species have secondary xylem, which is relatively uniform in structure throughout this group. Many conifers become tall trees: the secondary xylem of such trees is used and marketed as [[softwood]].
#[[angiosperms]] (''Angiospermae''): there are some quarter of a million to four hundred thousand species of angiosperms. Within this group secondary xylem is rare in the [[monocots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dickison, W.C.|year=2000|title=Integrative Plant Anatomy (page 196)|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780080508917|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-os1kvkFbS0C|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106151303/https://books.google.com/books?id=-os1kvkFbS0C|archivedate=2017-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-monocot angiosperms become trees, and the secondary xylem of these is used and marketed as [[hardwood]].

== Main function – upwards water transport ==
The xylem, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of water conducting channels reaching all parts of the plants. It transports water and soluble mineral nutrients from the roots throughout the plant. It is also used to replace water lost during [[transpiration]] and photosynthesis. Xylem [[plant sap|sap]] consists mainly of water and inorganic ions, although it can also contain a number of organic chemicals as well. The transport is passive, not powered by energy spent by the [[Vessel elements|tracheary]] elements themselves, which are dead by maturity and no longer have living contents. Transporting sap upwards becomes more difficult as the height of a plant increases and upwards transport of water by xylem is considered to limit the maximum height of trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=George W.|last2=Sillett|first2=Stephen C.|last3=Jennings|first3=Gregory M.|last4=Davis|first4=Stephen D.|title=The limits to tree height|journal=Nature|date=2004|volume=428|issue=6985|pages=851–854|doi=10.1038/nature02417|pmid=15103376|bibcode=2004Natur.428..851K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three phenomena cause xylem sap to flow:
* [[Pressure Flow Hypothesis|'''Pressure flow hypothesis''']]: Sugars produced in the leaves and other green tissues are kept in the phloem system, creating a [[Water potential|solute pressure]] differential versus the xylem system carrying a far lower load of solutes- water and minerals. The phloem pressure can rise to several MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knoblauch|first=Michael|last2=Knoblauch|first2=Jan|last3=Mullendore|first3=Daniel L.|last4=Savage|first4=Jessica A.|last5=Babst|first5=Benjamin A.|last6=Beecher|first6=Sierra D.|last7=Dodgen|first7=Adam C.|last8=Jensen|first8=Kaare H.|last9=Holbrook|first9=N. Michele|date=2016-06-02|title=Testing the Münch hypothesis of long distance phloem transport in plants|url=https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e15341v2|journal=eLife|language=en|volume=5|pages=e15341|doi=10.7554/eLife.15341|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4946904|pmid=27253062}}&lt;/ref&gt; far higher than atmospheric pressure. Selective inter-connection between these systems allows this high solute concentration in the phloem to draw xylem fluid upwards by negative pressure.
* {{anchor|Transpirational pull}}'''[[Transpirational pull]]''': Similarly, the [[evaporation]] of [[water]] from the surfaces of [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells to the atmosphere also creates a negative pressure at the top of a plant. This causes millions of minute [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]] to form in the mesophyll cell wall. The resulting [[surface tension]] causes a negative pressure or [[tension (physics)|tension]] in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil.
* '''[[Root pressure]]''': If the [[water potential]] of the root cells is more negative than that of the [[soil]], usually due to high concentrations of [[Solution|solute]], water can move by [[osmosis]] into the root from the soil. This causes a positive pressure that forces sap up the xylem towards the leaves. In some circumstances, the sap will be forced from the leaf through a [[hydathode]] in a phenomenon known as [[guttation]]. Root pressure is highest in the morning before the stomata open and allow transpiration to begin.  Different plant species can have different root pressures even in a similar environment; examples include up to 145 kPa in ''[[Vitis riparia]]'' but around zero in ''[[Celastrus orbiculatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2000|volume=87|pages=1272–78|title=Root pressure and specific conductivity in temperate lianas: exotic ''Celastrus orbiculatus'' (Celastraceae) vs. Native ''Vitis riparia'' (Vitaceae)|author=Tim J.

The primary force that creates the [[capillary action]] movement of water upwards in plants is the adhesion between the water and the surface of the xylem conduits.&lt;ref&gt;Cruiziat, Pierre and Richter, Hanno. [http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&amp;id=99 Plant Physiology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228144231/http://4e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=&amp;id=99 |date=2008-12-28 }}. Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Editors: Anthony Yeo, Tim Flowers|year=2007|title=Plant solute transport|location=Oxford UK|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-3995-3|page= 221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capillary action provides the force that establishes an equilibrium configuration, balancing gravity. When transpiration removes water at the top, the flow is needed to return to the equilibrium.

Transpirational pull results from the evaporation of water from the surfaces of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[leaf|leaves]]. This evaporation causes the surface of the water to recess into the [[wiktionary:pore|pore]]s of the [[cell wall]]. By [[capillary action]], the water forms concave [[Meniscus (liquid)|menisci]] inside the pores. The high surface tension of water pulls the [[wiktionary:Concavity|concavity]] outwards, generating enough [[force]] to lift water as high as a hundred meters from ground level to a [[tree]]'s highest branches.

Transpirational pull requires that the vessels transporting the water be very small in diameter; otherwise, [[cavitation]] would break the water column. And as water [[evaporates]] from leaves, more is drawn up through the plant to replace it. When the water pressure within the xylem reaches extreme levels due to low water input from the roots (if, for example, the soil is dry), then the gases come out of solution and form a bubble&amp;nbsp;– an [[embolism]] forms, which will spread quickly to other adjacent cells, unless [[pit (botany)|bordered pits]] are present (these have a plug-like structure called a torus, that seals off the opening between adjacent cells and stops the embolism from spreading).

=== Cohesion-tension theory ===
The ''cohesion-tension theory'' is a [[theory]] of [[intermolecular attraction]] that explains the process of [[water]] flow upwards (against the force of [[gravity]]) through the xylem of [[plant]]s. It was proposed in 1894 by [[John Joly]] and [[Henry Horatio Dixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Henry H. |last2=Joly |first2=J. |title=On the ascent of sap |journal=Annals of Botany |date=1894 |volume=8 |pages=468–470 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015001235830;view=1up;seq=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Henry H. |last2=Joly |first2=J. |title=On the ascent of sap |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B |date=1895 |volume=186 |pages=563–576 |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x001659730;view=1up;seq=609}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite numerous objections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tyree, M.T.|year=1997|title=The Cohesion-Tension theory of sap ascent: current controversies|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=48|issue=10|pages=1753–1765|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.abstract|doi=10.1093/jxb/48.10.1753|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220004428/http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.abstract|archivedate=2015-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wang, Z. |author2=Chang, C.-C. |author3=Hong, S.-J. |author4=Sheng, Y.-J. |author5=Tsao, H.-K. |year=2012|title=Capillary Rise in a Microchannel of Arbitrary Shape and Wettability: Hysteresis Loop|journal=Langmuir|volume=28|issue=49|pages=16917–16926|doi=10.1021/la3036242|pmid=23171321}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is the most widely accepted theory for the transport of water through a plant's vascular system based on the classical research of Dixon-Joly (1894),  Eugen Askenasy (1845–1903) (1895),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Askenasy|first=E.|title=Ueber das Saftsteigen|trans-title=On the ascent of sap|journal=Botanisches Centralblatt|year=1895|volume=62|pages=237–238|language=German|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c079536710;view=1up;seq=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Askenasy |first1=E. |title=Ueber das Saftsteigen |journal=Verhandlungen des Naturhistorisch-medizinischen Vereins zu Heidelberg (Proceedings of the Natural History-Medical Society at Heidelberg) |date=1895 |volume=5 |pages=325–345 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43534#page/349/mode/1up |series=2nd series |trans-title=On the ascent of sap |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dixon (1914,1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=H|title=Transpiration and the ascent of sap in plants|year=1914|publisher= Macmillan and Co.|location=London, England, UK|url=https://archive.org/stream/transpirationasc00dixo#page/n5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=H|title=The transpiration stream|year= 1924|publisher=University of London Press, Ltd|location=London|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is a [[polar molecule]]. When two water molecules approach one another, the slightly negatively charged [[oxygen]] atom of one forms a [[hydrogen bond]] with a slightly positively charged [[hydrogen]] atom in the other. This attractive force, along with other [[intermolecular force]]s, is one of the principal factors responsible for the occurrence of [[surface tension]] in liquid water. It also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf.

Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension. Transpiration pull, utilizing [[capillary action]] and the inherent surface tension of water, is the primary mechanism of water movement in plants. However, it is not the only mechanism involved. Any use of water in leaves forces water to move into them.

[[Transpiration]] in leaves creates tension (differential pressure) in the cell walls of [[Mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]] cells. Because of this tension, water is being pulled up from the roots into the leaves, helped by [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] (the pull between individual water molecules, due to [[hydrogen bonds]]) and [[adhesion]] (the stickiness between water molecules and the [[hydrophilic]] cell walls of plants). This mechanism of water flow works because of [[water potential]] (water flows from high to low potential), and the rules of simple [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology|year=2002|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2|pages=759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past century, there has been a great deal of research regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists continue to agree that the ''cohesion-tension theory'' best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem [[osmotic pressure]] [[gradient]]s, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Ulrich|title=What are the driving forces for water lifting in the xylem conduit?|journal=Physiologia|year=2002|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.2002.1140301.x|pmid=12060254|volume=114|issue=3|pages=327–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tyree1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyree|first=Melvin T.|title=The cohesion-tension theory of sap ascent: current controversies|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=48|issue=10|pages=1753–1765|year=1997|doi=10.1093/jxb/48.10.1753|url=http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/10/1753.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measurement of pressure ===
[[Image:Pressurebomb.svg|right|thumb|300px|A diagram showing the setup of a [[pressure bomb]]]]
Until recently, the differential pressure (suction) of transpirational pull could only be measured indirectly, by applying external pressure with a [[pressure bomb]] to counteract it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090918110039/http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/learning/resources/plant_form_function/external_sites/PAP/Lab08_WaterPot/08Lab_14.html The pressure of the water potential of the xylem in your plant's stem can be determined with the Scholander bomb.] bio.usyd.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt; When the technology to perform direct measurements with a pressure probe was developed, there was initially some doubt about whether the classic theory was correct, because some workers were unable to demonstrate negative pressures. More recent measurements do tend to validate the classic theory, for the most part. Xylem transport is driven by a combination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/water-uptake-and-transport-in-vascular-plants-103016037|title=Water Uptake and Transport in Vascular Plants|last=Andrew J. McElrone, Brendan Choat, Greg A. Gambetta, Craig R. Brodersen|date=2013|website=The Nature Education Knowledge Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of transpirational pull from above and [[root pressure]] from below, which makes the interpretation of measurements more complicated.

== Evolution ==
Xylem appeared early in the history of terrestrial plant life. Fossil plants with anatomically preserved xylem are known from the [[Silurian]] (more than 400 million years ago), and trace fossils resembling individual xylem cells may be found in earlier [[Ordovician]] rocks. The earliest true and recognizable xylem consists of [[tracheids]] with a helical-annular reinforcing layer added to the [[cell wall]]. This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues to be found in the ''protoxylem'' (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants. Several groups of plants later developed [[pit (botany)|pitted]] tracheid cells, it seems, through [[convergent evolution]]. In living plants, pitted tracheids do not appear in development until the maturation of the ''metaxylem'' (following the ''protoxylem'').

In most plants, pitted [[tracheid]]s function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the [[vessel element]]. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by ''bulk flow'', as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered to be one of the key innovations that led to the success of the [[angiosperms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carlquist, S.|author2=E.L. Schneider |year=2002|title=The tracheid–vessel element transition in angiosperms involves multiple independent features: cladistic consequences|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|issue=2|pages=185–195|doi= 10.3732/ajb.89.2.185|pmid=21669726}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or "basal" lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., [[Amborellaceae]], [[Tetracentraceae]], [[Trochodendraceae]], and [[Winteraceae]]), and their secondary xylem is described by [[Arthur Cronquist]] as "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of ''[[Gnetum]]'' to be convergent with those of angiosperms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cronquist, A.|date=August 1988|title=The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants|location=New York, New York|publisher=New York Botanical Garden Press|isbn=978-0-89327-332-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a [[cladistics#Definitions|primitive]] condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.

However, this comes at a price: while stomata are open to allow {{co2}} to enter, water can evaporate.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Sperry | first1 = J.

Specialized water transport tissues soon evolved in the form of hydroids, tracheids, then secondary xylem, followed by an endodermis and ultimately vessels.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

The high {{co2}} levels of Silurian-Devonian times, when plants were first colonizing land, meant that the need for water was relatively low. As {{co2}} was withdrawn from the atmosphere by plants, more water was lost in its capture, and more elegant transport mechanisms evolved.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; As water transport mechanisms, and waterproof cuticles, evolved, plants could survive without being continually covered by a film of water. This transition from [[poikilohydry]] to [[homoiohydry]] opened up new potential for colonization.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Plants then needed a robust internal structure that held long narrow channels for transporting water from the soil to all the different parts of the above-soil plant, especially to the parts where photosynthesis occurred.

During the Silurian, {{co2}} was readily available, so little water needed expending to acquire it. By the end of the Carboniferous, when {{co2}} levels had lowered to something approaching today's, around 17 times more water was lost per unit of {{co2}} uptake.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, even in these "easy" early days, water was at a premium, and had to be transported to parts of the plant from the wet soil to avoid [[desiccation]]. This early water transport took advantage of the ''cohesion-tension'' mechanism inherent in water. Water has a tendency to diffuse to areas that are drier, and this process is accelerated when water can be [[capillary action|wick]]ed along a fabric with small spaces. In small passages, such as that between the plant cell walls (or in tracheids), a column of water behaves like rubber&amp;nbsp;– when molecules evaporate from one end, they pull the molecules behind them along the channels. Therefore, transpiration alone provided the driving force for water transport in early plants.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, without dedicated transport vessels, the cohesion-tension mechanism cannot transport water more than about 2&amp;nbsp;cm, severely limiting the size of the earliest plants.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This process demands a steady supply of water from one end, to maintain the chains; to avoid exhausting it, plants developed a waterproof [[plant cuticle|cuticle]]. Early cuticle may not have had pores but did not cover the entire plant surface, so that gas exchange could continue.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; However, dehydration at times was inevitable; early plants cope with this by having a lot of water stored between their cell walls, and when it comes to it sticking out the tough times by putting life "on hold" until more water is supplied.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

To be free from the constraints of small size and constant moisture that the parenchymatic transport system inflicted, plants needed a more efficient water transport system. During the early Silurian, they developed specialized cells, which were [[lignin|lignified]] (or bore similar chemical compounds)&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; to avoid implosion; this process coincided with cell death, allowing their innards to be emptied and water to be passed through them.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; These wider, dead, empty cells were a million times more conductive than the inter-cell method, giving the potential for transport over longer distances, and higher {{co2}} diffusion rates.

The earliest macrofossils to bear water-transport tubes are Silurian plants placed in the genus ''[[Cooksonia (plant)|Cooksonia]]''.&lt;ref name=Edwards1992&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Edwards |first=D. |last2=Davies |first2=K.L. |last3=Axe |first3=L. |year=1992 |title=A vascular conducting strand in the early land plant ''Cooksonia'' |journal=Nature |volume=357 |issue=6380 |pages=683–685 |doi=10.1038/357683a0 |bibcode=1992Natur.357..683E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early Devonian pretracheophytes ''[[Aglaophyton]]'' and ''[[Horneophyton]]'' have structures very similar to the [[Hydroid (botany)|hydroids]] of modern mosses.

Water transport requires regulation, and dynamic control is provided by [[stoma]]ta.&lt;ref name=gk&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stewart, W.N. |author2=Rothwell, G.W. |title=Paleobiology and the evolution of plants|year=1993|publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By adjusting the amount of gas exchange, they can restrict the amount of water lost through transpiration. This is an important role where water supply is not constant, and indeed stomata appear to have evolved before tracheids, being present in the non-vascular hornworts.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

An [[endodermis]] probably evolved during the Silu-Devonian, but the first fossil evidence for such a structure is Carboniferous.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This structure in the roots covers the water transport tissue and regulates ion exchange (and prevents unwanted pathogens etc. from entering the water transport system). The endodermis can also provide an upwards pressure, forcing water out of the roots when transpiration is not enough of a driver.

Once plants had evolved this level of controlled water transport, they were truly homoiohydric, able to extract water from their environment through root-like organs rather than relying on a film of surface moisture, enabling them to grow to much greater size.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; As a result of their independence from their surroundings, they lost their ability to survive desiccation&amp;nbsp;– a costly trait to retain.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

During the Devonian, maximum xylem diameter increased with time, with the minimum diameter remaining pretty constant.&lt;ref name=Niklas1985&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Niklas | first1 = K.

While wider tracheids with robust walls make it possible to achieve higher water transport pressures, this increases the problem of cavitation.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Cavitation occurs when a bubble of air forms within a vessel, breaking the bonds between chains of water molecules and preventing them from pulling more water up with their cohesive tension. A tracheid, once cavitated, cannot have its embolism removed and return to service (except in a few advanced angiosperms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/plants/cavitation-and-embolism-in-vascular-plants-with-diagram/22732|title=Cavitation and Embolism in Vascular Plants (With Diagram)|last=Koratkar|first=Sanjay|date=2016-02-24|website=Biology Discussion|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/pubs/journals/pnw_2012_johnson002.pdf|title=Hydraulic safety margins and embolism reversal in stems and leaves: Why are conifers and angiosperms so different?|last=Daniel M. Johnson, Katherine A. McCulloh, David R. Woodruff, Frederick C. Meinzerc|date=June 2012|website=U.S Forest Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have developed a mechanism of doing so). Therefore, it is well worth plants' while to avoid cavitation occurring. For this reason, [[pit (botany)|pits]] in tracheid walls have very small diameters, to prevent air entering and allowing bubbles to nucleate. Freeze-thaw cycles are a major cause of cavitation. Damage to a tracheid's wall almost inevitably leads to air leaking in and cavitation, hence the importance of many tracheids working in parallel.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

Cavitation is hard to avoid, but once it has occurred plants have a range of mechanisms to contain the damage.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Small pits link adjacent conduits to allow fluid to flow between them, but not air&amp;nbsp;– although ironically these pits, which prevent the spread of embolisms, are also a major cause of them.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; These pitted surfaces further reduce the flow of water through the xylem by as much as 30%.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Conifers, by the Jurassic, developed an ingenious improvement, using valve-like structures to isolate cavitated elements. These torus-margo structures have a blob floating in the middle of a donut; when one side depressurizes the blob is sucked into the torus and blocks further flow.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Other plants simply accept cavitation; for instance, oaks grow a ring of wide vessels at the start of each spring, none of which survive the winter frosts. Maples use root pressure each spring to force sap upwards from the roots, squeezing out any air bubbles.

Growing to height also employed another trait of tracheids&amp;nbsp;– the support offered by their lignified walls. Defunct tracheids were retained to form a strong, woody stem, produced in most instances by a secondary xylem. However, in early plants, tracheids were too mechanically vulnerable, and retained a central position, with a layer of tough [[sclerenchyma]] on the outer rim of the stems.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Even when tracheids do take a structural role, they are supported by sclerenchymatic tissue.

Tracheids end with walls, which impose a great deal of resistance on flow;&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt; vessel members have perforated end walls, and are arranged in series to operate as if they were one continuous vessel.&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt; The function of end walls, which were the default state in the Devonian, was probably to avoid [[embolism]]s. An embolism is where an air bubble is created in a tracheid. This may happen as a result of freezing, or by gases dissolving out of solution. Once an embolism is formed, it usually cannot be removed (but see later); the affected cell cannot pull water up, and is rendered useless.

End walls excluded, the tracheids of prevascular plants were able to operate under the same hydraulic conductivity as those of the first vascular plant, ''Cooksonia''.&lt;ref name=Niklas1985/&gt;

The size of tracheids is limited as they comprise a single cell; this limits their length, which in turn limits their maximum useful diameter to 80&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Conductivity grows with the fourth power of diameter, so increased diameter has huge rewards; ''vessel elements'', consisting of a number of cells, joined at their ends, overcame this limit and allowed larger tubes to form, reaching diameters of up to 500&amp;nbsp;μm, and lengths of up to 10&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

Vessels first evolved during the dry, low {{co2}} periods of the late Permian, in the horsetails, ferns and [[Selaginellales]] independently, and later appeared in the mid Cretaceous in angiosperms and gnetophytes.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;
Vessels allow the same cross-sectional area of wood to transport around a hundred times more water than tracheids!&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; This allowed plants to fill more of their stems with structural fibers, and also opened a new niche to [[vine]]s, which could transport water without being as thick as the tree they grew on.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt; Despite these advantages, tracheid-based wood is a lot lighter, thus cheaper to make, as vessels need to be much more reinforced to avoid cavitation.&lt;ref name=Sperry2003/&gt;

[[File:Xylem Development.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Patterns of xylem development: xylem in brown; arrows show direction of development from protoxylem to metaxylem.]]
Xylem development can be described by four terms: ''centrarch, exarch, endarch'' and ''mesarch''.  As it develops in young plants, its nature changes from ''protoxylem'' to ''metaxylem'' (i.e. from ''first xylem'' to ''after xylem''). The patterns in which protoxylem and metaxylem are arranged is important in the study of plant morphology.

=== Protoxylem and metaxylem ===
As a young [[vascular plant]] grows, one or more strands of primary xylem form in its stems and roots. The first xylem to develop is called 'protoxylem'. In appearance protoxylem is usually distinguished by narrower vessels formed of smaller cells. Some of these cells have walls which contain thickenings in the form of rings or helices. Functionally, protoxylem can extend: the cells are able to grow in size and develop while a stem or root is elongating. Later, 'metaxylem' develops in the strands of xylem. Metaxylem vessels and cells are usually larger; the cells have thickenings which are typically either in the form of ladderlike transverse bars (scalariform) or continuous sheets except for holes or pits (pitted). Functionally, metaxylem completes its development after elongation ceases when the cells no longer need to grow in size.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Foster|first=A.S.|last2=Gifford|first2=E.M.|year=1974|title=Comparative Morphology of Vascular Plants|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|publisher=W.H.

=== Patterns of protoxylem and metaxylem ===
There are four main patterns to the arrangement of protoxylem and metaxylem in stems and roots.

* ''Centrarch'' refers to the case in which the primary xylem forms a single cylinder in the center of the stem and develops from the center outwards. The protoxylem is thus found in the central core and the metaxylem in a cylinder around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=White |first=A. Toby |last2=Kazlev |first2=M. Alan |title=Glossary |url=http://www.palaeos.com/Plants/Lists/Glossary/GlossaryA.html |work=palaeos.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220181617/http://palaeos.com/Plants/Lists/Glossary/GlossaryA.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern was common in early land plants, such as "[[rhyniophyte]]s", but is not present in any living plants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The other three terms are used where there is more than one strand of primary xylem.

* ''Exarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the outside inwards towards the center, i.e. centripetally. The metaxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the protoxylem closest to the periphery. The roots of [[vascular plant]]s are normally considered to have exarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;
* ''Endarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the inside outwards towards the periphery, i.e. centrifugally. The protoxylem is thus closest to the center of the stem or root and the metaxylem closest to the periphery. The stems of [[seed plant]]s typically have endarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;
* ''Mesarch'' is used when there is more than one strand of primary xylem in a stem or root, and the xylem develops from the middle of a strand in both directions. The metaxylem is thus on both the peripheral and central sides of the strand with the protoxylem between the metaxylem (possibly surrounded by it). The leaves and stems of many [[fern]]s have mesarch development.&lt;ref name="FosterGifford1974"/&gt;

== History ==

In his book ''De plantis libri XVI'' (On Plants, in 16 books) (1583), the Italian physician and botanist [[Andrea Cesalpino]] proposed that plants draw water from soil not by magnetism (''ut magnes ferrum trahit'', as magnetic iron attracts) nor by suction (''vacuum''), but by absorption, as occurs in the case of linen, sponges, or powders.&lt;ref&gt;See:

From p. 8 of (Malpighi, 1675): ''" … haec tubulosa sunt &amp; subrotunda, identidem tamen angustantur, &amp; perpetuo patent, nullumque, ut observare potui, effundunt humorem: Argentea lamina L, in spiram contorta, componuntur, ut facile laceratione, (velut in bombycinis tracheis expertus sum,) in hanc oblongam &amp; continuatam fasciam resolvantur.

( … these [vessels] are tubular and somewhat round, yet often become narrow, and they are always open, and none, as [far as] I could perceive, exude a liquid: they are composed of silvery sheets ''L'', twisted into a helix, although they can easily be unbound, by tearing, into this somewhat long and connected strip (just as I have done in silkworm treacheas).  This sheet, if it be examined further with a microscope, is composed of scale-like particles; which likewise is observed in the tracheas of insects.  On these helical vessels, or as I will more rightly say, "tracheas", there stand woody filaments ''M'', which being extended in length straddle – for greater strength and hardness – lines of transverse cells ''N'', so that it is constructed like a mat.)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malpighi believed that xylem contained only air, the British physician and botanist [[Nehemiah Grew]], who was Malpighi's contemporary, believed that sap ascended both through the bark and through the xylem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grew |first1=Nehemiah |title=The Anatomy of Plants … |date=1682 |publisher=W.

* (Grew, 1682), p. 126.  Grew recognized the limits of capillary action (from p. 126): " … small ''Glass-Pipes'' [i.e., capillary tubes] immersed in Water, will give it [i.e., the water] an ascent for some inches; yet there is a certain ''period'', according to the ''bore'' of the ''Pipe'', beyond which it will not rise."  Grew proposed the following mechanism for the ascent of sap in plants (from p. 126): "But the ''Bladders'' [i.e., parenchymal cells]  DP, which surround it [i.e., the column of tracheids], being swelled up and turgid with ''Sap'', do hereby press upon it; and so not only a little contract its bore, but also transfuse or strain some ''Portion'' of their ''Sap'' thereinto: by both which means, the ''Sap'' will be forced to rise higher therein."

From (Hales, 1727), p. 100: "And by the same [capillary] principle it is, that we see in the preceding Experiments plants imbibe moisture so vigorously up their fine capillary vessels; which moisture, as it is carried off in perspiration [i.e., transpiration], (by the action of warmth), thereby gives the sap vessels liberty to be almost continually attracting fresh supplies, which they could
not do, if they were fully saturate with moisture: For without perspiration the sap must necessarily stagnate, not withstanding the sap vessels are so curiously adapted by their exceeding fineness, to raise the sap to great heights, in reciprocal proportion to their very minute diameters."&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1891, the Polish-German botanist [[Eduard Strasburger]] had shown that the transport of water in plants did not require the xylem cells to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;See:
