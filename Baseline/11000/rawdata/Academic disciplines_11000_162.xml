      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3573">'''AQUAL''' is a [[theory of gravity]] based on [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] (MOND), but using a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]. It was developed by [[Jacob Bekenstein]] and [[Mordehai Milgrom]] in their 1984 paper, "Does the missing mass problem signal the breakdown of Newtonian gravity?". "AQUAL" stands for "A QUAdratic Lagrangian".

The gravitational force law obtained from MOND, 

:&lt;math&gt;m \mu \left (\frac{a}{a_0} \right) a = \frac{GMm}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;
has a serious defect: it violates [[Newton's third law of motion]], and therefore fails to [[Conservation law (physics)|conserve]] momentum and energy. To see this, consider two objects with &lt;math&gt;m \neq M&lt;/math&gt;; then we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left (\frac{a_m}{a_0} \right) m a_m = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{GMm}{r^2} = \mu \left (\frac{a_M}{a_0} \right) M a_M&lt;/math&gt;

but the third law gives &lt;math&gt;m a_m = M a_M,&lt;/math&gt; so we would get 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu \left (\frac{a_m}{a_0} \right)=\mu \left (\frac{a_M}{a_0} \right)&lt;/math&gt; 

even though &lt;math&gt;a_m \neq a_M,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; would therefore be constant, contrary to the MOND assumption that it is linear for small arguments.

This problem can be rectified by deriving the force law from a Lagrangian, at the cost of possibly modifying the general form of the force law. Then conservation laws could then be derived from the Lagrangian by the usual means.

The AQUAL Lagrangian is: 

:&lt;math&gt;\rho \Phi + \frac{1}{8 \pi G} a_0^2 F \left (\frac{|\nabla\Phi|^2}{a_0^2} \right);&lt;/math&gt;

this leads to a modified Poisson equation: 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \left  (\mu \left (\frac{|\nabla\Phi|}{a_0} \right ) \nabla\Phi \right ) = 4 \pi G \rho, \qquad \text{with } \quad \mu(x) = \frac{dF(x^2)}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

where the predicted acceleration is &lt;math&gt;-\nabla\Phi = a.&lt;/math&gt; These equations reduce to the MOND equations in the spherically symmetric case, although they differ somewhat in the disc case needed for modelling spiral or lenticular galaxies. However, the difference is only 10–15%, so does not seriously impact the results.

According to Sanders and [[Stacy McGaugh|McGaugh]], one problem with AQUAL (or any [[scalar-tensor theory]] in which the scalar field enters as a conformal factor multiplying Einstein's metric) is AQUAL's failure to predict the amount of [[gravitational lens]]ing actually observed in rich clusters of galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sanders, Robert H.|author2=McGaugh, Stacy S.|title=Modified Newtonian dynamics as an alternative to dark matter|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=40|issue=1|year=2002|pages=263–317|arxiv=astro-ph/0204521|bibcode=2002ARA&amp;A..40..263S|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.40.060401.093923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2679">'''Amorphous carbonia''', also called '''a-carbonia''' or '''a-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', is an exotic [[amorphous]] solid form of [[carbon dioxide]] that is analogous to amorphous [[silica glass]]. It was first made in the laboratory in 2006 by subjecting [[dry ice]] to high pressures (40-48 [[gigapascal]], or 400,000 to 480,000 [[atmosphere]]s), in a [[diamond anvil cell]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy Of Mathematics|author=Francis, J.|date=2008|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=9788182202672|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UGGgTXUJCEC|page=198|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amorphous carbonia is not stable at ordinary pressures—it quickly reverts to normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9339-carbon-dioxide-glass-created-in-the-lab.html Carbon dioxide glass created in the lab] 15 June 2006, www.newscientisttech.com. Retrieved 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While normally carbon dioxide forms [[molecular crystal]]s, where individual molecules are bound by [[Van der Waals force]]s, in amorphous carbonia a [[covalent bond|covalently bound]] three-dimensional network of atoms is formed, in a structure analogous to [[silicon dioxide]] or [[germanium dioxide]] glass.

Mixtures of a-carbonia and a-[[silica]] may be a prospective very hard and stiff glass material stable at room temperature. Such glass may serve as [[protective coating]]s, e.g. in [[microelectronics]].

The discovery has implications for [[astrophysics]], as interiors of [[gas giant|massive planets]] may contain amorphous solid carbon dioxide.

'''Aplia Inc.''' is an [[educational technology]] company founded in 2000 by [[Stanford University]] professor [[Paul Romer]] that offers online homework products geared toward college-level courses. In March 2007 [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired Aplia Inc. Aplia was based in [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], California until March 2014, when it relocated to Cengage Learning's new [[Mission Bay, San Francisco]] office.

==History==
In 1998, Romer created an online experiment system for use in his economics courses at [[Stanford University]] so his students would come to class better prepared and become more engaged with the course material. After other professors expressed interest in his approach, Romer decided to turn this system into the basis for a new company. He raised $10 million in venture capital to start Aplia, an online learning system. Since 2000, it has been used by over 4,300 professors, 1,200,000 students, at 1,300 colleges and universities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
Aplia’s basic product includes online homework assignments that professors can assign to students in accounting, business communication, business law, developmental reading, economics, finance, marketing, philosophy, statistics, and taxation. While the basic premise behind each course is the same, course materials vary; in many cases, Aplia problem sets are designed to complement specific textbook from a variety of publishers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Aplia support representatives set up and edit courses per the professor's schedule. Assignment types include problem sets, news analyses, tutorials, and (for economics) interactive market experiments.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Aplia is often integrated with textbooks from different publishers.  Aplia's questions are written by content experts in their respective fields and the problem sets match the tone, difficulty level, style, of the textbook. Aplia works with publishers, authors, and contributors, and many users believe the quality is decent.&lt;ref&gt;http://amplicate.com/hate/aplia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/07/AR2009050704299_pf.html|title=Steven Pearlstein - An Economist, an Academic Puzzle and a Lot of Promise|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of pricing, many of Aplia's products have a low-cost digital textbook as well as Aplia. In the Friday, May 9 issue of ''The Washington Post'', author Steven Pearlstein writes: "Aplia also paves the way for the textbook industry to ditch a lousy business model in which it has to charge ridiculously high prices for new books because it cannot collect anything from the students who buy them on the used-book market. Instead, publishers could move to a more sustainable model in which the textbook is priced close to the cost of printing and shipping (say, $20), while all students are charged a reasonable fee (say, $60) for what really matters, which is the content of the textbook, the labs and homework exercises."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Research has also shown Aplia to be less effective in the classroom for students who require an indepth relationship with the teacher. Studies are surfacing to find online learning to be another challenge that students must overcome in order to learn a subject they might be unfamiliar with. Some anecdotal evidence has been found that schools administration have found value in the micromanagement software features that Aplia offers, especially with keeping students on track with their assignments and increasing engagement and participation in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504850600993663|title=‘D’ is for dilly-dally?|first1=Arthur J.|last1=Caplan|first2=John|last2=Gilbert|date=21 November 2008|publisher=|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1085–1088|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/13504850600993663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company/press/ael_010107.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aplia features==

===Chapter assignments and problem sets===
Chapter assignments (or problem sets)--groups of questions based on each chapter of a textbook—are automatically graded and provide students with explanations for every question. All problems are randomized and written by a team of subject matter experts. Most assignments use "Grade It Now" technology. Students are given three attempts on each problem; if they don't like their score after their first attempt, they may try a second time; if they don’t like their score after two, they may try a third; they don't have to use all three attempts. Scores are averaged.

===News analyses===
In economics and finance, Aplia regularly features economics and finance articles from new sources. Each story includes a summary and follow-up questions.

===Experiments===
For economics, Aplia offers real-time, online market experiments to help students understand what the real market environment is like. Each experiment is supported by assignments that prepare students for this and help them analyze their results. These experiments have had proven success in the classroom as well—according to research, Aplia's methods provide college students with means to truly learn the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=708841|title=Conducting a Double Oral Auction Experiment in a High School Computer Lab: A Pilot Study|first=Paul R.|last=Johnson|date=1 March 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimedia===
All of Aplia's courses use multimedia to pique students' interest. Developmental Reading, for instance, uses audio so students can hear how vocabulary words are pronounced; Logic uses interactive Venn diagrams, truth tables, and natural deduction proofs so students keep learning the material hands-on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/developmentalreading&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplia.com/philosophy|title=Aplia|website=www.aplia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment and grading===
Aplia keeps instructors informed about student participation, progress, and real-time graphical reports. Instructors can download, save, manipulate, print, import, and export student grades. Gradebook Analytics allow instructors to monitor and address performance on a student-by-student and topic-by-topic basis.

===Course management system===
Instructors can post announcements, upload course materials, host student discussions, e-mail students, and manage their gradebook with Aplia’s course management system. Aplia works independently or in conjunction with other course management systems.

==Aplia criticism==

===Additional course fees and registration fees===
Students are charged (per course) additional registration fees on top of their home institutions tuition or per unit fees. This may amount to more than the parent institution's total cost for the entire course when including materials fees. This has been regarded by some to be a "troubling lack of transparency regarding the total net costs associated with getting a college degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.com/channels/should-students-pay-to-submit-homework-publishers-think-so/|title=Should Students Pay to Submit Homework? Publishers Think So|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing jobs ===
In 2015 several employees were asked to gather in the main conference room where a tactic of "psychological divide and conquer" separated the employees into the first of many days and weeks of learning that not only was their job being sent overseas that they would be shadowed by their replacement whom they would train.

One employee told Computer World "The employees were warned that speaking to the news media meant loss of severance" Once the story broke the company ignored media contacts and plowed ahead on a double down strategy of cutting costs and pressuring employees vs focusing on a total quality management strategy that was recommended by members of the Board and its Founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3002681/it-outsourcing/fury-and-fear-in-ohio-as-it-jobs-go-to-india.html|title=Fury and fear in Ohio as IT jobs go to India|first=Patrick|last=Thibodeau|work=computerworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ask A Biologist''' is a [[science outreach]] program originating from [[Arizona State University]]'s School of [[Life Sciences]].

==About the program==

Ask A Biologist is a pre-kindergarten through high school program dedicated to answering questions from students, their teachers, and parents. The primary focus of the program is to connect students and teachers with working scientists through a question and answer Web e-mail form. The companion website also includes a large collection of free content and activities that can be used inside, as well as outside, of the classroom. The award-winning program has been continuously running for more than 14 years, with the assistance of more than 150 volunteer scientists, faculty, and graduate students in biology and related fields. In 2010 the program released its new website interface and features that became the subject for articles in the journals
[[Science (journal)|Science]]&lt;ref name="rc10"&gt;{{cite web

===Primary audience===

Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the [[World Wide Web|World-Wide-Web]]. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades pre[[K–12 (education)|K-12]], as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials.

===History===

Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/askabiologist/
|title=Early Ask A Biologist Web Page
|accessdate=January 12, 2009
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222162859/http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/askabiologist/
|archivedate=February 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewable on the [[Internet Archive]] a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities.

By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities.

In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments.

In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with [[Audubon International|Audubon]] Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion [[Spectrogram|sonograms]], bird images, text descriptions, and range maps.

In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a "five out of five star" rating.&lt;ref name="rc2"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=80436
|title=Ask A Biologist
|date= 2005 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=MERLOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a [[Comics in education|comic book]] adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story.

Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on [[iTunes]] U with its audio [[podcast]] of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld.&lt;ref name="rc3"&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the guest scientists interviewed on the show included [[biologist]]s and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning authors [[Edward O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]], as well as [[physicist]] and writer [[Paul Davies]].
 
In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest&lt;ref name="rc4"&gt;{{cite web

|title=At the head(phones) of their class: Elementary school students win K-12 podcast contest
|accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; that offered students in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metro area the opportunity to meet and interview working scientists.

In 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of [[Web 2.0]] tools as part of the [[National Science Digital Library]] (NSDL).

In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool [[Drupal]] and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September.

In 2011 two new sections were added to the website. Body Depot is a collaborative project with the [[Arizona Science Center]] funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). PLOSable is a project that links plain language and kid-friendly reviews to primary source publications in journals of the [[Public Library of Science]].

[[Image:CPAS building.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Centre for the Public Awareness of Science at the Australian National University in Canberra]]
The '''Centre for the Public Awareness of Science''' is part of the [[Australian National University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Centre for the Public Awareness of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000 it became an accredited Centre for the Australian National Commission for [[UNESCO]].

==Work of the Centre==

As a [[UNESCO]] Centre, CPAS engages with [[science communication]] and communicators in the Pacific region and beyond.  In partnership with the [[UNESCO]] Pacific Office in [[Apia]], [[Samoa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=36986&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO Pacific Office in Apia, Samoa]&lt;/ref&gt; CPAS has focused on science teaching training and communication in Pacific nations.  As well as running a science journalism workshop for [[Pacific Island]] journalists in 2001, CPAS  followed up in the same year with a science teacher workshop and the first Pacific Science Communication Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au Pacific Science Communication Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNESCO]] office in [[Jakarta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.or.id UNESCO Office in Jakarta, Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt; invited CPAS to join a mission to [[Cambodia]] to conduct a survey to identify and assess the needs of the country with respect to science education in schools and universities. Other activities include joining with [[UNESCO]] ([[Apia]]) to help in its aims to raise social participation in science in and around the Pacific.

CPAS also established, as a pilot project, the Register of Pacific Scientists, an online database for those involved with Pacific Science to record their details and/or search for other people with similar or complementary interests. 

Other activities of CPAS include the presentation of workshops for secondary school science teachers and others in [[Fiji]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]]. A joint teaching program is being developed with the [[National University of Singapore]]. In [[South Africa]], CPAS helped to develop a touring hands-on science exhibition and has been invited to work in and with various [[South African]] science centres.

==Teaching, Outreach and Research==

With a flourishing graduate program, CPAS encourages research in all aspects of [[science communication]]. Degrees are offered at all tertiary levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php CPAS Academic Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113805/http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/academic/index.php |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach programs within Australia include workshops for research scientists, science teachers, science and engineering students and science centre personnel, as well as the ANU Shell [[Questacon]] Science Circus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/sqsc.html ANU Shell Questacon Science Circus]&lt;/ref&gt; 

CPAS has a wide research program dealing with issues at the interface of science and the public. Apart from a long-standing agenda of research in science centres, CPAS is concerned with current issues in science, with the communication agendas of scientists, and with effective communication of science concepts. The research program is interdisciplinary and contributes to the emerging framework of [[science communication]] theory.

==History==

CPAS was launched by Professor [[Richard Dawkins]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas-dev.anu.edu.au/about/CPAS_launch.php CPAS Launch]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owes it origin to the establishment, twenty years earlier, of a modest science centre in a vacant primary school in [[Canberra]]. This burgeoning science centre eventually grew into [[Questacon]] – The National Science and Technology Centre. [[Questacon]] was the brainchild of [[Mike Gore (physicist)|Michael Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike Prof. Michael Gore] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Mike |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior lecturer in Physics at the Australian National University, who became its first director. An important part of its activities was outreach, supported from the beginning by sponsorship from [[Shell Australia]].

Dr Gore approached Professor Chris Bryant,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris Prof. Chris Bryant] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Chris |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Dean of Science at the [[Australian National University]], with a proposal to set up a science circus to travel Australia, to be staffed by graduate science students enrolled in a course of [[science communication]]. Thus was born the Graduate Certificate in Science Communication that rapidly metamorphosed into a Graduate Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php CPAS Graduate Diploma in Science Communication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629085932/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/academic/Graduate_Diploma.php |date=June 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative proved extremely popular and it became clear that there was a hitherto undetected demand for such a course. Over the next few years, Masters and PhD courses were offered and science communication became a full-fledged graduate program.

By 1994, the demand was so great that the Faculty of Science at the [[Australian National University]] agreed to fund a Lectureship in [[Science Communication]]. This was the first in Australia and, possibly, the world. Dr [[Susan Stocklmayer]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue Dr Susan Stocklmayer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718222852/http://cpas.anu.edu.au/staff/index.php#Sue |date=July 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to the position and immediately announced her intention of establishing a university centre for [[science communication]].  The Centre was established in 1996, with Professor Bryant as its first, interim, Director. Dr Stocklmayer took over the position in 1998, where she remains today.

==Awards==

In subsequent years, the work of CPAS has been recognised by a number of awards and honours: In 1999, CPAS, [[Shell Australia]] and [[Questacon]] jointly won the Business/Higher Education Round Table&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhert.com/ Business/Higher Education Round Table]&lt;/ref&gt; Award. The citation commends CPAS as “a university centre whose brief is to empower Australians by encouraging in them the confidence of 'ownership' of modern science. It is intended to increase science awareness in the Australian community and to improve communication skills of scientists.”  In 2000, its standing was such that it was designated as the first UNESCO Centre for Science Communication.

In 2004, the triple partnership was awarded the Financial Review National Award for long term sponsorship, and in 2006 it won the Special Award for Excellence in the Prime Ministers Community Business Partnerships. The individual contributions of members of CPAS have also been widely recognised and they have received many personal accolades.

'''Behavioural sciences''' explore the cognitive processes within [[organism]]s and the behavioural interactions between organisms in the natural world. It involves the systematic analysis and investigation of [[human]] and [[animal]] behavior through the study of the past, controlled and [[naturalistic observation]] of the present, and disciplined scientific [[experimentation]] and [[Conceptual model|modeling]]. It attempts to accomplish legitimate, objective conclusions through rigorous formulations and observation.&lt;ref name= "Klemke"&gt;Klemke, E. D., Hollinger, R., and Kline, A. D., (1980), Introduction to the book in 'Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science': Buffalo, New York, Prometheus Books p 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of behavioral sciences include [[psychology]], [[psychobiology]], [[anthropology]], and [[cognitive science]]. Generally, behavior science deals primarily with human action and often seeks to generalize about human behavior as it relates to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Categories==
Behavioural sciences includes two broad categories: neural — ''Information sciences'' and social — ''Relational sciences''.

Information processing sciences deals with [[information processing]] of stimuli from the social environment by cognitive entities in order to engage in decision making, social judgment and social perception for individual functioning and survival of organism in a social environment. These include [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[psychobiology]], [[biological neural network|neural networks]], [[social cognition]], [[social psychology]], [[semantic networks]], [[ethology]], and [[social neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/behavioral-sciences.html|title=What are behavioral sciences? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Relational sciences deals with relationships, interaction, communication networks, associations and relational strategies or dynamics between organisms or cognitive entities in a social system. These include fields like [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological social psychology]], [[social networks]], [[dynamic network analysis]], [[agent-based model]] and  [[microsimulation]].

==Applications==
Insights from several pure disciplines across behavioural sciences are explored by various applied disciplines and practiced in the context of everyday life and business. These applied disciplines of behavioural science include: [[organizational behavior]], [[operations research]], [[consumer behaviour]] and [[media psychology]].

== Differentiation from social sciences ==
The term ''behavioural sciences'' is often confused with the term ''[[social sciences]]''.{{Who|date=September 2018}}  Though these two broad areas are interrelated and study systematic processes of behaviour, they differ on their level of scientific analysis of various dimensions of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/behavioral+science%3E|title=Definition of BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE|website=www.Merriam-Webster.com|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioural sciences abstract empirical data to investigate the decision processes and communication strategies within and between organisms in a social system. This involves fields like psychology, [[social neuroscience]] ethology, and cognitive science. In contrast, social sciences provide a perceptive framework to study the processes of a social system through impacts of social organization on structural adjustment of the individual and of groups. They typically include fields like [[sociology]], [[economics]],  [[public health]], [[anthropology]], [[demography]] and [[political science]].&lt;ref name="Klemke" /&gt;

Many subfields of these disciplines cross the boundaries between behavioral and social sciences. For example, [[political psychology]] and [[behavioral economics]] use behavioural approaches, despite the predominant focus on systemic and institutional factors in the broader fields of political science and economics.

The '''Biogeography of Deep-Water Chemosynthetic Ecosystems'''  is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] programme (CoML). The main aim of ChEss is to determine the [[biogeography]] of deep-water [[chemosynthetic]] [[Deep sea communities|ecosystems]] at a global scale and to understand the processes driving these ecosystems. ChEss addresses the main questions of CoML on diversity, abundance and distribution of marine species, focusing on deep-water reducing environments such as [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[cold seep]]s, [[whale fall]]s, [[sunken wood]] and areas of low oxygen that intersect with [[continental margin]]s and [[seamount]]s.

==Background==
{{main article|deep sea|deep-sea exploration|hydrothermal vent|cold seep|whale fall}}

Deep-sea hydrothermal vents and their associated fauna were first discovered along the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the eastern Pacific in 1977. Vents are now known to occur along all active mid ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres, from fast to ultra-slow spreading ridges. The interest in chemosynthetic environments was strengthened by the discovery of chemosynthetic-based fauna at cold seeps along the base of the [[Florida Escarpment]] in 1983. Cold seeps occur along active and passive continental margins. More recently, the study of chemosynthtetic fauna has extended to the communities that develop in other reducing habitats such as whale falls, sunken wood and areas of oxygen minima when they intersect with the margin or seamounts.
Since the first discovery of hydrothermal vents, more than 600 species have been described from vents and seeps. This is equivalent of 1 new description every 2 weeks(!). As biologists, geochemists, and physicists combine research efforts in these systems, new species will certainly be discovered. Moreover, because of the extreme conditions of the vent and seep habitat, certain species may have specific physiological adaptations with interesting results for the biochemical and medical industry.

These globally distributed, ephemeral and insular habitats that support endemic faunas offer natural laboratories for studies on dispersal, isolation and evolution. Here, hydrographic and topographic controls on biodiversity and biogeography might be much more readily resolved than in systems where climate and human activity obscure their role. In addition, hydrothermal vents have been suggested to be the habitat of the origin of life. These hypotheses are being used by ChEss researchers in collaboration with NASA to develop programmes to search for life in planets or moons of the outer space.

==Objectives of ChEss==
Only a small fraction of the global ridge system (~65000&amp;nbsp;km) and of the vast continental margin regions have been explored and their communities described. It is the aim of ChEss to improve the knowledge on the diversity, abundance and distribution of species from vents, seeps and other reducing habitats at a global scale, understanding the [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] processes that shape and maintain these ecosystems and their biogeography.

'''Main ChEss Science Questions'''
* I. What are the species' relationships between different habitats: vents, seeps, whale falls, sunken wood and OMZs?
* II. What is the role of deep-water circulation and geographical barriers in gene flow and biogeography?
* III. What are the factors driving patterns of biodiversity in these habitats?

''Objective 1. To create a centralised database''

To create a centralised database, [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/database/db_home.php ChEssBase], of deep-water vent, cold seep, whalefall and OMZ{{clarify|date=January 2011}} species. ChEssBase is a web-based database that incorporates archived and newly collected biological material. The database is geo- and bio-referenced. ChEssBase is available online and has been integrated with OBIS.

''Objective 2. To develop a long-term field programme''

To develop a long-term [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/science/sci_field.php field programme] to locate potential vent and seep sites and continue research on whalefalls and OMZ sites. The field programme aims to explain the main gaps in our knowledge of the diversity, abundance and distribution of chemosynthetic species globally. A limited number of target areas have been selected where specific scientific questions relevant to biogeographical issues will be answered.

The target areas have been grouped into two categories. Category I, combined areas: Area A: Equatorial Atlantic Belt region; Area B: the SE Pacific region; Area C: NZ region; Area D: the Arctic and Antarctic regions, within the International Polar Year. Category II, specific areas: 1&amp;nbsp;– The ice-covered Gakkel Ridge, 2&amp;nbsp;– the (ultra)-slow ridges of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, 3&amp;nbsp;– the northern MAR between the Iceland and Azores hot-spots; 4&amp;nbsp;– the Brazilian continental margin, 5&amp;nbsp;– the East Scotia Ridge and Bransfield Strait, 6&amp;nbsp;– the SW Indian Ridge, 7&amp;nbsp;– the Central Indian Ridge.
During the field programme, ChEss will promote the development and refinement of deep-towed, remotely operated ([[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]) and autonomous underwater (AUV) vehicle technologies to locate, map and sample new chemosynthetic systems. Using optical, chemical and acoustic techniques, ChEss researchers hope to gain a better understanding of not only biogeographical patterns, but to determine the processes driving these ecosystems.

''Objective 3: Outreach and Education''

ChEss has multi-lingual [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/education/edu_home.php education pages] related to vents, seeps and whalefalls. There is a dedicated page for key outreach initiatives such as live cruise diaries, open days, schools activities etc.

ChEss has joined forces with the other deep-sea CoML projects and this has resulted in the creation of the DEep-Sea Education and Outreach group (DESEO) that has produced a book "Deeper than Light" published in 5 languages.

'''Ceramic art''' is art made from [[ceramic]] materials, including [[clay]]. It may take forms including [[art ware]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. Ceramic art is one of [[the arts]], particularly the [[visual arts]]. Of these, it is one of the [[plastic arts]]. While some ceramics are considered [[fine art]], as pottery or sculpture, some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]] or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects.  Ceramics may also be considered [[Artefact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].  Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people.  In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture and decorate the art ware.  Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Pottery Manufacturers and Collectors |url=http://www.artpotterymanufacturers.com/Welcome.html |accessdate=5 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602012550/http://artpotterymanufacturers.com/Welcome.html |archivedate=2 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]].

The word "ceramics" comes from the Greek ''keramikos'' (κεραμικος), meaning "pottery", which in turn comes from ''keramos'' (κεραμος) meaning "potter's clay".&lt;ref&gt;''The Webster Encyclopedic Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  Most traditional ceramic products were made from [[clay]] (or clay mixed with other materials), shaped and subjected to heat, and tableware and decorative ceramics are generally still made this way. In modern ceramic engineering usage, ceramics is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tesserae]]''.

There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the [[Nok culture|Nok]] in Africa over 2,000 years ago.  Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese]], [[Crete|Cretan]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Persian pottery|Persian]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[Korea]]n cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures.

Elements of ceramic art, upon which different degrees of emphasis have been placed at different times, are the shape of the object, its decoration by painting, carving and other methods, and the glazing found on most ceramics.

{{Main article|Earthenware|Stoneware|Porcelain|Bone china}}

Different types of [[clay]], when used with different [[mineral]]s and firing conditions, are used to produce earthenware, stoneware, porcelain and bone china (fine china).
* [[Earthenware]] is [[pottery]] that has not been fired to [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitrification]] and is thus permeable to water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/176172/earthenware "Earthenware"] Britannica online&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of pottery have been made from it from the earliest times, and until the 18th century it was the most common type of pottery outside the far East. Earthenware is often made from clay, [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]].  [[Terracotta]], a type of [[earthenware]], is a [[clay]]-based unglazed or glazed [[ceramic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Terracotta"&lt;/ref&gt; where the fired body is porous.&lt;ref&gt;'Diagnosis Of Terra-Cotta Glaze Spalling.' S.E. Thomasen, C.L. Searls. ''Masonry: Materials, Design, Construction and Maintenance''. ASTM STP 992 Philadelphia, USA, 1988. American Society for Testing &amp; Materials.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Colour Degradation In A Terra Cotta Glaze' H.J. Lee, W.M. Carty, J.Gill. ''Ceram.Eng.Sci.Proc.'' 21, No.2, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;45–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'High-lead glaze compositions and alterations: example of byzantine tiles.' A. Bouquillon. C. Pouthas. ''Euro Ceramics V. Pt.2. Trans Tech Publications'', Switzerland,1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1487–1490 Quote: "A collection of architectural Byzantine tiles in glazed terra cotta is stored and exhibited in the Art Object department of the Louvre Museum as well as in the Musee de la Ceramique de Sevres."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Industrial Ceramics.' F.Singer, S.S.Singer. Chapman &amp; Hall. 1971. Quote: "The lighter pieces that are glazed may also be termed 'terracotta.'&lt;/ref&gt;  Its uses include vessels (notably [[flower pot]]s), water and waste water pipes, bricks, and surface embellishment in [[building construction]].  Terracotta has been a common medium for ceramic art ([[#Terracotta (artworks)|see below]]).
* [[Stoneware]] is a [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitreous]] or semi-vitreous [[ceramic]] made primarily from stoneware clay or non-[[refractory]] fire clay.&lt;ref&gt;''Standard Terminology of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products: ASTM Standard C242''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stoneware is fired at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=temps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigceramicstore.com/info/ceramics/tips/tip90_temp_fire_clay.html|title=What Temperature Should I Fire My Clay To?|author=|date=|work=bigceramicstore.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitrified or not, it is nonporous;{{sfn|Dodd|1994}} it may or may not be glazed.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica [http://www.britannica.com/art/Wedgwood-ware Jasperware is unglazed stoneware]&lt;/ref&gt;  One widely recognised definition is from the [[Combined Nomenclature]] of the European Communities, a European industry standard states "Stoneware, which, though dense, impermeable and hard enough to resist scratching by a steel point, differs from [[porcelain]] because it is more [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], and normally only partially vitrified. It may be vitreous or semi-vitreous. It is usually coloured grey or brownish because of impurities in the clay used for its manufacture, and is normally glazed."{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}
* [[Porcelain]] is a [[ceramic]] material made by heating materials, generally including [[kaolin]], in a [[kiln]] to temperatures between {{convert|1200|and|1400|°C|°F|-2}}. The toughness, strength and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of [[pottery]], arises mainly from [[vitrification]] and the formation of the mineral [[mullite]] within the body at these high temperatures.  [[Properties]] associated with porcelain include low [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]; considerable [[Strength of materials|strength]], [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[white]]ness, [[Translucent|translucency]] and [[resonance]]; and a high resistance to chemical attack and [[thermal shock]].  Porcelain has been described as being "completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant". However, the term ''porcelain'' lacks a universal definition and has "been applied in a very unsystematic fashion to substances of diverse kinds which have only certain surface-qualities in common".&lt;ref&gt;Definition in ''The Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities'' defines, Burton, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bone china]] (fine china) is a type of [[soft-paste porcelain]] that is composed of [[bone ash]], [[feldspar|feldspathic material]], and [[kaolin]]. It has been defined as ''ware with a translucent body'' containing a minimum of 30% of phosphate derived from animal bone and calculated calcium phosphate.{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}  Developed by English potter [[Josiah Spode]], bone china is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency,&lt;ref name="Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir p29-32"&gt;Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir. "Bone China from Turkey" Ceramics Technical; May2005, Issue 20, p&amp;nbsp;29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and very high mechanical strength and chip resistance.&lt;ref name="Trading Places 2009, p.35,37" /&gt; Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain.&lt;ref name="Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir p29-32" /&gt;  Like [[stoneware]] it is [[vitrified]], but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.&lt;ref&gt;What is China? [http://noritakechina.com/what-is-china As with stoneware, the body becomes vitrified; which means the body fuses, becomes nonabsorbent, and very strong. Unlike stoneware, china becomes very white and translucent.]&lt;/ref&gt;  From its initial development and up to the later part of the twentieth century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in [[Stoke-on-Trent]].&lt;ref name="Trading Places 2009, p.35,37"&gt;'Trading Places.' R.Ware. ''Asian Ceramics''. November,2009, p.35,37-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Most major English firms made or still make it, including [[Mintons]], [[Coalport porcelain|Coalport]], [[Spode]], [[Royal Crown Derby]], [[Royal Doulton]], [[Wedgwood]] and [[Royal Worcester|Worcester]].  In the UK, references to "china" or "porcelain" can refer to bone china, and "English porcelain" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold (ed), ''The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts'', p. 130, 1975, OUP, {{ISBN|0-19-866113-4}}; Faulkner, Charles H., "The Ramseys at Swan Pond: The Archaeology and History of an East Tennessee Farm'', p.96, 2008, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2008, {{ISBN|1-57233-609-9}}, 9781572336094; Lawrence, Susan, "Archaeologies of the British: Explorations of Identity in the United Kingdom and Its Colonies 1600–1945", p. 196, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-136-80192-8}}, 781136801921&lt;/ref&gt;  Fine china is not necessarily bone china, and is a term used to refer to ware which does not contain bone ash.{{sfn|Dodd|1994}}

=== China painting ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|China painting}}

China painting, or porcelain painting is the decoration of glazed [[porcelain]] objects such as plates, bowls, vases or statues. The body of the object may be [[hard-paste porcelain]], developed in China in the 7th or 8th century, or [[soft-paste porcelain]] (often [[bone china]]), developed in 18th-century Europe. The broader term ceramic painting includes painted decoration on [[lead-glazed earthenware]] such as [[creamware]] or [[tin-glazed pottery]] such as [[maiolica]] or [[faience]].  Typically the body is first fired in a kiln to convert it into a hard porous [[Biscuit (pottery)|biscuit]]. [[Underglaze]] decoration may then be applied, followed by [[ceramic glaze]], which is fired so it bonds to the body. The glazed porcelain may then be decorated with [[overglaze]] painting and fired again at a lower temperature to bond the paint with the glaze. Decoration may be applied by brush or by [[stencil]]ing, [[transfer printing]], [[lithography]] and [[screen printing]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Florence (1883). China painting. Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slipware ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Slipware}}

Slipware is a type of [[pottery]] identified by its primary decorating process where [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] is placed onto the leather-hard clay body surface before firing by dipping, painting or splashing.  Slip is an aqueous suspension of a clay body, which is a mixture of [[clay]]s and other minerals such as [[quartz]], [[feldspar]] and [[mica]].  A coating of white or coloured slip, known as an engobe, can be applied to the article to improve its appearance, to give a smoother surface to a rough body, mask an inferior colour or for decorative effect. Slips or engobes can also be applied by painting techniques, in isolation or in several layers and colours. [[Sgraffito]] involves scratching through a layer of coloured [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] to reveal a different colour or the base body underneath. Several layers of slip and/or sgraffito can be done while the pot is still in an unfired state.  One colour of slip can be fired, before a second is applied, and prior to the scratching or incising decoration. This is particularly useful if the base body is not of the desired colour or texture.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, Victoria and Michael. (1999) ''Slipware, Contemporary Approaches.'' A &amp; C Black, University of Pennsylvania Press, G &amp; B Arts International. {{ISBN|90-5703-212-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Terra sigillata ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Terra sigillata}}

In sharp contrast to the archaeological usage, in which the term ''terra sigillata'' refers to a whole class of pottery, in contemporary ceramic art, 'terra sigillata' describes only a  watery refined slip used to facilitate the [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ing of raw clay surfaces and used to promote carbon smoke effects, in both [[Pit fired pottery|primitive]] low temperature firing techniques and unglazed alternative western-style [[Raku ware|Raku]] firing techniques. Terra sigillata is also used as a brushable decorative colourant medium in higher temperature [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] ceramic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Garbsch, Jochen, Terra Sigillata.

=== Studio pottery ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Studio pottery}}

[[Studio pottery]] is [[pottery]] made by amateur or professional [[artist]]s or artisans working alone or in small groups, making unique items or short runs. Typically, all stages of manufacture are carried out by the artists themselves.{{sfn|Cooper|2010}}  Studio pottery includes functional wares such as [[tableware]], [[Cookware and bakeware|cookware]] and non-functional wares such as [[sculpture]].  Studio potters can be referred to as ceramic artists, ceramists, ceramicists or as an artist who uses clay as a medium. Much studio pottery is [[tableware]] or [[cookware]] but an increasing number of studio potters produce non-functional or sculptural items.  Some studio potters now prefer to call themselves ceramic artists, [[ceramist]]s or simply artists. Studio pottery is represented by potters all over the world.

=== Tile ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Tile}}
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, carreaux lustrés - Kairouan's Great Mosque, luster tiles.jpg|thumb|Upper part of the [[mihrab]] decorated with lusterware tiles (dating from the 9th century) in the '''[[Mosque of Uqba]]''' also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan, [[Tunisia]]]]
[[File:Tile, late 19th-early 20th century, X1047.7.jpg|thumb|Tile, Hopi Pueblo (Native American), late 19th–early 20th century]]

A [[tile]] is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, showers, or other objects such as tabletops. Alternatively, [[tile]] can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a "tile" is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.

Tiles are often used to form wall [[Tile mural|murals]] and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.

=== Figurines ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
[[File:Franz Anton Bustelli Liebesgruppe 1756-1.jpg|thumb|Group with lovers, modelled by [[Franz Anton Bustelli]], [[Nymphenburg porcelain]], 1756]]
{{Main article|Figurine}}

A [[figurine]] (a diminutive form of the word ''figure'') is a statuette that represents a human, [[deity]], mythical creature, or [[animal figurines|animal]]. Figurines may be realistic or [[iconic]], depending on the skill and intention of the creator. The earliest were made of stone or clay.  In ancient Greece, many figurines were made from terracotta (see [[Greek terracotta figurines]]). Modern versions are made of ceramic, metal, glass, wood and plastic.

Figurines and [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniatures]] are sometimes used in [[board game]]s, such as [[chess]], and tabletop [[role playing game]]s. Old figurines have been used to discount some historical theories, such as the [[origins of chess]].

=== Tableware ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Tableware}}

[[Tableware]] is the dishes or dishware used for setting a table, serving food and dining. It includes [[cutlery]], [[List of glassware|glassware]], serving dishes and other useful items for practical as well as decorative purposes.&lt;ref name=Bloomfield&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Linda|title=Contemporary tableware|date=2013|publisher=A. &amp; C. Black|location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-5395-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=venable&gt;{{cite book|last=Venable|first=Charles L.|display-authors=etal|title=China and Glass in America, 1880–1980: From Table Top to TV Tray|year=2000|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-6692-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes, bowls and cups may be made of ceramic, while cutlery is typically made from metal, and glassware is often made from glass or other non-ceramic materials.  The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, [[cuisine]] and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.&lt;ref name=venable /&gt;

=== Terracotta (artworks) ===&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
In addition to being a material, "terracotta" also refers to items made out of this material. In [[archaeology]] and [[art history]], "terracotta" is often used to describe objects such as statures, and figurines not made on a [[potter's wheel]].  A prime example is the [[Terracotta Army]], a collection of man-sized [[terracotta]] sculptures depicting the armies of [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first [[Emperor of China]]. It is a form of [[funerary art]] buried with the emperor in 210{{ndash}}209{{nbsp}}BCE and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.&lt;ref name=Portal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Portal|first1=Jane|title=The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army|date=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02697-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French sculptor [[Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse]] made many terracotta pieces, but possibly the most famous is [[The Abduction of Hippodameia]] depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. American architect [[Louis Sullivan]] is well known for his elaborate [[glazed architectural terra-cotta|glazed terracotta]] ornamentation, designs that would have been impossible to execute in any other medium. Terracotta and tile were used extensively in the town buildings of Victorian [[Birmingham]], England.

== History ==
There is a long history of ceramic art in almost all developed cultures, and often ceramic objects are all the artistic evidence left from vanished cultures, like that of the [[Nok culture|Nok]] in Africa over 2,000 years ago.  Cultures especially noted for ceramics include the [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese]], [[Crete|Cretan]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Persian pottery|Persian]], [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[Korea]]n cultures, as well as the modern Western cultures.

Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the [[Russian Far East]], providing several from 20,000{{ndash}}10,000{{nbsp}}BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects.&lt;ref name="'Oldest pottery' found in China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8077168.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Science &amp; Environment – 'Oldest pottery' found in China|author=|date=|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boaretto"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Boaretto, E. |year=2009 |title=Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and bone collagen associated with early pottery at Yuchanyan Cave, Hunan Province, China |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=106 |issue=24 |pages=9537–9538| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/06/01/0900539106.abstract |doi=10.1073/pnas.0900539106 |displayauthors=1 |last2=Wu|first2=X.|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.9595B |last3=Yuan |first3=J. |last4=Bar-Yosef |first4=O. |last5=Chu |first5=V. |last6=Pan |first6=Y. |last7=Liu |first7=K. |last8=Cohen |first8=D. |last9=Jiao |first9=T. |last10=Li |first10=S. |last11=Gu |first11=H. |last12=Goldberg |first12=P. |last13=Weiner |first13=S. |pmid=19487667 |pmc=2689310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Xianrendong Cave]] in [[Jiangxi]] province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000  years ago.&lt;ref name="Boston.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery|title=Harvard, BU researchers find evidence of 20,000-year-old pottery|publisher=Boston.com|access-date=2 January 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102041017/http://articles.boston.com/2012-06-28/science/32452370_1_bone-fragments-sediment-pottery|archive-date=2 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanglin, Douglas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/06/pottery-found-in-from-china-cave-confirmed-as-worlds-oldest/1#.UDiyGtZlRv0|title=Pottery found in China cave confirmed as world's oldest|author=Stanglin, Douglas|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts believe the first true porcelain was made in the [[Province (China)|province]] of [[Zhejiang]] in [[China]] during the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] period.  [[Sherd|Shards]] recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from {{convert|1260|to|1300|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="He Li 1996"&gt;He Li, (1996). ''Chinese Ceramics. The New Standard Guide''. Thames and Hudson, London. {{ISBN|0-500-23727-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1000 BCE, the so-called "porcelaneous wares" or "proto-porcelain wares" were made using at least some [[kaolin]] fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and ''true porcelain wares'' is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] (206{{ndash}}BCE{{snds}}220{{nbsp}}CE).&lt;ref name="temple"&gt;Temple, Robert K.G. (2007).

Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive [[Chinese porcelain]] were imported into Europe.  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] and the [[Medici porcelain]] made in [[Florence]]. None was successful until a recipe for [[hard-paste porcelain]] was devised at the [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] factory in [[Dresden]] in 1710. Within a few years, porcelain factories sprung up at [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory|Nymphenburg]] in [[Bavaria]] (1754) and [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]] (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler.

=== Prehistoric pottery ===
[[File:Frieze-group-3-example1.jpg|thumb|left|Vessel from [[Mesopotamia]], late [[Ubaid period]] (4,500{{ndash}}4,000{{nbsp}}BCE)]]

Early pots were made by what is known as the "coiling" method, which worked the clay into a long string that wound to form a shape that later made smooth walls.  The [[potter's wheel]] was probably invented in [[Mesopotamia]] by the 4th millennium BCE, but spread across nearly all Eurasia and much of Africa, though it remained unknown in the [[New World]] until the arrival of Europeans.  Decoration of the clay by incising and painting is found very widely, and was initially geometric, but often included figurative designs from very early on.

So important is pottery to the archaeology of prehistoric cultures that many are known by names taken from their distinctive, and often very fine, pottery, such as the [[Linear Pottery culture]], [[Beaker culture]], [[Globular Amphora culture]], [[Corded Ware culture]] and [[Funnelbeaker culture]], to take examples only from [[Neolithic Europe]] (approximately 7000{{ndash}}1800{{nbsp}}BCE).

Ceramic art has generated many styles from its own tradition, but is often closely related to contemporary sculpture and metalwork.  Many times in its history styles from the usually more prestigious and expensive art of metalworking have been copied in ceramics.  This can be seen in early Chinese ceramics, such as pottery and ceramic-wares of the Shang Dynasty, in Ancient Roman and Iranian pottery, and [[Rococo]] European styles, copying contemporary silverware shapes.  A common use of ceramics is for "pots" - containers such as bowls, vases and [[amphorae]], as well as other tableware, but figurines have been very widely made.

==== Ceramics as wall decoration ====
[[File:Hexagonal Tile, mid 15th century..jpg|thumb|''Hexagonal Tile'', mid 15th century{{snds}}[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

[[File:Tile panel flowers Louvre OA3919-2-297.jpg|thumb|16th century Turkish [[İznik pottery|Iznik]] tiles, which would have originally formed part of a much larger group]]

The earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elam]]ite Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BCE.  Glazed and coloured bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] ({{circa|575{{nbsp}}BCE}}), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere.  Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].  The tradition continued, and after the Islamic conquest of Persia coloured and often painted glazed bricks or tiles became an important element in [[Persian architecture]], and from there spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[İznik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Using the [[lusterware]] technology, one of the finest examples of medieval Islamic use of ceramics as wall decoration can be seen in the [[Mosque of Uqba]] also known as the Great Mosque of kairouan (in [[Tunisia]]), the upper part of the [[mihrab]] wall is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862-863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=luster+kairouan+gold&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K-wbT4X0EZKBhQexuuTfDA&amp;ved=0CGUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=luster%20kairouan%20gold&amp;f=false Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en|title=Qantara – Mihrāb of the Great Mosque of Kairouan|author=|date=|work=qantara-med.org|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmitted via Islamic Spain, a new tradition of [[Azulejo]]s developed in Spain and especially [[Portugal]], which by the [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white.  [[Delftware]] tiles, typically with a painted design covering only one (rather small) tile, were ubiquitous in the Netherlands and widely exported over Northern Europe from the 16th century on.  Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2792293957101026524 Porcelain Room, Aranjuez] Comprehensive but shaky video {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elaborate tiled stoves were a feature of rooms of the middle and upper-classes in Northern Europe from the 17th to 19th centuries.

There are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly coloured [[zellige]] tiles of [[Morocco]].  With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.

=== East Asia ===
Although pottery figurines are found from earlier periods in Europe, the oldest pottery vessels come from East Asia, with finds in China and Japan, then still linked by a land bridge, and some in what is now the [[Russian Far East]], providing several from between 20,000 and 10,000 BCE, although the vessels were simple utilitarian objects.&lt;ref name="'Oldest pottery' found in China" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boaretto" /&gt;  [[Xianrendong Cave]] in [[Jiangxi]] province contained pottery fragments that date back to 20,000  years ago.&lt;ref name="Boston.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanglin, Douglas" /&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
Recent archaeological excavations at [[Angkor Borei]] (in southern Cambodia) have recovered a large number of ceramics, some of which probably date back to the prehistoric period. Most of the pottery, however, dates to the pre-Angkorian period and consists mainly of pinkish terracotta pots which were either hand-made or thrown on a wheel, and then decorated with incised patterns.

Glazed wares first appear in the archaeological record at the end of the 9th century at the Roluos temple group in the Angkor region, where green-glazed pot shards have been found. A brown glaze became popular at the beginning of the 11th century and brown-glazed wares have been found in abundance at Khmer sites in northeast Thailand. Decorating pottery with animal forms was a popular style from the 11th to 13th century. Archaeological excavations in the [[Angkor]] region have revealed that towards the end of Angkor period production of indigenous pottery declined while there was a dramatic increase in Chinese ceramic imports.

Direct evidence of the shapes of vessels is provided by scenes depicted on bas-reliefs at Khmer temples, which also offer insight into domestic and ritualistic uses of the wares. The wide range of utilitarian shapes suggest the Khmers used ceramics in their daily life for cooking, food preservation, carrying and storing liquids, as containers for medicinal herbs, perfumes and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambodiamuseum.info/en_khmer_art_history.html|title=Contact Support|author=|date=|work=cambodiamuseum.info|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celadon]] was first made in China, and then exported to various parts of Asia and Europe.

There is [[Chinese porcelain]] from the late [[Eastern Han]] period (100{{ndash}}200{{nbsp}}CE), the [[Three Kingdoms]] period (220{{ndash}}280{{nbsp}}CE), the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220{{ndash}}589{{nbsp}}CE), and thereafter.  China in particular has had a continuous history of large-scale production, with the Imperial factories usually producing the best work.  The [[Tang Dynasty]] (618 to 906{{nbsp}}CE) is especially noted for [[grave goods]] figures of humans, animals and model houses, boats and other goods, excavated (usually illegally) from graves in large numbers.

The Imperial porcelain of the [[Culture of the Song Dynasty|Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), featuring very subtle decoration shallowly carved by knife in the clay, is regarded by many authorities as the peak of [[Chinese ceramics]], though the large and more exuberantly painted ceramics of the [[Chinese ceramics#Ming dynasty, 1368–1644|Ming Dynasty]] (1368{{ndash}}1644) have a wider reputation.

Chinese emperors gave ceramics as diplomatic gifts on a lavish scale, and the presence of Chinese ceramics no doubt aided the development of related traditions of ceramics in Japan and [[Korean pottery and porcelain|Korea]] in particular.

The earliest Japanese pottery was made around the 11th millennium BCE.  [[Jōmon]] ware emerged in the 6th millennium BCE and the plainer [[Yayoi]] style in about the 4th century BCE.  This early pottery was soft earthenware, fired at low temperatures. The potter's wheel and a [[Anagama kiln|kiln]] capable of reaching higher temperatures and firing stoneware appeared in the 3rd or 4th centuries CE, probably brought from China via the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kofu/hd_kofu.htm] "Although the roots of Sueki reach back to ancient China, its direct precursor is the grayware of the Three Kingdoms period in Korea."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, official kilns in Japan produced simple, green [[lead-glazed earthenware]].  Unglazed stoneware was used as funerary jars, storage jars and kitchen pots up to the 17th century.  Some of the kilns improved their methodsmil {{clarify|date=July 2014}} From the 11th to the 16th century, Japan imported much porcelain from China and some from Korea. The Japanese overlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s attempts to conquer China in the 1590s were dubbed the "Ceramic Wars" [citation needed]  the emigration of Korean potters appeared to be a major cause. One of these potters, [[Yi Sam-pyeong]], discovered the raw material of porcelain in Arita and produced first true porcelain in Japan.

In the 17th century, conditions in China drove some of its potters into Japan, bringing with them the knowledge to make refined porcelain. From the mid-century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] began to import Japanese porcelain into Europe.  At this time, [[Kakiemon]] wares were produced at the factories of [[Arita, Saga|Arita]], which had much in common with the Chinese [[Famille Verte]] style. The superb quality of its [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] decoration was highly prized in the West and widely imitated by the major European porcelain manufacturers.  In 1971 it was declared an important "intangible cultural treasure" by the [[Japanese government]].

In the 20th century, interest in the art of the village potter was revived by the [[Mingei]] folk movement led by potters [[Shoji Hamada]], Kawai Kajiro and others. They studied traditional methods in order to preserve native wares that were in danger of disappearing. Modern masters use ancient methods to bring pottery and porcelain to new heights of achievement at [[Shiga]], [[Iga, Mie|Iga]], [[Karatsu]], [[Hagi, Yamaguchi|Hagi]], and [[Bizen, Okayama|Bizen]]. A few outstanding potters were designated living cultural treasures (''mukei bunkazai'' 無形文化財).   In the old capital of [[Kyoto]], the [[Raku ware|Raku]] family continued to produce the rough [[Chawan|tea bowls]] that had so delighted connoisseurs. At [[Mino Province|Mino]], potters continued to reconstruct the classic formulas of Momoyama-era Seto-type tea wares of Mino, such as [[Oribe ware]]. By the 1990s many master potters worked away from ancient kilns and made classic wares in all parts of Japan.

Korean pottery has had a continuous tradition since simple [[earthenware]] from about 8000 BCE. Styles have generally been a distinctive variant of Chinese, and later Japanese, developments.  The ceramics of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty (918–1392) and early [[Joseon white porcelain]] of the following dynasty are generally regarded as the finest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection: Korean Art|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/korean.asp|website=Freer/Sackler|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]] was developed by the Islamic potters, the first examples found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating from about the 8th century.  The Islamic world had contact with China, and increasingly adapted many Chinese decorative motifs.  Persian wares gradually relaxed Islamic restrictions on figurative ornament, and painted figuratives scenes became very important.

The [[albarello]] form, a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs, was first made in the Islamic Middle East. It was brought to Italy by [[Hispano-Moresque]] traders; the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.

[[Iznik pottery]], made in western [[Anatolia]], is highly decorated ceramics whose heyday was the late 16th century under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans.  Iznik vessels were originally made in imitation of [[Chinese porcelain]], which was highly prized. Under [[Süleyman the Magnificent]] (1520–66), demand for Iznik wares increased.  After the conquest of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultans started a programme of building, which used large quantities of Iznik tiles. The [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] in Istanbul (built 1609–16) alone contains 20,000 tiles and tiles were used extensively in the [[Topkapi Palace]] (commenced 1459).  As a result of this demand, tiles dominated the output of the Iznik potteries.

=== Europe ===
==== Early figurines ====

The earliest known ceramic objects are the [[Gravettian]] figurines from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, such as those discovered at Dolní Věstonice in the modern-day [[Czech Republic]]. The [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]] (Věstonická Venuše in Czech) is a statuette of a nude female figure dating from some time from 29,000{{ndash}}25,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi359.htm|title=No. 359: The Dolni Vestonice Ceramics|author=|date=|work=uh.edu|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was made by moulding and then firing a mixture of clay and powdered bone.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Stringer. ''Homo Britannicus'', Alan Lane, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7139-9795-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar objects in various media found throughout Europe and Asia and dating from the Upper Paleolithic period have also been called [[Venus figurines]]. Scholars are not agreed as to their purpose or cultural significance.

Glazed [[Egyptian faience]] dates to the third millennium BCE), with painted but unglazed [[ancient Egyptian pottery|pottery]] used even earlier during the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] [[Naqada culture]]. [[Faience]] became sophisticated and produced on a large scale, using moulds as well modelling, and later also throwing on the wheel. Several methods of glazing were developed, but colours remained largely limited to a range in the blue-green spectrum.

On the Greek [[island]] of [[Santorini]] are some of the earliest finds created by the [[Minoan Civilization|Minoans]] dating to the third millennium BCE, with the original settlement at [[Akrotiri (Santorini)|Akrotiri]] dating to the fourth millennium BCE;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-to-santorini.com/place.php?place_id=40|title=Archaeological site of akrotiri Santorini Greece|author=|date=|work=travel-to-santorini.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  excavation work continues at the principal [[archaeological]] site of Akrotiri.  Some of the excavated homes contain huge ceramic storage jars known as ''[[pithoi]]''.

Ancient [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] ceramics are renowned for their figurative painting, especially in the [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] and [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] styles.  Moulded [[Greek terracotta figurines]], especially [[Tanagra figurine|those from Tanagra]], were small figures, often religious but later including many of everyday genre figures, apparently used purely for decoration.

[[Ancient Roman pottery]], such as [[Samian ware]], was rarely as fine, and largely copied shapes from metalwork, but was produced in enormous quantities, and is found all over Europe and the Middle East, and beyond. [[Monte Testaccio]] is a [[mound|waste mound]] in Rome made almost entirely of broken [[amphorae]] used for transporting and storing liquids and other products.  Few vessels of great artistic interest have survived, but there are very many small figures, often incorporated into oil lamps or similar objects, and often with religious or erotic themes (or both together – a Roman speciality).  The Romans generally did not leave grave goods, the best source of ancient pottery, but even so they do not seem to have had much in the way of luxury pottery, unlike [[Roman glass]], which the elite used with gold or silver  tableware.  The more expensive pottery tended to use relief decoration, often moulded, rather than paint.  Especially in the Eastern Empire, local traditions continued, hybridizing with Roman styles to varying extents.

[[tin-glazing|Tin-glazed]] pottery, or faience, originated in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, from where it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in the [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.  Important regional styles in Europe include: [[Hispano-Moresque]], [[maiolica]], [[Delftware]], and [[English Delftware]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]] the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of [[Al-Andaluz]] was the most sophisticated pottery being produced in Europe, with elaborate decoration. It introduced tin-glazing to Europe, which was developed in the [[Italian Renaissance]] in maiolica. Tin-glazed pottery was taken up in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries, the potters making household, decorative pieces and tiles in vast numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin Glazed Pottery'', Faber and Faber, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; usually with [[Blue and white porcelain|blue painting on a white ground]].  Dutch potters took tin-glazed pottery  to the British Isles, where it was made between about 1550 and 1800. In France, tin-glaze was begun in 1690 at [[Quimper, Finistère|Quimper]] in Brittany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html Faience-de-quimper.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050413214248/http://www.faience-de-quimper.com/histquim_en.html |date=13 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in [[Rouen]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Lunéville]].

{{further information|Porcelain#European porcelain}}

Until the 16th century, small quantities of expensive [[Chinese porcelain]] were imported into Europe.  From the 16th century onwards attempts were made to imitate it in Europe, including [[Soft-paste porcelain|soft-paste]] and the [[Medici porcelain]] made in [[Florence]]. In 1712, many of the elaborate Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets were revealed throughout Europe by the French Jesuit father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles and soon published in the ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses de Chine par des missionnaires jésuites''&lt;ref&gt;Baghdiantz McAbe, Ina (2008).

Joseph Needham : Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 5 Chemistry and Chemical Technology : Part 12 Ceramic Technology. Cambridge University Press, p. 36-7. {{ISBN|0-521-83833-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experimentation, a recipe for [[hard-paste porcelain]] was devised at the [[Meissen porcelain]] factory in [[Dresden]] soon after 1710, and was on sale by 1713. Within a few decades, porcelain factories sprung up at [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory|Nymphenburg]] in [[Bavaria]] (1754) and [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte]] in [[Naples]] (1743) and many other places, often financed by a local ruler.

[[Soft-paste porcelain]] was made at [[Rouen]] in the 1680s, but the first important production was at [[Saint-Cloud porcelain|St.Cloud]], letters-patent being granted in 1702.  The [[Duc de Bourbon]] established a soft-paste factory, the [[Chantilly porcelain]], in the grounds of his [[Château de Chantilly]] in 1730; a soft-paste factory was opened at [[Mennecy]]; and the [[Vincennes]] factory was set up by workers from Chantilly in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 | title=The 18th Century: The Rise and Success | work=Manufacture nationale de Sèvres | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124110833/http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 | archive-date=24 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sevr/hd_sevr.htm|title=Sèvres Porcelain in the Nineteenth Century|author=|date=|work=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1756.  The superior soft-paste made at Sèvres put it in the leading position in Europe in the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/porf/hd_porf.htm|title=French Porcelain in the Eighteenth Century|author=|date=|work=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated  in 1742, apparently based on the Saint-Cloud formula.  In 1749 a patent was taken out on the first [[bone china]], subsequently perfected by [[Josiah Spode]].  The main English porcelain makers in the 18th century were at [[Chelsea porcelain factory|Chelsea]],  [[Bow porcelain factory|Bow]],  St James's, [[Bristol porcelain|Bristol]],  [[Royal Crown Derby|Derby]]  and [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]].

Porcelain was ideally suited to the energetic [[Rococo]] curves of the day.  The products of these early decades of European porcelain are generally the most highly regarded, and expensive.  The Meissen modeler [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] and [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] of Nymphenburg are perhaps the most outstanding ceramic artists of the period.  Like other leading modelers, they trained as sculptors and produced models from which moulds were taken.

By the end of the 18th century owning porcelain tableware and decorative objects had become obligatory among the prosperous middle-classes of Europe, and there were factories in most countries, many of which are still producing.  As well as tableware, early European porcelain revived the taste for purely decorative figures of people or animals, which had also been a feature of several ancient cultures, often as [[grave goods]].  These were still being produced in China as [[blanc de Chine]] religious figures, many of which had reached Europe.  European figures were almost entirely secular, and soon brightly and brilliantly painted, often in groups with a modelled setting, and a strong narrative element (see picture).

==== Wedgwood and the North Staffordshire Potteries ====
[[File:Philbrook - Wedgewood (2)crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] [[Wedgwood]] urn in [[jasperware]], {{circa|1820}}]]

From the 17th century, [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in North Staffordshire emerged as a major centre of pottery making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/five.htm|title=all about Stoke-on-Trent in 5 minutes...|author=|date=|work=thepotteries.org|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Important contributions to the development of the industry were made by the firms of [[Wedgwood]], [[Spode]], [[Royal Doulton]] and [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]].

The local presence of abundant supplies of coal and suitable clay for earthenware production led to the early but at first limited development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] allowed the easy transportation of [[Kaolinite|china clay]] from [[Cornwall]] together with other materials and facilitated the production of [[creamware]] and [[bone china]].  Other production centres had a lead in the production of high quality wares but the preeminence of North Staffordshire was brought about by methodical and detailed research and a willingness to experiment carried out over many years, initially by one man, Josiah Wedgwood.  His lead was followed by other local potters, scientists and engineers.

Wedgwood is credited with the [[industrial process|industrialization]] of the manufacture of [[pottery]].  His work was of very high quality: when visiting his workshop, if he saw an offending vessel that failed to meet with his standards, he would smash it with his stick, exclaiming, "This will not do for Josiah Wedgwood!" He was keenly interested in the scientific advances of his day and it was this interest that underpinned his adoption of its approach and methods to revolutionize the quality of his pottery. His unique glazes began to distinguish his wares from anything else on the market.  His matt finish [[jasperware]] in two colours was highly suitable for the [[Neoclassicism]] of the end of the century, imitating the effects of Ancient Roman [[engraved gem|carved gemstone]] [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] like the [[Gemma Augustea]], or the [[cameo glass]] [[Portland Vase]], of which Wedgwood produced copies.

He also is credited with perfecting [[transfer-printing]], first developed in England about 1750. By the end of the century this had largely replaced hand-painting for complex designs, except at the luxury end of the market, and the vast majority of the world's decorated pottery uses versions of the technique to the present day.The perfecting of underglaze transfer printing is widely credited to Josiah Spode the first. The process had been  used as a development from the processes used in book printing, and early paper quality made a very refined detail in the design incapable of reproduction, so early print patterns were rather lacking in subtltey of tonal variation. The development of machine made thinner printing papers around 1804 allowed the engravers to use a much wider variety of tonal techniques which became capable of being reproduced on the ware, much more successfully.

Far from perfecting underglaze print Wedgwood was persuaded by his painters not to adopt underglaze printing until it became evident that Mr Spode was taking away his business through competitive pricing for a much more heavily decorated high quality product.

Stoke-on-Trent's supremacy in pottery manufacture nurtured and attracted a large number of ceramic artists including [[Clarice Cliff]], [[Susie Cooper]], [[Lorna Bailey]], [[Charlotte Rhead]], [[Frederick Hurten Rhead]] and [[Jabez Vodrey]].

==== Studio pottery in Britain ====
[[Studio pottery]] is made by artists working alone or in small groups, producing unique items or short runs, typically with all stages of manufacture carried out by one individual.{{sfn|Cooper|2010}} It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as [[Bernard Leach]], [[William Staite Murray]], [[Dora Billington]], [[Lucie Rie]] and [[Hans Coper]]. Bernard Leach (1887–1979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to [[stoneware]] fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns.  This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century.  The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902–1995) has been regarded as essentially a [[modernist]] who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles.  [[Hans Coper]] (1920–1981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces.  After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the [[Festival of Britain]].  The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos.  Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Harrod, Tanya, "From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940–1982", in ''The Harrow Connection'', Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elizabeth Fritsch]] (1940-) took up ceramics working under [[Hans Coper]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] (1968–1971). Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time. Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms. They are then hand painted with dry matt slips, in colours unusual for ceramics.

{{Main article|Native American pottery}}

The people in North, Central, and South America continents had a wide variety of pottery traditions before Europeans arrived. The oldest ceramics known in the [[Americas]]{{nsmdns}}made from 5,000 to 6,000 years ago{{nsmdns}}are found in the Andean region, along the Pacific coast of [[Ecuador]]  at [[Valdivia Culture|Valdivia]] and Puerto Hormiga, and in the San Jacinto Valley of [[Colombia]]; objects from 3,800 to 4,000 years old have been discovered in [[Peru]]. Some archaeologists believe that ceramics know-how found its way by sea to [[Mesoamerica]], the second great cradle of civilization in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times, Art Review Museum of American Indian's 'Born of Clay' Explores Culture Through Ceramics By GRACE GLUECK, Published: 1 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The best-developed styles found in the central and southern [[Andes]] are the ceramics found near the ceremonial site at [[Chavín culture|Chavín]] de Huántar (800{{ndash}}400{{nbsp}}BCE) and [[Cupisnique]] (1000{{ndash}}400{{nbsp}}BCE).  During the same period, another culture developed on the southern coast of Peru, in the area called [[Paracas culture|Paracas]]. The Paracas culture (600{{ndash}}100{{nbsp}}BCE) produced marvelous works of embossed ceramic finished with a thick oil applied after firing. This colorful tradition in ceramics and textiles was followed by the [[Nazca culture]] (1{{ndash}}600{{nbsp}}CE), whose potters developed improved techniques for preparing clay and for decorating objects, using fine brushes to paint sophisticated motifs. In the early stage of [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] ceramics, potters painted realistic characters and landscapes.

The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] cultures (1{{ndash}}800{{nbsp}}CE) that flourished on the northern coast of modern Peru produced modelled clay sculptures and effigies decorated with fine lines of red on a beige background.  Their pottery stands out for its [[Huaco (pottery)|huacos]] portrait vases, in which human faces are shown expressing different emotions{{nsmdns}}happiness, sadness, anger, melancholy{{nsmdns}}as well for its complicated drawings of wars, human sacrifices, and celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;Born of Clay – Ceramic from the National Museum of the American Indian, 2005 Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] were relative latecomers to ceramic development, as their ceramic arts flourished in the [[Maya Classic Period]], or the 2nd to 10th century.  One important site in southern [[Belize]] is known as [[Lubaantun]], that boasts particularly detailed and prolific works.  As evidence of the extent to which these ceramic art works were prized, many specimens traced to Lubaantun have been found at distant Maya sites in [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, ''Comparison of Mayan sites in southern and western Belize'', Lumina Technologies (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the current Maya people of Lubaantun continue to hand produce copies of many of the original designs found at Lubaantun.

In the United States, the oldest pottery dates to 2500{{nbsp}}BCE.  It has been found in the [[Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and some slightly older along the [[Savannah River]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=FTU&gt;{{cite news |title= The Mocama: New name for an old people|first= Matt|last= Soergel|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= 18 October 2009 |url= http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2009-10-18/story/the_mocama_new_name_for_an_old_people|accessdate= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hopi]] in Northern Arizona and several other [[Puebloan peoples]] including the [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]], [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], and [[Zuni people|Zuñi]] people (all in the [[Southwestern United States]]) are renowned for painted pottery in several different styles. [[Nampeyo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/gallery.shtml A Nampeyo Showcase] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105844/http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/gallery.shtml |date=24 September 2015 }}, a display of some of Nampeyo's work&lt;/ref&gt; and her relatives created pottery that became highly sought after beginning in the early 20th century.  Pueblo tribes in the state of [[New Mexico]] have styles distinctive to each of the various pueblos (villages). They include [[Santa Clara Pueblo]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Hopi]] Pueblos, [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]], [[Acoma Pueblo]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]] Pueblo, amongst others. Some of the renowned artists of Pueblo pottery include: [[Nampeyo]], Elva Nampeyo, and [[Dextra Quotskuyva]] of the Hopi; [[Leonidas Tapia]] of San Juan Pueblo; and [[Maria Martinez]] and [[Julian Martinez]] of San Ildefonso Pueblo. In the early 20th century Martinez and her husband Julian rediscovered the method of creating traditional San Ildefonso Pueblo Black-on Black [[pottery]].

==== Mexican ceramics ====
[[File:TalaveraTrayMAPDF.JPG|thumb|[[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera]] serving tray]]

[[Mexican ceramics]] are an ancient tradition. [[Precolumbian]] potters built up their wares with pinching, coiling, or hammer-an-anvil methods and, instead of using glaze, burnished their pots.

==== Studio pottery in the United States ====
{{see also|Category:American potters|Face jug}}

There is a strong tradition of studio artists working in ceramics in the United States. It had a period of growth in the 1960s and continues to present times. Many  fine art, craft, and contemporary art museums have pieces in their permanent collections. [[Beatrice Wood]] was an American artist and studio potter located in [[Ojai, California]]. She developed a unique form of luster-glaze technique, and was active from the 1930s to her death in 1998 at 105 years old. [[Robert Arneson]] created larger sculptural work, in an abstracted representational style. There are ceramics arts departments at many colleges, universities, and fine arts institutes in the [[United States]].

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
Pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa is traditionally made by coiling and is fired at low temperature.  The figurines of the ancient [[Nok culture]], whose function remains unclear, are an example of high-quality figural work, found in many cultures, such as [[Benin art|the Benin of Nigeria]].

In the Aïr Region of [[Niger]] (West Africa) (Haour 2003) pottery dating from around 10,000 BCE was excavated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-4425-0_8911 | title= Ceramics in Africa | author= Olivier P. Gosselain | accessdate=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ladi Kwali]], a [[Nigeria]]n [[pottery|potter]] who worked in the [[Gwari]] tradition, made large pots decorated with incised patterns. Her work is an interesting hybrid of traditional African with western [[studio pottery]].  [[Magdalene Odundo]] is a [[Kenya]]n-born [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Studio pottery|studio potter]] whose ceramics are hand built and burnished.

== Ceramics museums and museum collections ==&lt;!--Note, this section is a summary of the main article(s), if making changes, do change the main article first and then update the summary in this section--&gt;
{{Main article|Ceramics museum}}

A [[ceramics museum]] is a [[museum]] wholly or largely devoted to [[ceramic]]s, normally ceramic artworks, whose collections may include [[glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] as well, but will usually concentrate on [[pottery]], including [[porcelain]]. Most national ceramics collections are in a more general museum covering all [[the arts]], or just the [[decorative arts]], but there are a number of specialized ceramics museums, some concentrating on the production of just one country, region or manufacturer.  Others have international collections, which may concentrate on ceramics from Europe or East Asia, or have global coverage.

In Asian and Islamic countries ceramics are usually a strong feature of general and national museums.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Also most specialist [[archaeological]] museums, in all countries, have large ceramics collections, as pottery is the commonest type of [[archaeological artifact]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://greekarchaeology.osu.edu/arch-edu/analysis "Archaeological Analysis"], Ohio State Archeological excavations in Greece&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these are broken [[sherd|shards]] however.

Outstanding major ceramics collections in general museums include [[Collections of the Palace Museum#Ceramics|The Palace Museum, Beijing]], with 340,000 pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2009-02/16/content_322071.htm|title=Palace Museum Opens Its New Porcelain Hall|author=|date=|work=chinaculture.org|accessdate=19 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200546/http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2009-02/16/content_322071.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei city]], Taiwan (25,000 pieces);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/about/objects.htm|title=國立故宮全球資訊網-訊息頁|author=|date=|work=npm.gov.tw|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both are mostly derived from the Chinese Imperial collection, and are almost entirely of pieces from China.  In London, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (over 75,000 pieces, mostly after 1400 CE) and [[British Museum]] (mostly before 1400 CE) have very strong international collections.  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC (12,000, all East Asian&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, 403&lt;/ref&gt;) have perhaps the best of the many fine collections in the large city museums of the United States. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]], in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], has more than 45,000 glass objects.

'''Chemical mimicry''' (also referred to as Molecular mimicry) is a type of biological [[mimicry]], involving the use of chemicals to dupe an operator. A chemical mimic dupes an operator (e.g. a predator) by showing an adaptive chemical resemblance to an object of its environment and as a consequence receives selective advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Beeren|first1=Christoph|last2=Pohl|first2=Sebastian|last3=Witte|first3=Volker|title=On the Use of Adaptive Resemblance Terms in Chemical Ecology|journal=Psyche|date=2012|volume=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/635761|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/psyche/2012/635761/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases of chemical mimicry it has been found that the mimicking species is the only species to benefit from the reaction with either costs or no effect on the duped species.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dettner|first=K|last2=Liepert|first2=C|date=1994|title=Chemical Mimicry and Camouflage|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.en.39.010194.001021|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=129–154|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.39.010194.001021|issn=0066-4170|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is by adapting to produce chemicals (ex: [[Allomone|allomones]], [[Pheromone|pheromones]], [[Odor|odours]], etc.) that will cause a desirable behavioural reaction in the species being deceived and a selective advantage to the mimic.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akino|first=T.|last2=Knapp|first2=J.

Mimicking semiochemicals, which cannot be seen, make up some of the most widely used forms of chemical mimicry and is therefore less apparent than more visual forms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; As a result of this, this topic has been relatively neglected in research and literature.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Two examples of organisms displaying chemical mimicry include the mimicking of [[Noctuidae|Noctuid]] pheromones by [[Bolas spider|Bolas spiders]] in order to draw prey to the spider’s location and the duping of insects within their own nests by mimicking their odours in order to enter and hide within the nest undetected.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vereecken|first=N. J.|last2=McNeil|first2=J. N.|date=2010|title=Cheaters and liars: chemical mimicry at its finest|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z10-040|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume=88|issue=7|pages=725–752|doi=10.1139/z10-040|issn=0008-4301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that in all forms of mimicry the mimicking organism is not conscious of the deceit used and does not act intentionally to trick other organisms. 

==Classification==
Chemical mimicry exists in many forms and for a variety of uses. It may be classified by the function it performs for the mimicking species and the effect that the mimic will have on the species that is deceived. It can be used for such functions as deterring predators, drawing prey, to allow a [[Parasitism|parasite]] to deceive a [[Host (biology)|host]] species, or to help assist in the reproduction of an organism.

=== Aggressive mimicry ===
[[File:Bola_Spider_(Cladomelea_sp.)_(Photo_Sylvain_REMY)_(9286584444).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bola_Spider_(Cladomelea_sp.)_(Photo_Sylvain_REMY)_(9286584444).jpg|thumb|Bolas spiders emit chemicals to attract prey (Noctuid moths)]]
[[Aggressive mimicry]] through the use of chemicals is used among a wide variety of animals. It functions to either lure the deceived organism to the deceiver or it allows for the organism to accept the presence of a parasite. The chemical mimicry used by parasites allows for the deceived organism to accept the presence of the deceiver while they benefit from either taking up food supplies or directly preying on the host species from within their nest.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

==== Predator ====
Chemical mimicry of an organism’s pheromones allows predators with this ability to draw select prey to them, rather than spend their energy finding and attempting to capture these organisms with varied success.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The pheromones are typically used by the prey species to attract members of their own species as potential mates. In the case of predatory chemical mimicry, the predator has evolved to emit chemicals that are structurally similar and will cause the same behavioural reactions to be displayed by the prey. However, the mimicked pheromones will draw the animal toward the predator rather than a potential mate.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

One group of organisms that use this method are Bolas spiders (genus: ''[[Mastophora (spider)|Mastophora]]''). Bolas spiders will emit chemicals that attract their prey, Noctuid moths.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eberhard|first=William G.|date=1977-12-16|title=Aggressive Chemical Mimicry by a Bolas Spider|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/198/4322/1173|journal=Science|language=en|volume=198|issue=4322|pages=1173–1175|doi=10.1126/science.198.4322.1173|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17818935}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spiders have replaced the need to spin elaborate webs to capture prey by mimicking the pheromones emitted by female moths to attract males of the species effectively. In studies conducted on this spider it has been found that the moths only approach from downwind of the spider and that all of the moths captured were, in fact, male.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Parasites ====
[[File:Cuckoo_bee_(Nomada_sp).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cuckoo_bee_(Nomada_sp).jpg|thumb|Cuckoo bees mimic the eggs of other bee species and shift parental care onto hosts]]
Parasitic use of chemical mimicry involves the invasion of the nest of a duped species, which may consist of an individual or a colony. By emitting mimics of the chemicals that create the host’s familiar odours the invader is able to conceal themselves efficiently within the nest without alerting the host.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

One example of a group of insects that uses this method of chemical mimicry would be [[Cuckoo bee|Cuckoo bees]] (genus: ''[[Nomada]]''). Cuckoo bees will parasitize other genuses of bee, ''[[Melittidae]]'' and ''[[Andrenidae]]''.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Cuckoo bee males will produce chemicals that are similar in structure to the volatile [[Lipid|lipids]] secreted by host females and these chemicals are transferred to Cuckoo females so that they may camouflage their eggs within the host’s nest. This would allow the females to pass off the care of her eggs and larvae onto the host, benefiting the parasite and burdening the host.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== Protective ===
Protective forms of chemical mimicry work to benefit the mimicking species by preventing harm.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In most cases this achieved by acting as a deterrent to other organisms by mimicking the chemicals emitted by another species that has a mechanism to deter predators. This form of mimicry is known as Batesian Mimicry.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaefer|first=H. Martin|last2=Ruxton|first2=Graeme D.|date=2009|title=Deception in plants: mimicry or perceptual exploitation?|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534709002055|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=24|issue=12|pages=676–685|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.06.006|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Batesian Mimicry ====
In [[Batesian mimicry]], potential prey organisms will mimic chemicals emitted by an organism that poses a greater risk to the predator in order to deter attack.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most commonly this form of chemical mimicry is seen in plant species through the release of mimicked defense chemicals. The organism being mimicked may contain noxious chemicals used to deter predators from consuming them as it will lead to the predator becoming ill.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Augner|first=Magnus|last2=Bernays|first2=Elizabeth a.|title=Plant defence signals and Batesian mimicry|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1006581415114.pdf|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|doi=10.1023/a:1006581415114.pdf|issn=0269-7653}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using Batesian mimicry the operator will mimic a chemical aspect, such as “defense signals" used by plants, in order to deceive the herbivore or predator into avoiding an edible organism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Reproductive ===
Chemical mimicry can also have benefits on the reproductive success of the operator. This form is used primarily by [[Flower|flowers]] in order to deceive [[Pollinator|pollinators]]. There are two main types, the first being [[pseudocopulation]] which involves attracting male pollinators by mimicking the pheromones of females of the species.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The second type involves female plants mimicking the chemical signals of males of the same species. By doing this the female plant is able to draw more pollinators despite not producing the [[pollen]] that the animal is looking for.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;
[[File:Dasyscolia_ciliata.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dasyscolia_ciliata.jpg|thumb|Bee pseudo-copulating with orchid]]

==== Pseudocopulation ====
Pseudocopulation is achieved when a flower successfully mimics the appearance and the pheromones emitted by the female of an insect species.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schiestl|first=Florian P.|last2=Ayasse|first2=Manfred|last3=Paulus|first3=Hannes F.|last4=Löfstedt|first4=Christer|last5=Hansson|first5=Bill S.|last6=Ibarra|first6=Fernando|last7=Francke|first7=Wittko|date=1999-06-03|title=Orchid pollination by sexual swindle|url=https://doi.org/10.1038/20829|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=399|issue=6735|pages=421–421|doi=10.1038/20829|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemicals emitted by the mimicking species work to draw these pollinators to the plant and increase the amount of visits to and time spent on the flower. This will increase the chances that pollen will efficiently stick to the organism or that pollen already stuck to it will be transferred successfully to the plant.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In one study on [[Andrena|Mining bees]] (''[[Andrena]] [[nigroaenea]]'') and [[Spider orchid|Spider orchids]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'' Mill.) it was found that unpollinated Spider orchids emitted odours that consisted of [[Hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]] that were an exact match for the odours released by virginal female bees.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; As a result, male Mining bees are extremely attracted to the flowers of the Spider orchid, triggering more quick visits to the flower and in some cases the male bees attempt copulation, either getting themselves sufficiently covered in pollen of successfully transferring it to another plant.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, event schemata are described by pre- and post condition for a single or a set of [[data item]]s. In contrast to ECA ([[Event condition action]]), which considers an event to be a signal, the data event not only refers to the change (signal), but describes specific state transitions, which are referred to in ECA as conditions.

Considering data events as relevant [[data item]] state transitions allows defining complex event-reaction schemata for a database. Defining data event schemata for [[relational database]]s is limited to attribute and instance events. [[Object-oriented database]]s also support collection properties, which allows defining changes in collections as data events, too.

In [[process theology]] '''dipolar theism''' is the position that in order to conceive a perfect God, one must conceive Him as embodying the "good" in sometimes-opposing characteristics, and therefore cannot be understood to embody only one set of characteristics.

For instance, here are some characteristics commonly associated with God:
:One — Many
:Transcendent — Immanent
:Eternal — Temporal
:Mutable — Immutable
:Merciful — Just
:Simple — Complex

Dipolar theism holds that in each pair, both of the characteristics contain some element of good.  In order to embody all perfections, therefore, God must embody the good in ''both'' characteristics, and cannot be limited to one, because a God limited to one would suffer the limits of the one, and lack the good in the other.

For instance, there is a "good" in being just, and also a good in being merciful.  In being just, God determines that the good are rewarded and the evil are punished.  In being merciful, God forgives those who sin.  It follows, therefore, that a God that was ''only'' just or ''only'' merciful would be less than perfect.  Dipolar theism holds that a perfect God must embody the good in ''both'' of those characteristics.  Thus, a perfect God has the "good" characteristics of justice ''and'' the good characteristics of mercy.

Alternatively, there is good in having absolute power, and good in leading by persuasion.  For a God to be perfect, he cannot rule solely by [[predestination]], because then he would lack the good possessed by a God who led by persuasion.  God must therefore embody the "good" in both power and persuasion. From this conclusion, some reject the existence of an [[omnipotent]] God.

==Critique of dipolar theism==
Those rejecting dipolar theism argue that it fails to distinguish between what we ''think'' God is and what God ''actually'' is.  Just because we think God should be a certain way in order to embody our idea of perfection does not mean he embodies those characteristics in reality.  

This critique is analogous to the critique of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]'s [[ontological argument]] by [[Gaunilo]]: "Just because I can imagine a perfect island does not mean that it actually exists.  Things are what they are no matter what I think they should be."

'''Dirty Sanchez''' is a purported [[Human sexual activity|sex act]] where [[feces]] are purposely smeared onto a partner's upper lip. Sex-advice columnist [[Dan Savage]] says the act is completely fictional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do the Santorum|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=14422|last=Savage|first=Dan|date=2003-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Bouldrey]] in ''Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex'' says the act is an urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Words: A Literary Encyclopedia of Sex|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1-59691-474-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]'' says, "This appears to have been contrived with the intention to provoke shock rather than actually as a practice, although, no doubt, some have or will experiment."&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;Partridge, Eric; Dalzell, Tom; Victor, Terry (2006).

== In the media ==
American heavy metal band [[Steel Panther]] mentioned Dirty Sanchez in their song titled "The Shocker" from their album ''[[Feel the Steel]]'' (2009). Another band, [[Sleazy RoXxX]], recorded a song called "Dirty Sanchez" as the opener for their album ''[[Topless Suicide]]''' (2016).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Proper Condom Use]]" (2001), the Filthy Sanchez is noted as a sexual act, among several other allusive terms for sexual acts. "Hot Karl" was also mentioned.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

A 2004 advertisement for [[Unilever]]'s Seedy Sanchez [[Pot Noodle]] featured a [[Mariachi]] band singing a song filled with [[double entendre]]s about their noodles and the sex act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuxbnWuP6wM|title=Pot Noodle Ad – Seedy   Also seen in scary movie 4  Sanchez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pot Noodle continues innuendo in new TV ad|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120630110053/http://www.brandrepublic.com/Campaign/News/204400/Pot-Noodle-continues-innuendo-new-TV-ad/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-30|publisher=Brand Republic|date=2004-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the movie ''[[Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story]]'' (2004), after their victory over the girl scout troop, they{{who|date=November 2018}} meet White Goodman and his team in a bar called "The Dirty Sanchez".  The side of the building shows a woman with a moustache holding a beer.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

It was mentioned in the film ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' (2005) along with [[rusty trombone]] by Mooj after learning Andy is a virgin.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''docking sleeve''' or '''mounting boss''' is a tube or enclosure used to couple two mechanical components together, or for chilling, or to retain two components together; this permits two equally sized appendages to be connected via insertion and fixing within the construction. Docking sleeves may be physically [[solid]] or flexible, their implementation varying widely according to the required application of the device. The most common application is the [[plastic]] appendage that receives a [[screw]] in order to attach two parts.

{{Economic systems sidebar}}
'''Economic democracy''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from [[Management|corporate managers]] and [[Shareholder|corporate shareholders]] to a larger group of [[stakeholder theory|public stakeholders]] that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations [[externality|externalize]] costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for [[capitalism]]'s inherent [[effective demand]] gap.{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}}

Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. [[Corporation|Corporate]] monopoly of [[Common-pool resource|common resources]] typically creates [[artificial scarcity]], resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer [[purchasing power]].{{sfn|George|1912}}{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]], it opens a path to full [[Civil Rights|political rights]], defined as including the former.{{sfn|Smith|2005}} Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from [[decentralization]] and [[economic liberalism|economic liberalization]] to [[Cooperative|democratic cooperatives]], [[public banking]], [[fair trade]] and the [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] of [[Local food|food production]] and [[Local currency|currency]].
{{toclimit|3}}

== Deficiency of effective demand ==
According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, [[geographer]] [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output".{{sfn|Harvey|2010|p=107}} While balanced [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]] have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] and other critics claim that [[Planned economy|command economies]] are predominate, citing [[state capitalism]] and [[imperialism]] as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

In the [[Georgist]] view of any [[economics|economic system]], "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having [[exchange value]]. [[Land (economics)|Land]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]] and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to [[Henry George]]: "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion".{{sfn|George|1912|date=January 2012}} Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and [[Custom (law)|customs]] that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society.

Alternately, [[David Schweickart]] asserts in his book, ''After Capitalism'': "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components:

* "The bulk of the [[means of production]] are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals.
* "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices.
* "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are '[[wage labour]]ers'".{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=22–23}}

[[Supply and demand]] are generally accepted as market functions for establishing [[price]]s. Organisations typically endeavor to 1) minimize the [[Cost-of-production theory of value|cost of production]]; 2) increase sales; in order to 3) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of [[effective demand]] (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=36, 40–43, 95}} resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy.

In chapter 3 of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", [[Douglas Biklen|Douglas P. Biklen]] discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that according to this viewpoint:

{{Quote|[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marx's criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=41, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

=== Savings, investment and unemployment ===

In his 1879 book ''Progress and Poverty'', Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] through [[economic rent]]s, and that concentration of such [[Unearned income|unearned wealth]] was the root cause of poverty.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "Behind the abstraction known as 'the market' lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Henwood | first = Doug | title = Wall Street: How It Works and For Whom | publisher = Verso | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-86091-495-2 | page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=17}}

In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash.

If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=42–43}} which characterize deficiency of effective demand.

In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the "[[invisible hand]]"—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} In this view, [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith's]] "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Richard G | title = The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger | publisher = Bloomsbury Press | isbn = 978-1-60819-036-2 |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Jarvis | first = Brooke |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/want-the-good-life-your-neighbors-need-it-too | title = Equality and the Good Life: Interview with Richard Wilkinson, author of The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better | work = yesmagazine.org |date = March 4, 2010 |accessdate = January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monopoly power versus purchasing power ===

Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states:

{{quote|The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biklen|first=Douglas P.|title=Community Organizing: Theory and Practice|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632|isbn=0-13-153676-1|pages=43, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The discipline of economics is largely a study of [[scarcity]] management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Lionel|title=An Essay On The Nature And Significance Of Economic Science|year=1932|publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co, Ltd|location=St. Martin's Street, London|asin=B000XG8SV4|pages=15|url=https://mises.org/books/robbinsessay2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no [[economic problem]]". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by [[Corporate finance|corporate structures]] that confine [[Abundance (economics)|abundance]] to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited [[Resource (economics)|resources]] in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} American businessman Edward Kellogg (1790–1858) supports this perspective in his 1849 book, ''Labor and Other Capital'', where he states:

{{quote|Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kellogg |first=Edward |last2=Campbell |first2=Alexander |title=Labor and Other Capital |year=1971 |publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf |isbn=0-678-00803-5 |page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered [[Monopoly|monopoly power]], some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in [[artificial scarcity]]. For example, Henry George further suggested:

{{quote|There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = George | first = Henry | title = Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, With Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor | year = 1998 | publisher = Robert Schalkenbach Foundation | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-911312-83-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

For example, many analysts consider [[invention]] a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a 'rare and scarce commodity', for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Edith Tilton |title=The International Patent System | publisher = Johns Hopkins Press | location = Baltimore |year=1951 | oclc = 181961 |page=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nadudere |first=Dan |title=The Political Economy of Imperialism |year=1977 |publisher=Zed Books |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. {{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} According to Jack Rasmus, author of ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', in June 2006, investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labor's share of national income." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmus|first=Jack|title=The Trillion Dollar Income Shift, Part 1|journal=Z Magazine|date=February 2007|volume=20|issue=2|pages=44–49|url=http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/Wealth/JackRasmusZMag.txt|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enclosure of the commons ===
Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or [[enclosure|enclosure of the commons]]. Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both.{{sfn|George|1912|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In 1911, American journalist [[Ambrose Bierce]] defined "land" as:

{{quote|A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierce | first = Ambrose | authorlink = Ambrose Bierce | title = [[The Devil's Dictionary]] | year = 1911 | oclc = 49294964}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In ''The Servile State'' (1912), [[Hilaire Belloc]] referred to the [[Enclosure|Enclosures Movement]] when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy [[oligarchy]] before the series of great [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belloc|first=Hilaire|title=The Servile State|year=1912|publisher=T. N. Foulis|location=91 Great Russell Street, London, W.C. 15 Frederick Street, Edinburgh|asin=B004QGY2M6|pages=72, 74|url=https://archive.org/stream/servilestate00belluoft/servilestate00belluoft_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]], author of ''Capitalism 3.0'', when Adam Smith wrote ''The Wealth of Nations'' in 1776, the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate [[economies of scale]]. The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders' liability to the amounts they have invested.{{sfn|Barnes|2006}}

In ''A Preface To Economic Democracy'', [[Robert A. Dahl]] suggests that [[Agriculture|agrarian]] economy and society in the early United States "underwent a [[Industrial Revolution|revolutionary]] transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] of wealth, income, [[Social status|status]], and [[Economic power|power]]." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the "[[liberty]] to accumulate unlimited [[Factors of production|economic resources]] and to organize economic activity into [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] governed enterprises."{{sfn|Dahl|1985|p=50}}

=== The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage ===
According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first [[monastery]], established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before 1900 developed in Great Britain, where they were established by [[royal charter]], with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say:

{{quote|A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the [[corporate personhood|corporate person]] has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacLeod | first = Greg | title = The Public Purpose Corporation | journal = Harvard International Review | date = 2009-04-04 | url = http://hir.harvard.edu/the-mondragon-experiment | accessdate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In 1886, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the same protections as living [[Citizenship|citizens]]. Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire [[Lobbying|lobbyists]], donate copiously to politicians, and sway [[public opinion]].

But, despite [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an "[[automaton]]", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In 1955, sales of the [[Fortune 500]] accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By 2004 they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or [[Sole proprietorship|proprietorships]]. Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of [[sovereignty]], including [[immortality]], [[Self-governance|self-government]], and [[limited liability]]. By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered [[tariff]]s but extended corporate [[Property|property rights]] and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p=}}

David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=96}} Jack Rasmus, author of ''The War At Home'' and ''The Trillion Dollar Income Shift'', argues that the increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristic of economic [[recession]] and [[depression (economics)|depression]]. According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one percent of households rose while income shares declined for 80-percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid-1970s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the [[Great Depression]], estimating "well over $1 trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly 90 million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since 2001, [[real wages|real weekly earnings]] for 100 million workers are less in 2007 than in 1980 when [[Ronald Reagan]] took office".

According to economist [[Richard D. Wolff]], the 1970s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average [[real wage]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff|Wolff, Richard D.]] (2012). ''[http://www.democracyatwork.info/ Democracy at Work: A Cure for Capitalism].'' [[Haymarket Books]]. {{ISBN|1608462471}}.

* "...the combination of computerization, exported jobs, women surging into the labor market, and a new wave of immigration ended the period of rising real wages in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]].&lt;ref name="Wolff 2012 46"&gt;[[Richard D.

* "Across the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2007, US families worked and borrowed more and more, while real wages stagnated... When they began defaulting on their debts - the system crashed."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperialism ===
According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=David|title=The Enigma of Capital: And the Crises of Capitalism|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0199836841|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Imperialism, as defined by ''Dictionary of Human Geography'', is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnston | first = Ronald John | year = 2000 |title = The Dictionary of Human Geography | edition = 4th | publisher =Wiley-Blackwell | page=375 | isbn = 0-631-20561-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=David|title=Reading Marx’s Capital Vol 1 – Class 12, Chapters 26-33|url=http://davidharvey.org/2008/09/capital-class-12/|work=Video Lecture|publisher=WordPress|accessdate=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladimir Lenin]] viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lenin |first=Vladimir |title=Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism |year=1916 |place=London |publisher=Lawrence and Wishart}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people."&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against Empire |last=Parenti |first=Michael |year=1995 |publisher=City Lights Publishers |isbn=978-0-87286-298-2 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued:

{{quote|Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation.&lt;ref name="Parenti 1995 3"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''The Political Struggle for the 21st century'', [[J. W. Smith|J.W. Smith]] examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize [[colonialism]]. Rhetorically termed as "[[survival of the fittest]]", or "[[might makes right]]", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by [[corporate imperialism]]. Just as cities in the [[Middle Ages]] monopolized the [[means of production]] by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital:

{{Quote|Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p=}}|sign=|source=}}

Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was [[Proletariat|proletarian]]", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than 500 individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth's population. The wealth of 1/2 of 1-percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower 90-percent. {{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the [[lend-lease]] program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the 1950s and 1960s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid-1970s, when the United States implemented a policy known as [[dollar hegemony]], intended to stabilize the economy.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}

== Alternative models ==

Advocating for an "alternative economic system free of capitalism's structural flaws",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economist Richard D. Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say:

{{quote|The [[New Deal]]–era taxes on business and the rich and [[regulation]]s of [[Entrepreneurship|enterprise]] behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives ([[profit maximization]]) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after [[World War II]], with ever-greater effect in the period since the 1970s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], the current assault on [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolff|first1=Richard D.|title=Democracy At Work: A Cure For Capitalism|date=2012|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-60846-247-6|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing [[scientific modelling|model]]. Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that 'there is no alternative'—by proposing one."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=45}} Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure;{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=97}} and b) while capitalism thrives under [[polyarchy]], it is not compatible with genuine democracy.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=151}} Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment,{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=46}} many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one.

For example, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]] claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/political/martin_luther_king_talks/where_do_we_go_from_here/ |title=Where Do We Go From Here |first=Martin Luther Jr |last= King|work=writespirit.net | date = August 16, 1967 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained:

{{quote|The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available.{{sfn|King|1968|p=163}}|sign=|source=}}

According to historian and political economist, [[Gar Alperovitz]]: "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk About The Next American Revolution|date=2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=White River Junction, VT|isbn=978-160358-491-3|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated:

{{quote|When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders' entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy.{{sfn|Engler|2010|p=8}}|sign=|source=}}

Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between [[Planned economy|plan]] and [[Market economy|market]], but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework".&lt;ref name="Schweickart Essay"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Economic Democracy: A Worthy Socialism That Would Really Work |journal=Science &amp; Society |volume=56| issue=1 | pages=9–38|date=Spring 1992 |url=http://homepages.luc.edu/~dschwei/economicdemocracy.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features:

* Worker self-management: each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers.
* Social control of investment: funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}
* The market: enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand.

In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=47}}

Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well.

=== Worker self-management ===
{{Main|Worker self-management}}In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by [[stockholder]]s. Ultimate authority rests with the enterprise's workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–48}}

According to veteran [[World Bank]] economic adviser [[David Ellerman|David P. Ellerman]] it's the [[employment contract]] that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain 'private' in the sense of not being government-owned."{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|p=56}} In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated:

{{quote|In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ([[private company|privately]] or [[public enterprise|publicly]]). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of [[private property]]. Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm.{{sfn|Ellerman|1990|pp=44–49}}|sign=|source=}}

Alternately, in Schweickart's model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways: 1) All firms pay tax on their [[capital asset]]s, which goes into society's investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society. 2) Firms are required to preserve the value of the [[capital stock]] entrusted to them. This means that a [[depreciation]] fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers' incomes. {{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=47–49}}

Italy's [[Legacoop]] and Spain's [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoyt|first1=Lorlene|last2=Luviene|first2=Nicholas|last3=Stitely|first3=Amy|title=Sustainable Economic Democracy: Worker Cooperatives for the 21st Century|url=http://web.mit.edu/colab/pdf/papers/Sustainable_Economic_Democracy.pdf|website=colab.mit.edu|publisher=MIT Community Innovators Lab  with support from the Barr Foundation|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report goes on to say:

{{quote|In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of 256 industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms.}}

=== Social control of investment ===
While there is no single approach or 'blueprint' for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, [[Gar Alperovitz]] claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, [[credit union]]s and other cooperative forms, [[social enterprise]]s, municipally-owned utilities and [[public bank]]s as starting points for what he has termed a "[[Pluralist commonwealth|Pluralist Commonwealth]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alperovitz|first1=Gar|title=What Then Must We Do?: Straight Talk about the Next American Revolution|date=May 1, 2013|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|location=85 North Main Street, Suite 120, White River Junction, VT 05001|isbn=1603585044|pages=139–147|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a [[Flat tax|flat-rate tax]] on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable [[project]] proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund.

Banks are public, not private, institutions that make [[Grant (money)|grants]], not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring [[interest]] payments but no repayment of [[Debt|principal]].{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=56}}

While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism - because banks are mandated to consistently prioritize investment projects that would increase employment - Schweickart notes that it does not guarantee [[full employment]]. Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the [[employer of last resort]]. The original formulation of the [[Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act|U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978]] assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|pp=135, 136}}

=== The market ===
Hungarian historian [[Karl Polanyi]] suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of [[Labour (economics)|labor]], do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In [[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]] Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. Polanyi claimed that [[Land (economics)|land]], labor, and money are all [[commodities|commodified]] under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels "[[fictitious commodities]]." He says [[natural resources]] are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies.

Schweickart's economic democracy is a form of [[market economy]], at least insofar as the allocation of [[consumer goods|consumer]] and [[capital goods]] is concerned. [[business entity|Firm]]s buy [[raw materials]] and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely [[Regulation|unregulated]] except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Without a [[price mechanism]] sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and [[Innovation|innovative]]. [[Competition (economics)|Market competition]] resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a [[Authoritarianism|non-authoritarian]], [[Bureaucracy|non-bureaucratic]] fashion.

Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid.{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=49}}

Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickart's model aims to facilitate [[fair trade]], not [[free trade]], between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. [[Financial capital|Finance capital]] stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesn't flow into the country, either, since there are no [[stock]]s nor [[Bond (finance)|corporate bonds]] nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale."{{sfn|Schweickart|2002|p=63}}

According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a [[market socialism]] has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism".&lt;ref name="Rose In The Fist"&gt;{{cite book |last=Howard |first=Michael |title=Self-Management and the Crisis of Socialism: The Rose in the Fist of the Present |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. |isbn=0-8476-8905-0 |year=2000 |page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed.

=== Economic democracy as part of an inclusive democracy ===
{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}
Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an [[inclusive democracy]] in Takis Fotopoulos' ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice.

The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ([[macroeconomic]] decisions), and secure freedom of choice ([[microeconomic]] decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: (1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and (2) an artificial market using [[Labour voucher|personal vouchers]], which ensures [[choice|freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pepper | first = David | title = Modern environmentalism: An Introduction | publisher = Routledge | location = London; New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-415-05745-5 | page = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, [[participatory economics]] guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Albert  | first = Michael |title = Parecon: Life After Capitalism | publisher = Verso Books | location = New York | year = 2003 | pages = 37–38 | isbn = 978-1-85984-698-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many advocates of participatory economics and [[Participism]] have contested this.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used and so on) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate.

== Reform agendas ==
While [[Reform movement|reform agendas]] tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market and wage labor.

=== Social credit ===
{{Main|Social credit}}
Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts{{who|date=January 2012}} consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a [[public utility]] rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} [[Social Credit]] is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major [[C. H. Douglas]]. His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled ''Economic Democracy''. In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry.&lt;ref name="Douglas CP&amp;D"&gt;{{cite book |title=Credit-Power and Democracy |last=Douglas |first=C.H. |year=1933 |publisher=The Social Credit Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |pages=4–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement":

{{quote|The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale.{{sfn|Cook, "C.H. Douglas"|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy".

==== Credit as a public utility ====
Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the [[American Monetary Institute]], veteran Project Manager for the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], [[Richard C. Cook]] proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cook| first=Richard C.| year=07/02/2010 | title=Monetary Reform and How a National Monetary System Should Work| publisher=Global Research| url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created 'out of thin air' by the banking system".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

[[File:GAP Chart from We Hold These Truths.jpg|thumb|320px|GAP Chart from [[We Hold These Truths: The Hope of Monetary Reform|''We Hold These Truths'']]]]

* A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $12,000 per year under today's economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing".{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=128–129}}

While Smith and others suggest an [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy,{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} {{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes":{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}}

{{quote|[[Monetary reform]] embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 1|2007}} The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of 'market' economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks.{{sfn|Cook, "Credit as a Public Utility" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

Cook avoided [[Collectivism|collectivist]] solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cook's argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including [[Early American currency|colonial paper currencies]] which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the [[Greenback (money)|Greenbacks]] issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American civil war]], and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the [[Great Depression]]. While President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least 20 years.{{sfn|Cook|2008|pp=81–112}}

==== National dividend ====
Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a [[Basic income|Basic Income Guarantee]] or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including [[Thomas Paine]], [[Milton Friedman]], Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Friedman originally proposed a [[negative income tax]] to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIG's demise in the late 1960s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American".{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=121}} In 2006, Representative [[Bob Filner]] (D-CA) proposed a modest basic income guarantee via an inflation-adjusted refundable tax credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/5257 |title=H.R.5257 - Tax Cut for the Rest of Us Act of 2006, 109th Congress (2005-2006)|date=2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network:

{{quote|The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizen's income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 1, 2007|url=http://www.usbig.net/ |title=The U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $12.98-trillion minus $9.21-trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $3.77-trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $12,600 could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. 
Rather than [[Federal Reserve Note]]s, circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "it's important to realize that [[Social Credit]] is not a socialist system. Rather it is 'democratic capitalism,' in contrast to the 'finance capitalism' that has become so damaging".{{sfn|Cook, "US Economy on Life Support"|2007}} Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the 1920s, Cook explains:

{{quote|The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient.{{sfn|Cook, "Monetary Reform" Part 2|2007}}|sign=|source=}}

In his book, ''Capitalism 3.0'', Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top 5 percent of the population owns more [[property]] than the remaining 95 percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$5-trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society.

One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of [[Alaska]], where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the state's oil revenues via the "[[Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend]]". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund".{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.:

{{quote|Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability.{{sfn|King|1968|p=164}}}}

Barnes deemed any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted.{{sfn|Barnes|2006|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Monopoly power versus public utility ===
{{Main|J. W. Smith}}

Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} According to Smith [[entitlement|exclusive title]] to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=2}} Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in [[Western culture]]s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} He estimated that roughly 60 percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double [[economic efficiency]], maintain [[quality of life]], and reduce [[Working time|working hours]] by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xiv}}

Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and [[Telecommunication|communications]]. He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=14}} Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for [[market share]], thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

In Smith's view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 187}} Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through [[License|licensing]] should be legislated as human rights.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 13, 22, 90, 102, 113, 124, 220}}

Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=3}} Federated regions collect [[resource rent]]s on land and technology to a [[social fund]] to operate governments and care for social needs.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=17, 54}} Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=xv}} Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=2, 84}} Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=16–17}}

According to Smith, all monetary systems, including [[money market]]s, should function within [[fractional-reserve banking]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=15}} Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=16}} Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=13}}

=== Cooperatives ===
{{Main|Cooperative}}
A [[cooperative]] is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either [[consumer cooperative]]s or [[worker cooperative]]s, the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy.

According to the [[International Cooperative Alliance]]'s [[Statement on the Cooperative Identity]], "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner."

==== Worker cooperatives ====
{{Main|Worker cooperative}}
According to the [[United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives]]: "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are: 1) workers invest in and own the business and (2) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling 300 democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over 3,500 people and generating over $400 million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between 1990 and 2010, technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|title=About Worker Cooperatives|url=http://usworker.coop/aboutworkercoops|publisher=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called [[workplace democracy]], which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellerman|first=David P.|title=The Democratic Worker-Owned Firm: A New Model for the East and West|publisher=Unwin Hyman Limited (HarperCollins Academic)|location=London|isbn=0-04-445743-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|first=Richard|title=The Spirit Level|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60819-036-2|pages=248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble:

{{quote|Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control.{{sfn|Dahl|1985|pp=92–93 }}|sign=|source=}}

In worker cooperatives, [[net income]] is called [[Economic surplus|surplus]] instead of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt;

Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above.&lt;ref name="usworker" /&gt; Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}} In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working.&lt;ref name="usworker"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usworker.coop/front |title=US Federation of Worker Cooperatives |work=usworker.coop |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.canadianworker.coop/worker-co-op |title=What is a Worker Co-op? | publisher = Canadian Worker Co-op Federation |work=canadianworker.coop |year=2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon cooperatives]] in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque region]] of [[Spain]] have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in 1956, Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stikkers|first=Kenneth W.|title=Dewey and the Mondragon Cooperatives|journal=European Journal of Pragmatism and American Philosophy|year=2011|volume=3|series=2036-4091|issue=2|pages=195–197|url=http://lnx.journalofpragmatism.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/stikkers.pdf|accessdate=10/02/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Richard D. Wolff]] argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard D. Wolff]] (June 24, 2012). [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/24/alternative-capitalism-mondragon "Yes, there is an alternative to capitalism: Mondragon shows the way."] ''[[The Guardian]].'' Retrieved 27 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer cooperatives ====
{{Main|Consumer cooperative}}
A [[consumers' cooperative]] is owned by its customers for their [[mutual aid (organization)|mutual benefit]]. Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group.

In his book, ''From Mondragon To America'', Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain.

Consumer cooperatives vary in organization and operations, but typically follow the [[Rochdale Principles]]. Consumer cooperatives may also form [[Co-operative Federation]]s. These may take the form of [[Co-operative Wholesale Society|co-operative wholesale societies]], through which they collectively purchase goods at [[wholesale]] prices and, in some cases, cooperatively own factories. Alternatively, they may be members of [[Co-operative union]]s.

Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer"&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html What is a Consumer Cooperative? – Cooperative Grocer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055607/http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/cg_coops.html |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Food cooperatives =====
{{Main|Food cooperative}}Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers.&lt;ref name="CooperativeGrocer" /&gt; [[Food cooperatives]] were originally established to provide fresh, [[Organic food|organic produce]] as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and [[slow food]] production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

For example, associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority.{{sfn|DeNies|2003}}

=== Regional trading currencies ===
According to [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]], author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in today's world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the [[Bretton Woods system]], the Federal Reserve acted as the world's central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners".{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}} Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere.{{sfn|Cook, "US Immigration Crisis"|2007}}

According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth:

{{quote|By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization"{{clarify|date=January 2012}} and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others' resources.{{sfn|Smith|2005|p={{page needed|date=January 2012}}}}

=== Democratizing workplaces and distributing productive assets ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

==== The Workplace as a political entity to be democratized ====
Workplace democracy has been cited as a possible solution to the problems that arise from excluding employees from decision-making such as low-employee morale, employee alienation, and low employee engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=122513|title=An Alternative Organizational Model: Workplace Democracy|last=van der Vliet|first=Merijn|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political theorist Isabelle Ferreras argues that there exists “a great contradiction between the democratic nature of our times and the reality of the work experience.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Firms as Political Entities: Saving Democracy through Economic Bicameralism|last=Ferreras|first=Isabelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781108245043|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that the modern corporation's two basic inputs, capital and labor, are treated in radically different ways. Capital owners of a firm wield power within a system of shareholder democracy that allocates voice democratically according to how much capital investment they place in the firm. Labor, on the other hand, rarely benefits from a system to voice their concerns within the firm. She argues that firms are more than just economic organizations especially given the power that they wield over people's livelihoods, environment, and rights. Rather, Ferreras holds that firms are best understood as political entities. And as political entities “it is crucial that firms be made compatible with the democratic commitments of our nations.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany and to a lesser extent the broader European Union have experimented with a way of workplace democracy known as Co-determination, a system that allows workers to elect representatives that sit on the board of directors of a company. Common criticisms of workplace democracy include that democratic workplaces are less efficient than hierarchical workplace, that managers are best equipped to make company decisions since they are better educated and aware of the broader business context.

==== Creating a widespread distribution of productive assets ====
One of the biggest criticisms against capitalism is that it concentrates economic and, as a result, political power in few hands. Theorists of economic democracy have argued that one solution to this unequal concentration of power is to create mechanism that distribute ownership of productive assets across the entire population. In ''Justice as Fairness: A Restatement'', John Rawls argues that only two systems could embody the main features of his principles of justice: liberal socialism or a property-owning democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45388455|title=Justice as fairness : a restatement|last=1921-2002.|first=Rawls, John,|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=Kelly, Erin.|isbn=0674005104|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=45388455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within property-owning democracy Rawls envisions widespread use of worker-owned cooperatives, partial-employee ownership of firms, systems to redistribute one's asset after death to prevent the accumulation of wealth, as well as a strong system of asset-based redistribution that encourages workers to own productive assets.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Samuel. "'Rawls and Property-Owning Democracy'." In Unpacking Rawls, edited by Nicola Riva., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating under the idea that making ownership more widespread leads to more equitable outcomes various proposals of asset-based welfare and asset-redistribution have been conceived. Individualistic and liberal asset-based welfare strategies such as the United Kingdom's Child Trust Fund of the United States Individual Development Account aimed to help people save money so that it could be invested on education, home-ownership, or entrepreneurship. More expirmental and left-leaning proposals include worker owned cooperatives, ESOPS, or Roemers coupon socialism.

== Critiques ==
[[Ludwig von Mises]] argued that ownership and control over the [[means of production]] belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace.{{sfn|Mises|1953|loc=preface; p. 443}} "The capitalistic social order", he claimed, therefore "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word".{{sfn|Mises|2006|p=158}} Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase—they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used.

'''Ecopath with Ecosim''' ('''EwE''') is a free [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]], initially started at [[NOAA]] by Jeffrey Polovina, but has since primarily been developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The NOAA citation states that Ecopath "revolutionized scientists' ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, 2007. ECOPATH Modeling: Precursor to an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management [WWW Document]. URL http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/ecopath/welcome.html (accessed 8.26.12).&lt;/ref&gt; Behind this lie more than two decades of development work in association with [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smikle, S.G., V. Christensen and K.A. Aiken (2010). "A review of caribbean ecosystems and fishery resources using ECOPATH models". Revue Etudes Caribéennes, n°15, https://etudescaribeennes.revues.org/4529&lt;/ref&gt; followed with the provision of user support, training and co-development collaborations. Per January 2012 there are 6000+ registered users in 150+ countries.

==Components==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48529">[[Promiscuity]] tends to be frowned upon by many societies, expecting most members to have [[Committed relationship|committed, long-term relationships]] with single partners.

Most societies have historically been more critical of women's promiscuity than of [[heterosexual]] men's. Among women, as well as men, inclination for sex outside committed relationships is correlated with a high [[libido]],&lt;ref name="Baumeister" /&gt; but social and cultural factors have also been observed to influence sexual behavior and opinion.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Regan&amp;Atkins2006" /&gt;

{{See also|Hormones and sexual motivation|Sexual desire#Sex differences in sexual desire|Libido#Factors}}

Studies have related [[sociosexual orientation]] to [[sex drive]], especially in women, where the higher the sex drive the less restricted the sociosexual orientation, or interest in sex outside [[committed relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Baumeister"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baumeister |first1=RF |title=Gender and erotic plasticity: Sociocultural influences on the sex drive |doi=10.1080/14681990410001691343 |journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=133–139 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, pertaining to the [[nature and nurture]] debate, there is some data emphasizing cultural factors, more so for women than for men.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lippa | first1 = R.

[[Power (social and political)|Social power]] has been popularly associated with sexual [[wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] among men; experimental psychologists have linked power with sexual infidelity among women also. A Dutch study involving a large survey of 1,561 professionals, concluded that "The relationship between power and infidelity was the same for women as for men, and for the same reason.

A 2010 study published in ''[[Journal of Marriage and Family]]'' found that there was a correlation between female pre-marital promiscuity and higher rates of divorce.

[[Bateman's principle]] implies that females are choosy because there is little evolutionary advantage for them to mate with multiple males. However, observation of many species, from [[rabbit]]s to [[tephritidae|fruit flies]], has shown that females have more offspring if they mate with a larger number of males. This seemingly contradicts Bateman's theory, specifically his conclusion that "while males had more children the more partners they mated with, females did not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Judson |first=Olivia |author-link=Olivia Judson |title=Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice To All Creation |place=New York |publisher=Metropolitan Books |year=2002 |isbn=0-8050-6331-5 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to Bateman's principle abound, as do hypotheses explaining the evolution of female promiscuity. Females in fact have a lot to gain, depending on the species (see [[Bateman's principle#Females can be promiscuous|here]]).

=== Pre-Modern ===

Female promiscuity is a recurring theme in mythologies and religions. In the Middle East, [[sacred prostitution]], usually in honor of Goddess [[Astarte]], had been prevalent before the 4th century when Emperor [[Constantine I]] attempted to replace pagan traditions with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="3.55"&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html |title=3.55}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html |title=3.58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], [[nymph]]s are portrayed as dangerous nature spirits sexually uninhibited with humans; hence, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] medical term ''[[Wiktionary:nymphomania|nymphomania]]''. [[Imperial Rome]] is popularly seen as being sexually profligate,&lt;ref&gt;Beert C. Verstraete and Vernon Provencal, introduction to ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 5. For an extended discussion of how the modern perception of Roman sexual decadence can be traced to early [[Christian polemic]], see Alastair J.L. Blanshard, "Roman Vice," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), pp. 1–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catharine Edwards, ''The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; and certain Roman empresses—such as [[Theodora I]], [[Messalina]] and [[Julia the Elder]]—gained in their lifetime a reputation of extreme promiscuity.
{{Quote|text=

Many cultures have historically laid much restriction on sexuality, most emphatically against immoderate expression of sexuality by women. In contrast, some recent ethical philosophies—both secular (coming from [[individualism]] and [[sex-positive feminism]]) and religious (e.g., [[Wicca]], [[Thelema]], [[LaVeyan Satanism]])—either tolerate it or outright celebrate it.

We are all oppressed. We have all been taught, one way or another, that our desires, our bodies, our sexualities, are shameful. What better way to defeat oppression than to get together in communities and celebrate the wonders of sex?|

Public opinion has fluctuated over the centuries, with such downturns as [[Puritan#Family life|New England Puritanism]] (1630—1660) and the [[Victorian era]] (1837—1901), when [[hypersexuality]] was often treated as an exclusively female disorder, diagnosed on the grounds of as little as masturbation alone (see [[Hypersexuality#Nymphomania in the Victorian age|here]]).&lt;ref name=Frick&gt;{{cite web|last=Frick |first=Katie L. |title=Women's Mental Illness: A Response to Oppression |url=http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml#spinsters |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=26 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061024/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~ulrich/femhist/madness.shtml |archivedate=30 March 2010 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the late 20th century, women could be incarcerated for promiscuous behavior in so-called [[Magdalene asylum]]s, the last of which was closed in Ireland in 1996.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/world/europe/25iht-abuse25.html?_r=3 |title=Irish Church's Forgotten Victims Take Case to U.N. |last=Ryan |first=Carol |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-archer.co.uk/history/magdalene1.htm |title=The Magdalene Laundry |author=Alison Roberts |year=2003 |publisher=The-archer.co.uk |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Institutionalised |author=Garth Toyntanen |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558501-0-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1897 to 1958, [[Ontario]] used the [[Velma Demerson|Female Refuges Act]] to incarcerate women felt to be "incorrigible".

Following the [[Industrial Revolution]] (1760~1840), as Western countries underwent [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], education and employment opportunities were increasing for women. This environment gave rise in the late 19th century to the feminist ideal called "the [[New Woman]]"—a personification of female economic, sexual and other autonomy—which had a profound influence on feminism well into the 20th century. It wasn't until the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] that female British citizens were no longer legally compelled, upon marriage, to transfer all their property to their husbands. The [[Women's Movement]] was closely [[Free love#Free love and the women's movement|allied]] with the [[free love]] movement, whose advocates had a strong belief that a woman ought to be herself [[Self-ownership|sovereign over her body]].

{{Quote|text=Laws against adultery [were] [[Adultery#Historical context|based]] upon the idea that woman is a chattel, so that to make love to a married woman is to deprive the husband of her services. It is the frankest and most crass statement of a slave-situation. To us, every woman … has …  an absolute right to travel in her own orbit. There is no reason why she should not be the ideal [[Wiktionary:hausfrau|hausfrau]], if that chance to be her will. But society has no right to insist upon that standard. It was, for practical reasons, almost necessary to set up such taboos in small communities, savage tribes, where the wife was nothing but a general servant, where the safety of the people depended upon a high birth-rate. But to-day woman is economically independent, becomes more so every year. The result is that she instantly asserts her right to have as many or as few men or babies as she wants or can get; and she defies the world to interfere with her. More power to her!|

The [[Roaring Twenties]] have been described as "a time when gin was the national drink and sex the national obsession."&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scott Fitzgerald, Author, Dies at 44 |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=December 23, 1940 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0924.html |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |type=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular at that time was a female subculture called "[[flappers]]", who flouted social and sexual norms and were considered a significant challenge to Victorian [[gender roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history1900s.about.com/od/1920s/a/flappers.htm |title=Flappers in the Roaring Twenties |first=Jennifer |last=Rosenberg |accessdate=2010-04-25 |publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But these sentiments were then overshadowed by the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul N.

Despite this, the 1925 silent film ''[[The Red Kimono]]'', sympathetic toward its promiscuous protagonist, was subject to severe censorship,&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite web|last=Campbell |first=Russell |title="Fallen woman" prostitute narratives in the cinema |url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr1199/rcfr8b.htm |publisher=LaTrobe University |accessdate=2011-12-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308080040/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr1199/rcfr8b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led to a landmark legal case, ''[[Melvin v. Reid]]''.

The 1950s in America is stereotyped to have been sexually repressed, though not as severely as the Victorian era. Female promiscuity in particular became substantially more accepted in [[Western world|Western]] culture after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, which resonated with the [[hippie movement]]. It also became more prevalent a theme in [[mass media]], including cinema (e.g., ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'') and music (e.g., ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]).

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has been at the forefront of the [[gender neutrality|gender neutrality]] movement in terms of promiscuity since becoming a globally recognized entertainer in the 1980’s. In addition to her sexually explicit song lyrics and occasional nude self exposures during live performances and almost being arrested in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, on May 29, 1990 for simulating masturbation in public &lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6582939/madonna-masturbation-like-a-virgin-controversy-toronto-anniversary&lt;/ref&gt;, her book [[Sex (book)|Sex]] released on Oct 21, 1992 was a commercially successful nude pictorial of her and various famous celebrities engaging in scenes of purported promiscuity, further enhancing her vision of gender equality in this regard. 

There has been an increase in awareness of [[discrimination]] on grounds of promiscuity—apparent or actual—which at least since year 2010 has been called ''[[slut shaming]]''.&lt;ref name="Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lang |first=Nico |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nico-lang/trampires-why-the-slut-sh_b_1850940.html |title=‘Trampire:’ Why the Public Slut Shaming of Kristen Stewart Matters for Young Women |newspaper=Huffington Post |date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Slattery |first=Laura |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2012/1218/1224327955336.html |title=The year of slut-shaming, creepshots, Malala and more |newspaper=Irish Times |date=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 3, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlutWalk Toronto: What |url=http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/about/what |accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[SlutWalk]] movement—protesting against explaining or excusing [[rape]] by referring to any aspect of a woman's [[Human physical appearance|appearance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/news/canada/article/511501--slut-walk-crowded |title=‘Slut walk’ crowded |publisher=TheSpec |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, by extension, calling for sexual freedom in general—began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and went on to spread throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/a-rally-to-find-the-slut-in-everyone-20110528-1f9w3.html |title=‘A Rally to find the slut in everyone’ |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[polygyny]] is more common, some tribal societies are traditionally [[polyandrous]].

The use of [[demographical]] methods in [[sexological]] research was pioneered by the American zoologist [[Alfred Kinsey]], who published two books—''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) and ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953)—collectively known as the [[Kinsey Reports]]. The reports defied the expectations of the public and paved the way for the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s.

Accurately assessing people's sexual behavior is difficult, since there are strong social and personal motivations, depending on social [[Social control|sanctions]] and [[taboo]]s, for either minimizing or exaggerating reported sexual activity. Women tend to undervalue the number of their sex partners whereas men tend to overestimate the number of theirs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In a 1994 study in the United States, almost all married heterosexual women reported having sexual contact only with their husbands, and unmarried women almost always reported having no more than one sexual partner in the past three months. [[Lesbian]]s who had a long-term partner reported having fewer outside partners than heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="nejm"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1056/NEJM199410063311407 |last1=Friedman |first1=RC |last2=Downey |first2=JI |year=1994 |title=Homosexuality |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=331 |issue=October 6, 1994, Number 14 |pages=923–930 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/14/923#R10 |pmid=8078554}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research, however, contradicts the assertion that heterosexual women are largely [[monogamous]]. A 2002 study estimated that 45% to 55% of married heterosexual women engage in sexual relationships outside their marriage.&lt;ref name="Atwood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Atwood |first=JD |last2=Schwartz |first2=L |title=Cyber-Sex  The New Affair Treatment Considerations |journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy: Innovations in Clinical and Educational Interventions |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=37–56 |doi=10.1300/J398v01n03_03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the estimates for heterosexual males in the same study were greater (50%–60%), the data indicates that a significant portion of married heterosexual women have or have had sexual partners other than their spouse as well.&lt;ref name="Atwood" /&gt;

One international study found women to be more variable than men in their sex drive.&lt;ref name="Lippa2009" /&gt; International measurements of promiscuity are inconsistent from study to study, varying by the methodology used. Due to practical reason—the inability to survey a country's entire population—all studies of this class are [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], generalizing about the general population based on assessments of sample groups supposed to be representative of the larger population being studied.

For example, in a non-scientific study conducted by the condom-making company [[Durex]], British women reported fewer partners than British men, while the only country where women reported more sex partners than men did was [[New Zealand]] (20.4 versus 16.8), which was also the country where women reported more sex partners than did women from all other countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2007/10/13/1191696214489.html |title=New Zealand women most promiscuous |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further complicate matters, a well-known study in general sociosexuality that surveyed 14,059 people across 48 countries, placed New Zealand, which came right before [[Slovenia]], second to [[Finland]]; the [[United States]], in the unisex scores of the same study, came in 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmitt |first=David |title=Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: a 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating |journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=28 |pages=247–75; discussion 275–311 |year=2005 |pmid=16201459 |issue=2 |url=http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000051 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226234624/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/dalywilson/commentary_schmitt.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual relations with multiple males are termed ''[[polyandry]]''. It has a more specific meaning in zoology, where it refers to a type of [[mating system]], and in anthropology, where it refers to a type of [[marriage]]. Sexual relations with multiple females are termed ''[[polygyny]]'', but in zoology it can only be applied to heterosexual relations. [[Polyamory]] is sometimes defined as [[non-monogamy]] with consent of all parties involved, if within or without [[committed relationship]]s. Attitudinal differences concerning sex outside committed relationships are referred to under the term ''[[sociosexual orientation]]'' or simply ''sociosexuality''.

Since at least 1450, the word ''[[slut]]'' has been used, often pejoratively, to describe a sexually promiscuous woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|slut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In and before the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era]]s, terms like "strumpet" and "whore" were used to describe women deemed promiscuous, as seen for example in [[John Webster]]'s 1612 play ''[[The White Devil]]''.

Discrimination targeting individuals, specifically women, for sexual behavior deemed excessive, has been referred to, since at least spring of 2010, with the [[neologism]] ''[[slut shaming]]'' (also hyphenated, as ''slut-shaming'').&lt;ref name="Post" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

''[[Cuckold]] fetish'' is colloquial for a [[paraphilia]] in which sexual gratification is gained from maintenance or observation of sexual relations by a woman with a man or a number of men besides her husband, boyfriend or long-term male sex partner.

The popular slang ''[[Cougar (slang)|cougar]]'' refers to a woman who seeks sexual relations with considerably younger men.

The term ''[[fallen woman]]'' was used to describe a woman who has "lost her innocence", and fallen from the grace of God. In [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain especially, the meaning came to be closely associated with the "loss or surrender of a woman's chastity". Its use was an expression of the belief that to be socially and morally acceptable a women's sexuality and experience should be entirely restricted to marriage, and that she should also be under the supervision and care of an authoritative man.

'''Green computing''', '''green ICT''' as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT", '''green IT''', or '''ICT sustainability''', is the study and practice of [[environmentally sustainable]] computing or IT.

The goals of green computing are similar to [[green chemistry]]: reduce the use of hazardous materials, maximize [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] during the product's lifetime,  the [[recycling|recyclability]] or [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]] of defunct products and factory waste. Green computing is important for all classes of systems, ranging from handheld systems&lt;ref&gt;S.

In 1992, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] launched [[Energy Star]], a voluntary labeling program that is designed to promote and recognize the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of [[sleep mode]] among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the [[TCO Certification]] program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]-based [[computer display]]s; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, [[ergonomics]], and the use of hazardous materials in construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TCO takes the initiative in comparative product testing |accessdate=May 3, 2008 |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723060821/http://www.boivie.se/index.php?page=2&amp;lang=eng |archive-date=July 23, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations and industry initiatives==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has published a survey of over 90 government and industry initiatives on "Green ICTs", i.e. information and communication technologies, the environment and climate change. The report concludes that initiatives tend to concentrate on the greening ICTs themselves rather than on their actual implementation to tackle global warming and environmental degradation. In general, only 20% of initiatives have measurable targets, with government programs tending to include targets more frequently than business associations.&lt;ref&gt;Full report: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|title=Towards Green ICT strategies: Assessing Policies and Programmes on ICTs and the Environment|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317103746/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/47/12/42825130.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}} Summary: {{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|title=Executive summary of OECD report|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|access-date=November 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102750/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/43044065.pdf|archive-date=March 17, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
Many [[governmental]] agencies have continued to implement standards and regulations that encourage green computing. The [[Energy Star]] program was revised in October 2006 to include stricter efficiency requirements for computer equipment, along with a tiered ranking system for approved products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EPA Announces New Computer Efficiency Requirements |date=October 23, 2006 |url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |last=Jones |first=Ernesta |publisher=U.S. EPA |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212022429/http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/a8f952395381d3968525701c005e65b5/113b0c0647fee41585257210006474f1!OpenDocument |archive-date=February 12, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |title=How Important Will New Energy Star Be for PC Makers? |last=Gardiner |first=Bryan |date=February 22, 2007 |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=September 18, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826193654/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2097558,00.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2007 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2008, 26 US states established statewide recycling programs for obsolete computers and consumer electronics equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306222713/http://www.e-takeback.org/docs%20open/Toolkit_Legislators/state%20legislation/state_leg_main.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |title= State Legislation on E-Waste |date=March 20, 2008 |publisher=Electronics Take Back Coalition |accessdate=March 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes either impose an "advance recovery fee" for each unit sold at retail or require the manufacturers to reclaim the equipment at disposal.

In 2010, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] (ARRA) was signed into legislation by President Obama. The bill allocated over $90 billion to be invested in green initiatives (renewable energy, smart grids, energy efficiency, etc.) In January 2010, the U.S. Energy Department granted $47 million of the ARRA money towards projects that aim to improve the energy efficiency of data centers. The projects provided research to optimize data center hardware and software, improve power supply chain, and [[computer cooling|data center cooling technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527141406/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/8491.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2010 |title=Secretary Chu Announces $47 Million to Improve Efficiency in Information Technology and Communications Sectors |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
* [[Climate Savers Computing Initiative]] (CSCI) is an effort to reduce the electric power consumption of PCs in active and inactive states.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214140754/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/press.html |archivedate=February 14, 2008 |title=Intel and Google Join with Dell, EDS, EPA, HP, IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, PG&amp;E, World Wildlife Fund and Others to Launch Climate Savers Computing Initiative |publisher=Business Wire |date=June 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CSCI provides a catalog of green products from its member organizations, and information for reducing PC power consumption. It was started on 2007-06-12. The name stems from the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s Climate Savers program, which was launched in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215151042/http://www.climatesaverscomputing.org/program/index.html |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |title=What exactly is the Climate Savers Computing Initiative? |publisher=Climate Savers Computing Initiative |year=2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WWF is also a member of the Computing Initiative.&lt;ref name="CSCI_pressrel_launch" /&gt;
* The [[Green Electronics Council]] offers the [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) to assist in the purchase of "greener" computing systems. The Council evaluates computing equipment on 51 criteria - 23 required and 28 optional - that measure a product's efficiency and sustainability attributes. Products are rated Gold, Silver, or Bronze, depending on how many optional criteria they meet. On 2007-01-24, President [[George W. Bush]] issued Executive Order 13423, which requires all United States Federal agencies to use EPEAT when purchasing computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20(1-24-07).pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qCuJd6am?url=http://www.epeat.net/Docs/Bush%20Requires%20EPEAT%20%281-24-07%29.pdf |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |title=President Bush Requires Federal Agencies to Buy EPEAT Registered Green Electronic Products |publisher=Green Electronics Council |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |title=Executive Order: Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management |publisher=The White House: Office of the Press Secretary |date=January 24, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831005045/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070124-2.html |archive-date=August 31, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Green Grid]] is a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers and business computing ecosystems. It was founded in February 2007 by several key companies in the industry&amp;nbsp;– [[AMD]], [[American Power Conversion|APC]], [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Rackable Systems]], [[SprayCool]] (purchased in 2010 by [http://www.parker.com/portal/site/Market-Tech/menuitem.e9f921bc8ae21676de92b210237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=e7bfa7bee4a70310VgnVCM10000048021dacRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default Parker]), [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[VMware]]. The Green Grid has since grown to hundreds of members, including end-users and government organizations, all focused on improving [[data center infrastructure efficiency]] (DCIE).
* The [[Green500]] list rates supercomputers by energy efficiency ([[megaflops]]/[[watt]]), encouraging a focus on efficiency rather than absolute performance.
* [[Green Comm Challenge]] is an organization that promotes the development of energy conservation technology and practices in the field of Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
* The [[Transaction Processing Performance Council]] (TPC) Energy specification augments existing TPC benchmarks by allowing optional publications of energy metrics alongside performance results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Energy benchmarks: a detailed analysis (e-Energy 2006) |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1791314.1791336|publisher=ACM. {{ISBN|978-1-4503-0042-1}}.

==Approaches==
Modern [[Information technology|IT]] systems rely upon a complicated mix of people, networks, and hardware; as such, a green computing initiative must cover all of these areas as well. A solution may also need to address end user satisfaction, management restructuring, regulatory compliance, and return on investment (ROI). There are also considerable fiscal motivations for companies to take control of their own power consumption; "of the power management tools available, one of the most powerful may still be simple, plain, common sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100706131340/http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/technology/Green-and-lean-it-data-centre-efficiency.cfm |archivedate =July 6, 2010 |title=The common sense of lean and green IT |work=Deloitte Technology Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product longevity===
[[Gartner]] maintains that the PC manufacturing process accounts for 70% of the natural resources used in the life cycle of a PC.&lt;ref&gt;InfoWorld July 6, 2009;
{{cite web |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121223HCFSDBIFBWETHVYUSDVFSDJB CFSDBVGZDGFCHGSDVYUFSDYVGASJDVG315/http://www.infoworld.com/d/green-it/used-pc-strategy-passes-toxic-buck-300?_kip_ipx=1053322433-1267784052&amp;_pxn=0 |archivedate=January 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fujitsu released a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a desktop that show that manufacturing and end of life accounts for the majority of this desktop's ecological footprint.&lt;ref&gt;GreenIT.fr Feb. 2011; http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424020904/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/pc-de-bureau/quelle-est-l-empreinte-carbone-d-un-ordinateur-3478 |date=April 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the biggest contribution to green computing usually is to prolong the equipment's lifetime. Another report from Gartner recommends to "Look for product longevity, including upgradability and modularity."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Mingay, Gartner: 10 Key Elements of a 'Green IT' Strategy;
{{cite web |url=http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730120749/http://www.onsitelasermedic.com/pdf/10_key_elements_greenIT.pdf |archivedate=July 30, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, manufacturing a new PC makes a far bigger [[ecological footprint]] than manufacturing a new [[RAM]] module to upgrade an existing one.

===Data center design===
Data center facilities are heavy consumers of energy, accounting for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world’s total energy use in 2010 [1]. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that data center facilities consume up to 100 to 200 times more energy than standard office buildings.&lt;ref name="https://energy.gov"&gt;“Best Practices Guide for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design”, prepared by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy, Federal Energy Management Program, March 2011.[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220151305/https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/10/f3/eedatacenterbestpractices.pdf |date=December 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should address all of the energy use aspects included in a data center: from the IT equipment to the HVAC(Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) equipment to the actual location, configuration and construction of the building.

The U.S. Department of Energy specifies five primary areas on which to focus energy efficient data center design best practices:&lt;ref&gt;Koomey, Jonathon. “Growth in data center electricity use 2005 to 2010,” Oakland, CA: Analytics Press. August 1. {{cite web |url=http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111082558/http://www.analyticspress.com/datacenters.html |archivedate=January 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Information technology (IT) systems
* Environmental conditions
* Air management
* Cooling systems
* Electrical systems

Additional energy efficient design opportunities specified by the U.S. Department of Energy include on-site electrical generation and recycling of waste heat.&lt;ref&gt;Junaid Shuja, Abdullah Gani, Shahaboddin Shamshirband, Raja Wasim Ahmad, Kashif Bilal, Sustainable Cloud Data Centers: A survey of enabling techniques and technologies, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 62, September 2016, Pages 195-214, ISSN 1364-0321, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.04.034&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy efficient data center design should help to better utilize a data center’s space, and increase performance and efficiency.

In 2018, three new US Patents make use of facilities design to simultaneously cool and produce electrical power by use of internal and external waste heat. The three patents use silo design for stimulating use internal waste heat, while the recirculation of the air cooling the silo's computing racks. US Patent  [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=4&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,510,486], uses the recirculating air for power generation, while sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=2&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 9,907,213], forces the recirculation of the same air, and sister patent, US Patent [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=matteo&amp;s2=gravina&amp;OS=matteo+AND+gravina&amp;RS=matteo+AND+gravina 10,020,436], uses thermal differences in temperature resulting in negative power usage effectiveness.  Negative power usage effectiveness, makes use of extreme differences between temperatures at times running the computing facilities, that they would run only from external sources other than the power use for computing. 

===Software and deployment optimization===

====Algorithmic efficiency====
{{Main article|Algorithmic efficiency}}
{{Further|Analysis of algorithms}}
The efficiency of algorithms affects the amount of computer resources required for any given computing function and there are many efficiency trade-offs in writing programs.  Algorithm changes, such as switching from a slow (e.g. linear) search algorithm to a fast (e.g. hashed or indexed) search algorithm can reduce resource usage for a given task from substantial to close to zero. &lt;!-- algorithmic efficiency personal example: I re-coded a SQL report query (that was run several times a day) that took 30 minutes to run in 15 seconds.  Impressive?  Sure!  Unusual?  Hardly.  I'm sure there are citeable examples.--&gt; In 2009, a study by a physicist at [[Harvard]] estimated that the average Google search released 7&amp;nbsp;grams of carbon dioxide (CO₂).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | title=Research reveals environmental impact of Google searches. | accessdate=January 15, 2009 | work=Fox News | date=January 12, 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112195017/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,479127,00.html | archive-date=January 12, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Google disputed this figure, arguing instead that a typical search produced only 0.2&amp;nbsp;grams of CO₂.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | title=Powering a Google search | accessdate=October 1, 2009 | work=Official Google Blog | publisher=Google | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729054622/http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/powering-google-search.html | archive-date=July 29, 2009 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resource allocation====
{{Main article|Resource allocation}}
Algorithms can also be used to route data to data centers where electricity is less expensive. Researchers from MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Akamai have tested an energy allocation algorithm that successfully routes traffic to the location with the cheapest energy costs. The researchers project up to a 40 percent savings on energy costs if their proposed algorithm were to be deployed. However, this approach does not actually reduce the amount of energy being used; it reduces only the cost to the company using it. Nonetheless, a similar strategy could be used to direct traffic to rely on energy that is produced in a more environmentally friendly or efficient way. A similar approach has also been used to cut energy usage by routing traffic away from data centers experiencing warm weather; this allows computers to be shut down to avoid using air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Rear don |first= Marguerite |title= Energy-aware Internet routing coming soon |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |date= August 18, 2009 |accessdate= August 19, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110617075237/http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10312408-54.html |archive-date= June 17, 2011 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger server centers are sometimes located where energy and land are inexpensive and readily available. Local availability of renewable energy, climate that allows outside air to be used for cooling, or locating them where the heat they produce may be used for other purposes could be factors in green siting decisions.

Approaches to actually reduce the energy consumption of network devices by proper network/device management techniques are surveyed in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |author1=Aruna Prem Bianzino |author2=Claude Chaudet |author3=Dario Rossi |author4=Jean-Louis Rougier|title=A Survey of Green Networking Research |arxiv= 1010.3880 |class=cs.NI|date= October 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors grouped the approaches into 4 main strategies, namely (i) Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), (ii) Interface Proxying, (iii) Energy Aware Infrastructure, and (iv) Max Energy Aware Applications.

====Virtualizing====
{{Main article|Platform virtualization}}
{{See also|Comparison of platform virtualization software}}
Computer virtualization refers to the abstraction of computer resources, such as the process of running two or more logical computer systems on one set of physical hardware. The concept originated with the IBM [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] operating systems of the 1960s, but was commercialized for [[x86 architecture|x86]]-compatible computers only in the 1990s. With virtualization, a system administrator could combine several physical systems into virtual machines on one single, powerful system, thereby unplugging the original hardware and reducing power and cooling consumption. Virtualization can assist in distributing work so that servers are either busy or put in a low-power sleep state. Several commercial companies and open-source projects now offer software packages to enable a transition to virtual computing. [[Intel Corporation]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] have also built proprietary [[x86 virtualization#Hardware support|virtualization enhancements]] to the x86 [[instruction set]] into each of their CPU product lines, in order to facilitate virtual computing.

New virtual technologies, such as [[Linux Containers]] can also be used to reduce energy consumption. These technologies make a ore efficient use of resources, thus reducing energy consumption by design. Also, the consolidation of virtualized technologies is more efficient than the one done in [[Virtual machine|virtual machines]], so more services can be deployed in the same physical machine, reducing the amount of hardware needed. &lt;ref&gt;Ismael Cuadrado-Cordero, Anne-Cécile Orgerie, Jean-Marc Menaud., [https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 “Comparative Experimental Analysis of the Quality-of-Service and Energy-Efficiency of VMs and Containers' Consolidation for Cloud Applications,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233816/https://hal-centralesupelec.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01578325v2 |date=June 28, 2018 }} International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2017), Sep 2017, Split, Croatia. pp.1-6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminal servers====
{{Main article|Terminal server}}
Terminal servers have also been used in green computing. When using the system, users at a terminal connect to a central server; all of the actual computing is done on the server, but the end user experiences the operating system on the terminal. These can be combined with [[thin client]]s, which use up to 1/8 the amount of energy of a normal workstation, resulting in a decrease of energy costs and consumption.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} There has been an increase in using terminal services with thin clients to create virtual labs. Examples of terminal server software include [[Terminal Services]] for Windows and the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]] (LTSP) for the [[Linux operating system]]. Software-based remote desktop clients such as [[Windows Remote Desktop]] and [[RealVNC]] can provide similar thin-client functions when run on low power, commodity hardware that connects to a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|title=Software or Hardware: The Future of Green Enterprise Computing|last=Kazandjieva|first=Maria|date=|work=|access-date=|last2=Heller|first2=Brandon|last3=Gnawali|first3=Omprakash|last4=Hofer|first4=Wanja|last5=Levis|first5=Philip|last6=Kozyrakis|first6=Christos|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619190042/http://hci.stanford.edu/cstr/reports/2011-02.pdf|archive-date=June 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power management===
{{Main article|Power management}}
The [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI), an open industry standard, allows an operating system to directly control the power-saving aspects of its underlying hardware. This allows a system to automatically turn off components such as [[computer display|monitors]] and [[hard drive]]s after set periods of inactivity. In addition, a system may [[Hibernation (computing)|hibernate]], when most components (including the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] and the system RAM) are turned off. ACPI is a successor to an earlier Intel-Microsoft standard called [[Advanced Power Management]], which allows a computer's [[BIOS]] to control power management functions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some programs allow the user to manually adjust the voltages supplied to the CPU, which reduces both the amount of heat produced and electricity consumed. This process is called [[undervolting]]. Some CPUs can automatically undervolt the processor, depending on the workload; this technology is called "[[SpeedStep]]" on Intel processors, "[[PowerNow!]]"/"[[Cool'n'Quiet]]" on AMD chips, [[LongHaul]] on [[VIA Technologies|VIA]] CPUs, and [[LongRun]] with [[Transmeta]] processors.

====Data center power====

Data centers can potentially improve their energy and space efficiency through techniques such as storage consolidation and virtualization. Many organizations are aiming to eliminate underutilized servers, which results in lower energy usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211120149/http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/green-it-over.aspx|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 11 February 2011|title= Is Green IT Over?|publisher=Dell.com | accessdate=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step toward this aim will be training of data center administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|title= Towards Green Computing Application for Measuring the Sustainability of Data Centers: An Analytical Survey, Zohreh Gandomi, Salmiah Amin|publisher= SDIWC Digital Library|access-date= November 1, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402210100/http://sdiwc.net/digital-library/towards-green-computing-application-for-measuring-the-sustainability-of-data-centers-an-analytical-survey.html|archive-date= April 2, 2015|dead-url= no|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. federal government has set a minimum 10% reduction target for data center energy usage by 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; With the aid of a self-styled ultraefficient evaporative cooling technology, Google Inc. has been able to reduce its energy consumption to 50% of that of the industry average.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

====Operating system support====
&lt;!-- Needs Mac and Linux coverage. Also, this may be too detailed for a summary--&gt;
Microsoft Windows, has included limited [[PC power management]] features since Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |title=Windows 95 Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311193319/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms810046.aspx |archive-date=March 11, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These initially provided for stand-by (suspend-to-RAM) and a monitor low power state. Further iterations of Windows added hibernate (suspend-to-disk) and support for the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] standard. Windows 2000 was the first NT-based operating system to include power management. This required major changes to the underlying operating system architecture and a new hardware driver model. Windows 2000 also introduced [[Group Policy]], a technology that allowed administrators to centrally configure most Windows features. However, power management was not one of those features. This is probably because the power management settings design relied upon a connected set of per-user and per-machine binary registry values,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown |title=Windows power-saving options are, bizarrely, stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127034201/http://www.liv.ac.uk/csd/greenit/powerdown/ |archivedate=November 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively leaving it up to each user to configure their own power management settings.

This approach, which is not compatible with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |title=How Windows XP Wasted $25 Billion of Energy |date=November 21, 2006 |accessdate=November 21, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051214/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/11/how_windows_xp.php |archive-date=November 27, 2006 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this section, while quite possibly true, sounded like OR so I cut it out. In fact, the treehugger source is basically a blog... can we do better?

The support offered is limited to a single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for [[timer coalescing]], [[processor power management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/ProcPowerMgmtWin7.mspx |title=Windows 7 Processor Power Management |access-date=April 19, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015949/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/procpowermgmtwin7.mspx |archive-date=May 10, 2010 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |title=Windows 7 Timer Coalescing |access-date=April 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416215821/http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/pnppwr/powermgmt/TimerCoal.mspx |archive-date=April 16, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.

As hard drive prices have fallen, storage farms have tended to increase in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and backup data that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage IBM chief engineer talks green storage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502041656/http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/1255635/IBM-chief-engineer-talks-green-storage |date=May 2, 2013 }}, SearchStorage - TechTarget&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials recycling===
{{Main article|Electronic waste | computer recycling | Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive}}

Recycling computing equipment can keep harmful materials such as lead, mercury, and hexavalent chromium out of [[landfill]]s, and can also replace equipment that otherwise would need to be manufactured, saving further energy and emissions. Computer systems that have outlived their particular function can be re-purposed, or donated to various charities and non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503011722/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/04/12/reuse-your-electronics-through-donation-to-schools-charities-and-nonprofit-organizations/ |archivedate=May 3, 2008 |title=Reuse your electronics through donation » Earth 911 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many charities have recently imposed minimum system requirements for donated equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=PC Magazine |volume=26 |issue=17 |date=September 4, 2007 |title=15 Ways to Reinvent Your PC |last=Delaney |first=John |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502215811/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2170255,00.asp |archive-date=May 2, 2008 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parts from outdated systems may be salvaged and recycled through certain retail outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.staples.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=96244&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1004542&amp;highlight= |title=Staples Launches Nationwide Computer and Office Technology Recycling Program |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Staples, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725070137/http://earth911.org/blog/2007/08/15/goodwill-teams-with-electronic-recyclers-to-recycle-ewaste/ |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |title=Goodwill Teams with Electronic Recyclers to Recycle eWaste |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |publisher=Earth 911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and municipal or private recycling centers.

In this country, e-waste collection is still at a 14% annual rate between electronic equipment sold and e-waste collected for 2006 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |title=e-waste take-back still very low |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011 |publisher=GreenIT.fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213031911/http://www.greenit.fr/article/materiel/recyclage/deee-l-europe-revoit-ses-objectifs-a-la-hausse-3482 |archive-date=February 13, 2011 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recycling of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if there is more than one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |title=Green Computing and Privacy Issues |publisher=MySecureCyberspace |date= |accessdate=September 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028214220/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/articles/features/green-computing-and-privacy-issues.html |archive-date=October 28, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloud computing===
{{Main article| Cloud computing }}
Cloud computing addresses two major ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and [[resource consumption]]. [[Virtualization]], [[Dynamic provisioning environment]], multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up to a great extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |title= Microsoft-backed research suggests big energy reductions from cloud |publisher= ZDNet |date= November 4, 2010 |accessdate= September 3, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151208073045/http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-backed-research-suggests-big-energy-reductions-from-cloud/ |archive-date= December 8, 2015 |dead-url= no |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One common example includes [[Online shopping]] that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel to reach out to the physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.&lt;ref name="Google Scholar Citations"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=tWRIBtoAAAAJ&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=tWRIBtoAAAAJ:rO6llkc54NcC|title=Google Scholar Citations|website=scholar.google.com.pk|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edge Computing===
{{Main article| Edge computing }}
New technologies such as [[Edge computing| Edge]] and [[Fog computing]] are a solution to reducing energy consumption. These technologies allow redistributing computation near the use, thus reducing energy costs in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Cuadrado-Cordero, Ismael, [http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 “Microclouds: an approach for a network-aware energy-efficient decentralised cloud,”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233846/http://www.theses.fr/2017REN1S003 |date=June 28, 2018 }} PhD thesis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, having smaller data centers, the energy used in operations such as refrigerating and maintenance gets largely reduced. 

===Telecommuting===
{{Main article|Telecommuting}}
[[Teleconference|Teleconferencing]] and [[telepresence]] technologies are often implemented in green computing initiatives. The advantages are many; increased worker satisfaction, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions related to travel, and increased profit margins as a result of lower overhead costs for office space, heat, lighting, etc.&lt;ref&gt;E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/MISQE_SustainableIT_Intel_2012.pdf “Developing an Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel’s Journey,”] MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61–74, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The savings are significant; the average annual energy consumption for U.S. office buildings is over 23 kilowatt hours per square foot, with heat, air conditioning and lighting accounting for 70% of all energy consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306130237/http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/documents/sector-meeting/4bi_officebuilding.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2009 |format=PDF|title=EPA Office Building Energy Use Profile |date=August 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 17, 2008 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other related initiatives, such as [[Hoteling]], reduce the square footage per employee as workers reserve space only when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|title=What Is Green IT?|access-date=March 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415091508/http://energypriorities.com/entries/2007/06/what_is_green_it_data_centers.php|archive-date=April 15, 2008|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many types of jobs, such as sales, consulting, and field service, integrate well with this technique.

[[Voice over Internet Protocol|Voice over IP (VoIP)]] reduces the telephony wiring infrastructure by sharing the existing Ethernet copper. VoIP and phone extension mobility also made [[hot desking]] more practical.

===Telecommunication network devices energy indices===
The information and communication technologies (ICTs) energy consumption, in the USA and worldwide, has been estimated respectively at 9.4% and 5.3% of the total electricity produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507123122/http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/cyb/app/docs/itu-icts-for-e-environment.pdf |archive-date=May 7, 2013 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy consumption of ICTs is today significant even when compared with other industries. Some study tried to identify the key energy indices that allow a relevant comparison between different devices (network elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Virgilio |last1=Puglia |title=Energy indices for environmental sustainability |journal=International Journal of Technology Marketing |date=January 2013 |volume=8 |issue=1/2013 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530121855/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/n2w5530544110065/ |archivedate=May 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was focused on how to optimise device and network consumption for carrier telecommunication by itself. The target was to  allow an immediate perception of the relationship between the network technology and the environmental effect. These studies are at the start and the gap to fill in this sector is still huge and further research will be necessary.

===Supercomputers===

The inaugural [[Green500]] list was announced on November 15, 2007 at SC|07. As a complement to the TOP500, the unveiling of the Green500 ushered in a new era where supercomputers can be compared by performance-per-watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.green500.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826075608/http://www.green500.org/ |archive-date=August 26, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tsubame (supercomputer)|TSUBAME-KFC-GSIC Center]] by Tokyo Institute of Technology, Made in Japan was with a great advantage to the second, the Top 1 Supercomputer in the World with 4,503.17 MFLOPS/W and 27.78 Total Power (kW)++

Today a new supercomputer, [[L-CSC]] from the [[GSI Helmholtz Center]], Made in Germany emerged as the most energy-efficient (or greenest) supercomputer in the world. The L-CSC cluster was the first and only supercomputer on the list to surpass 5 gigaflops/watt (billions of operations per second per watt). L-CSC is a heterogeneous supercomputer that is powered by Dual Intel Xeon E5-260 and GPU accelerators, namely AMD FirePro™ S9150 GPUs. It marks the first time that a supercomputer using AMD GPUs has held the top spot. Each server has a memory of 256 gigabytes. Connected, the server via an Infiniband FDR network.

He curated the major exhibit "Facing History: The Black Image in American Art 1710-1940" which dealt with the image of African-Americans in American art.

==Early life and education==
Guy C. McElroy was the son of Geraldine (née Woods) and George E. McElroy, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geraldine McElroy  Obituary  - Fairmont, West Virginia - Tributes.com|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Geraldine-McElroy-89243121|website=www.tributes.com|accessdate=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in his native Fairmont, West Virginia McElroy earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from local [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State College]] in 1970. After he earned a master's degree in art history from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1972, he acquired a second Master's in Mass Communications from Boston's [[Emerson College]] in 1975.

He held the position of [[Rockefeller Fellow]] in Museum Studies at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] from 1974 to 1975. He followed that position with several assistant curator roles in West and East Coast public galleries and museums. Beginning in 1978 McElroy spent 10 years at Washington, DC's [[Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site|Bethune Museum-Archive]], first as curator and then as assistant director. It was as adjunct curator of the Corcoran Gallery where he completed his work on "Facing History."

Becoming a quadriplegic after a 1987 New Mexico automobile accident, McElroy began using a wheelchair.

He died at 44, only five months after initial publication of the catalog for "Facing History,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Guy C.|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|last3=Art|first3=Corcoran Gallery of|last4=Museum|first4=Brooklyn|title=Facing history: the Black image in American art, 1710-1940|publisher=Bedford Arts|isbn=9780938491385|page=vi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Facing_history.html?id=1d1PAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" from a pulmonary embolism at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in Washington, DC having nearly completed a Ph.D. in art history from the [[University of Maryland]].

==Facing History==
"Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940," was the first public display by a major museum to showcase depictions of [[African-Americans]] in American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kastor|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Kastor|first2=Elizabeth|title=GUY MCELROY, FACING HIS FUTURE|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/01/14/guy-mcelroy-facing-his-future/77b55f94-9116-4a11-92ff-905e3bc2c852/|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=14 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show examined ways in which American artists "reinforced a number of largely restrictive stereotypes of black identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guy C. McElroy papers 1969-1990|url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20683|website=archives.nypl.org|accessdate=25 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art exhibition]] originally shown from January 13 through March 25, 1990 at the [[Corcoran Gallery]] travelled to the [[Brooklyn Museum]] from April 20 through June 25, 1990.

Both works by approximately 80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BOLLE|first1=SONJA|title=FACING HISTORY  by Guy C. McElroy (Bedford Arts/The Corcoran Gallery of Art: $50; 141 pp.)|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-18/books/bk-1702_1_visual-image|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=18 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; African American and European American artists were featured in the exhibition of drawing, painting and sculpture. In McElroy's view these works depict the attitude of society toward African-Americans through the works themselves and the response they received in the marketplace. The works make overt political statements, as well as, address contemporary issues. Stereotypes, slavery and violence dominate the images. But as McElroy states in the show's catalog:

{{quote frame |quote=Depictions of black people can no longer rely on gross distortions of physiognomy or character to achieve racially motivated humor, but the symbolic power of visual images remains insidious. Jim Crow, Uncle Tom, Mammy, the Comic Darkey and Zip Coon no longer dominate images of African-Americans in painting and sculpture, but their ghosts live on in a host of popular mediums, most notably in the violence of action serials and the stereotyped behavior of television sitcoms.|author=Guy C.

'''''Histopathology''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] covering diagnostic, research, and surgical [[pathology]]. It was established in 1977 and is published monthly by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. It is currently edited by Alastair Burt. Histopathology is an international journal intended to be of practical value to surgical and diagnostic histopathologists, and to investigators of human disease who employ histopathological methods. The primary purpose is to publish advances in pathology, in particular those applicable to clinical practice and contributing to the better understanding of human disease.

Both the number of subscribers and the amount of papers accepted for publication have increased rapidly since Histopathology's launch in 1977. It publishes histopathological material having clinical application in the study of human disease and includes electron microscopic histochemical, immunological and supportive experimental studies where necessary. The readership consists of diagnostic histopathologists and researchers in the clinicopathological field.

[[File:Emblemata 1624.jpg|thumb|275px|Early depiction of a "Dutch telescope" from 1624.]]

The earliest known [[telescope]] appeared in 1608 in the [[Netherlands]] when an [[eyeglass]] maker named [[Hans Lippershey]] tried to obtain a patent on one. Although Lippershey did not receive his patent, news of the new invention soon spread across Europe. The design of these early [[refracting telescope]]s consisted of a convex [[Objective (optics)|objective]] lens and a concave [[eyepiece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] improved on this design the following year and applied it to astronomy. In 1611, [[Johannes Kepler]] described how a far more useful telescope could be made with a convex objective lens and a convex eyepiece lens and by 1655 astronomers such as [[Christiaan Huygens]] were building powerful but unwieldy Keplerian telescopes with compound eyepieces.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the telescope'' Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones Publisher Courier Dover Publications {{ISBN|0-486-43265-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] is credited with building the first reflector in 1668 with a design that incorporated a small flat diagonal mirror to reflect the light to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. [[Laurent Cassegrain]] in 1672 described the design of a reflector with a small convex secondary mirror to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

The [[achromatic lens]], which greatly reduced color aberrations in objective lenses and allowed for shorter and more functional telescopes, first appeared in a 1733 telescope made by [[Chester Moore Hall]], who did not publicize it. [[John Dollond]] learned of Hall's invention&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, D. J.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=97m3IxXmT-oC&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Optical anecdotes]', pp.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Ray N.; '[https://books.google.com/books?id=PuN7l2A2uzQC&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Reflecting Telescope Optics: Basic design theory and its historical development]', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; and began producing telescopes using it in commercial quantities, starting in 1758.

Important developments in reflecting telescopes were [[John Hadley]]'s production of larger [[paraboloid]]al mirrors in 1721; the process of [[silvering]] glass mirrors introduced by [[Léon Foucault]] in 1857;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/inventorbios/39/Jean-Bernard-L-on-Foucault.html |title=Inventor Biographies – Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault Biography (1819–1868) |publisher=madehow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the adoption of long-lasting aluminized coatings on reflector mirrors in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/astronomy/features/amateur/files/p28-4.pdf |title=Bakich sample pages Chapter 2 |page=3 |quote=John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the California Institute of Technology, was one of the first to coat a mirror with aluminum. He did it by thermal vacuum evaporation. The first mirror he aluminized, in 1932, is the earliest known example of a telescope mirror coated by this technique. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ritchey-Chretien]] variant of [[Cassegrain reflector]] was invented around 1910, but not widely adopted until after 1950; many modern telescopes including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] use this design, which gives a wider field of view than a classic Cassegrain.

During the period 1850–1900, reflectors suffered from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and a considerable number of "Great Refractors" were built from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the [[Yerkes Observatory]] refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with glass mirrors were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch (1.5 metre), the 100-inch (2.5 metre) [[Hooker Telescope]] (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) [[Hale telescope]] (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled [[alt-azimuth mount]] in the 1970s and [[active optics]] in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) [[Keck telescopes]] in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the [[ESO]] [[Very Large Telescope]], [[Gemini Observatory]] and [[Subaru Telescope]].

The era of [[radio telescope]]s (along with [[radio astronomy]]) was born with [[Karl Guthe Jansky]]'s [[Serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery of an astronomical radio source in 1931. Many types of telescopes were developed in the 20th century for a wide range of wavelengths from radio to [[gamma-ray telescope|gamma-rays]].  The development of [[space observatories]] after 1960 allowed access
to several bands impossible to observe from the ground, including [[X-rays]] and longer wavelength [[infrared]] bands.

===Invention===
[[File:Lipperhey.jpg|thumb|left|Notes on Hans Lipperhey's unsuccessfully requested a patent on the telescope in 1608]]

The first record of a telescope comes from the Netherlands in 1608. It is in a patent filed by [[Middelburg]] spectacle-maker [[Hans Lippershey]] with the [[States General of the Netherlands]] on 2 October 1608 for his instrument "''for seeing things far away as if they were nearby''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES]&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later another Dutch instrument-maker, [[Jacob Metius]] also applied for a patent. The States General did not award a patent since the knowledge of the device already seemed to be ubiquitous&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bo.astro.it/dip/Museum/english/can_int.html Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna - TELESCOPES "''The request however was turned down, also because other spectacle-makers had made similar claims at the same time''."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"The Hague discussed the patent applications first of Hans Lipperhey of Middelburg, and then of Jacob Metius of Alkmaar... another citizen of Middelburg'' [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/telescope.html galileo.rice.edu '''The Galileo Project &gt; Science &gt; The Telescope''' by Al Van Helden]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Dutch [[government]] awarded Lippershey with a contract for copies of his [[design]].

The original Dutch telescopes were composed of a [[Biconcave|convex]] and a [[Biconcave lens|concave lens]]—telescopes that are constructed this way do not invert the image. Lippershey's original design had only 3x [[magnification]]. Telescopes seem to have been made in the Netherlands in considerable numbers soon after this date of "invention", and rapidly found their way all over Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==== Claims of prior invention ====
[[File:Jaansen Microscope.jpg|thumbnail|right|Reproduction of one of the four optical devices that Zacharias Snijder in 1841 claimed were early telescopes built by [[Zacharias Janssen]]. Its actual function and creator has been disputed over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch biologist and naturalist [[Pieter Harting]] claimed in 1858 that this shorter tube was an early microscope which he also attributed to Janssen, perpetuating the ''Janssen'' claim to both devices.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope p.32-36"/&gt;]]

In 1655 Dutch diplomat [[Willem Boreel|William de Boreel]] tried to solve the mystery of who invented the telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg follow up on Boreel's childhood and early adult recollections of a spectacle maker named "Hans" who he remembered as the inventor of the telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, [[Zacharias Janssen]] invented the telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias and his father, Hans Martens, must have been who he remembered.&lt;ref name="HeldenDupré2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=21–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen invented the telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, [[Hans Lippershey]], was adopted by [[Pierre Borel]] in his 1656 book ''De vero telescopii inventore''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Henry C. ''The History of the Telescope.'' Courier Dover Publications. 1955/2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discrepancies in Boreel's investigation and Zachariassen's testimony (including Zachariassen misrepresenting his date of birth and role in the invention) has led some historians to consider this claim dubious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupré|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&amp;pg=PA36|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|pages=32–36, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Janssen" claim would continue over the years and be added on to with [[Zacharias Snijder]] in 1841 presenting 4 iron tubes with lenses in them claimed to be 1590 examples of Janssen's telescope&lt;ref name="The Origins of the Telescope p.32-36"/&gt; and historian [[Cornelis de Waard]]'s 1906 claim that the man who tried to sell a broken telescope to astronomer [[Simon Marius]] at the 1608 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] must have been Janssen.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Van Helden, Sven Dupré, Rob van Gent, The Origins of the Telescope, Amsterdam University Press - 2010, pages 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1682,&lt;ref&gt;July 26, 1682&lt;/ref&gt; the minutes of the [[Royal Society]] in London [[Robert Hooke]] noted [[Thomas Digges]]' 1571 ''Pantometria'', (a book on measurement, partially based on his father [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]' notes and observations) seemed to support an English claim to the invention of the telescope, describing Leonard as having a ''fare seeing glass'' in the mid 1500s based on an idea by [[Roger Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Usher, Shakespeare and the Dawn of Modern Science, Cambria Press, 2010, page 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biographia Britannica: Or, The Lives of the Most Eminent Persons who Have Flourished in Great Britain and Ireland, from the Earliest Ages, Down to the Present Times, Volume 5, W. Innys - 1760, page 3130&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas described it as "''by proportional Glasses duly situate in convenient angles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered pieces of money with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by some of his friends of purpose upon downs in open fields, but also seven miles off declared what hath been done at that instant in private places''." Comments on the use of proportional or "perspective glass" are also made in the writings of [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] (1575) and  [[William Bourne (mathematician)|William Bourne]] (1585).&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28-29&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne was asked in 1580 to investigate the Diggs device by [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s chief advisor [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]]. Bourne's is the best description of it, and from his writing it seemed to consist of peering into a large curved mirror that reflected the image produced by a large lens.&lt;ref name="Patrick Moore 2012, page 9"&gt;Patrick Moore, Eyes on the Universe: The Story of the Telescope, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2012, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an "Elizabethan Telescope" has been expanded over the years, including astronomer and historian [[Colin Ronan]] concluding in the 1990s that this reflecting/refracting [[telescope]] was built by Leonard Digges between 1540 and 1559.&lt;ref name="chocky.demon.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Satterthwaite |first=Gilbert |year=2002 |work=The Digges Telescope |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |title=Did the reflecting telescope have English origins? |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronan 1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ronan |first=Colin A. |year=1991 |title=Leonard and Thomas Digges |journal=[[Journal of the British Astronomical Association]] |volume=101 |issue=6 |url=http://www.chocky.demon.co.uk/oas/diggeshistory.html |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;{{Cite book |last=Watson |first=Fred |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dD2oE4pvukC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=Leonard+Digges+stargazer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uuobTriVL6LZ0QGeud3KBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=digges&amp;f=false |title=Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope |location=London |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin |pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "backwards" [[reflecting telescope]] would have been unwieldy, it needed very large mirrors and lens to work, the observer had to stand backwards to look at an upside down view, and Bourne noted it had a very narrow field of view making it unsuitable for military purposes.&lt;ref name="Patrick Moore 2012, page 9"/&gt; The optical performance required to see the details of coins lying about in fields, or private activities seven miles away, seems to be far beyond the technology of the time&lt;ref name="watson40"&gt;Fred Watson, (2007), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=BIwrSc6pB4OClQT4zfyxBg Stargazer: The Life and Times of the Telescope]'', page 40.

King, The History of the Telescope, Courier Corporation - 1955, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1959 research paper by Simon de Guilleuma claimed that evidence he had uncovered pointed to the French born spectacle maker [[Juan Roget]] (died before 1624) as another possible builder of an early telescope that predated Hans Lipperhey's patent application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7617426.stm|title=Controversy over telescope origin|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; inventing early telescope-like devices.

==== Spread through Europe ====
Lippershey's application for a patent was mentioned at the end of a diplomatic report on an embassy to Holland from the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] sent by the Siamese king [[Ekathotsarot]]: ''Ambassades du Roy de Siam envoyé à l'Excellence du Prince Maurice, arrivé à La Haye le 10 Septemb. 1608'' (''Embassy of the King of Siam sent to his Excellency Prince Maurice, arrived at The Hague on 10 September 1608''). This report was issued in October 1608 and distributed across Europe, leading to experiments by other scientists, such as the Italian [[Paolo Sarpi]], who received the report in November, and the English mathematician and astronomer [[Thomas Harriot]], who used a six-powered telescope by the summer of 1609 to observe features on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |title=Old Moon Map Corrects History |publisher=News.aol.com |date=2009-01-14 |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119004546/http://news.aol.com/article/old-moon-map-corrects-history/307394 |archivedate=January 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galileo Donato.jpg|thumb|left|200px|19th-century painting depicting [[Galileo Galilei]] displaying his [[telescope]] to [[Leonardo Donato]] in 1609.]]

The Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] was in [[Venice]] in June 1609&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OwOlRPbrZeQC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=Galileo++happened+to+be+in+Venice+Dutch+telescope |title=Galileo at Work |author=Stillman Drake |page=137 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-486-49542-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there heard of the "Dutch perspective glass" by means of which distant objects appeared nearer and larger. Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the first night after his return to [[Padua]] from Venice and made his first telescope the next day by fitting a convex lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice where he communicated the details of his invention to the public and presented the instrument itself to the [[Doge of Venice|doge]] [[Leonardo Donato]], who was sitting in full council. The [[senate]] in return settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary.

[[File:Galileo-picture.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Galileo Galilei]].]]

Galileo spent his time to improving the telescope, producing telescopes of increased power. His first telescope had a 3x magnification, but he soon made instruments which magnified 8x and finally, one nearly a meter long with a 37mm objective (which he would stop down to 16mm or 12mm) and a 23x magnification.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Quinn, Stargazing with Early Astronomer Galileo Galilei, Sky &amp; Telescope, July 31, 2008 [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/stargazing-with-galileo/]&lt;/ref&gt; With this last instrument he began a series of astronomical observations in October or November 1609, discovering the [[Galilean moon|satellites]] of [[Jupiter]], hills and valleys on the [[Moon]], the phases of [[Venus]]&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palmieri |first1=Paolo |title=Galileo and the discovery of the phases of Venus |journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]] |date=2001 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=109–129 |bibcode=2001JHA....32..109P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observed [[sunspot|spots on the sun]] (using the projection method rather than direct observation). Galileo noted that the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, rotation of the [[Sun]] and the tilted path its spots followed for part of the year pointed to the validity of the sun-centered [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] over other [[Geocentric model|Earth-centered systems]] such as the one proposed by [[Ptolemy]]. Galileo's instrument was the first to be given the name "telescope". The name was invented by the Greek poet/theologian [[Giovanni Demisiani]] at a banquet held on April 14, 1611 by Prince [[Federico Cesi]] to make [[Galileo Galilei]] a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward, ''The Naming of the Telescope'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; The word was created from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tele'' = 'far' and ''skopein'' = 'to look or see'; ''teleskopos'' = 'far-seeing'.

These observations, together with Galileo's improvement of the instrument, led to the adoption of the name of the [[Galilean telescope]] for these early forms of telescope that employed a [[negative lens]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;This paragraph is adapted from the 1888 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further refinements ===
==== Refracting telescopes ====
[[Johannes Kepler]] first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his ''Catoptrics'' (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope of this form was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]] who gives a description of it in his ''Rosa Ursina'' (1630).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

[[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] was the first who commanded a chief advantage of the form of telescope suggested by Kepler: that a small material object could be placed at the common [[focal plane]] of the objective and the eyepiece. This led to his invention of the [[micrometer]], and his application of telescopic sights to precision astronomical instruments. It was not till about the middle of the 17th century that Kepler's telescope came into general use: not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but because its [[field of view]] was much larger than in the [[Galilean telescope]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The first powerful telescopes of Keplerian construction were made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] after much labor—in which his brother assisted him. With one of these: an objective diameter of {{convert|2.24|in|mm}} and a {{convert|12|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/bigtel/LargestTelescope.html |title=Largest optical telescopes of the world |author=Paul Schlyter |publisher=Stjarnhimlen.se |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discovered the brightest of Saturn's satellites ([[Titan (moon)|Titan]]) in 1655; in 1659, he published his "''Systema Saturnium''" which, for the first time, gave a true explanation of Saturn's [[planetary ring|ring]]—founded on observations made with the same instrument.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

===== Long focal length refractors =====
[[File:Houghton Typ 620.73.451 - Johannes Hevelius, Machinae coelestis, 1673.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut illustration of a {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} focal length Keplerian astronomical refracting telescope built by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. From his book, "''Machina coelestis''" (first part), published in 1673.]]

The [[sharpness (visual)|sharpness]] of the image in Kepler's telescope was limited by the [[chromatic aberration]] introduced by the non-uniform refractive properties of the objective lens. The only way to overcome this limitation at high magnifying powers was to create objectives with very long focal lengths. [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] discovered [[Saturn's]] fifth satellite ([[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]) in 1672 with a telescope {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. Astronomers such as [[Johannes Hevelius]] were constructing telescopes with focal lengths as long as {{convert|150|ft|m}}. Besides having really long tubes these telescopes needed scaffolding or long masts and cranes to hold them up. Their value as research tools was minimal since the telescope's frame "tube" flexed and vibrated in the slightest breeze and sometimes collapsed altogether.&lt;ref name="AIP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cartage"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |publisher=Cartage |work=History of Telescopes |title=How Telescopes Improved |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311032203/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Astronomy/Equipementdevices/Telescope/Historyoftelescope/howtelescopeimproved/howtelescopeimproved.htm |archivedate=2009-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Aerial telescopes =====
{{Main|Aerial telescope}}
In some of the very long refracting telescopes constructed after 1675, no tube was employed at all. The objective was mounted on a swiveling ball-joint on top of a pole, tree, or any available tall structure and aimed by means of string or connecting rod. The eyepiece was handheld or mounted on a stand at the focus, and the image was found by trial and error. These were consequently termed [[aerial telescope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga/astronomyclubaugusta/History/telescope.html |title=The Telescope |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been attributed to [[Christiaan Huygens]] and his brother [[Constantijn Huygens, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="AIP"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-first-telescopes.htm | work = Cosmic Journey: A History of Scientific Cosmology | title = The First Telescopes | publisher = Center for History of Physics, a Division of the American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Christiaan+Huygens+Aerial+telescope | title = The history of the telescope | first = Henry C. | last = King | year = 2003 | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | isbn = 978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not clear that they invented it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/christianhuygens029504mbp/christianhuygens029504mbp_djvu.txt | first = A.

Telescopes of such great length were naturally difficult to use and must have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of the observers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Aerial telescopes were employed by several other astronomers. Cassini discovered Saturn's third and fourth satellites in 1684 with aerial telescope objectives made by [[Giuseppe Campani]] that were {{convert|100|and|136|ft|m|abbr=on}} in focal length.

==== Reflecting telescopes ====
{{See also|Reflecting telescope}}

The ability of a [[curved mirror]] to form an image may have been known since the time of [[Euclid]]&lt;ref&gt;''Reading Euclid'' by J. B. Calvert, 2000 [http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/classics/nugreek/contents.htm Duke U.] accessed 23 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and had been extensively studied by [[Alhazen]] in the 11th century. Galileo, [[Giovanni Francesco Sagredo]], and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=intitle:Stargazer+digges+coins#PPA108,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=108 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Zucchi]], an Italian Jesuit astronomer and physicist, wrote in his book ''Optica philosophia'' of 1652 that he tried replacing the lens of a refracting telescope with a bronze concave mirror in 1616. Zucchi tried looking into the mirror with a hand held concave lens but did not get a satisfactory image, possibly due to the poor quality of the mirror, the angle it was tilted at, or the fact that his head partially obstructed the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2LZZginzib4C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Niccol%C3%B2+Zucchi#PPA109,M1 |title=Stargazer |author=Fred Watson |page=109 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-1-74176-392-8 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope gregory.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Gregorian telescope]].]]

In 1636 [[Marin Mersenne]] proposed a telescope consisting of a paraboloidal primary mirror and a paraboloidal secondary mirror bouncing the image through a hole in the primary, solving the problem of viewing the image.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T4-GErgSbU0C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=Marin+Mersenne+reflecting+telescope&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GGocBEbf9P&amp;sig=Bmk8GLC46HdSoeYKq6wyz3jaoZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result#PPA88,M1] ''[[Mirror Mirror: A History of the Human Love Affair With Reflection]]'' by [[Mark Pendergrast]] Page 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] went into further detail in his book ''Optica Promota'' (1663), pointing out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was shaped like the part of a [[conic section]], would correct [[spherical aberration]] as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refractors. The design he came up with bears his name: the "[[Gregorian telescope]]"; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas and after some fruitless attempts, was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope into practical use.

[[File:LaNature1873 coupe telescope foucault.png|thumb|right|350px|Light path in a [[Newtonian telescope]].]]

[[File:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|A replica of Newton's second reflecting telescope which was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in 1672.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;dq=history+of+the+telescope&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA74,M1 |title=The History of the Telescope |author=Henry C.

In 1666 [[Isaac Newton]], based on his theories of refraction and color, perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope were due more to a lens's varying refraction of light of different colors than to a lens's imperfect shape. He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations, although he incorrectly concluded from some rough experiments&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''Optics'', bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3&lt;/ref&gt; that ''all'' refracting substances would diverge the prismatic colors in a constant proportion to their mean refraction. From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on Optics'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's experiments with mirrors showed that they did not suffer from the chromatic errors of lenses, for all colors of light the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] reflected in a mirror was equal to the [[angle of reflection]], so as a proof to his theories Newton set out to build a reflecting telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=Isaac+Newton+demonstration+reflecting+telescope+in#PPA168,M1 |title=Isaac Newton By Michael White |page=170 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01|isbn=978-0-7382-0143-6 |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton completed his [[Newton's Reflector|first telescope]] in 1668 and it is the earliest known functional reflecting telescope.&lt;ref name="mymathdone.com"&gt;[http://www.mymathdone.com/isaac-newton-adventurer-in-thought/ '''Isaac Newton: adventurer in thought''', by Alfred Rupert Hall, page 67]&lt;/ref&gt;  After much experiment, he chose an [[alloy]] ([[speculum metal]]) of [[tin]] and [[copper]] as the most suitable material for his [[Objective (optics)|objective]]  mirror. He later devised means for grinding and polishing them, but chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a "''Newtonian telescope''", a secondary "diagonal" mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90° angle to an [[eyepiece]] mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, [[Telescope mount|mount]], and fittings. Newton's first compact reflecting telescope had a mirror diameter of 1.3&amp;nbsp;inches and a [[F-number#Focal ratio in telescopes|focal ratio]] of f/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telescope-optics.net/reflecting.htm |title=Reflecting telescopes: Newtonian, two- and three-mirror systems |publisher=Telescope-optics.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it he found that he could see the four [[Galilean moons]] of [[Jupiter]] and the [[Venus#Observation|crescent phase of the planet Venus]]. Encouraged by this success, he made a second telescope with a magnifying power of 38x which he presented to the [[Royal Society of London]] in December 1672. This type of telescope is still called a [[Newtonian telescope]].

[[File:Lanature1873 telescope cassegrain.png|thumb|left|350px|Light path in a [[Cassegrain telescope]].]]

A third form of reflecting telescope, the "[[Cassegrain reflector]]" was devised in 1672 by [[Laurent Cassegrain]]. The telescope had a small convex [[hyperboloid]]al secondary mirror placed near the prime focus to reflect light through a central hole in the main mirror.

No further practical advance appears to have been made in the design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until [[John Hadley]] (best known as the inventor of the [[octant (instrument)|octant]]) developed ways to make precision aspheric and [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amazing-space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations//groundup/lesson/scopes/hadley/index.php |title=Hadley’s Reflector |publisher=amazing-space.stsci.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter, {{convert|62+3/4|in|cm|adj=on}} focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by [[James Pound]] and [[James Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;Pound reported upon it in ''Phil. Trans.'', 1723, No. 378, p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a {{convert|7.5|in|mm}} diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.

Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]], having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing speculum metal, succeeded in producing large reflecting telescopes of their own, one of which had a focal length of {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}. These methods of fabricating mirrors were passed on by Molyneux to two London opticians —Scarlet and Hearn— who started a business manufacturing telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robert, ''Compleat system of opticks in four books'', bk, iii. ch. I. (Cambridge, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British mathematician, optician [[James Short (mathematician)|James Short]] began experimenting with building telescopes based on Gregory's designs in the 1730s. He first tried making his mirrors out of glass as suggested by Gregory, but he later switched to speculum metal mirrors creating Gregorian telescopes with original designers [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] and [[elliptic]] figures. Short then adopted telescope-making as his profession which he practised first in Edinburgh, and afterward in London. All Short's telescopes were of the Gregorian form. Short died in London in 1768, having made a considerable fortune selling telescopes.

Since speculum metal mirror secondaries or diagonal mirrors greatly reduced the light that reached the eyepiece, several reflecting telescope designers tried to do away with them. In 1762 [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] presented a reflecting telescope before the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] forum. It had its primary mirror tilted at four degrees to telescope's axis so the image could be viewed via an eyepiece mounted at the front of the telescope tube without the observer's head blocking the incoming light. This innovation was not published until 1827, so this type came to be called the Herschelian telescope after a similar design by [[William Herschel]].&lt;ref&gt;"On an optic pipe improvement" — Lomonosov M.V.

[[File:40 foot telescope 120 cm 48 inch reflecting telescope William Herschel.png|thumb|left|[[William Herschel]]'s {{convert|49|in|mm|adj=on}} "40-foot" telescope of 1789. Illustration from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition]] published in 1797.]]

About the year 1774 William Herschel (then a teacher of music in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[England]]) began to occupy his leisure hours with the construction of reflector telescope mirrors, finally devoted himself entirely to their construction and use in astronomical research. In 1778, he selected a {{convert|6+1/4|in|cm|adj=on}} reflector mirror (the best of some 400 telescope mirrors which he had made) and with it, built a {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} focal length telescope. Using this telescope, he made his early brilliant astronomical discoveries. In 1783, Herschel completed a reflector of approximately {{convert|18|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} focal length. He observed the heavens with this telescope for some twenty years, replacing the mirror several times. In 1789 Herschel finished building his largest reflecting telescope with a mirror of {{convert|49|in|cm}} and a focal length of {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}, (commonly known as his [[40-foot telescope]]) at his new home, at [[Observatory House]] in [[Slough]], England. To cut down on the light loss from the poor reflectivity of the speculum mirrors of that day, Herschel eliminated the small diagonal mirror from his design and tilted his primary mirror so he could view the formed image directly. This design has come to be called the [[Reflecting telescope#Reflecting telescope designs|Herschelian telescope]]. He discovered Saturn's sixth known moon, [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], the first night he used it (August 28, 1789), and on September 17, its seventh known moon, Mimas. This telescope was world's largest telescope for over 50 years. However, this large scope was difficult to handle and thus less used than his favorite 18.7-inch reflector.

In 1845 [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse]] built his {{convert|72|in|cm|adj=on}} Newtonian reflector called the "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]" with which he discovered the spiral form of [[galaxies]].

All of these larger reflectors suffered from the poor reflectivity and fast tarnishing nature of their speculum metal mirrors. This meant they need more than one mirror per telescope since mirrors had to be frequently removed and re-polished. This was time consuming since the polishing process could change the curve of the mirror so it usually had to be "[[Figuring|re-figured]]" to the correct shape.

==== Achromatic refracting telescopes ====
{{See also|Achromatic lens}}
[[File:Achromat doublet en.svg|thumb|Light path through an [[achromatic lens]].]]

From the time of the invention of the first refracting telescopes it was generally supposed that chromatic errors seen in lenses simply arose from errors in the spherical figure of their surfaces. Opticians tried to construct lenses of varying forms of curvature to correct these errors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Isaac Newton discovered in 1666 that chromatic colors actually arose from the un-even refraction of light as it passed through the glass medium. This led opticians to experiment with lenses constructed of more than one type of glass in an attempt to canceling the errors produced by each type of glass. It was hoped that this would create an "[[achromatic lens]]"; a lens that would focus all colors to a single point, and produce instruments of much shorter focal length.

The first person who succeeded in making a practical achromatic refracting telescope was [[Chester Moore Hall]] from [[Essex, England]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He argued that the different humours of the human eye refract rays of light to produce an image on the [[retina]] which is free from color, and he reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by combining lenses composed of different refracting media. After devoting some time to the inquiry he found that by combining two lenses formed of different kinds of glass, he could make an achromatic lens where the effects of the unequal refractions of two colors of light (red and blue) was corrected. In 1733, he succeeded in constructing telescope lenses which exhibited much reduced [[chromatic aberration]]. One of his instruments had an objective measuring {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} with a relatively short focal length of {{convert|20|in|cm}}.

Hall was a man of independent means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to [[John Dollond]] (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by [[Lord Mansfield]] that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, but the one who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.

In 1747, [[Leonhard Euler]] sent to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] a paper in which he tried to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope [[Objective (optics)|objective]]. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of lenses of glass and water.

All of Euler's efforts to produce an actual objective of this construction were fruitless—a failure which he attributed solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses that worked precisely to the requisite curves.&lt;ref&gt;''Mem. Acad. Berlin'', 1753.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dollond]] agreed with the accuracy of Euler's analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it was purely a theoretical assumption: that the theory was opposed to the results of Newton's [[Scientific method|experiments]] on the refraction of light, and that it was impossible to determine a [[physical law]] from analytical reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1753, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, Euler sent to the Berlin Academy a further paper in which starting from the hypothesis that light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies—and that the difference of color of light is due to the greater or lesser [[electromagnetic spectrum|frequency]] of these vibrations in a given time— he deduced his previous results. He did not doubt the accuracy of Newton's experiments quoted by Dollond.

Dollond did not reply to this, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a paper by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] mathematician and astronomer, [[Samuel Klingenstierna]], which led him to doubt the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations (fully appreciated by Dollond) that the results of Newton's experiments could not be brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.

[[File:Göttingen-Dollond-Teleskop.JPG|thumb|right|Dollond telescope.]]

As a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment: he confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered a difference far beyond his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect to the [[refraction|divergence]] of colors, and was thus rapidly led to the construction of lenses in which first the chromatic aberration—and afterwards—the spherical aberration were corrected.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Phil. Trans.'', 1758, p. 733&lt;/ref&gt;

Dollond was aware of the conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes, but relied on the accuracy of experiments made by Newton. His writings show that with the exception of his [[Courage|bravado]], he would have arrived sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. Dollond's paper&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; recounts the successive steps by which he arrived at his discovery independently of Hall's earlier invention—and the logical processes by which these steps were suggested to his mind.

In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) introduced the triple objective, which consisted of a combination of two convex lenses of crown glass with a concave [[Flint glass|flint]] lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the diameter and light gathering power of the lenses found in the achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered prizes for large perfect disks of optical flint glass.

The difficulties with the impractical metal mirrors of reflecting telescopes led to the construction of large refracting telescopes. By 1866 refracting telescopes had reached {{convert|18|in|cm}} in aperture with many larger "''[[Great refractor]]s''" being built in the mid to late 19th century. In 1897, the refractor reached its maximum practical limit in a research telescope with the construction of the [[Yerkes Observatory]]s' {{convert|40|in|cm|adj=on}} refractor (although a larger refractor [[Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900]] with an objective of {{convert|49.2|in|m}} diameter was temporarily exhibited at the [[Paris 1900 Exposition]]). No larger refractors could be built because of [[gravity]]'s effect on the lens. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OJclbOHqrD0C&amp;pg=PT532&amp;lpg=PT532&amp;dq=the+largest+telescope+lens+sag |title=Physics Demystified |author=Stan Gibilisco |isbn=0-07-138201-1 |page=515 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2002-08-01|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large reflecting telescopes ===
{{See also|List of largest optical telescopes historically}}
[[File:Palomar arp 600pix.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]]]]

In 1856–57, [[Karl August von Steinheil]] and [[Léon Foucault]] introduced a process of depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it had the advantage of being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on glass mirror reflecting telescopes were built.

The beginning of the 20th century saw construction of the first of the "modern" large research reflectors, designed for precision photographic imaging and located at remote high altitude clear sky locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |title=Building the 60-inch Telescope |author=Mike Simmons |origyear=Written in 1984 |date=2008&lt;!--Updated in--&gt; |publisher=Mtwilson.edu |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805001558/http://www.mtwilson.edu/Simmons3.php |archivedate=2013-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[60-inch Hale telescope]] of 1908, and the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] in 1917, both located at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=1956ASPL....7..249P |title=Pettit, E., Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets, Vol. 7 |journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets |volume=7 |page=249 |publisher=Articles.adsabs.harvard.edu |date= |author1=Pettit |first1=Edison |year=1956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These and other telescopes of this size had to have provisions to allow for the removal of their main mirrors for re-silvering every few months. John Donavan Strong, a young physicist at the [[California Institute of Technology]], developed a technique for coating a mirror with a much longer lasting aluminum coating using thermal [[vacuum evaporation]]. In 1932, he became the first person to "aluminize" a mirror; three years later the {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} and {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} telescopes became the first large astronomical telescopes to have their mirrors aluminized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |title=New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology - "Resurfacing the {{convert|100|in|mm|adj=on}} Telescope" by George Zamora |publisher=nmt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013030537/http://www.nmt.edu/mainpage/news/2001/10aug03.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1948 saw the completion of the {{convert|200|in|cm|adj=on}} [[Hale telescope|Hale reflector]] at [[Palomar Observatory|Mount Palomar]] which was the largest telescope in the world up until the completion of the massive {{convert|605|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[BTA-6]] in Russia twenty-seven years later. The Hale reflector introduced several technical innovations used in future telescopes, including [[hydrostatic bearings]] for very low friction, the [[Serrurier truss]] for equal deflections of the two mirrors as the tube sags under gravity, and the use of [[Pyrex]] low-expansion glass for the mirrors. The arrival of substantially larger telescopes had to await the introduction of methods other than the rigidity of glass to maintain the proper shape of the mirror.

==== Active and adaptive optics ====
{{See also|Adaptive optics|List of largest optical reflecting telescopes}}

The 1980s saw the introduction of two new technologies for building larger telescopes and improving image quality,
known as [[active optics]] and [[adaptive optics]]. In active optics, an image analyser senses the aberrations of a star image
a few times per minute, and a computer adjusts many support forces on the primary mirror and the location of the secondary mirror
to maintain the optics in optimal shape and alignment. This is too slow to correct for atmospheric blurring effects, but enables the use of thin single mirrors up to 8&amp;nbsp;m diameter, or even larger segmented mirrors. This method was pioneered by the ESO [[New Technology Telescope]] in the late 1980s.

The 1990s saw a new generation of giant telescopes appear using active optics, beginning with the construction of the first of the two {{convert|10|m|in|abbr=on}} [[Keck telescope]]s in 1993. Other giant telescopes built since then include: the two [[Gemini telescope]]s, the four separate telescopes of the [[Very Large Telescope]], and the [[Large Binocular Telescope]].

[[File:ESO Very Large Telescope.jpg|thumb|[[ESO]]'s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] boasts advanced [[adaptive optics]] systems, which counteract the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere.]]

Adaptive optics uses a similar principle, but applying corrections several hundred times per second to
compensate the effects of rapidly changing optical distortion due to the motion of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and then compensating for them by rapid changes of [[actuator]]s applied to a small deformable mirror or with a [[liquid crystal]] array filter. AO was first envisioned by [[Horace W. Babcock]] in 1953, but did not come into common usage in astronomical telescopes until advances in computer and detector technology during the 1990s made it possible to calculate the compensation needed in [[Real-time computing|real time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Telescopes Have Grown from Huge to Humongous [Slide Show]|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/telescopes-have-grown-from-huge-to-humongous-slide-show/|website = www.scientificamerican.com|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adaptive optics, the high-speed corrections needed mean that a fairly bright star is needed very close to the target of interest (or an artificial star is created by a laser). Also, with a single star or laser the corrections are only effective over a very narrow field (tens of arcsec), and current systems operating on several 8-10m telescopes work mainly in near-infrared wavelengths for single-object observations.

Developments of adaptive optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above kiloHertz rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these are currently in progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.

== Other wavelengths ==
The twentieth century saw the construction of telescopes which could produce images using wavelengths other than [[visible light]] starting in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered astronomical objects gave off radio emissions; this prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] from radio to [[gamma-rays]].

=== Radio telescopes ===
{{See also|Radio telescope|Radio astronomy}}
[[File:Lovell Telescope 2.jpg|thumb|The {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} Lovell radio telescope at [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory.]]

Radio astronomy began in 1931 when [[Karl Jansky]] discovered that the [[Milky Way]] was a source of radio emission while doing research on terrestrial static with a direction antenna. Building on Jansky's work, [[Grote Reber]] built a more sophisticated purpose-built radio telescope in 1937, with a {{convert|31.4|ft|m|adj=on}} dish; using this, he discovered various unexplained radio sources in the sky. Interest in radio astronomy grew after the Second World War when much larger dishes were built including: the {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Jodrell bank]] telescope (1957), the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Green Bank Telescope]] (1962), and the {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Effelsberg]] telescope (1971). The huge {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Arecibo telescope]] (1963) is so large that it is fixed into a natural depression in the ground; the central antenna can be steered to allow the telescope to study objects up to twenty degrees from the [[zenith]]. However, not every radio telescope is of the dish type. For example, the [[Mills Cross Telescope]] (1954) was an early example of an array which used two perpendicular lines of antennae {{convert|1500|ft|m}} in length to survey the sky.

High-energy radio waves are known as [[microwaves]] and this has been an important area of astronomy ever since the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964. Many ground-based [[radio telescopes]] can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.

Because radio telescopes have low resolution, they were the first instruments to use [[interferometry]] allowing two or more widely separated instruments to simultaneously observe the same source. [[Very long baseline interferometry]] extended the technique over thousands of kilometers and allowed resolutions down to a few [[arcseconds|milli-arcseconds]].

A telescope like the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (active since 2006) observes from {{convert|0.85|to|4|mm|um|abbr=on}}, bridging between the far-infrared/[[submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter telescopes]] and longer wavelength radio telescopes including the microwave band from about {{convert|1|mm|um|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|mm|m|abbr=on}} in wavelength.

=== Infrared telescopes (700 nm/ 0.7 µm – 1000 µm/1 mm) ===
{{See also|Infrared telescope|Infrared astronomy|Far-infrared astronomy}}
Although most [[infrared]] radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, infrared astronomy at certain wavelengths can be conducted on high mountains where there is little absorption by atmospheric [[water vapor]]. Ever since suitable detectors became available, most optical telescopes at high-altitudes have been able to image at infrared wavelengths. Some telescopes such as the {{convert|3.8|m|in|adj=on}} [[UKIRT]], and the {{convert|3|m|in|adj=on}} [[NASA Infrared Telescope Facility|IRTF]] — both on [[Mauna Kea]] — are dedicated infrared telescopes. The launch of the [[IRAS]] satellite in 1983 revolutionized infrared astronomy from space. This reflecting telescope which had a {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror, operated for nine months until its supply of coolant ([[liquid helium]]) ran out. It surveyed the entire sky detecting 245,000 infrared sources—more than 100 times the number previously known.

=== Ultra-violet telescopes (10 nm – 400 nm) ===
{{See also|Ultraviolet astronomy}}
Although optical telescopes can image the near ultraviolet, the [[ozone layer]] in the [[stratosphere]] absorbs [[ultraviolet]] radiation shorter than 300&amp;nbsp;nm so most ultra-violet astronomy is conducted with satellites. Ultraviolet telescopes resemble optical telescopes, but conventional [[aluminium]]-coated mirrors cannot be used and alternative coatings such as [[magnesium fluoride]] or [[lithium fluoride]] are used instead. The [[Orbiting Solar Observatory]] satellite carried out observations in the ultra-violet as early as 1962. The [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1978) systematically surveyed the sky for eighteen years, using a {{convert|45|cm|in|adj=on}} aperture telescope with two [[spectroscope]]s. Extreme-ultraviolet astronomy (10–100&amp;nbsp;nm) is a discipline in its own right and involves many of the techniques of X-ray astronomy; the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer]] (1992) was a satellite operating at these wavelengths.

=== X-ray telescopes (0.01 nm – 10 nm) ===
{{See also|X-ray telescope|X-ray astronomy}}
[[X-rays]] from space do not reach the Earth's surface so X-ray astronomy has to be conducted above the Earth's atmosphere. The first X-ray experiments were conducted on [[sub-orbital]] [[rocket]] flights which enabled the first detection of X-rays from the [[Sun]] (1948) and the first galactic X-ray sources: [[Scorpius X-1]] (June 1962) and the [[Crab Nebula]] (October 1962). Since then, X-ray telescopes ([[Wolter telescope]]s) have been built using nested grazing-incidence mirrors which deflect X-rays to a detector. Some of the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory|OAO satellites]] conducted X-ray astronomy in the late 1960s, but the first dedicated X-ray satellite was the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] (1970) which discovered 300 sources. More recent X-ray satellites include: the [[EXOSAT]] (1983), [[ROSAT]] (1990), [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] (1999), and [[XMM-Newton|Newton]] (1999).

=== Gamma-ray telescopes (less than 0.01 nm) ===
{{See also|Gamma-ray astronomy}}
[[Gamma rays]] are absorbed high in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with [[satellites]]. Gamma-ray telescopes use [[scintillation counters]], [[spark chamber]]s and more recently, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were [[balloon]]-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with the launch of the [[OSO 3]] satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were [[Second Small Astronomy Satellite|SAS B]] (1972) and [[Cos-B|Cos B]] (1975). The [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200&amp;nbsp;GeV) can be detected from the ground via the [[Cerenkov radiation]] produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the [[HEGRA]] (1987), [[STACEE]] (2001), [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|HESS]] (2003), and [[MAGIC (telescope)|MAGIC]] (2004).

== Interferometric telescopes ==
{{See also|Astronomical interferometry}}

In 1868, [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Fizeau]] noted that the purpose of the arrangement of mirrors or glass lenses in a conventional telescope was simply to provide an approximation to a [[Fourier transform]] of the optical wave field entering the telescope. As this mathematical transformation was well understood and could be performed mathematically on paper, he noted that by using an array of small instruments it would be possible to measure the diameter of a star with the same precision as a single telescope which was as large as the whole array— a technique which later became known as [[astronomical interferometry]]. It was not until 1891 that [[Albert A. Michelson]] successfully used this technique for the measurement of astronomical angular diameters: the diameters of Jupiter's satellites (Michelson 1891). Thirty years later, a direct interferometric measurement of a stellar diameter was finally realized by Michelson &amp; [[Francis G. Pease]] (1921) which was applied by their 20&amp;nbsp;ft (6.1 m) interferometer mounted on the [[Hooker telescope|100 inch Hooker Telescope]] on Mount Wilson.

The next major development came in 1946 when [[Martin Ryle|Ryle]] and Vonberg (Ryle and Vonberg 1946) located a number of new cosmic radio sources by constructing a radio analogue of the [[Michelson interferometer]]. The signals from two radio antennas were added electronically to produce interference. Ryle and Vonberg's telescope used the rotation of the Earth to scan the sky in one dimension. With the development of larger arrays and of computers which could rapidly perform the necessary Fourier transforms, the first [[aperture synthesis]] imaging instruments were soon developed which could obtain high resolution images without the need of a giant parabolic reflector to perform the Fourier transform. This technique is now used in most radio astronomy observations. Radio astronomers soon developed the [[closure phase|mathematical methods]] to perform [[aperture synthesis]] Fourier imaging using much larger arrays of telescopes —often spread across more than one continent. In the 1980s, the [[aperture synthesis]] technique was extended to visible light as well as infrared astronomy, providing the first very high resolution optical and infrared images of nearby stars.

In 1995 this imaging technique was demonstrated on [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|an array of separate optical telescopes]] for the first time, allowing a further improvement in resolution, and also allowing even higher resolution [https://web.archive.org/web/19971021083400/http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/telescopes/coast/astronomy.html#supergiants02-04 imaging of stellar surfaces]. The same techniques have now been applied at a number of other astronomical telescope arrays including: the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]], the [[CHARA array]], and the [[Infrared Optical Telescope Array|IOTA]] array. A detailed description of the development of astronomical optical interferometry can be found here [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/2309/page1.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:32:14].

In 2008, [[Max Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] proposed a "[[Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]]" design in which the lenses and mirrors could be dispensed with altogether when computers become fast enough to perform all the necessary transforms.

== In Asian culture ==
In traditional [[Bali]]nese culture, it was{{when|date=December 2013}} common for a set of [[twin]]s of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between [[Cultural heritage|descent]] and affinity in Balinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin incest was a common feature of Balinese mythology. As in many other mythologies, the Balinese [[deities]] frequently marry their siblings without any of the incest-related issues faced by similarly-situated human couples.

This was commonplace in [[Southeast Asia]]n [[creation myth]]s which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child(ren), but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Errington, Atkinson |first=Shelley, Jane Monnig|title=Power and Difference: Gender in Island Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1781-8|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] mythology, Malakás ("strong") and Magandá ("beautiful"), the first humans on earth, were fraternal twins born of the same bamboo stalk.

An old Japanese myth says that if two [[star-crossed lovers]] commit [[Suicide pact|dual suicide]], they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as fraternal twins.

== In European culture ==
Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and a feature in some [[Greek mythology]], such as the story of [[Byblis]] and [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]]. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese [[Ramayana]], and some scholars have speculated an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme also appears in [[English literature]], such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in [[Delarivier Manley]]'s ''The New Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen|title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684-1814|year=2003|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4|pages=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heN14DHX_IIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that "most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixler |first=Ray H. |date=August 1983 |title=Homosexual Twin Incest Avoidance |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1080/00224498309551190  |jstor=3812342}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study drew on [[Edvard Westermarck]]'s [[Westermarck effect|hypothesis]] that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, Edvard]] (1922). ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a [[House of Lords]] debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parted-at-birth twins 'married' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7182817.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely publicised in the British press,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/shock-for-the-married-couple-who-discovered-they-are-twins-separated-at-birth-6682411.html|title=Shock for the married couple who discovered they are twins separated|last=|first=|date=2008-01-11|website=|publisher=The Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its truthfulness was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech identical twins Michal and Radek Cuma are male pornographic actors who in 2009 began having sex together in video performances as "Milo and Elijah Peters". They consider themselves both brothers and romantic partners, and report that, outside their video performances with other actors, they have sex solely with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Rogers|title=Gay Porn's Most Shocking Taboo|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/21/twincest/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jantar Mantar observatory in Delhi in 1858.jpg|thumb|250px|The Jantar Mantar in 1858, damaged by fighting during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].]]

'''Jantar Mantar'''  is located in the modern city of New Delhi. It consists of 13 architectural [[astronomical|astronomy]] instruments. The site is one of five built by [[Maharaja]] [[Jai Singh II]] of [[Jaipur]], from 1723 onwards, as he was given by [[Mughal emperor]] [[Muhammad Shah]] the task of revising the calendar and astronomical tables.  There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the [[Jantar Mantar]] observatory in [[New Delhi]] that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710.  Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction.

The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified as [[astronomy]].

Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1867. The Ram Yantra, the Samrat Yantra, the Jayprakash Yantra and the Mishra Yantras are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar.

==Purpose of individual structures==

The 4 distinct instruments within the observatory of [[Jantar Mantar]] in [[New Delhi]]: the Samrat Yantra, the Jayaprakash, Rama Yantra and the [[Misra Yantra]].

* '''Samrat Yantra''': The Samrat Yantra, or Supreme Instrument, is a giant triangle that is basically an equal hour sundial.  It is 70 feet high, 114 feet long at the base, and 10 feet thick.  It has a {{convert|128|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} hypotenuse that is parallel to the Earth's axis and points toward the [[North Pole]].  On either side of the triangle is a quadrant with graduations indicating hours, minutes, and seconds.  At the time of the Samrat Yantra's construction, sundials already existed, but the Samrat Yantra turned the basic sundial into a precision tool for measuring declination and other related coordinates of various heavenly bodies.
* '''Jayaprakash Yantra''': The Jayaprakash consists of hollowed out hemispheres with markings on their concave surfaces. Crosswires were stretched between points on their rim.  From inside the [[Ram (building)|Ram]], an observer could align the position of a star with various markings or a window's edge.
*'''Rama Yantra''': Two large cylindrical structures with open top, used to measure the altitude of stars based on the latitude and the longitude on the earth.
* '''Misra Yantra''': The [[Misra Yantra]] (literally mixed instrument) is a composite of 5 instruments designed as a tool to determine the shortest and longest days of the year. It could also be used to indicate the exact moment of noon in various cities and locations regardless of their distance from Delhi. The Mishra yantras were able to indicate when it was noon in various cities all over the world and was the only structure in the observatory not invented by [[Jai Singh II]].

==Other observatories==
Between 1727 and 1734 [[Jai Singh II]] built five similar observatories in west-central India, all known by the name Jantar Mantar. They are located at
* [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jaipur]], 
* [[Ujjain]], 
* [[Mathura]], and 
* [[Jantar Mantar, Varanasi|Varanasi]]. 
While the purpose of the Jantar Mantars was astronomy and astrology ([[Jyotish]]), they are also a major tourist attraction and a significant monument of the history of astronomy.

As a trend "Land art" expanded boundaries of art by the materials used and the siting of the works. The materials used were often the materials of the Earth including for instance the soil and rocks and vegetation and water found on-site, and the siting of the works were often distant from population centers. Though sometimes fairly inaccessible, photo documentation was commonly brought back to the urban art gallery.&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mymodernmet.com/andy-goldsworthy-land-art/ http://mymodernmet.com] Unexpected Land Art Beautifully Formed in Nature.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="la"&gt;[http://www.land-arts.com/Land_art.html http://www.land-arts.com] Land art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns of the art movement centered around rejection of the commercialization of art-making and enthusiasm with an emergent ecological movement. The art movement coincided with the popularity of the rejection of urban living and its counterpart, an enthusiasm for that which is rural. Included in these inclinations were spiritual yearnings concerning the planet [[Earth]] as home to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;ArtSpeak, A Guide to Contemporary Ideas, Movements, and Buzzwords, 1945 to the Present, By Robert Atkins, Abbeville Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-78921-150-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Micucci"&gt;[http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/04/land-art-earthworks-postwar-american-art/ Dana Micucci, ''Land Art: Earthworks that Defined Postwar American Art'', Art &amp; Antiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s land art protested "ruthless commercialization" of art in [[United States|America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Natural Art|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XAn5hztDTggC|publisher = PediaPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, exponents of land art rejected the [[museum]] or [[Art museum|gallery]] as the setting of artistic activity and developed monumental landscape projects which were beyond the reach of traditional transportable [[sculpture]] and the commercial art market, although photographic documentation was often presented in normal gallery spaces. Land art was inspired by [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimal art]] and [[conceptual art]] but also by modern movements such as [[De Stijl]], [[Cubism]], [[minimalism]] and the work of [[Constantin Brâncuși]] and [[Joseph Beuys]]. Many of the artists associated with land art had been involved with minimal art and [[conceptual art]]. [[Isamu Noguchi]]'s 1941 design for ''Contoured Playground'' in New York is sometimes interpreted as an important early piece of land art even though the artist himself never called his work "land art" but simply "sculpture". His influence on contemporary land art, [[landscape architecture]] and [[environmental sculpture]] is evident in many works today.&lt;ref name="Weilacher"&gt;Udo Weilacher, ''Between Landscape Architecture and Land Art''. Birkhäuser, 1999, Basel Berlin Boston 1999 {{ISBN|3-7643-6119-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Sonfist]] used an alternative approach to working with [[nature]] and [[culture]] by bringing historical nature and [[sustainable art]] back into New York City. His most inspirational work is ''Time Landscape'', an indigenous forest he planted in New York City.&lt;ref name="Weilacher" /&gt; He also created several other ''Time Landscapes'' around the world such as ''Circles of Time'' in Florence Italy documenting the historical usage of the land, and recently at the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum outside Boston. According to critic [[Barbara Rose]], writing in ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1969, he had become disillusioned with the commodification and insularity of gallery bound art. In 1967, the [[art critic]] Grace Glueck writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared the first earthwork was done by Douglas Leichter and Richard Saba at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]]. The sudden appearance of land art in 1968 can be located as a response by a generation of artists mostly in their late twenties to the heightened political activism of the year and the emerging [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[women's liberation]] [[Social movement|movement]]s.

One example of land art in the 20th century was a group exhibition created in 1968 at the Dwan Gallery &lt;!--"Dwan" is not a typo--&gt; in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/earthworks.html|title=Leftmatrix|publisher=leftmatrix.com|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1969, [[Willoughby Sharp]] curated the "Earth Art" exhibition at the [[Andrew Dickson White House|Andrew Dickson White Museum of Art]] at [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The artists included were [[Walter De Maria]], [[Jan Dibbets]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Neil Jenney]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Medalla]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Robert Smithson]], and [[Gunther Uecker]]. The exhibition was directed by Thomas W. Leavitt. Gordon Matta-Clark, who lived in Ithaca at the time, was invited by Sharp to help the artists in "Earth Art" with the on-site execution of their works for the exhibition.

Perhaps the best known artist who worked in this genre was the [[United States|American]] [[Robert Smithson]] whose 1968 essay "The Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects" provided a critical framework for the movement as a reaction to the disengagement of [[Modernism]] from social issues as represented by the critic [[Clement Greenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22land+art%22,+%22Clement+Greenberg%22,+smithson&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP-sP09dPUAhXFKFAKHdrfB9oQ6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22land%20art%22%2C%20%22Clement%20Greenberg%22%2C%20smithson&amp;f=false Francis Frascina, ''Art, Politics and Dissent: Aspects of the Art Left in Sixties America''], Manchester University Press, 1999, p. 142, {{ISBN|0719044693}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best known piece, and probably the most famous piece of all land art, is the ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' (1970), for which Smithson arranged rock, earth and [[algae]] so as to form a long (1500&amp;nbsp;ft) spiral-shape [[jetty]] protruding into [[Great Salt Lake]] in northern [[Utah]], [[United States|U.S.]]. How much of the work, if any, is visible is dependent on the fluctuating water levels. Since its creation, the work has been completely covered, and then uncovered again, by water.

Utah Museum of Fine Arts. umfa.utah.org. July&amp;nbsp;30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's ''Gravel Mirror with Cracks and Dust'' (1968) is an example of land art existing in a [[art gallery|gallery]] space rather than in the natural environment. It consists of a pile of gravel by the side of a partially mirrored gallery wall. In its simplicity of form and concentration on the materials themselves, this and other pieces of land art have an affinity with [[minimalism]]. There is also a relationship to [[Arte Povera]] in the use of materials traditionally considered "unartistic" or "worthless". The Italian Germano Celant, founder of Arte Povera, was one of the first curator to promote Land Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obsart.blogspot.fr/2012/05/conceptual-art-arte-povera-land-art-it.html|title=Observatoire du Land Art|publisher=obsart.blogspot.fr|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Land Artists' have tended to be American,&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; with other prominent artists in this field including, [[Carl Andre]], [[Alice Aycock]], [[Walter De Maria]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]], [[Charles Ross (artist)|Charles Ross]], [[Alan Sonfist]], and [[James Turrell]]. Turrell began work in 1972 on possibly the largest piece of land art thus far, reshaping the earth surrounding the extinct [[Roden Crater]] [[volcano]] in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps the most prominent non-American land artists are the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Chris Drury (artist)|Chris Drury]], [[Andy Goldsworthy]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] and the Australian [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm|title=Monumental Land Art of the United States|publisher=daringdesigns.com|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1973 [[Jacek Tylicki]] begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.

Some projects by the artists [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] (who are famous for wrapping monuments, buildings and landscapes in [[textile|fabric]]) have also been considered land art by some, though the artists themselves consider this incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030208060629/http://christojeanneclaude.net/errors.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-02-08|title=Common Errors|authors=Christo and Jeanne-Claude|publisher=Christojeanneclaude.net|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Beuys]]' concept of '[[social sculpture]]' influenced 'Land art' and his '[[7000 Eichen]]' project of 1982 to plant 7000 Oak trees has many similarities to 'Land art' processes. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Rogers]]' “Rhythms of Life” project is the largest contemporary land-art undertaking in the world, forming a chain of stone sculptures, or geoglyphs, around the globe – 12 sites – in disparate exotic locations (from below sea level and up to altitudes of 4,300 m/14,107&amp;nbsp;ft). Up to three geoglyphs (ranging in size up to 40,000 sq m/430,560 sq ft) are located in each site.

Eduardo Sanguinetti, the Latino-American philosopher and land-artist, presented in 1979 his "Sculptures in Earth". They were placed in natural spaces, they became functional as plants and animals made their homes in that particular topos installed in the La Pampa desert. Later, they acquired the noise of codes capable of classifying smells and colours, and will complete the original idea of our artist, who was at that time absorbed by the countryside and its specular radiation...in his Land-Art Performance "Solum" (1987), in the zoomorphy of that horse that greatly seduce the audience of the [[Centro Cultural Recoleta]] (ex Centro Cultural Ciudad de Buenos Aires). "Amarillo Total" the name of the horse, not only stopped the ecologic blow but also paraded the models who had been completely painted by our artist, their naked painted bodies put another body to painting, with artesan colours prepared with earth and plants pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Espartaco Carlos 1989, "Eduardo Sanguinetti: The Experience of Limits" pp. 86, 87 (Ediciones de Arte Gaglianone, first published 1989) {{ISBN|950-9004-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Sanguinetti's Essay "Alter Ego" (1986), he said: "Spontaneous Activity in Nature...In nature, there is a type of spontaneous activity. This concept does not exist in cultured man, and if it does remain in children, it is like a faint reminiscence of the primitive mind...Consequently I think that the survival of an awareness of the supernatural in nature, should, in all works of Land-Art, be the thing which "animates Everything".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti Eduardo 1984, "Alter Ego" pag. 53, 54 (Pentland, Edinburgh, First Published in 1986 in the English languaje translated from the Spanish in 1986) {{ISBN|9780946270170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prTwAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;dq=eduardo+sanguinetti&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5FbBUNXSI-610AGY44DoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw |title=Alter ego - Eduardo Sanguinetti - Google Libros |publisher=Books.google.com.ar |date=2011-11-29 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land artists in America relied mostly on wealthy [[patron]]s and [[private foundation]]s to fund their often costly projects. With the sudden economic down turn of the mid-1970s funds from these sources largely stopped. With the death of Robert Smithson in a plane crash in 1973 the movement lost one of its most important figureheads and faded out. Charles Ross continues to work on the Star Axis project, which he began in 1971. Michael Heizer continues his work on [[City (artwork)|City]], and James Turrell continues to work on the [[Roden Crater]] project. In most respects, "land art" has become part of mainstream [[public art]] and in many cases the term "land art" is misused to label any kind of art in nature even though conceptually not related to the [[avant-garde]] works by the pioneers of land art.

The Earth art of the 1960s were sometimes reminiscent the much older land works, [[Stonehenge]], the [[Pyramids]], [[Mound Builders|Native American mounds]], the [[Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines in Peru]], [[Carnac stones]] and [[List of burial mounds in the United States|Native American burial grounds]], and often evoked the spirituality of such archeological sites.&lt;ref name="Micucci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dempsey" /&gt;

The '''Master of Management: Co-operatives and Credit Unions''' ('''MMCCU''') is a [[master's degree]] in [[co-operative]] and [[credit union]] administration. The degree is currently offered solely through an international program at the Sobey School of Business at [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's University]] in [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name="cg"&gt;Livingston, Jane. [http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 Co-op Management Master’s Degree Program: Lessons Learned.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920034748/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=657 |date=2010-09-20 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #124 May - June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The program is designed for students entering [[business management]] and degree applicants come from diverse academic disciplines.

The MMCCU degree is designed to improve students' understanding of management within the context of the [[Co-operative economics|co-operative economic model]].&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; Similar to the more traditional [[MBA]], students are introduced to economics, accounting, human resources, marketing, technology, [[best practice]]s and equity management. The MMCCU also teaches the history and philosophy of the co-operative management model and hosts international symposia.&lt;ref&gt;Crowell, Erbin.

While the coursework is delivered exclusively on-line, participants proceed as cohorts and meet in person three times during the process: once for Orientation Week in Halifax, once for a field trip in the second year and finally for Convocation upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Andrew.

Volume II, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The MMCCU degree program was created in 2002 by a partnership between Saint Mary's University and the Co-operative Management Education Co-operative (CMEC), a federation of over 50 cooperatives. This co-operative consists of co-operatives, individuals, as well as educational and support institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 A Cooperative Approach to Management Education.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921055629/http://cooperativegrocer.coop/articles/index.php?id=944 |date=2010-09-21 }} ''Cooperative Grocer.'' #148 May - June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf Come Together, Right Now.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718162134/http://education.victoria.coop/files/mmccu-newsletter%202010%20Jan.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }} ''Cooperative Management Advantage.'' Volume 4, Issue 2. January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Members donated nearly $1 million to fund the program and the curriculum was approved by the Maritime Provinces' Higher Education Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novkovic|first1=Sonja|last2=Holm|first2=Wendy|title=Co-operative networks as a source of organizational innovation|journal=International Journal of Co-operative Management|date=October 2012|volume=6|issue=1|page=55|url=http://theholmteam.ca/Co-operative.Mgmt.Journal.Oct.2012.pdf#page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was founded by Saint Mary's University Professor John Chamard&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=Consider your options|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20101015161334/http://www.nationalpost.com/related/topics/Consider+your+options/2044603/story.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 15, 2010|work=[[National Post]]|date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took its first students in 2003. The first cohort graduated in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Chamard, John.

Volume 40, Number 2. August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While other methods of training in co-operatives exist,{{ref|a|1}} the MMCCU is the only English-language master's degree in co-operative management by a business school that is internationally accredited.&lt;ref name="Ratner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ratner|first1=Carl|title=Cooperation, Community, and Co-ops in a Global Era|date=2013|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-4614-5825-0|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5WTgR3mN2oC&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%22master%20of%20management%22%20co-operatives&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sobey School of Business, the home of the MMCCU, has accreditation through the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aacsb.net/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=AACSB&amp;WebKey=00E50DA9-8BB0-4A32-B7F7-0A92E98DF5C6 List of Accredited Schools by Country] ''[[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method of delivery===
The MMCCU is an on-line only program using the [[Blackboard Learning System]] virtual environment. With the exception of the orientation and field trip, the classes only meet on-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingston|first1=Jane|title=Mastering Co-op Management|journal=[[Rural Cooperatives]]|date=March 2006|volume=73|issue=2|pages=23–25, 34|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-mar06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students move through the program as a cohort, so once a student starts they must commit to the entire program or drop-out.

==Program content==
The [[Cooperative Principles]] are central to MMCCU curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacPherson|first1=Ian|title=New Opportunities for Co-operatives: New Opportunities for People|date=2012|publisher=University of Helsinki|isbn=978-952-10-6514-9|page=366|chapter=Finding Traction on a Slippery Path: Teaching about Co-operatives, the Co-operative Movement, and Co-operation in Canada|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/ruralia/ica2011/presentations/MacPherson.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First year===
In the first semester, students complete the following:
*''Philosophical Philosophical Origins and Historical Evolution of Co-operative Governance and Business Practice'' offers a survey of the historical development of co-operation from the dawn of the Industrial Age and market capitalism to the present day. Students learn about and practice creating [[Social accounting|social audits]].
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective I'' provides an overview of globalization and its effect on the world economy. In addition, students examine examples of global co-operation.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice I: Variety and Range of Co-operative Business''. This course builds off of the history of the first semester. Students learn about the different sectors of co-operation: consumer, producer, housing, financial and worker and multi-stakeholder co-operatives.
*''Co-operative Financial Analysis and Management I'' provides students with a basic understanding of [[managerial accounting]] and [[financial accounting]]. Students learn the basic of an income statement, balance statement, cash flow analysis and equity statement. Students also learn to conduct a financial analysis.

===Second year===
*''The Emerging Global Economy and Society from a Co-operative Perspective II''.
*''Field Research: Study Visits to Exemplars of Excellent Co-operative Business Practice''. Students learn about the region of the visit and the co-operative society prior to their visit. The remainder of the course examines the lessons learned during the trip and how it might relate to their co-operatives.
*''Comparative Co-operative Practice II: Co-operative Innovations and Best Practice'' considers different co-operatives on an individual level in order to understand how different co-operators solve similar problems.
*''Technology, Communication and Co-operation'' examines the role of technology in society and how co-operatives might use it to succeed.

====Field trip====
The field trip currently alternates between two locations. The first is the [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon Co-operative]] in northern [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="ica"&gt;Parnell, Edgar. [http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf Masters of Management - Co-ops and Credit Unions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231155736/http://www.ica.coop/publications/digest/38-digest.pdf |date=2010-12-31 }} ''[[International Co-operative Alliance|ICA Digest]].'' Issue 38. March 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Students spend 10 days studying the Mondragon Co-operative and learning about the culture of the region.

The second location involves the [[Emilia-Romagna]] region of [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="ica"/&gt; Students tour and study the worker co-operatives and co-operative federations of the region.

'''Memory management''' is a form of [[Resource management (computing)|resource management]] applied to [[computer memory]].  The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed. This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single [[Process (computing)|process]] might be underway at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibson|first=Steve|author1-link=Steve Gibson (computer programmer)|title=Tech Talk: Placing the IBM/Microsoft XMS Spec Into Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|magazine=[[InfoWorld]]|date=August 15, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods have been devised that increase the effectiveness of memory management. [[Virtual memory]] systems separate the memory addresses used by a process from actual physical addresses, allowing separation of processes and increasing the size of the [[virtual address space]] beyond the available amount of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] using [[paging]] or swapping to [[secondary storage]]. The quality of the virtual memory manager can have an extensive effect on overall system performance.

== Details ==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}

Application-level memory management is generally categorized as either automatic memory management, usually involving [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], or [[manual memory management]].

=== {{Anchor|DYNAMIC|HEAP|ALLOCATION}}Dynamic memory allocation ===
[[File:External Fragmentation.svg|thumb|450px|An example of external fragmentation]]
{{See also|C dynamic memory allocation}}

The task of fulfilling an allocation request consists of locating a block of unused memory of sufficient size. Memory requests are satisfied by allocating portions from a large pool of memory called the ''heap'' or ''free store''.{{efn|Not to be confused with the unrelated [[heap (data structure)|heap]] data structure.}} At any given time, some parts of the heap are in use, while some are "free" (unused) and thus available for future allocations.

Several issues complicate the implementation, such as [[fragmentation (computer)#External fragmentation|external fragmentation]], which arises when there are many small gaps between allocated memory blocks, which invalidates their use for an allocation request. The allocator's [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] can also inflate the size of (individually) small allocations. This is often managed by [[chunking (computing)|chunking]]. The memory management system must track outstanding allocations to ensure that they do not overlap and that no memory is ever "lost" (i.e. that there be no "[[memory leak]]").

==== Efficiency ====
The specific dynamic memory allocation algorithm implemented can impact performance significantly. A study conducted in 1994 by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] illustrates the [[computational overhead|overheads]] involved for a variety of allocators. The lowest average [[instruction path length]] required to allocate a single memory slot was 52 (as measured with an instruction level [[Profiling (computer programming)|profiler]] on a variety of software).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/spe.4380240602| title = Memory allocation costs in large C and C++ programs| journal = Software: Practice and Experience| volume = 24| issue = 6| pages = 527–542| date=June 1994 | last1 = Detlefs | first1 = D. | last2 = Dosser | first2 = A. | last3 = Zorn | first3 = B. | url = http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/uc-courses/15400-2008-spring/spe895.pdf| citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.3073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implementations ====
Since the precise location of the allocation is not known in advance, the memory is accessed indirectly, usually through a [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] [[reference (computer science)|reference]]. The specific algorithm used to organize the memory area and allocate and deallocate chunks is interlinked with the [[kernel (computing)|kernel]], and may use any of the following methods:

===== {{Anchor|FIXED-SIZE}}Fixed-size blocks allocation =====
{{main|Memory pool}}

Fixed-size blocks allocation, also called memory pool allocation, uses a [[free list]] of fixed-size blocks of memory (often all of the same size). This works well for simple [[embedded system]]s where no large objects need to be allocated, but suffers from [[Fragmentation (computing)|fragmentation]], especially with long memory addresses. However, due to the significantly reduced overhead this method can substantially improve performance for objects that need frequent allocation / de-allocation and is often used in [[video games]].

===== Buddy blocks =====
{{details|Buddy memory allocation}}

In this system, memory is allocated into several pools of memory instead of just one, where each pool represents blocks of memory of a certain [[power of two]] in size, or blocks of some other convenient size progression. All blocks of a particular size are kept in a sorted [[linked list]] or [[Tree data structure|tree]] and all new blocks that are formed during allocation are added to their respective memory pools for later use. If a smaller size is requested than is available, the smallest available size is selected and split. One of the resulting parts is selected, and the process repeats until the request is complete. When a block is allocated, the allocator will start with the smallest sufficiently large block to avoid needlessly breaking blocks. When a block is freed, it is compared to its buddy. If they are both free, they are combined and placed in the correspondingly larger-sized buddy-block list.

===== Slab allocation =====
{{main|Slab allocation}}

This memory allocation mechanism preallocates memory chunks suitable to fit objects of a certain type or size.&lt;ref name=silberschatz&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abraham Silberschatz|authorlink1=Abraham Silberschatz|author2=Peter B. Galvin|title=Operating system concepts|publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-471-69466-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These chunks are called caches and the allocator only has to keep track of a list of free cache slots. Constructing an object will use the any one of the free cache slots and destructing an object will add a slot back to the free cache slot list. This technique alleviates memory fragmentation and is efficient as there is no need to search for a suitable portion of memory, as any open slot will suffice.

===== Stack allocation =====
{{main|Stack-based memory allocation}}

{{expand section|date=November 2016}}

=== Automatic variables  ===
{{main|Automatic variable}}
In many programming language implementations, all variables declared within a procedure (subroutine, or function) are local to that function; the runtime environment for the program automatically allocates memory for these variables on program execution entry to the procedure, and automatically releases that memory when the procedure is exited. Special declarations may allow local variables to retain values between invocations of the procedure, or may allow local variables to be accessed by other procedures. The automatic allocation of local variables makes [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]] possible, to a depth limited by available memory.  

==== Garbage collection ====
{{main|Garbage collection (computer science)}}
Garbage collection is a strategy for automatically detecting memory allocated to objects that are no longer usable in a program, and returning that allocated memory to a pool of free memory locations. This method is in contrast to "manual" memory management where a programmer explicitly  codes memory requests and memory releases in the program. While automatic garbage has the advantages of reducing programmer workload and preventing certain kinds of memory allocation bugs, garbage collection does require memory resources of its own, and can compete with the application program for processor time.

== Systems with virtual memory ==
{{Main|Memory protection|Shared memory (interprocess communication)}}

[[Virtual memory]] is a method of decoupling the memory organization from the physical hardware. The applications operate on memory via ''virtual addresses''. Each attempt by the application to access a particular virtual memory address results in the virtual memory address being translated to an actual ''physical address''.  In this way the addition of virtual memory enables granular control over memory systems and methods of access.

In virtual memory systems the operating system limits how a [[Process (computing)|process]] can access the memory. This feature, called [[memory protection]], can be used to disallow a process to read or write to memory that is not allocated to it, preventing malicious or malfunctioning code in one program from interfering with the operation of another.

Even though the memory allocated for specific processes is normally isolated, processes sometimes need to be able to share information. [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|Shared memory]] is one of the fastest techniques for [[inter-process communication]].

Memory is usually classified by access rate into [[primary storage]] and [[secondary storage]]. Memory management systems, among other operations, also handle the moving of information between these two levels of memory.

Misattribution is one of many [[theories of humor]] that describes an audience's inability to identify exactly why they find a [[joke]] to be [[funny]].  The formal theory is attributed to Zillmann &amp; Bryant (1980) in their article, "Misattribution Theory of Tendentious Humor", published in ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.  They derived the critical concepts of the theory from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious]]'', originally published in 1905.  Freud declared people incapable of knowing exactly what it is they find amusing due to the complex nature of their [[conscious]] and [[subconscious]] minds.  Jokes are crafted by comedians who have experience with causing laughter but who may themselves be blind to the actual cause of humor.

==Tendentious vs. innocuous humor==
Freud made a key distinction between tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Tendentious humor involves a "victim", someone at whose expense we laugh.  Non-tendentious humor does not require a victim.  This innocuous humor typically depends on wordplay, and Freud believed it has only modest power to evoke amusement.  Tendentious humor, then, is the only kind that can evoke big laughs.
However, Freud believed a mixture of both tendentious and non-tendentious humor is required to keep the tendentious humor from becoming too offensive or demeaning to its victim.  The innocent jokework of the innocuous humor would mask the otherwise hostile joke and therefore "bribe" our senses, allowing us to laugh at what would otherwise be socially unacceptable.  Therefore, we often think we are laughing at innocuous jokes, but what really makes them funny is their socially unacceptable nature hidden below the surface.

==Empirical study==
To further examine Freud's concepts, [[media scholar]]s Dolf Zillmann &amp; Jennings Bryant set up an experimental situation to combine and/or separate tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Their findings confirmed the expectations that amusement was highest when all of the ingredients of good comedy were present.  In conjunction with disposition theory of mirth (Zillmann &amp; Cantor, 1976), audiences predictably enjoyed witnessing the demise of a disliked character.  However, the mere presence of the innocuous humor cue more than doubled the amusement in response to the observed misfortune.
The applications to humor in film, television, and other media are quite apparent.  However, very little research has been conducted to follow up Zillmann &amp; Bryant's original experiment.

==Example in today's comedy==
Sitcom and [[comedy films]] are filled with humor based on misattribution.  For example, characters in a working-class family may banter back and forth about paying bills or finding a more respected or higher-paying job.  The delivery of dialog may come across as funny for an audience who believes the humor comes from the antagonistic relationship between the two characters.  But the real hostile nature of the joke involves class and economic issues that are otherwise not funny.
Similar analysis can be applied to issues involving racial discrimination, sexual deviancy, drug abuse, and other controversial issues.

The effect of '''mobile phone radiation on human health''' is a subject of interest and study worldwide, as a result of the enormous increase in [[mobile phone]] usage throughout the world. {{As of|2015}}, there were 7.4 billion subscriptions worldwide, though the actual number of users is lower as many users own more than one mobile phone.&lt;!--Connections/100 citizens-field at [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use]]--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2015/mobility-report/ericsson-mobility-report-nov-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

A 2010 review stated that "The balance of experimental evidence does not support an effect of 'non-thermal' radiofrequency fields" on the permeability of the [[blood-brain barrier]], but noted that research on low frequency effects and effects in humans was sparse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stam R |title=Electromagnetic fields and the blood-brain barrier |journal=Brain Research Reviews |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=80–97 |year=2010 |pmid=20550949 |doi=10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.06.001 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study of low-frequency radiation on humans found "no evidence for acute effects of short-term mobile phone radiation on cerebral blood flow".&lt;ref name="nci"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kwon MS, Vorobyev V, Kännälä S ''et al.'' | year = 2012 | title = No effects of short-term GSM mobile phone radiation on cerebral blood flow measured using positron emission tomography | url = | journal = Bioelectromagnetics | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 247–56 | doi=10.1002/bem.20702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
{{See also|Non-ionizing radiation}}

There is no strong or consistent evidence that mobile phone use increases the risk of getting brain cancer or other head tumors. The United States National Cancer Institute points out that "Radiofrequency energy, unlike [[ionizing radiation]], does not cause DNA damage that can lead to cancer. Its only consistently observed biological effect in humans is tissue heating. In animal studies, it has not been found to cause cancer or to enhance the cancer-causing effects of known chemical carcinogens." The majority of human studies have failed to find a link between cell phone use and cancer. In 2011 a [[World Health Organization]] working group classified cell phone use as "possibly carcinogenic to humans". The CDC states that no scientific evidence definitively answers whether cell phone use causes cancer.&lt;ref name=nci&gt;[https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet#q4 What has research shown about the possible cancer-causing effects of radiofrequency energy?], United States National Cancer Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cancer2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Repacholi MH, Lerchl A, Röösli M, Sienkiewicz Z, Auvinen A, Breckenkamp J, d'Inzeo G, Elliott P, Frei P, Heinrich S, Lagroye I, Lahkola A, McCormick DL, Thomas S, Vecchia P |title=Systematic review of wireless phone use and brain cancer and other head tumors |journal=Bioelectromagnetics |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=187–206 |year=2012 |pmid=22021071 |doi=10.1002/bem.20716 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who-cancer&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/en/|title= Electromagnetic fields and public health: mobile phones&lt;!--: Fact sheet N°193--&gt;|publisher= World Health Organization|date= October 2014|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of an "eagerly anticipated" study using rats and mice by the [[National Toxicology Program]] indicates that due such issues as the inconsistent appearances of "signals for harm" within and across species and the increased chances of false positives due to the multiplicity of tests, the positive results seen are more likely due to random chance. The full results of the study were released in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labos |first1=Christopher |last2=Foster|first2=Kenneth|title=Cell Phone Radiation and Cancer: New NTP Results Inconsistent; Random Chance Likely at Play |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male fertility===

A decline in male sperm quality has been observed over several decades.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/29/infertility-crisis-sperm-counts-halved&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/25/health/sperm-counts-declining-study/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1557988316643383 | volume=11 | title=The Disappearing Sperms: Analysis of Reports Published Between 1980 and 2015 | year=2016 | journal=American Journal of Men's Health | pages=1279–1304 | author=Sengupta Pallav, Dutta Sulagna, Krajewska-Kulak Elzbieta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on the impact of mobile radiation on male fertility are conflicting, and the effects of the [[radiofrequency]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] (RF-EMR) emitted by these devices on the reproductive systems are currently under active debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/10343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0006446 | volume=4 | title=Mobile Phone Radiation Induces Reactive Oxygen Species Production and DNA Damage in Human Spermatozoa In Vitro | year=2009 | journal=PLoS ONE | page=e6446 | author=De Iuliis Geoffry N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1677-55382011000400002&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/152/6/R263.short&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 review concluded that "together, the results of these studies have shown that [[Radio wave|RF-EMR]] decreases sperm count and motility and increases [[oxidative stress]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = La Vignera S., Condorelli R.

===Electromagnetic hypersensitivity===
{{Main article|Electromagnetic hypersensitivity}}
Some users of mobile phones and similar devices have reported feeling various non-specific [[symptom]]s during and after use. Studies have failed to link any of these symptoms to electromagnetic exposure. In addition, EHS is not a recognised medical diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Röösli|first1= Martin|date=June 2008|title= Radiofrequency electromagnetic field exposure and non-specific symptoms of ill health: A systematic review|journal= [[Environmental Research]]|volume= 107|issue= 2|pages= 277–287|doi= 10.1016/j.envres.2008.02.003|pmid= 18359015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glucose metabolism===
According to the [[National Cancer Institute]], two small studies exploring whether and how cell phone radiation affects brain glucose metabolism showed inconsistent results.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

==Base stations==
[[File:Cellular Mobile UHF Antenna Tower8.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Cellular Mobile and UHF Antenna Tower with multiple Antennas]]

Experts consulted by France considered it was mandatory that the main antenna axis should not to be directly in front of a living place at a distance shorter than 100 metres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&amp;parentid=424 page 37&lt;/ref&gt; This recommendation was modified in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Téléphonie mobile et santé, Rapport à l'Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire Environnementale, 21 March 2003 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&amp;parentid=424&lt;/ref&gt; to say that antennas located within a 100-metre radius of primary schools or childcare facilities should be better integrated into the cityscape and was not included in a 2005 expert report.&lt;ref&gt;Téléphonie mobile et santé, Rapport du groupe d’experts, l'Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire Environnementale, April 2005 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&amp;parentid=424&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale'' ([[:fr:Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de l'environnement|fr]]) {{asof|2009|lc=yes}}, says that there is no demonstrated short-term effect of electromagnetic fields on health, but that there are open questions for long-term effects, and that it is easy to reduce exposure via technological improvements.&lt;ref&gt;"Radiofréquences : actualisation de l'expertise (2009)", l'Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire Environnementale, April 2005 at http://www.afsset.fr/index.php?pageid=712&amp;parentid=424&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety standards and licensing==
In order to protect the population living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the [[International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection]] (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to harmonise the different standards in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icnirp.de |title=International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection home page|accessdate=7 January 2008 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio base licensing procedures have been established in the majority of urban spaces regulated either at municipal/county, provincial/state or national level. Mobile telephone service providers are, in many regions, required to obtain construction licenses, provide certification of antenna emission levels and assure compliance to ICNIRP standards and/or to other environmental legislation.

Many governmental bodies also require that competing telecommunication companies try to achieve sharing of towers so as to decrease environmental and cosmetic impact. This issue is an influential factor of rejection of installation of new antennas and towers in communities.

The safety standards in [[United states|the US]] are set by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). The FCC has based its standards primarily on those standards established by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), specifically Subcommittee 4 of the "International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety".

Switzerland has set safety limits lower than the ICNIRP limits for certain "sensitive areas" (classrooms, for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Anforderungen nach NISV: Mobilfunkanlagen|trans-title= Specifications of the Regulation on Non-Ionizing Radiation: Mobile Telephone Installations|url= http://www.bafu.admin.ch/elektrosmog/01100/01105/index.html?lang=de |publisher= Bundesamt für Umwelt &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Swiss Federal Environment Ministry&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|language= German|date= 13 March 2009|accessdate= 20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In [[United states|the US]], a small number of [[personal injury]] [[lawsuits]] have been filed by individuals against cellphone manufacturers (including [[Motorola]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoventures.com/emf/legal/lt-il001.html Wright v. Motorola, Inc. et al., No95-L-04929]&lt;/ref&gt; [[NEC Corporation|NEC]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], and [[Nokia]]) on the basis of allegations of causation of [[brain cancer]] and death. In US federal courts, expert testimony relating to science must be first evaluated by a judge, in a [[Daubert standard|Daubert hearing]], to be relevant and valid before it is admissible as evidence. In a 2002 case against [[Motorola]], the plaintiffs alleged that the use of wireless handheld telephones could cause brain cancer and that the use of Motorola phones caused one plaintiff's cancer. The judge ruled that no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation was proffered by the plaintiffs, accepted a motion to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts, and denied a motion to exclude the testimony of the defendants' experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Christopher Newman, et al. v Motorola, Inc., et al. |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court= United States District Court for the District of Maryland |date= |url= http://news.lp.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cellphone/newmanmotorola93002mem.pdf |format=PDF|quote= Because no sufficiently reliable and relevant scientific evidence in support of either general or specific causation has been proffered by the plaintiffs, as explained below, the defendants’ motion will be granted and the plaintiffs’ motion will be denied. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==

===Precautionary principle===
In 2000, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommended that the [[precautionary principle]] could be voluntarily adopted in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/docstore/peh-emf/publications/facts_press/EMF-Precaution.htm|title= Electromagnetic Fields and Public Health: Cautionary Policies|accessdate=1 February 2008|date=March 2000|work= World Health Organization Backgrounder|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows the recommendations of the [[European Community]] for environmental risks.

According to the WHO, the "precautionary principle" is "a risk management policy applied in circumstances with a high degree of scientific uncertainty, reflecting the need to take action for a potentially serious risk without awaiting the results of scientific research." Other less stringent recommended approaches are [[prudent avoidance principle]] and [[as low as reasonably practicable]]. Although all of these are problematic in application, due to the widespread use and economic importance of wireless telecommunication systems in modern civilization, there is an increased popularity of such measures in the general public, though also evidence that such approaches may increase concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiedemann | year = 2006 | title = The Impacts of Precautionary Measures and the Disclosure of Scientific Uncertainty on EMF Risk Perception and Trust | doi = 10.1080/13669870600802111 | journal = Journal of Risk Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 361–372 | last2 = Thalmann | first2 = Andrea | last3 = Grutsch | first3 = Markus | last4 = Schütz | first4 = Holger | displayauthors = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They involve recommendations such as the minimization of cellphone usage, the limitation of use by at-risk population (such as children), the adoption of cellphones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation, the wider use of hands-free and [[earphone]] technologies such as [[Bluetooth]] headsets, the adoption of maximal standards of exposure, RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations, and so forth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Overall, public information remains a challenge as various health consequences are evoked in the literature and by the media, putting populations under chronic exposure to potentially worrying information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poumadère M. |author2=Perrin A. | year = 2013 | title = Risk Assessment of Radiofrequencies and Public Information | url = | journal = Journal of Risk Analysis and Crisis Response | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 3–12 | doi=10.2991/jrarc.2013.3.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precautionary measures and health advisories===
In May 2011, the [http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf World Health Organisation's International Agency for Research on Cancer] announced it was classifying electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and other sources as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" and advised the public to adopt safety measures to reduce exposure, like use of hands-free devices or texting.

Some national radiation advisory authorities, including those of Austria,&lt;ref name="AustriaPrecaution"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pressbaum.net/wai_startseite-aktuelles-handy.htm|title= Information: Wie gefährlich sind Handystrahlen wirklich?|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111002195819/http://www.pressbaum.net/wai_startseite-aktuelles-handy.htm|archive-date= 2011-10-02|dead-url= yes| access-date=16 May 2015| language= German|publisher= [[Pressbaum|Marktgemeinde Pressbaum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sante-jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/actualite-presse/presse-sante/communiques/telephones-mobiles-sante-securite.html|title= Téléphones mobiles : santé et sécurité|accessdate=19 January 2008|date= 2 January 2008|publisher=Le ministère de la santé, de la jeunesse et des sports|language= French}} Lay article in {{en icon}} making comment at {{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080103-france-beware-excessive-cell-phone-usedespite-lack-of-data.html|title=France: Beware excessive cell phone use?: despite lack of data |accessdate=19 January 2008 |last= Gitlin|first= Jonathan M.|date= 3 January 2008|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz|Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.de/en/elektro/faq/emf_faq_vorsorge.html |title= Precaution regarding electromagnetic fields |accessdate= 19 January 2008|date= 7 December 2007|publisher= [[Federal Office for Radiation Protection]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ssi.se/ickejoniserande_stralning/Mobiltele/onodig_exponering.html?Menu2=Mobiltelefoni|title= Exponering|accessdate=19 January 2008|date=February 2006|language= Swedish|publisher= [[Swedish Radiation Safety Authority|Swedish Radiation Protection Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; have recommended measures to minimize exposure to their citizens. Examples of the recommendations are:

* Use hands-free to decrease the radiation to the head.
* Keep the mobile phone away from the body.
* Do not use telephone in a car without an external antenna.

The use of "hands-free" was not recommended by the British [[Which?|Consumers' Association]] in a statement in November 2000, as they believed that exposure was increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/02/london.phone/index.html|title= UK consumer group: Hands-free phone kits boost radiation exposure|date= 2 November 2000|work= cnn.com|publisher= [[CNN|Cable News Network]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060314135643/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/02/london.phone/index.html |archivedate=14 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, measurements for the (then) [[UK Department of Trade and Industry]]&lt;ref&gt;Manning, MI and Gabriel, CHB, SAR tests on mobile phones used with and without personal hands-free kits, SARtest Report 0083 for the DTI, July 2000 (PDF) at http://straff-x.com/SAR-Hands-Free-Kits-July-2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and others for the French {{Interlanguage link multi|Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale|fr|3=Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de l'environnement et du travail}}&lt;ref&gt;Téléphonie mobile &amp; santé, Report for l'Agence française de sécurité sanitaire environnementale (Afsse), June 2005 at http://www.afsse.fr/index.php?pageid=671&amp;parentid=619#&lt;/ref&gt; showed substantial reductions. In 2005, Professor Lawrie Challis and others said clipping a [[ferrite bead]] onto hands-free kits stops the radio waves travelling up the wire and into the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bead 'slashes mobile radiation'|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4203077.stm|publisher= [[BBC News]]|date= 25 January 2005|accessdate= 17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several nations have advised moderate use of mobile phones for children.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Finland {{cite web|url= http://www.stuk.fi/stuk/tiedotteet/en_GB/news_527/|title= Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority: Children's mobile phone use should be limited|publisher= Finnish [[Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority]] (STUK)|date= 7 January 2009|accessdate= 20 January 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100111082827/http://www.stuk.fi/stuk/tiedotteet/en_GB/news_527/|archivedate= 11 January 2010|df= dmy-all}} and France {{cite web|url= http://www.sante-sports.gouv.fr/IMG//pdf/AFOM_-_Fiche_4_-_telephone_mobile_DAS_et_sante.pdf|format= PDF|title= Téléphone mobile, DAS et santé|trans-title= Mobile telephones, SAR and health|work= Votre enfant et le téléphone mobile &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Your child and mobile telephony&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher= Association Française des Opérateurs Mobiles (AFOM)&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;French Mobile Phone Operators' Association&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; et l’Union Nationale des Associations Familiales (UNAF) &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;National Federation of Family Associations&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date= 31 January 2007|accessdate= 20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A journal by Gandhi et al. in 2006 states that children receive higher levels of [[Specific absorption rate|Specific Absorption Rate]] (SAR).  When 5- and 10-year olds are compared to adults, they receive about 153% higher SAR levels.

===Bogus products===
Products have been advertised that claim to shield people from EM radiation from cell phones; in the US the [[Federal Trade Commission]] published a warning that "Scam artists follow the headlines to promote products that play off the news{{snd}}and prey on concerned people.

According to the FTC, there is no scientific proof that so-called shields significantly reduce exposure from electromagnetic emissions. Products that block only the earpiece{{snd}}or another small portion of the phone{{snd}}are totally ineffective because the entire phone emits electromagnetic waves. Such shields "may interfere with the phone's signal, cause it to draw even more power to communicate with the base station, and possibly emit more radiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cell Phone Radiation Scams|url=https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0109-cell-phone-radiation-scams|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FTC has enforced false advertising claims against companies that sell such products.&lt;ref name=FTCenforce&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fair|first1=Lesley|title=Federal Trade Commission Advertising Enforcement|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/training-materials/enforcement.pdf|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|pages=18–19|date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33855">'''Nitrogen fixation''' is a process by which [[nitrogen]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]] is converted into [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or related nitrogenous compounds.&lt;ref name=postgate&gt;{{cite book |last=Postgate|first= J. |year=1998 |title= Nitrogen Fixation|edition= 3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atmospheric nitrogen, which is molecular dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is relatively nonreactive and is metabolically useless to all but a few microorganisms.  The fixation process converts N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into ammonia, which is metabolized by most organisms.

Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because fixed inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the [[biosynthesis]] of all nitrogen-containing compounds. Therefore, as part of the [[nitrogen cycle]], it is essential for [[agriculture]] and the manufacture of [[fertilizer]]. It is also, indirectly, relevant to the manufacture of all chemical compounds that contain nitrogen, which includes explosives, most pharmaceuticals, and dyes.  Nitrogen fixation is carried out naturally in the [[soil]] by a wide range of nitrogen fixing [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], including ''[[Azotobacter]]''. Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria have [[symbiotic]] relationships with some [[plant]] groups, especially [[legume]]s.  Looser relationships between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants are often referred to as associative or non-symbiotic, as seen in nitrogen fixation occurring on [[rice]] roots. It also occurs naturally in the air by means of [[NOx]] production by [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slosson|first=Edwin|title=Creative Chemistry|year=1919|publisher=The Century Co.|location=New York, NY|pages=19–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R.

All biological nitrogen fixation is effected by enzymes called [[nitrogenase]]s. These enzymes contain [[iron]], often with a second metal, usually [[molybdenum]] but sometimes [[vanadium]].  Microorganisms that can fix nitrogen are [[prokaryotes]] (both [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], distributed throughout their respective domains) called [[diazotroph]]s. Some higher plants, and some animals ([[termite]]s), have formed associations ([[symbiosis]]) with diazotrophs.

==Non-biological natural nitrogen fixation==
[[File:Lightning Pritzerbe 01 (MK).jpg|thumb|Lightning heats up the air around it breaking the bonds of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; starting the formation of nitrous acid.]]
Nitrogen can be fixed by [[lightning]] converting nitrogen and oxygen into [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides). NOx may react with water to make [[nitrous acid]] or [[nitric acid]], which seeps into the soil, where it makes [[nitrate]], which is of use to growing plants. Nitrogen in the atmosphere is highly stable and nonreactive due to there being a [[triple bond]] between atoms in the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuck|first=A.

Nitrogenases are rapidly degraded by oxygen. For this reason, many bacteria cease production of the enzyme in the presence of oxygen. Many nitrogen-fixing organisms exist only in [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions, respiring to draw down oxygen levels, or binding the oxygen with a protein such as [[leghemoglobin]].&lt;ref name=postgate/&gt;

===Microorganisms that fix nitrogen===
{{main|Diazotroph}}
Diazotrophs are widespread within domain [[Bacteria]] including [[cyanobacteria]] (e.g. the highly significant ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' and ''[[Cyanothece]]''), as well as [[green sulfur bacteria]], [[Azotobacteraceae]], [[rhizobia]] and ''[[Frankia]]''. Several obligately anaerobic bacteria fix nitrogen including many  (but not all) [[Clostridium]] spp. Some [[Archaea]] also fix nitrogen, including several [[methanogen]]ic taxa, which are significant contributors to nitrogen fixation in anoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bae|first=Hee-Sung|last2=Morrison|first2=Elise|last3=Chanton|first3=Jeffrey P.|last4=Ogram|first4=Andrew|date=2018-04-01|title=Methanogens Are Major Contributors to Nitrogen Fixation in Soils of the Florida Everglades | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=84|issue=7|pages=e02222–17|doi=10.1128/AEM.02222-17 |pmc=5861825|pmid=29374038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyanobacteria]] inhabit nearly all illuminated environments on Earth and play key roles in the carbon and [[nitrogen cycle]] of the [[biosphere]]. In general, [[cyanobacteria]] can use various inorganic and organic sources of combined nitrogen, like [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonium]], [[urea]], or some [[amino acid]]s. Several cyanobacterial strains are also capable of [[diazotroph]]ic growth, an ability that may have been present in their last common ancestor in the [[Archean]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latysheva | first1 = N. | last2 = Junker | first2 = V.

The colonial marine cyanobacterium ''[[Trichodesmium]]'' is thought to fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen fixation in marine systems globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergman|first1= B.|last2= Sandh|first2= G.|last3= Lin|first3= S.|last4= Larsson|first4= H.|last5= Carpenter|first5= E.

===Root nodule symbioses===
====The Legume family====
Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include those of the [[legume]] family&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; [[Fabaceae]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with taxa such as [[kudzu]], [[clover]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[alfalfa]], [[lupin]]es, [[peanut]]s, and [[rooibos]]. They contain [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria called [[rhizobia]] within [[root nodule|nodules]] in their [[root|root systems]], producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plant dies, the fixed nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants; this helps to fertilize the [[soil]].&lt;ref name=postgate/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smil|first=Vaclav |year=2000 |title=Cycles of Life |publisher=Scientific American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., ''[[Styphnolobium]]'') do not. In many traditional and organic farming practices, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually include one consisting mainly or entirely of [[clover]] or [[buckwheat]] (non-legume family [[Polygonaceae]]), often referred to as "[[green manure]]".&lt;ref&gt;By who?&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficiency of nitrogen fixation in soil is dependent on many factors, including the legume as well as air and soil conditions. For example, nitrogen fixation by red clover can range from 50 - 200&amp;nbsp;lb./acre depending on these variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.foragebeef.ca/$Foragebeef/frgebeef.nsf/all/frg90/$FILE/fertilitylegumefixation.pdf|title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inga alley farming]] relies on the leguminous [[genus]] ''[[Inga]]'', a small tropical, tough-leaved, nitrogen-fixing tree.&lt;ref name=Elkan&gt;{{cite news|last=Elkan|first= Daniel |title=Slash-and-burn farming has become a major threat to the world's rainforest|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-leguminous ===
[[Image:A sectioned alder root nodule gall.JPG|right|thumb|A sectioned alder tree root nodule]]

Although by far the majority of plant species able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family [[Fabaceae]], there are exceptions:

* ''Parasponia'', a tropical genus in the [[Cannabaceae]] also able to interact with rhizobia and form nitrogen-fixing nodules&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Rik |last=Op den Camp |title=LysM-Type Mycorrhizal Receptor Recruited for Rhizobium Symbiosis in Nonlegume ''Parasponia'' |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=331 |issue=6019 |pages=909–912 |doi=10.1126/science.1198181 |year=2010 |first2=A. |last3=De Mita |first3=S. |last4=Cao |first4=Q. |last5=Polone |first5=E. |last6=Liu |first6=W. |last7=Ammiraju |first7=J.

* [[Actinorhizal plant]]s such as [[alder]] and [[bayberry]] can also form nitrogen-fixing nodules, thanks to a symbiotic association with ''[[Frankia]]'' bacteria. These plants belong to 25 genera&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ecology of actinorhizal plants |first=J.

The ability to fix nitrogen is present in the families listed below. They belong to the [[order (biology)|order]]s [[Cucurbitales]], [[Fagales]], and [[Rosales]], which together with the [[Fabales]] form a clade of [[eurosid]]s. The ability to fix nitrogen is not universally present in these families. For example, of 122 genera in the [[Rosaceae]], only 4 genera are capable of fixing nitrogen. Fabales were the first lineage to branch off this nitrogen-fixing clade; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen may be [[plesiomorphic]] and subsequently lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant; however, it may be that the basic [[genetics|genetic]] and [[physiological]] requirements were present in an incipient state in the [[most recent common ancestor]]s of all these plants, but only evolved to full function in some of them.

==Industrial nitrogen fixation==

The possibility that atmospheric nitrogen reacts with certain chemicals was first observed by [[Desfosses]] in 1828. He observed that mixtures of [[alkali metal]] oxides and carbon react at high temperatures with nitrogen. With the use of [[barium carbonate]] as starting material the first commercially used process became available in the 1860s developed by Margueritte and Sourdeval. The resulting [[barium cyanide]] could be reacted with steam yielding [[ammonia]]. In 1898 [[Adolph Frank]] and [[Nikodem Caro]] decoupled the process and first produced  [[calcium carbide]] and in a subsequent step reacted it with nitrogen to [[calcium cyanamide]]. The [[Ostwald process]] for the production of [[nitric acid]] was discovered in 1902. [[Frank-Caro process]] and Ostwald process dominated the industrial fixation of nitrogen until the discovery of the [[Haber process]] in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Die Umwandlungsgleichung Ba(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C im Temperaturgebiet von 500 bis 1000&amp;nbsp;°C | trans-title = The conversion reaction Ba(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → BaCN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C in the temperature range from 500 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C | first1 = H. | last1 = Heinrich | first2 = Rolf | last2= Nevbner  | journal = Z.

[[File:THC 2003.902.022 D. C. Bardwell Study of Nitrogen Fixation.tif|thumb|right|Equipment for a study of nitrogen fixation by [[alpha ray]]s (Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926)]]
Artificial fertilizer production is now the largest source of human-produced fixed nitrogen in the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]].  Ammonia is a required precursor to [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and other products. The most common method is the [[Haber process]]. The Haber process requires high pressures (around 200&amp;nbsp;atm) and high temperatures (at least 400&amp;nbsp;°C), routine conditions for industrial catalysis. This highly efficient process uses natural gas as a hydrogen source and air as a nitrogen source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/watertrain/pdf/issue1.pdf |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|title=Human Alteration of the Global Nitrogen Cycle: Causes and Consequences |first1=Peter M. |last1=Vitousek |first2=John |last2=Aber|first3=Robert W. |last3=Howarth|first4= Gene E. |last4=Likens|first5= Pamela A. |last5=Matson|first6= David W. |last6=Schindler|first7= William H. |last7=Schlesinger|first8= G.

Much research has been conducted on the discovery of catalysts for nitrogen fixation, often with the goal of reducing the energy required for this conversion. However, such research has thus far failed to even approach the efficiency and ease of the Haber process. Many compounds react with atmospheric nitrogen to give [[dinitrogen complex]]es. The first dinitrogen [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] to be reported was [[pentaamine(dinitrogen)ruthenium(II) chloride|Ru(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Ambient nitrogen reduction ===
Catalytic chemical nitrogen fixation  at ambient conditions is an ongoing scientific endeavor.  Guided by the example of nitrogenase, this area of homogeneous catalysis is ongoing, with particular emphasis on hydrogenation to give ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schrock | first1 = Richard R. | year = 2006 | title = Reduction of dinitrogen | journal = PNAS | volume = 103 | issue = 46| page = 17087 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0603633103 | pmc = 1859893 | pmid = 17088548 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/46/17087.full.pdf| bibcode = 2006PNAS..10317087S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic [[lithium]] has long been known for burning in an atmosphere of nitrogen and then converting to [[lithium nitride]]. Hydrolysis of the resulting nitride gives ammonia. In a related process, [[trimethylsilyl chloride]], lithium, and nitrogen react in the presence of a catalyst to give [[tris(trimethylsilyl)amine]]. Tris(trimethylsilyl)amine can then be used for reaction with α,δ,ω-tri[[ketone]]s to give tricyclic [[pyrrole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brook|first=Michael A.|title=Silicon in Organic, Organometallic, and Polymer Chemistry|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Processes involving [[lithium]] metal are however of no practical interest since they are non-catalytic and re-reducing the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion residue is difficult.

Beginning in the 1960s several homogeneous systems were identified that convert nitrogen to ammonia, sometimes even catalytically but often operating via ill-defined mechanisms. The original discovery is described in an early review:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Vol'pin and co-workers, using a non-protic Lewis acid, aluminium tribromide, were able to demonstrate the truly catalytic effect of titanium by treating dinitrogen with a mixture of titanium tetrachloride, metallic aluminium, and aluminium tribromide at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, either in the absence or in the presence of a solvent, e.g. benzene. As much as 200&amp;nbsp;mol of ammonia per mol of TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was obtained after hydrolysis.…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatt|first=J.|last2=Leigh|first2=G. J.|title=Nitrogen Fixation|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|date=1972|volume=1|page=121|doi=10.1039/cs9720100121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:NitrogenReduction.png|Synthetic nitrogen reduction&lt;ref name=Yandulov/&gt;|thumb|400px|right]]
The quest for well defined intermediates led to the characterization of many [[transition metal dinitrogen complex]]es.  Few of these well-defined complexes function catalytically, their behavior illuminated likely stages in nitrogen fixation.  Fruitful early studies focused on M(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[dppe]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mo, W), which protonates to give intermediates with ligand M=N−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1995, a molybdenum(III) amido complex was discovered that cleaved N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give the corresponding molybdenum(VI) nitride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dinitrogen Cleavage by a Three-Coordinate Molybdenum(III) Complex|first1=Catalina E.|last1= Laplaza |first2= Christopher C.|last2= Cummins |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=1995|volume=268|issue=5212|pages= 861–863|doi=10.1126/science.268.5212.861|pmid=17792182|bibcode=1995Sci...268..861L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and related terminal nitrido complexes have been used to make [[nitriles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=John J.|last1= Curley |first2=Emma L. |last2=Sceats|first3= Christopher C.|last3= Cummins |title=A Cycle for Organic Nitrile Synthesis via Dinitrogen Cleavage|journal=[[J.

In 2003 a molybdenum amido complex was found to catalyze the reduction of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, albeit with few turnovers.&lt;ref name=Yandulov&gt;{{cite journal|first=Dmitry V. |last=Yandulov |author2-link=Richard R.

Nitrogen adds end-on to the molybdenum atom, and the bulky HIPT substituents prevent the formation of the stable and nonreactive Mo−N=N−Mo [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]. In this isolated pocket is the Mo−N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The proton donor is a [[pyridinium]] salt of weakly coordinating counter anion. The [[reducing agent]] is decamethylchromocene. All ammonia formed is collected as the HCl salt by trapping the distillate with a HCl solution.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note also that, although the dinitrogen complex is shown in brackets, this species can be isolated and characterized. Here the brackets do not indicate that the intermediate is not observed.&lt;/ref&gt; In these systems, like the biological one, hydrogen is provided to the substrate heterolytically, by means of protons and a strong [[reducing agent]] rather than with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself.

In 2011, yet another molybdenum-based system was discovered, but with a diphosphorus [[pincer ligand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arashiba | first1 = Kazuya | first2 = Yoshihiro | last2 = Miyake | first3 = Yoshiaki | last3 = Nishibayashi | year = 2011 | title = A molybdenum complex bearing PNP-type pincer ligands leads to the catalytic reduction of dinitrogen into ammonia | url = | journal = Nature Chemistry | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 120–125 | doi = 10.1038/nchem.906 | pmid = 21258384 | bibcode = 2011NatCh...3..120A }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photochemistry|Photolytic]] nitrogen splitting is also considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rebreyend | first1 = C. | last2 = de Bruin | first2 = B. | year = 2014 | title = Photolytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Splitting: A Road to Sustainable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Production? | url = | journal = Angew.

[[File:Secretary Pompeo Conducts airborne questions and answers (43821739051).jpg|thumb|Members of the press ask questions of US Secretary of State [[Mike Pompeo]]]]
'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Political journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|publisher=mundoelectoral.com|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="68897">'''Present day Mars habitability analogue environments on Earth''' are environments that share potentially relevant [[astrobiological]] conditions with Mars. These include sites that are analogues of potential subsurface habitats, and deep subsurface habitats.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt; For analogues more generally see [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites]].

A few places on Earth, such as the hyper-arid core of the high Atacama desert and the McMurdo dry valleys in Antarctica approach the dryness of current Mars surface conditions. In some parts of Antarctica, the only water available is in films of brine on salt / ice interfaces. There is life there, but it is rare, in low numbers, and often hidden below the surface of rocks (endoliths), making the life hard to detect. Indeed, these sites are used for testing sensitivity of future life detection instruments for Mars.

Other analogues duplicate some of the conditions that may occur in particular locations on Mars. These include ice caves, the icy fumaroles of [[Mount Erebus]], hot springs, or the sulfur rich mineral deposits of the Rio Tinto region in Spain. Other analogues include regions of deep permafrost and high alpine regions with plants and microbes adapted to aridity, cold and UV radiation with similarities to Mars conditions.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University|title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf|publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrestonDartnell2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lewisdartnell.com/en-gb/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/18-Preston-Dartnell2014_IJA.pdf|last1=Preston|first1=Louisa J.|last2=Dartnell|first2=Lewis R.|title=Planetary habitability: lessons learned from terrestrial analogues|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2014|pages=81–98|issn=1473-5504|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000396|bibcode=2014IJAsB..13...81P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Mars analogue environments are used for furthering the study of [[astrobiology]]. For instance, they are used for testing life detection instruments to be sent to Mars, as a source for species to be tested for their ability to survive on Mars, and as a way to study how Earth life copes in conditions that resemble conditions on Mars. They may also give us some insight into adaptations that native Mars life could use to survive.

==Precision of analogues==
Mars surface conditions are not exactly reproduced anywhere on Earth&lt;!-- is it that the surface conditions "are not" reproduced or "cannot" be reproduced? and why is that? is it primarily due to differences in atmosphere? sentence should give a reason --&gt; so Earth surface analogues for Mars are necessarily partial analogues. Some Earth cave and deep subsurface analogues may be more exact analogues of Mars surface conditions (apart from the levels of gravity), if similar conditions occur on Mars. Here are some of the most significant differences between Earth and Mars surface conditions, with remarks on Mars' closest analogues on Earth:

* '''Ionizing radiation'''. Curiosity measured levels on Mars similar to the interior of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), which is far higher than surface Earth levels - however adaptations for desiccation resistance also give some Earth microbes high levels of ionizing radiation resistance - they can repair single and double breaks of their DNA within hours using the example of still intact DNA to repair breaks in the damaged DNA.&lt;ref name="DieserBattista2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dieser|first1=M.|last2=Battista|first2=J.

* '''Atmosphere'''. The Mars atmosphere is a near vacuum while Earth's is not. However, as a result of desiccation resistance, some lifeforms can survive even the vacuum of space in dormant states, and Mars simulation experiments show that some Earth microbes can metabolize in the near vacuum conditions of Mars.&lt;ref name="BilliViaggiu2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_url?url=http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles_Cockell/publication/49810974_Damage_escape_and_repair_in_dried_Chroococcidiopsis_spp._from_hot_and_cold_deserts_exposed_to_simulated_space_and_martian_conditions/links/0c960530543245cde9000000.pdf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=T&amp;oi=gsb-gga&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ei=M2AqVeLzG-fq0AG5xYGACA&amp;scisig=AAGBfm1aHrkKehQaYpPYGQ9mjRxVTxPS0Q|last1=Billi|first1=Daniela|last2=Viaggiu|first2=Emanuela|last3=Cockell|first3=Charles S.|last4=Rabbow|first4=Elke|last5=Horneck|first5=Gerda|last6=Onofri|first6=Silvano|title=Damage Escape and Repair in DriedChroococcidiopsisspp. from Hot and Cold Deserts Exposed to Simulated Space and Martian Conditions|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=1|year=2011|pages=65–73|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2009.0430|bibcode=2011AsBio..11...65B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dlrMarsStudy"&gt;[http://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-3409/ Surviving the conditions on Mars] DLR, 26 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre de Vera [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504812000098 Lichens as survivors in space and on Mars] Fungal Ecology

Earth does however have some areas though that are highly oxidizing, such as the soda lakes, and though not direct analogues, they create conditions that may be duplicated in thin films of brines on Mars. Earth even has some perchlorates, the most oxidized state, in its deserts, with an estimated {{convert|100000|to|3000000|tonne}} "global inventory".&lt;ref&gt;

* '''Temperature'''. Nowhere on Earth reproduces the extreme changes in temperature that happen within a single day on Mars.
* '''Dry ice'''. The Mars surface consists of dry ice in many areas. Even in equatorial regions, dry ice mixed with water forms frosts for about 100 days of the year. On Earth, although temperatures on Earth briefly get cold enough for dry ice to form in the Antarctic interior at high altitudes, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is too low for dry ice to form because the depositional temperature for dry ice on Earth under 1 bar of pressure is {{convert|-140|C|F|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="AgeeOrton2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agee|first1=Ernest|last2=Orton|first2=Andrea|last3=Rogers|first3=John|title=CO2Snow Deposition in Antarctica to Curtail Anthropogenic Global Warming|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology|volume=52|issue=2|year=2013|pages=281–288|issn=1558-8424|doi=10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|url=https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0110.1|bibcode=2013JApMC..52..281A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the lowest temperature recorded in Antarctica is {{convert|−94.7|C|F|1|abbr=on}}, recorded in 2010 by satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antarctica records unofficial coldest temperature ever|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2013/12/10/antarctica-cold-record/3950019/|agency=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These partial analogues are still very useful, for instance for:&lt;ref name="PrestonDartnell2014"/&gt;

* Testing life detection equipment which may one day be sent to Mars
* Studying conditions for preservation of past life on Mars
* Studying adaptations to conditions similar to those that may occur on Mars

==Atacama desert arid core==
The [[Atacama desert]] plateau lies at an altitude of 3,000 meters and lies between the Pacific and the Andes mountains. Its Mars like features include

* '''Hyper arid''' conditions
* '''Cold''' compared to most arid deserts because of the altitude

The Yungay area at the core of the Atacama desert used to be considered the driest area on Earth for more than a decade, until the discovery that [[#Maria Elena South|Maria Elena South]] is drier in results published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AstrobioMariaElenaSouth"/&gt; It can go centuries without rainfall, and parts of it have been [[hyper-arid]] for 150&amp;nbsp;million years. The older regions in this area have salts that are amongst the closest analogues of salts on Mars because these regions have nitrate deposits that contain not only the usual chlorides, but also sulfates, [[chlorate]]s, chromates, iodates, and perchlorates.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"/&gt; The infrared spectra are similar to the spectra of bright soil regions of Mars.&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues/&gt;

The Yungay area has been used for testing instruments intended for future life detection missions on Mars, such as the Sample Analysis at Mars instruments for [[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]], the Mars Organic Analyzer for [[ExoMars]], and Solid3 for [[Icebreaker Life]], which in 2011, in a test of its capabilities, was able to find a new "microbial oasis" for life two meters below the surface of the Atacama desert.&lt;ref name="Solid32011"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3242637|last1=Parro|first1=Victor|last2=de Diego-Castilla|first2=Graciela|last3=Moreno-Paz|first3=Mercedes|last4=Blanco|first4=Yolanda|last5=Cruz-Gil|first5=Patricia|last6=Rodríguez-Manfredi|first6=José A.|last7=Fernández-Remolar|first7=David|last8=Gómez|first8=Felipe|last9=Gómez|first9=Manuel J.|last10=Rivas|first10=Luis A.|last11=Demergasso|first11=Cecilia|last12=Echeverría|first12=Alex|last13=Urtuvia|first13=Viviana N.|last14=Ruiz-Bermejo|first14=Marta|last15=García-Villadangos|first15=Miriam|last16=Postigo|first16=Marina|last17=Sánchez-Román|first17=Mónica|last18=Chong-Díaz|first18=Guillermo|last19=Gómez-Elvira|first19=Javier|title=A Microbial Oasis in the Hypersaline Atacama Subsurface Discovered by a Life Detector Chip: Implications for the Search for Life on Mars|journal=Astrobiology|volume=11|issue=10|year=2011|pages=969–996|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0654|bibcode=2011AsBio..11..969P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues2&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University|title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 2.6.1|url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf|publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF|date=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AtacamaMicrobialOasis&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-02/f-sf-mod021612.php Microbial oasis discovered beneath the Atacama Desert], PUBLIC RELEASE: 16 FEB 2012, [[FECYT]] - SPANISH FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY&lt;/ref&gt; It is the current testing site for the Atacama Rover Astrobiology Drilling Studies (ARADS) project to improve technology and strategies for life detection on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mars rover tests driving, drilling and detecting life in Chile's high desert|url=http://www.astrobio.net/also-in-news/mars-rover-tests-driving-drilling-detecting-life-chiles-high-desert/|website=Nasa Astrobiology Magazine|date=Mar 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Tests Life-Detection Drill in Earth’s Driest Place|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasa-tests-life-detection-drill-in-earth-s-driest-place|website=NASA Press Release|date=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments conducted on Mars have also been successfully repeated in this region. In 2003, a group led by [[Chris McKay]] repeated the [[Viking Lander]] experiments in this region and got the same results as those of the Viking landers on Mars: decomposition of the organics by non biological processes.

===Maria Elena South===
This site is even drier than the Yungay area. It was found through a systematic search for drier regions than Yungay in the Atacama desert, using relative humidity data loggers set up from 2008 to 2012, with the results published in 2015.&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt; The relative humidity is the same as the lowest relative humidity measured by Curiosity.&lt;ref name="AstrobioMariaElenaSouth"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Andrew|title=Driest Place on Earth Hosts Life|url=http://www.astrobio.net/extreme-life/driest-place-on-earth-hosts-life/|website=NASA Astrobiology Magazine (online)|publisher=NASA|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This region's maximum atmospheric relative humidity is 54.7% compared with 86.8% for the Yungay region.

The following living organisms were also found in this region:
* '''''[[Actinobacteria]]:''''' [[Actinobacterium]], [[Aciditerrmonas]], and [[Geodermatophilus]]
* '''''[[Proteobacteria]]:''''' [[Caulobacter]] and [[Sphyingomonas]]
* '''''[[Firmicutes]]:''''' [[Firmicutes]] and [[Clostridiales]]
* '''''[[Acidobacteria]]:''''' [[Acidobacterium]]
* 16 new species of [[Streptomyces]], 5 of [[Bacillus]] and 1 of Geodermatophilus.

There was no decrease in the numbers of species as the soil depth increased down to a depth of one meter, although different microbes inhabited different soil depths. There was no colonization of Gypsum, showing the extreme dryness of the site.

No [[archaea]] was detected in this region using the same methods that detected archaea in other regions of the Atacama desert. The researchers said that if this is confirmed in studies of similarly dry sites, it could mean that "there may be adry limit for this domain of life on Earth"&lt;ref name="Azua-BustosCaro-Lara2015"/&gt;

[[File:Trek-browse.jpg|thumb|Researchers scout out field sites in Antarctica's Beacon Valley, one of the most Mars-like places on Earth. Image credit: NASA]]
These valleys lie on the edge of the Antarctic plateau. They are kept clear of ice and snow by fast [[katabatic wind]]s that blow from the plateau down through the valleys. As a result, they are amongst the coldest and driest areas in the world.

The central region of [[Beacon Valley]] is considered to be one of the best terrestrial analogues for the current conditions on Mars. There is snowdrift and limited melting around the edges and occasionally in the central region, but for the most part, moisture is only found as thin films of brine around permafrost structures. It has slightly alkaline salt rich soil.&lt;ref name="McKay2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/snow-recurrence-sets-the-depth-of-dry-permafrost-at-high-elevations-in-the-mcmurdo-dry-valleys-of-antarctica/CF01B0520168E3A900CD4BD360049E2F/core-reader |last1=McKay |first1=Christopher P. |title=Snow recurrence sets the depth of dry permafrost at high elevations in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica |journal=Antarctic Science |volume=21 |issue=01 |year=2008 |page=89 |issn=0954-1020 |doi=10.1017/S0954102008001508}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PlanetaryAnalogues3&gt;{{cite web |last1=The Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, The Open University |title=TN2: The Catalogue of Planetary Analogues, section 1.6.3 |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/The_Catalogue_of_Planetary_Analogues.pdf |publisher=Under ESA contract: 4000104716/11/NL/AF |date=December 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Don Juan pond===
This small pond in Antarctica, 100 meters by 300 meters, and 10&amp;nbsp;cm deep, is of great interest for studying the limits of habitability for present day life on Mars.

Research using a time lapse camera shows that it is partly fed by deliquescing salts revealing dark tracks that resemble the Recurrent Slope Lineae on Mars. The salts absorb water by deliquescence only, at times of high humidity, then flows down the slope as salty brines. These then mix with snow melt, which feeds the lake. The first part of this process may be related to the processes that form the [[Seasonal flows on warm Martian slopes|Recurring Slope Lineae]] (RSLs) on Mars.&lt;ref name="DicksonHead2013"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130130/srep01166/full/srep01166.html#supplementary-information|last1=Dickson|first1=James L.|last2=Head|first2=James W.|last3=Levy|first3=Joseph S.|last4=Marchant|first4=David R.|title=Don Juan Pond, Antarctica: Near-surface CaCl2-brine feeding Earth's most saline lake and implications for Mars|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=3|year=2013|issn=2045-2322|doi=10.1038/srep01166|bibcode=2013NatSR...3E1166D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stacey|first1=Kevin|title=How the world’s saltiest pond gets its salt - describing the research of Jay Dickson and Jim Head|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2013/02/antarctica|date=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has an exceptionally low water activity of 0.3 to 0.6. Though microbes have been cultivated from it, they have not been shown to be able to reproduce in the salty conditions present in the lake, and it is possible that they only got there through being washed in by the rare occasions of snow melt feeding the lake. If this turns out to be the case, it may possibly be the only natural water body of any size without indigenous life on the Earth.

===Blood Falls===
{{Wide image|Blood Falls by Peter Rejcek.jpg|400px|[[Blood Falls]] seeps from the end of the Taylor Glacier into Lake Bonney. The tent at left provides a sense of scale }}

[[Image:blood falls1 f Low Res nsf.gov.jpg|thumb|A schematic cross-section of Blood Falls showing how subglacial microbial communities have survived in cold, darkness, and absence of oxygen for a million years in brine water below [[Taylor Glacier]].]]

This unusual flow of melt water from below the glacier gives scientists access to an environment they could otherwise only explore by drilling (which would also risk contaminating it). The melt water source is a subglacial pool of unknown size which sometimes overflows. Biogeochemical analysis shows that the water is marine in source originally. One hypothesis is that the source may be the remains of an ancient fjord that occupied the Taylor valley in the [[tertiary period]]. The ferrous iron dissolved in the water oxidizes as the water reaches the surface, turning the water blood red.&lt;ref name="DachwaldMikucki2014"/&gt;

[[Blood Falls]] was used as the target for testing [[IceMole]] in November 2014.

At {{convert|4500|m|ft}}, [[Qaidam Basin]] is the plateau with highest average elevation on the Earth. The atmospheric pressure is 50% - 60% of sea level pressures, and as a result of the thin atmosphere it has high levels of UV radiation, and large temperature swings from day to night. Also, the Himalayas to the South block humid air from India, making it hyper arid.

In the most ancient playas (Da Langtang) at the north west corner of the plateau, the evaporate salts are magnesium sulfates (sulfates are common on Mars). This combined with the Mars like conditions make it an interesting analogue of the Martian salts and salty regolith. An expedition found eight strains of [[Haloarchaea|halobacteria]] inhabiting the salts, similar to some species of [[Virgibacillus]], [[Oceanobacillus]], [[Halobacillus]], and Ter-ribacillus.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A., et al.

Two sites of special interest: Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill, two sets of cold saline springs on [[Axel Heiberg Island]] that flow with almost constant temperature and flow rate throughout the year. The air temperatures are comparable to the McMurdo dry valleys, range -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -20&amp;nbsp;°C (for the McMurdo dry valleys -15&amp;nbsp;°C to -40&amp;nbsp;°C). The island is an area of thick permafrost with low precipitation, leading to desert conditions. The water from the springs has a temperature of between -4&amp;nbsp;°C and 7&amp;nbsp;°C. A variety of minerals precipitate out of the springs including gypsum, and at Colour Peak crystals of the metastable mineral [[ikaite]] ({{chem|Ca|C|O|3}}·6{{chem|H|2|O}}) which decomposes rapidly when removed from freezing water.&lt;ref&gt;Impey, Chris, Jonathan Lunine, and José Funes, eds.

===Colour Lake Fen===
This is another Mars analogue habitat in [[Axel Heiberg Island]] close to Colour Peak and Gypsum Hill. The frozen soil and permafrost hosts many microbial communities that are tolerant of anoxic, acid, saline and cold conditions. Most are in survival rather than colony forming mode. Colour Lake Fen is a good terrestrial analogue of the saline acidic brines that once existed in the Meridani Planum region of Mars and may possibly still exist on the martian surface.

== Permafrost soils ==
Much of the water on Mars is permanently frozen, mixed with the rocks. So terrestrial permafrosts are a good analogue.

As well as analogues of ice fumaroles on Mars, if they exist, they may also be useful analogues for hydrothermally heated ice caves on Mars more generally if they exist.

== Cave systems ==
There are several almost enclosed ecosystems below the surface of the Earth, in cave habitats, which are especially good analogues for Mars as similar environments might exist there. And the mines give access to deep subsurface environments which turn out to be inhabited on the Earth, and may possibly exist on Mars.&lt;ref name="AertsRöling2014"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/4/535/htm#322SubsurfaceEnvironments|last1=Aerts|first1=Joost|last2=Röling|first2=Wilfred|last3=Elsaesser|first3=Andreas|last4=Ehrenfreund|first4=Pascale|title=Biota and Biomolecules in Extreme Environments on Earth: Implications for Life Detection on Mars|journal=Life|volume=4|issue=4|year=2014|pages=535–565|issn=2075-1729|doi=10.3390/life4040535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basaltic lava tube caves===
The only caves found so far on Mars are lava tube caves. These are insulated to some extent from surface conditions and may retain ice also when there is none left on the surface, and may have access to chemicals such as hydrogen from serpentization to fuel chemosynthetic life. Lava tubes on Earth have microbial mats, and mineral deposits inhabited by microbes.

The [[Snottite]]s in the toxic sulfur cave [[Cueva de Villa Luz]] flourish on Hydrogen Sulfide gas and though some are aerobes (though only needing low levels of oxygen), some of these species (e.g. Acidianus), like those that live around hydrothermal vents, are able to survive independent of a source of oxygen.

So magnesium sulfate is a likely component of cold brines on the planet, especially with the limited availability of subsurface ice. Terrestrial magnesium sulfate lakes have similar chemical and physical properties. They also have a wide range of halophilic organisms, in all the three [[Kingdom (biology)#The three domains of life|Kingdoms of life]] (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota), in the surface and near subsurface.&lt;ref name="FosterKing2010"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063309002463|last1=Foster|first1=Ian S.|last2=King|first2=Penelope L.|last3=Hyde|first3=Brendt C.|last4=Southam|first4=Gordon|title=Characterization of halophiles in natural {{chem|Mg|S|O|4}} salts and laboratory enrichment samples: Astrobiological implications for Mars|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=58|issue=4|year=2010|pages=599–615|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2009.08.009|bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58..599F}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the abundance of algae and bacteria, in alkaline hypersaline conditions, they are of astrobiological interest for both past and present life on Mars.

These lakes are most common in Western Canada, and the northern part of Washington state, USA. One of the examples, is Basque Lake 2 in Western Columbia, which is highly concentrated in magnesium sulfate. In summer it deposits epsomite ("Epsom salts"). In winter, it deposits [[meridianiite]]. This is named after [[Meridiani Planum]] where Opportunity rover found crystal molds in sulfate deposits ([[Vugs]]) which are thought to be remains of this mineral which have since been dissolved or dehydrated.

Another example is [[Spotted Lake]], which shows a wide variety of minerals, most of them sulfates, with sodium, magnesium and calcium as cations.

Though many of the experiments use these lakes as an analogue for ancient Mars, some researchers also have investigated them as an analogue to explore the possibility of microbes that could inhabit cold magnesium sulfate rich brines in present-day Mars. Some of the microbes isolated have been able to survive the high concentrations of magnesium sulfates found in martian soils, also at low temperatures that may be found on Mars.&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3989109|last1=Kilmer|first1=Brian R.|last2=Eberl|first2=Timothy C.|last3=Cunderla|first3=Brent|last4=Chen|first4=Fei|last5=Clark|first5=Benton C.|last6=Schneegurt|first6=Mark A.|title=Molecular and phenetic characterization of the bacterial assemblage of Hot Lake, WA, an environment with high concentrations of magnesium sulphate, and its relevance to Mars|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|volume=13|issue=1|year=2014|pages=69–80|issn=1473-5504|doi=10.1017/S1473550413000268|pmid=24748851|bibcode=2014IJAsB..13...69K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KilmerEberl2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CrislerNewville2012"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3277918|last1=Crisler|first1=J.D.|last2=Newville|first2=T.M.|last3=Chen|first3=F.|last4=Clark|first4=B.C.|last5=Schneegurt|first5=M.A.|title=Bacterial Growth at the High Concentrations of Magnesium Sulfate Found in Martian Soils|journal=Astrobiology|volume=12|issue=2|year=2012|pages=98–106|issn=1531-1074|doi=10.1089/ast.2011.0720|pmid=22248384|bibcode=2012AsBio..12...98C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Searching salt for answers about life on Earth, Mars|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120809151324.htm|website=Science Daily - press release from Wichita State University|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfates (for instance of sodium, magnesium and calcium) are also common in other continental evaporates (such as the salars of the Atacama desert), as distinct from salt beds associated with marine deposits which tend to consist mainly of halites (chlorides).&lt;ref name="BarbieriStivaletta2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbieri|first1=Roberto|last2=Stivaletta|first2=Nunzia|title=Continental evaporites and the search for evidence of life on Mars|journal=Geological Journal|volume=46|issue=6|year=2011|pages=513–524|issn=0072-1050|doi=10.1002/gj.1326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subglacial lakes ==
[[File:Lake Vostok drill 2011.jpg|thumb|Lake Vostok drill 2011]]
Subglacial lakes such as [[Lake Vostok]] may give analogues of Mars habitats beneath ice sheets. In 2001, Duxbury et al. suggested that processes similar to the ones that maintain Lake Vostok liquid could work on Mars.

Sub glacial lakes are kept liquid partly by the pressure of the depth of ice, but that contributes only a few degrees of temperature rise. The main effect that keeps them liquid is the insulation of the ice blocking escape of heat from the interior of the Earth, similarly to the insulating effect of deep layers of rock. As for deep rock layers, they don't require extra geothermal heating below a certain depth.

In the case of Mars, the depth needed for geothermal melting of the basal area of a sheet of ice is 4-6 kilometers. The ice layers are probably only 3.4 to 4.2&amp;nbsp;km in thickness for the north polar cap. However, Duzbury et al. showed that the situation is different if you consider a lake that is already melted. When they applied their model to Mars, they showed that a liquid layer, once melted (initially open to the surface of the ice), could remain stable at any depth over 600 meters even in absence of extra geothermal heating.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JE001254/pdf|last1=Duxbury|first1=N.

So, according to their model, if the polar regions had a subsurface lake perhaps formed originally through friction as a subglacial lake at times of favourable axial tilt, then supplied by accumulating layers of snow on top as the ice sheets thickened, they suggest that it could still be there. If so, it could be occupied by similar lifeforms to those that could survive in Lake Vostok.&lt;ref name="DuxburyZotikov2001" /&gt;

Ground penetrating radar could detect these lakes because of the high radar contrast between water and ice or rock. MARSIS, the ground penetrating radar on ESA's Mars Express is our best instrument for the job. After several searches, it hasn't found anything yet.&lt;ref name="LasueMangold2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lasue|first1=Jeremie|last2=Mangold|first2=Nicolas|last3=Hauber|first3=Ernst|last4=Clifford|first4=Steve|last5=Feldman|first5=William|last6=Gasnault|first6=Olivier|last7=Grima|first7=Cyril|last8=Maurice|first8=Sylvestre|last9=Mousis|first9=Olivier|title=Quantitative Assessments of the Martian Hydrosphere|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=174|issue=1–4|year=2012|page=191|issn=0038-6308|doi=10.1007/s11214-012-9946-5|bibcode=2013SSRv..174..155L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their resolution isn't that great, however, around a kilometer. We can say that Mars doesn't seem to have an equivalent of our Lake Vostok (250&amp;nbsp;km by 50&amp;nbsp;km by 0.43&amp;nbsp;km deep) at present. It could still have small subglacial lakes of up to a kilometer or so in diameter.

== Subsurface life kilometers below the surface ==

Investigations of life in deep mines, and drilling beneath the ocean depths may give an insight into possibilities for life in the Mars Hydrosphere and other deep subsurface habitats, if they exist.

== Alpine and permafrost lichens ==
In high alpine and polar regions, lichens have to cope with conditions of high UV fluxes low temperatures and arid environments. This is especially so when the two factors, polar regions and high altitudes are combined. These conditions occur in the high mountains of Antarctica, where lichens grow at altitudes up to 2,000 meters with no liquid water, just snow and ice. Researchers described this as the most Mars-like environment on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Pierre_de_Vera/publication/258227207_Adaptation_of_an_Antarctic_lichen_to_Martian_niche_conditions_can_occur_within_34_days/links/00b4952e11f3088291000000.pdf|last1=de Vera|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Schulze-Makuch|first2=Dirk|last3=Khan|first3=Afshin|last4=Lorek|first4=Andreas|last5=Koncz|first5=Alexander|last6=Möhlmann|first6=Diedrich|last7=Spohn|first7=Tilman|title=Adaptation of an Antarctic lichen to Martian niche conditions can occur within 34 days|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=98|year=2014|pages=182–190|issn=0032-0633|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2013.07.014|bibcode=2014P&amp;SS...98..182D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During [[World War II]] the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) launched a large-scale information and propaganda campaign both at home and abroad through radio broadcasts, newspapers, posters, photographs, films and other forms of media, but ''psychological warfare'' operations had been run by special military units.

After the end of the war President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] transferred the operations of the OWI as well as control over [[Voice of America]] overseas radio network to the Interim International Information Service (IIS) within the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=156|plainurl=yes}}|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department, eager to assert leadership in this area, organized a civilian-sponsored project on new methods and approaches to [[Cold War]] propaganda, code-named Project Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=155|plainurl=yes}}|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convened in October 1950 at the State Department's request, it brought together for a period of almost three months a group of twenty-one distinguished scientists, social scientists, and historians, most of whom were academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/17/3/399/392265/Truth-Is-Our-Weapon-Project-TROY-Political-Warfare|title="Truth Is Our Weapon": Project TROY, Political Warfare, and Government-Academic Relations in the National Security State|date=1 June 2007|first=Allan|last=Needell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be assumed that the Truman administration tried to implement plans established by the Project Troy in the project ''Overload and Delay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=77|plainurl=yes}}|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the latter was to break the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system by increasing the number of input points in the system and by creating complex and unpredictable situations requiring action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=76|plainurl=yes}}|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 1951 Robert J. Hooker delivered a memorandum on the Troy Report to the Director of the [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]] [[Paul Nitze]], asserting that the report "deserves the most serious consideration. It lays down principles and techniques for the conduct of political warfare which, with few exceptions, seem worthy of adoption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1950-55Intel/d59 |title=Memorandum From Robert J.

'''''Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism''''' is a non-fiction book by art historian [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], who aims to reconcile Western [[art history]] to artistic cultural production around the world from all time periods.

In the book, Summers creates his own art history methodology to explore spatial attributes of art and architecture and their connection to social functions throughout time. He disregards traditional formal and iconographical art historical models, aiming to explore cultural traditions from around the world within the chapters.&lt;ref name="Elkins"&gt;Elkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis and chapter breakdown==

===Introduction===

Summers divides the world into "Real Space", the space we share with other people and objects, and "Virtual Space", the space that exists within two dimensions which people "seem to see." He explains, “Real space is the space we find ourselves sharing with other people and things; virtual space is space represented on a surface, space we ‘”seem to see.’ In fact, space can only be represented visually as virtual, but at the same time we always encounter a virtual space in a real space.” &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facture===

Facture is understood as an indication that an object has been made. Summers considers concepts of form, such as seriality, diachronicity, etc. Some are given new definitions, others are adjusted in relation to the existing literature; others do not change meaning at all. Summers relates and interconnects the concepts together in relationship to artworks such as [[Benvenuto Cellini]]’s ''Salt Cellar of Francis I'', of 1539-43 to other artworks like Late Neolithic Arrowheads. The conceptual themes, such as fracture, become critical tools throughout the book.&lt;ref name="Elkins"/&gt;

===Places===

Places is based on that “places, as real social spaces, provide the possibility for the actual statement of relations of difference" &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The chapter discusses the concepts of difference (emphasizing its spatial qualities), centers and diasporas, shrines precincts, boundaries, paths, alignments and orientations, and the idea of a periphery and division of land outside the sanctum. For example, a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers, 125-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Appropriation of the Centre===

The Appropriation of the Centre gathers Egyptian, Akkadian, Roman, Khmer, Chinese, and French examples to articulate the change from cultures in which rulers appropriate the center. Rulers use centre as, “the point where the world is defined, with its values of collective generation, and the combination of notional ‘cosmic’ order and vital centrality provides the political order” &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 201&lt;/ref&gt; For example,  [[Shi Huangdi]]’s capital of [[Xianyang]].&lt;ref name="Elkins"/&gt;

===Images===
Images opens with a realignment of discussions on the origins of images, proposing that "images are fashioned in order to make present in social spaces what for some reason is not present" &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 252.&lt;/ref&gt; They are therefore substitutive, and it is important to study their "conditions of presentation" and "the relations of those conditions to our own spatiotemporality." &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planarity===
Planarity follows the development of planar orders "as they shape and enable all kinds of routine, second-natural practices and activities" &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 344.&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts that follow from planarity include order (which is one of the basic relations between parts of an image, but is also "analogous to the order of the parts of something to which the image refers," &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; measure and proportion, hierarchy, framing and division, symmetries, oppositions, profiles and frontal figures, harmony, ratio, grids, and maps.&lt;ref name="Elkins"/&gt;

===Virtuality===
Virtuality concerns the capacity to complete images by seeing three dimensions in two or by perceiving what is absent from what is given. Virtuality raises the problem of illusion, and effigies, narratives, and doubting or skepticism.&lt;ref name="Elkins"/&gt;

===Conditions of Modernity===
Conditions of Modernity examines “the conditions of presentation, trying to characterize the formation of Western modernity as a tradition of place and image-making traditions.” &lt;ref&gt;Summers, 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Summers examines [[László Moholy-Nagy]]’s, ''Untitled (Looking Down from the Wireless Tower, Berlin)'' of 1932.

==Post-Formalism==

Summers proposes that Western art history and world art history can be united by Post-Formalism, a new type of [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] artistic interpretation that privileges the form or shape of the art object. Throughout the text, Summers uses various definitions he has created or re-interpreted to better understand art objects based primarily on their form, which he believes will provide different cultural or social meanings of art.

[[File:ISS_impact_risk.jpg|thumb|300px|right|NASA's illustration showing high impact risk areas for the International Space Station]]
'''Safety engineering''' is an engineering discipline which assures that engineered systems provide acceptable levels of [[safety]]. It is strongly related to [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]],  and the subset [[system safety]] engineering. Safety engineering assures that a [[life-critical system]] behaves as needed, even when components fail.

==Analysis techniques==
Analysis techniques can be split into two categories: qualitative and quantitative methods. Both approaches share the goal of finding causal dependencies between a hazard on system level and failures of individual components. Qualitative approaches focus on the question "What must go wrong, such that a system hazard may not occur?", while quantitative methods aim at providing estimations about probabilities, rates and/or severity of consequences.

[[File:Risk Cost Analysis.jpg|thumb|Risk vs Cost/Complexity&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The complexity of the technical systems such as Improvements of Design and Materials, Planned Inspections, Fool-proof design, and Backup Redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost. The risk can be decreased to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) or ALAPA (as low as practically achievable) levels.

Traditionally, safety analysis techniques rely solely on skill and expertise of the safety engineer. In the last decade model-based approaches have become prominent. In contrast to traditional methods, model-based techniques try to derive relationships between causes and consequences from some sort of model of the system.

===Traditional methods for safety analysis===
The two most common fault modeling techniques are called [[failure mode and effects analysis]] and [[fault tree analysis]]. These techniques are just ways of finding problems and of making plans to cope with failures, as in [[probabilistic risk assessment]]. One of the earliest complete studies using this technique on a commercial nuclear plant was the [[WASH-1400]] study, also known as the Reactor Safety Study or the Rasmussen Report.

====Failure modes and effects analysis====
{{Main|Failure mode and effects analysis}}
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a bottom-up, [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] analytical method which may be performed at either the functional or piece-part level. For functional FMEA, failure modes are identified for each function in a system or equipment item, usually with the help of a functional [[block diagram]]. For piece-part FMEA, failure modes are identified for each piece-part component (such as a valve, connector, resistor, or diode). The effects of the failure mode are described, and assigned a probability based on the [[failure rate]] and failure mode ratio of the function or component.   This quantiazation is difficult for software ---a bug exists or not, and the failure models used for hardware components do not apply.  Temperature and age and manufacturing variability affect a resistor; they do not affect software.

Failure modes with identical effects can be combined and summarized in a Failure Mode Effects Summary. When combined with criticality analysis, FMEA is known as [[Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis]] or FMECA, pronounced "fuh-MEE-kuh".

====Fault tree analysis====
{{Main|Fault tree analysis}}
Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a top-down, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] analytical method.  In FTA, initiating primary events such as component failures, human errors, and external events are traced through [[Boolean logic]] gates to an undesired top event such as an aircraft crash or nuclear reactor core melt. The intent is to identify ways to make top events less probable, and verify that safety goals have been achieved.

[[File:Fault tree.svg|thumb|A fault tree diagram]]

Fault trees are a logical inverse of success trees, and may be obtained by applying [[de Morgan's laws|de Morgan's theorem]] to success trees (which are directly related to [[reliability block diagram]]s).

FTA may be qualitative or quantitative. When failure and event probabilities are unknown, qualitative fault trees may be analyzed for minimal cut sets. For example, if any minimal cut set contains a single base event, then the top event may be caused by a single failure. Quantitative FTA is used to compute top event probability, and usually requires computer software such as CAFTA from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]] or [[SAPHIRE]] from the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].

Some industries use both fault trees and [[event tree]]s. An event tree starts from an undesired initiator (loss of critical supply, component failure etc.) and follows possible further system events through to a series of final consequences. As each new event is considered, a new node on the tree is added with a split of probabilities of taking either branch. The probabilities of a range of "top events" arising from the initial event can then be seen.

==Safety certification==
Typically, safety guidelines prescribe a set of steps, deliverable documents, and exit criterion focused around planning, analysis and design, implementation, verification and validation, configuration management, and quality assurance activities for the development of a safety-critical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rempel|first=Patrick|last2=Mäder|first2=Patrick|last3=Kuschke|first3=Tobias|last4=Cleland-Huang|first4=Jane|date=2014-01-01|title=Mind the Gap: Assessing the Conformance of Software Traceability to Relevant Guidelines|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2568225.2568290|journal=Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering|series=ICSE 2014|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=943–954|doi=10.1145/2568225.2568290|isbn=9781450327565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they typically formulate expectations regarding the creation and use of [[Requirements traceability|traceability]] in the project. For example, depending upon the criticality level of a requirement, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|US Federal Aviation Authority]] guideline [[DO-178C|DO-178B/C]] requires [[Requirements traceability|traceability]] from [[Requirement|requirements]] to [[design]], and from [[Requirement|requirements]] to [[source code]] and executable [[object code]] for software components of a system. Thereby, higher quality traceability information can simplify the certification process and help to establish trust in the maturity of the applied development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mäder|first=P.|last2=Jones|first2=P.

Usually a failure in safety-[[product certification|certified]] systems is acceptable{{by whom|date=April 2015}} if, on average, less than one life per  10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; hours of continuous operation is lost to failure.{as per FAA document AC 25.1309-1A} Most Western [[nuclear reactors]], medical equipment, and commercial [[aircraft]] are certified{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to this level.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The cost versus loss of lives has been considered appropriate at this level (by [[FAA]] for aircraft systems under [[Federal Aviation Regulations]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2025.1309-1A.pdf|title=System Design and Analysis|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|year=1988|page=|pages=|format=pdf|id=Advisory Circular AC&amp;nbsp;25.1309-1A|quote=|ref=|author=ANM-110|section=|sectionurl=|version=|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/arp4754a|title=Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems|last=S–18|first=|publisher=[[Society of Automotive Engineers]]|year=2010|isbn=|page=|pages=|format=|id=ARP4754A|quote=|ref=|author-link=|coauthors=|section=|sectionurl=|version=|accessdate=}}

==Preventing failure==
[[File:Survival redundancy.svg|thumbnail|A [[NASA]] graph shows the relationship between the survival of a crew of astronauts and the amount of [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant]] equipment in their spacecraft (the "MM", Mission Module).]]

Once a failure mode is identified, it can usually be mitigated by adding extra or redundant equipment to the system. For example, nuclear reactors contain dangerous [[radiation]], and nuclear reactions can cause so much [[heat]] that no substance might contain them. Therefore, reactors have emergency core cooling systems to keep the temperature down, shielding to contain the radiation, and engineered barriers (usually several, nested, surmounted by a [[containment building]]) to prevent accidental leakage. Safety-critical systems are commonly required to permit no [[single point of failure|single event or component failure]] to result in a catastrophic failure mode.

Most [[biology|biological]] organisms have a certain amount of redundancy: multiple organs, multiple limbs, etc.

For any given failure, a fail-over or redundancy can almost always be designed and incorporated into a system.

There are two categories of techniques to reduce the probability of failure:
Fault avoidance techniques increase the reliability of individual items (increased design margin, de-rating, etc.).
Fault tolerance techniques increase the reliability of the system as a whole (redundancies, barriers, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;

== Safety and reliability ==
{{details|Inherent safety}}{{details|Reliability engineering}}

Safety engineering and reliability engineering have much in common, but safety is not reliability.  If a medical device fails, it should fail safely; other alternatives will be available to the surgeon.  If the engine on a single-engine aircraft fails, there is no backup.  Electrical power grids are designed for both safety and reliability; telephone systems are designed for reliability, which becomes a safety issue when emergency (e.g. US "911") calls are placed.

[[Probabilistic risk assessment]] has created a close relationship between safety and reliability. Component reliability, generally defined in terms of component [[failure rate]], and external event probability are both used in quantitative safety assessment methods such as FTA. Related probabilistic methods are used to determine system [[Mean time between failures|Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)]], system availability, or probability of mission success or failure. Reliability analysis has a broader scope than safety analysis, in that non-critical failures are considered. On the other hand, higher failure rates are considered acceptable for non-critical systems.

Safety generally cannot be achieved through component reliability alone. Catastrophic failure probabilities of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; per hour correspond to the failure rates of very simple components such as  [[resistor]]s or [[capacitor]]s. A complex system containing hundreds or thousands of components might be able to achieve a MTBF of 10,000 to 100,000 hours, meaning it would fail at 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; per hour. If a system failure is catastrophic, usually the only practical way to achieve 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; per hour failure rate is through redundancy.

When adding equipment is impractical (usually because of expense), then the least expensive form of design is often "inherently fail-safe". That is, change the system design so its failure modes are not catastrophic. Inherent fail-safes are common in medical equipment, traffic and railway signals, communications equipment, and safety equipment.

The typical approach is to arrange the system so that ordinary single failures cause the mechanism to shut down in a safe way (for nuclear power plants, this is termed a [[Passive nuclear safety|passively safe]] design, although more than ordinary failures are covered). Alternately, if the system contains a hazard source such as a battery or rotor, then it may be possible to remove the hazard from the system so that its failure modes cannot be catastrophic. The U.S. Department of Defense Standard Practice for System Safety (MIL–STD–882) places the highest priority on elimination of hazards through design selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One of the most common fail-safe systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the valve sticks open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow. Another common example is that in an [[elevator]] the cable supporting the car keeps [[spring-loaded brake]]s open. If the cable breaks, the brakes grab rails, and the elevator cabin does not fall.

Some systems can never be made fail safe, as continuous availability is needed. For example, loss of engine thrust in flight is dangerous. Redundancy, fault tolerance, or recovery procedures are used for these situations (e.g. multiple independent controlled and fuel fed engines). This also makes the system less sensitive for the reliability prediction errors or quality induced uncertainty for the separate items. On the other hand, failure detection &amp; correction and avoidance of common cause failures becomes here increasingly important to ensure system level reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Principles==

SMM can, for example, use cylinders to model [[dielectric]]/[[metal]] objects in the domain.&lt;ref&gt;

The total-field/scattered-field (TF/SF) formalism where the total field is written as sum of incident and scattered at each point in the domain:
:&lt;math&gt;E_{tot} = E_{inc} + E_{scatt} \ &lt;/math&gt;

By assuming series solutions for the total field, the SMM method transforms the domain into a cylindrical problem. In this domain total field is written in terms of [[Bessel function|Bessel]] and [[Hankel function]] solutions to the cylindrical [[Helmholtz equation]]. SMM method formulation, finally helps compute these coefficients of the cylindrical harmonic functions within the cylinder and outside it, at the same time satisfying EM boundary conditions.

Finally, SMM accuracy can be increased by adding (removing) cylindrical harmonic terms used to model the scattered fields.

SMM, eventually leads to a matrix formalism, and the coefficients are calculated through matrix inversion. For N-cylinders, each scattered field modeled using 2M+1 harmonic terms, SMM requires to solve a N(2M + 1) system of equations. 

==Advantages==

SMM, is a rigorous and accurate method deriving from first principles. Hence, it is guaranteed to be accurate within limits of model, and not show suprious effects of numerical dispersion arising in other techniques like [[Finite-difference time-domain method|FDTD]].

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}}

A '''seat filler''' is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:

# a person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller [[audience]] and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house". &lt;br /&gt;Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
# a person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the [[Academy Awards]] in which many of the audience are either gaining awards, once they win the award the recipient needs to wait for an appropriate time to return to their seat, or because the member of the audience is involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots there are no empty seats.

==Benefits to the Shows==
* Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
* Higher concession sales 
* Fuller audience for a better show experience
* Marketing to a vocal audience
* Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales

==In popular culture==
*In the ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of his friends who works as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Summer of George]]", [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] works as a seat filler at the [[Tony Awards]].
*The plot of the 2004 movie ''[[The Seat Filler]]'' revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
*In the movie ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Call Girl (Family Guy)|Call Girl]]", [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] works as a seat filler for fetuses during [[ultrasounds]].
*In the [[87th Academy Awards]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]] mentions the seat fillers explaining its meaning and jokes with [[Steve Carell]] as if he were a seat filler.

==Terminology==
The term is derived from the [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] {{lang|la|peccatum Sodomiticum}} or "sin of Sodom", which in turn comes from the Ancient Greek word {{lang|grc|Σόδομα}} (Sódoma).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html myetymology.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916041421/http://www.myetymology.com/english/sodomy.html |date=2012-09-16 }}, Sodomy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (chapters 18–20) tells how God wished to destroy the "sinful" cities of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may "know" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the "messengers" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to "do worse" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, "so that they wearied themselves to find the door." (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])

In current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v. Texas'' in which The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that sodomy laws are unconstitutional on June 26, 2003|author=|date=|website=cornell.edu|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406071731/https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cognates in other languages, such as [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|[[:fr:sodomie|sodomie]]}} (verb {{lang|fr|sodomiser}}), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{lang|es|[[:es:sodomía|sodomía]]}} (verb {{lang|es|sodomizar}}), and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[:pt:sodomia|sodomia]]}} (verb {{lang|pt|sodomizar}}), are used exclusively for penetrative anal sex, at least since the early nineteenth century. In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]—human sexuality and the anus—without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.

In modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}. The [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word {{lang|no|[[:no:sodomi|sodomi]]}} carries both senses. In [[Danish language|Danish]], {{lang|da|[[:da:sodomi|sodomi]]}} is rendered as "unnatural [[carnal knowledge]] with [[Gay sexual practices|someone of the same sex]] or (now) with [[Zoophilia|animals]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ordnet.dk/ods/ordbog?query=sodomi "Sodomi"] (''[[Ordbog over det danske Sprog]]'')&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], the word for sodomy,  {{lang|ar|لواط|rtl=yes}} (Arabic pronunciation: {{lang|ar-Latn|liwāṭ}}; Persian pronunciation {{lang|fa-Latn|lavât}}), is derived from the same source as in Western culture, with much the same connotations as English (referring to most sexual acts prohibited by the [[Qur'an]]). Its direct reference is to [[Islamic view of Lot|Lot]] (لوط ''Lūṭ'' in Arabic) and a more literal interpretation of the word is "the practice of Lot", but more accurately it means "the practice of Lot's people" (the Sodomites) rather than Lot himself.
 
The word ''[[wikt:sod#Etymology 2|sod]]'', a noun or verb (to "sod off") used as an insult, is derived from ''sodomite''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Main Entry: sod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422175451/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sod |date=2009-04-22 }}&lt;nowiki&gt;[3,noun]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. "Etymology: short for sodomite.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

While religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that "an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction — and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction — appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, pp. 92–98&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.
Neither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.

Many times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.

Specific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).

In Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. "Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they." (v. 47, NASB) "Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49–50, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word "thus" is the conjunction "ו" which is usually translated "and", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)

There is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and "abomination" is used to describe many sins.

The [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as "There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel," but the word corresponding to "sodomite" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:קדש), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as "[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Roman Empire period===

==== New Testament ====
The [[New Testament]], like the [[Old Testament]], references Sodom as a place of God's anger against sin, but the [[Epistle of Jude]] provides a certain class of sin as causative of its destruction, the meaning of which is disputed.

{{quotation|1=Jude 1:5  I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.
&lt;br&gt;6  And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
&lt;br&gt;7  Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.|2=[[Authorized King James Version]]&lt;br&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Jude%201:7 Compare Jude 1:7 in multiple versions]}}

The Greek word in the New Testament from which the phrase is translated "giving themselves over to fornication", is "ekporneuō" ("ek" and "porneuō"). As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as "sexual immorality".

The Greek words for "strange flesh" are "heteros", which almost always basically denotes "another/other", and "sarx",  a common word for "flesh", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.

In the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall "filthy" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word ("aselgeiais") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).

====Epistle of Jude====
The [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: "just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered "sexual immorality and unnatural desire" is translated "strange flesh" or "false flesh", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.

One theory is that it is just a reference to the "strange flesh" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.&lt;ref&gt;Boswell, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent's Word Studies&lt;/ref&gt;  "out of the order of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset and David Brown&lt;/ref&gt; "Strange" is understood to mean "outside the moral law",&lt;ref&gt;Word pictures in the New Testament, Archibald Thomas Robertson&lt;/ref&gt; ({{bibleverse||Romans|7:3|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Galatians|1:6|KJV}}) while it is doubted that either Lot or the men of Sodom understood that the strangers were angels at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Gn. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philo====
The [[Hellenistic]] [[Jewish]] [[philosopher]] [[Philo]] (20 BC - 50 AD)  described the inhabitants of Sodom in an extra biblical account:

"As men, being unable to bear discreetly a satiety of these things, get restive like cattle, and become stiff-necked, and discard the laws of nature, pursuing a great and intemperate indulgence of gluttony, and drinking, and unlawful connections; for not only did they go mad after other women, and defile the marriage bed of others, but also those who were men lusted after one another, doing unseemly things, and not regarding or respecting their common nature, and though eager for children, they were convicted by having only an abortive offspring; but the conviction produced no advantage, since they were overcome by violent desire; and so by degrees, the men became accustomed to be treated like women, and in this way engendered among themselves the disease of females, and intolerable evil; for they not only, as to effeminacy and delicacy, became like women in their persons, but they also made their souls most ignoble, corrupting in this way the whole race of men, as far as depended on them" (133-35; ET Jonge 422-23).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo The works of Philo a contemporary of Josephius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119043027/http://www.scribd.com/doc/8326130/The-Works-of-Philo |date=2016-01-19 }} Page 528&lt;/ref&gt;

====Josephus====
The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] used the term "Sodomites" in summarizing the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] narrative: "About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches and great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards [[God]], in so much that they did not call to mind the advantages they received from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with Sodomitical practices" "Now when the Sodomites saw the young men to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary degree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved themselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when Lot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to the strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and promised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would expose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither thus were they made ashamed." (''Antiquities'' 1.11.1,3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216095250/http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-1.htm |archivedate=2009-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; — circa AD 96). His assessment goes beyond the Biblical data, though it is seen by conservatives as defining what manner of fornication (Jude 1:7) Sodom was given to.

===Medieval Christendom===
[[File:Dante sodom.jpg|thumb|[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] interview the sodomites, from {{Interlanguage link multi|Guido da Pisa|it}}'s commentary on the ''Commedia'', c. 1345]]

The primarily sexual meaning of the word ''sodomia'' for Christians did not evolve before the 6th century AD. [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], in his novels no. 77 (dating 538) and no. 141 (dating 559) amended to his [[Corpus iuris civilis]], and declared that Sodom's sin had been specifically same-sex activities and desire for them. He also linked "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences"  upon cities as being due to "such crimes",&lt;ref&gt;trans. in Derrick Sherwin Bailey, Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, (London: Longmans, Green, 1955), 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; during a time of recent earthquakes and other disasters (see [[Extreme weather events of 535–536]]). He may have also used the anti-homosexual laws he enacted upon personal and political opponents, in case he could not prove them guilty of anything else.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm&lt;ref&gt;For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior. Individuals might ignore and escape secular laws, but they could not do the same with divine laws, if Justinian declared his novels to be such.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Christians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the 4th century regarded such as worse than murder in his fourth homily on {{bibleverse||Romans|1:26-27|KJV}} [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210204.htm], while [[Paul the Apostle]] in the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' referred to same sex relations as ''"shameful lust"'' and which acts were contrary to nature,  with men suffering a ''"due penalty"'' in their bodies. Just like the Jews, early Christians prior to Justinian I are not known to have used the word ''sodomia'' for the carnal sin they abhorred, though [[Philo of Alexandria]] (20 BC - 50 AD)&lt;ref&gt;Jewish philosopher, Writing on the life of Abraham&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Methodius of Olympus]] (AD 260-312)&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the sin of Sodom&lt;/ref&gt; attributed homosexual relations to Sodom, as may have Josephus, (AD 37 – c. 100)&lt;ref&gt;Antiquities 1.11.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;33-34; ET Jonge 422-23; The Sodom tradition in Romans Biblical Theology Bulletin, Spring, 2004 by Philip F.

Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom may have been forgotten today (as some hold it had been, along with his law novellizations regarding homosexual behavior immediately after his death) had it not been made use of in fake [[Charlemagne|Charlemagnian]] [[capitularies]], fabricated by a [[Franks|Frankish]] monk using the pseudonym Benedictus Levita ("Benedict the Levite") around 850 AD, as part of the [[Pseudo-Isidore]]. Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:

*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' ("No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs")
*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' ("No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them")
*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' ("No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds")

It was in these fake capitularies where Benedictus utilized Justinian's interpretation as a justification for ecclesiastical supremacy over mundane institutions, thereby demanding{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} burning at the stake for carnal sins in the name of Charlemagne himself. Burning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[Nīþ|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.

Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.

Benedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. According to Benedictus, this was why all mundane institutions had to be subjected to ecclesiastical power in order to prevent moral as well as religious laxity causing divine wrath.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]
For delaying reasons described in the article [[Pseudo-Isidore]], but also because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.

This came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W. A. P.|authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning "of Bulgaria".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials. The resulting infamy of sodomy motivated a continuing discrimination and persecution of homosexuals and sexual deviants in general long after the Medieval period had ended. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:

:"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers."
:"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them." ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])

===Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
[[File:Amsterdam sodomites 1730.png|thumb|upright|A [[wanted poster]], published in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in 1730, accusing ten men of "the abominable crime of sodomy" ({{lang|nl|de verfoeyelyke Crimen van Sodomie}})]]

An examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online&lt;/ref&gt;

In France in the 18th century, sodomy was still theoretically a capital crime, and there are a handful of cases where sodomites were executed. However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize "this vice".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}
[[File:Hangin outside Newgate Prison.jpg|left|thumb|An execution taking place outside Newgate Prison]]
Periodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}

In 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing.

==Modern sodomy laws==
{{main|Sodomy law}}

===United States===
{{Main|Sodomy laws in the United States}}

In the 1950s, all states had some form of law criminalizing sodomy, and in 1986 the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting sodomy. However, state legislators and state courts had started to repeal or overturn their sodomy laws, beginning with Illinois in 1961, and thus in 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all sodomy, with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex sodomy.

On June 26, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in a 6–3 decision in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' struck down the [[Texas]] same-sex sodomy law, ruling that this private sexual conduct is protected by the liberty rights implicit in the [[Due process|due process clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], with [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s concurring opinion arguing that they violated equal protection. (''See [[Sodomy law]].)'' This decision invalidated all  [[U.S. state|state]] sodomy laws insofar as they applied to noncommercial conduct in private between consenting civilians and overruled its 1986 ruling in ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' which upheld [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s sodomy law.

In the [[U.S. military]], the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals has ruled that the ''Lawrence v. Texas'' decision applies to Article 125 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], the statute banning sodomy.  In ''United States v. Stirewalt'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in part and in the result): I agree with the result in this case but I "would reserve for another day the questions of whether and how ''Lawrence'' [''v. Texas'', 539 U.S. 558 (2003)] applies to the military. "1  ''Like United States v. Marcum'', "the factual differences between Lawrence and Appellant's case are striking" for the reasons mentioned by the majority as well as the circumstances surrounding the charges themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|title=U.S. v. Stirewalt|author=|date=|website=www.armfor.uscourts.gov|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525185749/http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm|archivedate=25 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stirewalt's conviction of sodomy stood due to the circumstances surrounding the crime. The court went on to say that despite ''Lawrence''{{'}}s application to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" which would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm|title=U.S. v.

''United States v. Meno'' and ''United States v. Bullock'' are two known cases in which consensual sodomy convictions have been overturned in military courts under the ''Lawrence'' precedent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sldn.org/binary-data/SLDN_ARTICLES/pdf_file/2309.pdf United States v.

==Religions==
Views on sodomy in some contemporary [[world religion]]s.

===Judaism===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw ''good''.
:— [[Authorized King James Version|KJV]], {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:49-50|KJV}}).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Classical Jewish texts are seen by many as not stressing the homosexual aspect of the attitude of the inhabitants of Sodom as much as their cruelty and lack of [[hospitality]] to the "stranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|title=A History of Homophobia: 2 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah|author=|date=|website=rictornorton.co.uk|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608042052/http://rictornorton.co.uk/homopho2.htm|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th-century Jewish scholar [[Nachmanides]] wrote, "According to our sages, they were notorious for every evil, but their fate was sealed for their persistence in not supporting the poor and the needy." His contemporary Rabbenu Yonah expresses the same view: "Scripture attributes their annihilation to their failure to practice ''[[tzedakah]]'' [charity or justice]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/publicat/hazon/tzedaka/Tzedakah_Activists_Vs_Sodomites.html|title=Tzedakah Activists Vs.

Prohibitions on same-sex activities among men (#157) and bestiality (#155–156) are among the [[613 commandments]] as listed by [[Maimonides]] in the 12th century; however, their source in [[Leviticus 18]] does not contain the word ''sodomy''. The idea that homosexual intercourse was involved as at least a part of the evil of Sodom arises from the story in [[Genesis 19]] (NIV):

{{quote|Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom—both young and old—surrounded the house. They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them." ({{Bibleref2|Genesis|19:4-7|KJV;NIV|Gen.19:4&amp;ndash;7 compare}}) 
The Hebrew verb used is ''to know'', which can have a sexual meaning in the Bible, but doesn't always, and might have a sexual meaning here, judging from Lot's shocked reaction:
"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing&amp;nbsp;..."}}

===Christianity===
The traditional interpretation sees the primary sin of Sodom as being homoerotic sexual acts,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. J. Gagnon, ''The Bible and Homosexual Practice'', pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf Gagnon, ''Why the Disagreement over the Biblical Witness on Homosexual Practice'', pp. 46–50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512090559/http://www.westernsem.edu/files/westernsem/gagnon_autm05_0.pdf |date=2008-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting the Sodom narrative with [[Leviticus 18]], which lists various sexual crimes, which, according to verses 27 and 28, would result in the land being "defiled":

{{quote|for the inhabitants of the land, who were before you, committed all of these abominations, and the land became defiled; otherwise the land will vomit you out for defiling it, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.}}

Some scholars, such as Per-Axel Sverker, align this passage with the traditional interpretation, claiming that the word [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]] refers to sexual misconduct, and that while homoerotic acts were not the only reason Sodom and Gomorrah were condemned, it was a significant part of the picture.

Others, the earliest of whom was [[D.S. Bailey|Derrick Sherwin Bailey]], claim that this passage contradicts the traditional interpretation altogether. In their view the sins of Sodom were related more to violation of [[hospitality]] laws than sexual sins.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Bailey, ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition'' (Hamden: Conn.: Archon, 1975 reprint from 1955), 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; This also coincides with traditional Jewish interpretations of these texts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Destruction of Sodom|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|website=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad (Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement)|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402022353/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/246615/jewish/The-Destruction-of-Sodom.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary word in contention is the Hebrew word ''yâda‛'' used for ''know'' in the Old Testament. Biblical scholars disagree on what "know" in this instance refers to, but most of conservative Christianity interprets it to mean "sexual intercourse",&lt;ref&gt;Greg Bahnsen, ''Homosexuality: A Biblical View'' (Phillipsburg: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing, 1978), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Reformed Response to Daniel Helminiak's Gay Theology'', by Derrick K. Olliff and Dewey H. Hodges&lt;/ref&gt; while the opposing position interprets it to mean "interrogate."&lt;ref&gt;John J. McNeil, ''The Church and the Homosexual'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Lot's offering of his two virgins has been interpreted to mean that Lot is offering a compromise to assure the crowd that the two men have no untoward intentions in town, or that he is offering his virgins as a substitute for the men to "know" by sexual intercourse.

Those who oppose the interpretation of sexual intent toward Lot's guests point out that there are over 930 occurrences of the Hebrew word (yâda‛) for "know" in the Old Testament, and its use to denote sexual intercourse only occurs about a dozen times, and in the [[Septuagint]] it is not rendered sexually. Countering this is the argument that most of the uses of ''yâda‛'' denoting sex is in Genesis,&lt;ref&gt;''Homosexuality and the Old Testament'', P. Michael Ukleja&lt;/ref&gt; (including once for premarital sex: Genesis 38:26), and in verse 8 sex the obvious meaning. Its use in the parallel story in Judges 19 is also invoked in support of this meaning,&lt;ref&gt;''Sodom: Inhospitality or Homosexuality?'', by Dave Miller, Ph.D., Apologetics Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James B. DeYoung, ''Homosexuality'', pp. 118–122&lt;/ref&gt; with it otherwise providing the only instance of "knowing" someone by violence.

===Islam===
While the [[Quran]] clearly disapproves of the sexual practices of the "people of Lot" ("What, of all creatures do ye come unto the males, and leave the wives your Lord created for you?"&lt;ref&gt;Sura 26:165–167, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;), only one passage can be interpreted as taking a particular legal position towards such activities:

{{quote|As for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both; and if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo, God is relenting, merciful.&lt;ref&gt;Sura 4:16, quoted in Wafer, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
[[Hadith]] (reports of [[Muhamma]]d's sayings and deeds from those close to him in his lifetime) on the subject are inconsistent, with different writers interpreting the Prophet in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Wafer, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shariah]] (Islamic law) defines sodomy outside marriage as adultery or fornication or both, and it thus attracts the same penalties as those crimes (flogging or death), although the exact punishment varies with schools and scholars.&lt;ref name="Jong"&gt;Jivraj &amp; de Jong, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, few modern Muslim countries have legal systems based fully on Shariah, and an increasing number of Muslims do not look to shariah but to the Quran itself for moral guidance.&lt;ref name="Jong"/&gt; For sodomy within marriage, the majority of [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] interpreters hold that (1) anal intercourse, while strongly disliked, is not ''haram'' (forbidden) provided the wife agrees; and (2), if the wife does not agree, then it is preferable to refrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|title=Chapter Three: The Islamic Sexual Morality (2) Its Structure|author=|date=|website=Al-Islam.org|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016184024/http://www.al-islam.org/m_morals/chap3b.htm|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the formal disapproval of religious authority, [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation in Muslim societies]] and the strong emphasis on virility leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt &amp; Sofer, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Not all sodomy is homosexual, but for many young men heterosexual sodomy is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report the demand for anal penetration from their male clients.&lt;ref&gt;Dialmy, pp. 32 and 35, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5867">In an [[integrated circuit]], a signal can couple from one node to another via the substrate. This phenomenon is referred to as '''substrate coupling''' or '''substrate noise coupling'''.

The push for reduced cost, more compact circuit boards, and added customer features has provided
incentives for the inclusion of [[Analogue electronics|analog]] functions on primarily digital MOS [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) forming
[[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal IC]]s. In these systems, the speed of digital circuits is constantly increasing, chips are
becoming more densely packed, interconnect layers are added, and analog resolution is increased. In addition, recent increase in wireless applications and its growing market are introducing a new set of aggressive design goals for realizing mixed-signal systems. 
Here, the designer integrates [[radio frequency]]
(RF) analog and base band digital circuitry on a single chip. 
The goal is to make single-chip radio frequency
integrated circuits (RFICs) on silicon, where all the blocks are fabricated on the same chip. 
One of the advantages of this integration is low power dissipation for portability due to a reduction in the number of package pins and associated bond wire capacitance. 
Another reason that an integrated solution offers lower power consumption is that routing high-frequency signals off-chip often requires a 50Ω [[impedance matching|impedance match]], which can result in higher power dissipation. 
Other advantages include improved high-frequency performance due to reduced package interconnect parasitics, higher system reliability, smaller package count, and higher integration of RF components with VLSI-compatible digital circuits. 
In fact, the single-chip transceiver is now a reality.

The design of such systems, however, is a [[Integrated circuit design|complicated task]]. There are two main challenges in realizing
mixed-signal ICs. The first challenging task, specific to RFICs, is to fabricate good on-chip passive elements
such as high-Q [[inductor]]s. The second challenging task, applicable to any mixed-signal IC and the subject
of this chapter, is to minimize noise coupling between various parts of the system to avoid any malfunctioning
of the system. 
In other words, for successful system-on-chip integration of mixed-signal systems, the
noise coupling caused by nonideal isolation must be minimized so that sensitive analog 
circuits and noisy digital circuits can effectively coexist, and the system operates correctly.  
To elaborate, note that in mixed-signal
circuits, both sensitive analog circuits and high-swing high-frequency noise injector digital circuits may be
present on the same chip, leading to undesired signal coupling between these two types of circuit via the conductive substrate.  
The reduced distance between these circuits, which is the result of constant technology scaling (see [[Moore's law]] and the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]]),
exacerbates the coupling.  
The problem is severe, since signals of different nature and strength interfere,
thus affecting the overall performance, which demands higher clock rates and greater analog
precisions.

The primary mixed-signal noise coupling problem comes from fast-changing digital signals 
coupling to sensitive analog nodes. 
Another significant cause of undesired signal
coupling is the [[Crosstalk (electronics)]] between analog nodes themselves owing to 
high-frequency/high-power analog
signals. 
One of the media through which mixed-signal noise coupling occurs is the substrate. 
Digital operations cause fluctuations in the underlying substrate voltage, which spreads 
through the common substrate causing variations in the substrate potential of sensitive 
devices in the analog section. 
Similarly, in the case of crosstalk between analog nodes, a signal can couple from one 
node to another via the substrate.
This phenomenon is referred to as ''substrate coupling'' or ''substrate noise coupling''.

== Modelling, analysis, and verification of mixed signal coupling ==
There is a sizeable literature on substrate, and mixed signal coupling.  Some of the most common topics are:
*Differentiating between the random noise inherent to electronic devices and the deterministic noise generated by circuits. 
*Examining the physical phenomena responsible for the creation of undesired signals in a digital circuit and the mechanisms of their transport to other parts of the system.  The substrate is the most common coupling mechanism, but capacitive coupling, mutual inductance, and coupling through power supplies are also analyzed. 
*Comparing various modeling approaches and simulation techniques.  There are many possible models for digital noise generation, the substrate impedance network, and the sensitivity of the (unintended) receiver.  The chosen techniques significantly influence the speed and accuracy of the analysis.
*Substrate and mixed-signal analysis techniques can be applied to [[placement (EDA)|placement]] and power distribution synthesis.

The '''Sudbury Neutrino Observatory''' ('''SNO''') was a [[neutrino observatory]] located 2100&amp;nbsp;m underground in [[Vale Limited|Vale]]'s&lt;!--As it was known at the time--&gt; [[Creighton Mine]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The detector was designed to detect [[solar neutrino]]s through their interactions with a large tank of [[heavy water]].

The detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006.  The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken.

The director of the experiment, [[Arthur B. McDonald|Art McDonald]], was co-awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2015 for the experiment's contribution to the discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nobel-prize-physics-2015-1.3258178 |title=2015 Nobel Prize in Physics: Canadian Arthur B. McDonald shares win with Japan's Takaaki Kajita |date=2015-10-06 |journal=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permanent facility and now operates multiple experiments as [[SNOLAB]]. The SNO equipment itself is currently being refurbished for use in the [[SNO+]] experiment.

==Experimental motivation==
{{See also|Cowan-Reines neutrino experiment}}
The first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the [[Standard Solar Model]]. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]]. Over several decades many ideas were put forward to try to explain the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of [[neutrino oscillation]]s. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to [[electron neutrino]]s and yielded little to no information on [[muon neutrino]]s and [[tau neutrino]]s.

In 1984, [[Herb Chen]] of the [[University of California at Irvine]] first pointed out the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Direct Approach to Resolve the Solar-Neutrino Problem |first=Herbert H. |last=Chen |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=55 |issue=14 |pages=1534–1536 |date=September 1984 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1534|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55.1534C |pmid=10031848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other reaction sensitive to only electron neutrino.  Thus, such detector can measure neutrino oscillations directly.  A location in Canada was attractive because [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]], which maintains large stockpiles of heavy water to support its [[CANDU reactor]] power plants, was willing to lend the necessary amount (worth {{Currency|330 million|CAD}} at market prices) at no cost.&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/D2O.html |title=Heavy Water |date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creighton Mine in Sudbury, among the deepest in the world and accordingly low in background radiation, was quickly identified as an ideal place for Chen's proposed experiment to be built,&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt; and the mine management was willing to make the location available for only incremental costs.&lt;ref name=ANRV2009&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/papers/JelleyMcDonaldRobertsonAnnRev2009.pdf |title=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory |first1=Nick |last1=Jelley |first2=Arthur B. |last2=McDonald |authorlink2=Arthur B.

The SNO collaboration held its first meeting in 1984. At the time it competed with [[TRIUMF]]'s [[KAON Factory]] proposal for federal funding, and the wide variety of universities backing SNO quickly led to it being selected for development. The official go-ahead was given in 1990.

The experiment observed the light produced by [[special relativity|relativistic]] electrons in the water created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the [[Cherenkov effect]], and it is this light that is directly detected.

==Detector description==

[[File:Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.detector outside.jpg|thumb|The Sudbury Neutrino Detector (Courtesy of SNO)]]
[[File:Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.detector inside.jpg|thumb|A wide-angle view of the detector interior (Courtesy of SNO)]]

The SNO detector target consisted of {{convert|1000|t|ST|0|lk=on}} of [[heavy water]] contained in a {{convert|6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-radius}} [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] vessel. The detector cavity outside the vessel was filled with normal water to provide both [[buoyancy]] for the vessel and [[radiation shield]]ing. The heavy water was viewed by approximately 9,600 [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] (PMTs) mounted on a [[geodesic]] sphere at a radius of about {{convert|850|cm|ft|0}}. The cavity housing the detector was the largest in the world at such a depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Canadian Consulting Engineer |title=Deep Sphere: The unique structural design of the Sudbury {{sic|Neutrinos|hide=y}} Observatory buried within the earth |first=Robert |last=Brewer |date=&lt;!--Would really like to know--&gt; |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/neutrino/sno_deep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a variety of high-performance [[rock bolt]]ing techniques to prevent rock bursts.

The observatory is located at the end of a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} [[Drift mining|drift]], named the "SNO drift", isolating it from other mining operations. Along the drift are a number of operations and equipment rooms, all held in a [[clean room]] setting. Most of the facility is [[Class 3000 (standard)|Class 3000]] (fewer than 3,000 particles of 1&amp;nbsp;μm or larger per 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air) but the final cavity containing the detector is an even stricter [[Cleanroom|Class 100]].&lt;ref name=SNO2001&gt;

===Charged current interaction===
In the [[charged current]] interaction, a neutrino converts the [[neutron]] in a [[deuteron]] to a [[proton]]. The neutrino is absorbed in the reaction and an electron is produced. Solar neutrinos have energies smaller than the mass of [[muon]]s and [[tau lepton]]s, so only electron neutrinos can participate in this reaction. The emitted electron carries off most of the neutrino's energy, on the order of 5–15&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]], and is detectable. The proton which is produced does not have enough energy to be detected easily. The electrons produced in this reaction are emitted in all directions, but there is a slight tendency for them to point back in the direction from which the neutrino came.

===Neutral current interaction===
In the [[neutral current]] interaction, a neutrino dissociates the deuteron, breaking it into its constituent neutron and proton. The neutrino continues on with slightly less energy, and all three neutrino flavours are equally likely to participate in this interaction.  Heavy water has a small [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for neutrons, and when neutrons capture on a deuterium nucleus a [[gamma ray]] ([[photon]]) with roughly 6&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced.  The direction of the gamma ray is completely uncorrelated with the direction of the neutrino. Some of the neutrons wander past the acrylic vessel into the light water, and since light water has a very large cross section for neutron capture these neutrons are captured very quickly.  A gamma ray with roughly 2.2&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced in this reaction, but because the energy of the photons are not above the detector's energy threshold (meaning above the threshold for the photomultipliers), they are not directly observable. The gamma ray collides with an electron through Compton scattering and the accelerated electron can be detected through Cherenkov radiation.

===Electron elastic scattering===
In the [[elastic scattering]] interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts some of its energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral [[Z boson]], and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged [[W boson]]. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, and this is the channel through which the [[Super-Kamiokande]] (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of [[billiards]], and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.

==Experimental results and impact==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the first clear evidence that [[Neutrino oscillation|neutrinos oscillate]] (i.e. that they can transmute into one another), as they travel in the sun. This oscillation in turn implies that neutrinos have non-zero masses. The total flux of all neutrino flavours measured by SNO agrees well with the theoretical prediction. Further measurements carried out by SNO have since confirmed and improved the precision of the original result.

Although Super-K had beaten SNO to the punch, having published evidence for neutrino oscillation as early as 1998, the Super-K results were not conclusive and did not specifically deal with solar neutrinos. SNO's results were the first to directly demonstrate oscillations in solar neutrinos. This was important to the [[standard solar model]].'''  '''The results of the experiment had a major impact on the field, as evidenced by the fact that two of the SNO papers have been cited over 1,500 times, and two others have been cited over 750 times.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other possible analyses==
The SNO detector would have been capable of detecting a [[supernova]] within our galaxy if one had occurred while the detector was online. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it is possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova is visible. SNO was a founding member of the [[Supernova Early Warning System]] (SNEWS) with [[Super-Kamiokande]] and the [[Large Volume Detector]]. No such supernovae have yet been detected.

The SNO experiment was also able to observe atmospheric neutrinos produced by [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the atmosphere. Due to the limited size of the SNO detector in comparison with Super-K the low cosmic ray neutrino signal is not statistically significant at neutrino energies below 1&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]].

==Participating institutions==
Large particle physics experiments require large collaborations. With approximately 100 collaborators, SNO was a rather small group compared to [[particle collider|collider experiment]]s. The participating institutions have included:

===Canada===
* [[Carleton University]]
* [[Laurentian University]]
* [[Queen's University]] – designed and built many calibration sources and the device for deploying sources
* [[TRIUMF]]
* [[University of British Columbia]]
* [[University of Guelph]]

Although no longer a collaborating institution, [[Chalk River Laboratories]] led the construction of the acrylic vessel that holds the heavy water, and [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] was the source of the heavy water.

===United Kingdom===
* [[University of Oxford]]  –  developed much of the experiment's [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] analysis program (SNOMAN), and maintained the program

===United States===
* [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|LBNL]]  –  Led the construction of the geodesic structure that holds the PMTs
* [[PNNL]]

== History and Staff ==

The '''Edelstein Center''' was established in 2004, by Joel Edelstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/English/JoelEdelstein.asp |title=About Joel Edelstein |publisher=Centroedelstein.org.br |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a USA citizen living in [[Brazil]]. From its inception is directed by [[Bernardo Sorj]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernardosorj.com.br/english/index.asp |title=Director Bernardo Sorj’s site |publisher=Bernardosorj.com.br |date=2005-12-30 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Board of Advisors includes [[Adama Samassékou]] (Mali), Angelina Peralva (France), Daniel Pécaut (France), Giorgio Alberti (Italy), [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] (in memoriam, Argentina), [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]] (France) [[:es:Julio Cotler|Julio Cotler]] (Peru), Sérgio Costa (Germany), Shepard Forman (United States) and [[Simon Schwartzman]] (Brazil).

In 2007, in association with the Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifhc.org.br Instituto Fernando Henrique Cardoso]&lt;/ref&gt; founded the ''Democratic Platform Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plataformademocratica.org/English |title=Democratic Platform Project |publisher=Plataformademocratica.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009-2010, the '''Edelstein Center''' was one of the sponsors of the [[Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy]]. The other organizations were Instituto [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and the [[Open Society Institute]].&lt;ref name="drogasedemocracia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drogasedemocracia.org/English/Default.asp |title=Latin American Initiative on Drugs and Democracy |publisher=Drogasedemocracia.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010-2011, the '''Edelstein Center''' was part of the secretariat of the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/ |title=The Global Commission on Drug Policy |publisher=Globalcommissionondrugs.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

'''The Information Society in Latin America'''

This research program concentrates on the impact of new [[information and communications technology]] on the transformation of [[Latin America]]'s education system, public space and democratic life.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo. Information Societies and Digital Divides: an Introduction. Milano: Polimetrica. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, 2008. {{ISBN|9788876991288}}. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/Information_Societies_and_Digital_Divides_ebook.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[REMOLD, Julie.

Recently the '''Edelstein Center''' has completed a research on the use of computers and [[Internet]] by public school teachers in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, Bernardo; LISSOVSKY, Mauricio. Internet in Brazilian Public Schools: Policies beyond Politics. Rio de Janeiro: The Edelstein Center for Social Research, Working Paper nº 6, May 2011. http://www.centroedelstein.org.br/PDF/WP_6_English.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The study indicates that even when they have a positive impact, they cannot be separated from the educational and human context. A comprehensive policy needs to properly training teachers, in particular confronting the difficulties of the older generation, use monitored software, and adequate maintaining the physical infrastructural and technical support for school computer labs.

'''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'''

The ''Civil Society and Globalization Agendas'' research program focuses on the current changes in [[Latin America]]’s [[civil society]]. Civil society played an important role in the promotion of [[democracy]] during the period of [[military dictatorships]]. However, more recently, civil society organizations have expanded and changed profoundly. While continuing to play an important role in the defense of [[human rights]], in many countries civil society has become a vehicle for  political parties, individual politicians, unions and social movements to channel public funds for their own benefit and/or political cooptation.&lt;ref&gt;[SORJ, B.

The '''Ulster University's Transitional Justice Institute (TJI)''', is a law-led multidisciplinary [[research institute]] of [[Ulster University]] which is physically located at the [[Ulster University at Jordanstown|Jordanstown]], and [[Ulster University at Magee|Magee]] campuses. It was created in 2003, making it the first and longest-established university research centre on this theme.  In the 2014 ''[[Research Excellence Framework|Research Excellence Framework (REF)]]'' Law at Ulster University was ranked 4th overall in the UK. Ulster was ranked first for impact in law with 100% of impact rated as world-leading, the only University to achieve this in law.

Within the Institute, there are over 15 researchers based on the Jordanstown and Magee campuses of the university. In addition, the TJI has approximately 15 [[doctoral studies|doctoral students]] researching and studying towards their chosen topics. Visiting scholars and [[visiting professor]]s are often closely involved in research.

The institute is internationally recognised, receiving recognition from the [[American Society of International Law]] in 2006 with TJI scholars being awarded top book and article prize for ''creative and outstanding contributions to international legal scholarship''. Staff have been awarded the 2009 Hart SLSA Early Career Award and jointly awarded the 2009 [[British Society of Criminology]] Book Prize&lt;ref name="Louise Mallinder"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/staff_profiles/louise_mallinder.html | title=Louise Mallinder | accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2010 Basil Chubb Prize for the best PhD produced in any field of politics in an Irish university.&lt;ref name="Catherine O'Rourke"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/staff_profiles/catherine_orourke.html | title=Catherine O'Rourke | accessdate=December 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is associated with the [[Transitional Justice Institute#External Links|Association of Human Rights Institutes (AHRI)]].&lt;ref name="Association of Human Rights Institutes List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ahri-network.org/member-institutions | title=Member Institutes | publisher=Association of Human Rights Institutes (AHRI) | accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the University's rebranding in October 2014 the institute updated its logo; the old logo can be found [[Transitional Justice Institute#External links|here]].

==Vision==
The TJI undertakes world-leading research on [[transitional justice]], [[conflict (process)|conflict]], [[international law]], [[human rights]] and [[gender equality]]. The TJI model of research is based on an innovative real-world oriented research strategy, involving external mentoring of early career staff, the development of a key theoretical conceptual foundation, the nurturing of research clusters within the Institute, a strong interdisciplinary focus, and a collaborative leadership mode.

The stated aims of the Institute are:&lt;ref name="About TJI"/&gt;
* To build a theoretical and practical understanding of the role of 'transitional justice', and the underlying relationship between justice and peace;
* To examine the role of the international and domestic legal systems and institutions in facilitating transition from conflict;
* To make links between the experience of Northern Ireland and international experience, so as to benefit both Northern Ireland and other contexts;
* To inform policy makers involved in peacemaking in local and international institutions; and
* To make visible and critically examine gendered experiences of transition.

==Research==
The Institute has four main research streams or clusters:
* Dealing with the Past
* Gender, Conflict and Transition
* Northern Ireland – Local and Global Perspectives
* Theory Method and Evaluation

The '''UK Household Longitudinal Study''' ('''UKHLS''') is now known as '''Understanding Society'''.&lt;ref name=homepage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/|title=Homepage: understandingsociety.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest [[panel study|panel survey]] in the world, supporting social and economic research. Its sample size is 40,000 households from the [[United Kingdom]] or approximately 100,000 individuals.

==Structure==
Data collection, or fieldwork, began in January 2009 and the plan is to follow and interview annually the members of the original households (and their newly formed households, if applicable). The fieldwork period is 24 months, but each person is still interviewed annually, i.e., the fieldwork for consecutive waves overlap.

The study is mainly funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]], and led by the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.iser.essex.ac.uk Iser.essex.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Essex]].

As a [[panel study|panel survey]], Understanding Society is a form of [[longitudinal study]] which means that the survey consists of information about the same individuals at regular intervals and so can be used to track changes in people's lives and attitudes over time. It can also be used to measure phenomena such as poverty persistence, unemployment duration, duration of marriage or cohabitation and analyze the factors that affect these durations. The study allows for deeper analysis of a wide range of sections of the population as they respond to regional, national and international change. Understanding Society will enhance our insight into the pathways that influence peoples longer term occupational trajectories; their health and well-being, their financial circumstances and personal relationships.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

From its second wave (starting in 2010) onwards the ''Understanding Society'' incorporates the [[British Household Panel Survey]], which has been carried out at ISER&lt;ref name="Iser.essex.ac.uk"/&gt; since 1991.

The ''Understanding Society'' is one of the first longitudinal surveys in UK to put ethnicity at the heart of the survey and include an ''Ethnic Minority Boost Sample'' (approximately 1000 adults from each of the five main ethnic minority groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African plus members of other minorities as identified in the screening).&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study will capture biomedical data on 20,000 participants and place this alongside rich social histories, helping us weigh the extent to which people's environment influences their health relative to their genetic make-up.

This study also consists of a methodological survey called the ''Innovation Panel'' which is conducted in the year prior to the main survey to enable research in key methodological issues such as the quality of new questions, methods to improve response rates, mode effects. This sample consists of 1500 households.&lt;ref name=homepage/&gt;

The study hosts a ''biennial conference''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/2014/12/08/call-for-abstracts-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viability PCR''', also named v-PCR or vPCR, is an evolution of [[PCR]]. Through the use of a simple pre-treatment of the sample by the means of specific intercalating photo-reactive reagents it's possible to neutralize the DNA of dead cells. As a result, only DNA from live cells will be detected by PCR. This approach expands a lot the analytical scope of PCR procedures. The capability to detect only living cells become very important, because  in key applications is more important to know the amount of live cells, than the total cell level. Examples of this are: food  and water quality control, infectious diseases diagnostic, veterinary applications, ecological dynamics...

The first referenced work about this analytical approach was in 2003, Norwegian researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ethidium monoazide for DNA-based differentiation of viable and dead bacteria by 5'-nuclease PCR|journal = BioTechniques|date = 2003-04-01|issn = 0736-6205|pmid = 12703305|pages = 804–808, 810, 812–813|volume = 34|issue = 4|first = Hege Karin|last = Nogva|first2 = Signe Marie|last2 = Drømtorp|first3 = Hilde|last3 = Nissen|first4 = Knut|last4 = Rudi}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest the use of Ethidium Monoazide, an azide form of [[Ethidium Bromide]], which was used in other analytical fields as [[Flow cytometry|Flow Cytometry]] as a candidate for viability PCR. However, the main important advances were done by Nocker and colleagues, which demonstrated in successive works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular monitoring of disinfection efficacy using propidium monoazide in combination with quantitative PCR|journal = Journal of Microbiological Methods|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0167-7012|pmid = 17544161|pages = 252–260|volume = 70|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.mimet.2007.04.014|first = Andreas|last = Nocker|first2 = Katherine E.|last2 = Sossa|first3 = Anne K.|last3 = Camper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Use of propidium monoazide for live/dead distinction in microbial ecology|journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date = 2007-08-01|issn = 0099-2240|pmc = 1951001|pmid = 17586667|pages = 5111–5117|volume = 73|issue = 16|doi = 10.1128/AEM.02987-06|first = Andreas|last = Nocker|first2 = Priscilla|last2 = Sossa-Fernandez|first3 = Mark D.|last3 = Burr|first4 = Anne K.|last4 = Camper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Novel approaches toward preferential detection of viable cells using nucleic acid amplification techniques|journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters|date = 2009-02-01|issn = 1574-6968|pmid = 19054073|pages = 137–142|volume = 291|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01429.x|first = Andreas|last = Nocker|first2 = Anne K.|last2 = Camper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective detection of live bacteria combining propidium monoazide sample treatment with microarray technology|journal = Journal of Microbiological Methods|date = 2009-03-01|issn = 0167-7012|pmid = 19103234|pages = 253–261|volume = 76|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.mimet.2008.11.004|first = Andreas|last = Nocker|first2 = Alberto|last2 = Mazza|first3 = Luke|last3 = Masson|first4 = Anne K.|last4 = Camper|first5 = Roland|last5 = Brousseau}}&lt;/ref&gt; the potential of this technology and also suggested [[Propidium monoazide]] as a better reagent for vPCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparison of propidium monoazide with ethidium monoazide for differentiation of live vs. dead bacteria by selective removal of DNA from dead cells|journal = Journal of Microbiological Methods|date = 2006-11-01|issn = 0167-7012|pmid = 16753236|pages = 310–320|volume = 67|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.mimet.2006.04.015|first = Andreas|last = Nocker|first2 = Ching-Ying|last2 = Cheung|first3 = Anne K.|last3 = Camper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This field still is on development, from 2003 up to 2015, the scientific evidences about the applicability of vPCR are stacking, nowadays main efforts are focused in procedure optimization. Since a simple reagent mix with the sample, photo-activation and subsequent PCR not always shows expected results, each procedure needs some optimization. Up to now the main improvements has been :

- Improving the efficiency of photo activation: early procedures were based on high power halogen lamps which overheated the samples and don't ensured constant light dose, these home made solutions have been replaced by led based instruments.[http://www.geniul.com/en/products/instruments/phast-blue-for-nucleic-acids-photo-labeling][https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/dna/dna-preparation/blu-v-system/]

- The use of  long PCR aplicons as targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Use of propidium monoazide and increased amplicon length reduce false-positive signals in quantitative PCR for bioburden analysis|journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|date = 2013-03-01|issn = 1432-0614|pmid = 23354451|pages = 2153–2162|volume = 97|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s00253-013-4711-6|first = Franz|last = Schnetzinger|first2 = Youwen|last2 = Pan|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Nocker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The increase of  temperature during dark incubation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Improving efficiency of viability-PCR for selective detection of live cells|journal = Journal of Microbiological Methods|date = 2013-04-01|issn = 1872-8359|pmid = 23389080|pages = 20–24|volume = 93|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.mimet.2013.01.018|first = Esther|last = Nkuipou-Kenfack|first2 = Holger|last2 = Engel|first3 = Sarah|last3 = Fakih|first4 = Andreas|last4 = Nocker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through combining different optimizations strategies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Progress in understanding preferential detection of live cells using viability dyes in combination with DNA amplification|journal = Journal of Microbiological Methods|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1872-8359|pmid = 22940102|pages = 276–289|volume = 91|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.mimet.2012.08.007|first = Mariana|last = Fittipaldi|first2 = Andreas|last2 = Nocker|first3 = Francesc|last3 = Codony}}&lt;/ref&gt; and controlling the analytical bias, nowadays the vPCR  becomes a powerful analytical tool.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">The '''Wayqecha Biological Station''' is a [[tropical ecology|tropical ecological]] [[research station]] near [[Peru]]'s [[Manú National Park]]. This research station is located (13°10'38.06"S, 71°36'16.36"W) in the upper reaches of the river Cosñipata, an affluent of the [[Madre de Dios River]], in the [[Paucartambo Province]], [[Cusco Region]].  The station ranges from 2200 to 3700 m in elevation and includes several Andean [[ecosystem]]s, such as montane forests, elfin forests, montane scrub and high-Andean grassland ([[Puna grassland|puna]]). These ecosystems are connected by a series of trails and by the road Paucartambo-Shintuya. The station was established in 2005 and is managed by two non-governmental organizations: the Peruvian NGO Asociación para la Conservación de la Cuenca Amazónica (ACCA) and the US-based [[Amazon Conservation Association]] (ACA), which also manage the [[Los Amigos Biological Station]] in the lowland rainforest of southeastern Peru.  

Current research at Wayqecha includes a multidisciplinary project studying [[Carbon cycle|carbon cycling]] in soils and montane forests and their response to [[climate change]], and  studies of plant and animal diversity patterns along the Andean elevational gradient. Wayqecha hosted a field course of the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]] in 2007.

==Access==
Wayqecha is located along the Paucartambo-Shintuya road, approximately 1 hour east of Paucartambo and 4–5 hours east of [[Cusco]], the nearest city.

[[File:Pieter Janssens Elinga - Reading Woman - WGA7482.jpg|thumb|Elinga, ''Reading Woman,'' c. 1660]]
'''Women reading in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying one or more women in the act of reading. This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conlon|first=James|year=2005|title=Men Reading Women Reading: Interpreting Images of Women Readers|jstor=4137395|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=26|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. ''Reading Woman'' (c.1660) by [[Pieter Janssens Elinga|Pieter Janssans Elinga]] portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity.

Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, then, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Depictions of woman readers ==

[[File:Antoine_Wiertz_La_liseuse_de_romans.jpg|thumb|Antoine Wiertz, ''The Reader of Novels,'' c. 1853]]
During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Reader|last=Jack|first=Belinda|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=228–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties.  Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in [[Antoine Wiertz|Antoine Wiert's]]''The Reader of Novels'' (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Claude_Monet_-_Springtime_-_Walters_3711.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', c. 1872]]
In [[Dutch Golden Age]] painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. [[Johannes Vermeer]], for example, created numerous works around this subject, including ''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter|A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]''. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/teaching-packets/pdfs/dutch_painting.pdf|title=Painting in the Dutch Golden Age: A Profile of the Seventeenth Century|last=|first=|date=2007|website=National Gallery of Art, Washington|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conlon argues, the self-relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Vermeer,_Johannes_-_Woman_reading_a_letter_-_ca._1662-1663.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'', ca. 1662-1663, [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

== Female artists and the subject of reading ==

Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''Family Group Reading'' is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
