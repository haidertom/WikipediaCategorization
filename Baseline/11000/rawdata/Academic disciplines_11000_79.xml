{{Distinguish|AIDS Education and Training Centers}}
[[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|200px|thumb|A red ribbon is often used to signify the fight against AIDS]]
[[AIDS]], caused by the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV), has become a global health issue, and various ways are being explored in order to combat the spread of the [[disease]]. One such way to somewhat limit the spread of AIDS is through [[education]]. Societies with significant number of HIV positive individuals and people that have been diagnosed with having cases of AIDS are societies in which education about the disease is limited to almost non-existent and where culture and [[tradition]] clash with [[modern medicine]]. Thus, education and training are of great importance and a number of organizations have been formed within the past two decades. Organizations vary from being government funded to private and/or are formed by health and social advocates. Organizations provide range of services from support for families and individuals affected by the [[disease]], classes in academic settings ranging from preschools to universities, available resources to updates on the latest advances in medical treatments.

In many societies, even in many [[Western cultures]], stereotyping exists and one way to stop or prevent [[discrimination]] is through education and passing out information about the ways the disease is spread. Big problem in containing the spread of the disease are cultural and religious backgrounds where usage of common [[contraceptives]], such as [[latex condoms]], are prohibited. Unfortunate events such as wars and armed conflicts often employ [[rape]] as a mean of terrorizing local population, in which AIDS, among other [[sexually transmitted diseases]] (STDs), is spread almost exponentially and, very often, it is impossible to trace back to the individual that was the original HIV carrier.  The consequences of such horrific acts are infected mothers who give births to infected babies and the disease is spread vertically. Because of its impact on global population and the high rate of spreading, AIDS has been classified as being [[pandemic]].

There is a growing number of organizations exclusively dedicated to AIDS education and prevention, as well as organized training of medical staff and any individuals that may be interested. Main goals of these organizations are:
* Education about the disease (acquisition and transmission process) 
* Training 
* Support
* Updates on latest research efforts

The '''Academy of Military Engineering of Guadalajara''' ({{lang-es|Academia de Ingenieros de Guadalajara}}) was a [[military academy]] in [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], [[Spain]]. It operated in Guadalajara from 1833 until its move to [[Segovia]] in 1932 as part of its merger with the Artillery Academy (''Academia de Artilleros'').

The Academy was located in the Montesclaros Palace, in the west of the city, until a 1924 fire destroyed part of the premises and an important collection of models, documents, books, and artworks.  Between 1924 and its final move, its activities were continued in the palace's annex buildings that today serve as the General Military Archive of Guadalajara (''Archivo General Militar de Guadalajara'') and the palace of Antonio de Mendoza.

Many important figures attended or taught at the Academy, including [[Mariano Barberán]], [[Eduardo Barrón]],&lt;ref name="aeroplano"&gt;Warleta Carrillo, José (1989). «Revista Aeroplano nº 6».

'''Acceleration''' in human development process is the phenomenon which has been registered in many populations around the world. This applies equally to the growth of certain anthropometric parameters and the speed of reaching sexual maturity. These facts illustrate the results of secular changes in body height and appearance of the first [[menstruation]] ([[menarche]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hatton T. J.

Increases in human stature are a main indicator of improvements in the average health of populations. The newest data set for the average height of adult male birth cohorts, from the mid-nineteenth century to 1980, in 15 European countries was studied (in the populations listed). 

During a century average height increased by 11 cm representing a dramatic improvement of this phenomenon. The apparent acceleration of body height occurred during the Ĝ.{{clarify|What is Ĝ?|date=September 2018}

The '''American Institute for Economic Research''' ('''AIER'''), located in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], is an independent [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] economic research institute that represents no fund, concentration of wealth, or other special interests. AIER publishes research and critical analysis based on the principles of scientific inquiry and positive economics. 

As of 2017, the president of the Institute is [[Edward Stringham]], previously a professor of economics at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=Eagle&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/stories/aier-names-new-president,509745|title=American Institute for Economic Research names new president|work=The Berkshire Eagle|date=June 7, 2017|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of AIER is to conduct independent, scientific, economic research to educate individuals, thereby advancing their personal interests and those of their nation. Neither the Institute itself nor members of its staff may derive profit from organizations or businesses that happen to benefit from the results of Institute research.

==History==

On the advice of Dr. [[Vannevar Bush]], then vice-president and dean of engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Col. [[Edward C. Harwood]] founded AIER to conduct research into the wide range of economic, social, and monetary developments that had contributed to the catastrophic economic contraction of the Great Depression. Harwood, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, was serving in the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1920s when he undertook an intensive study of economics, with particular emphasis on money-credit problems. Bush's support for Harwood was based on articles that Harwood has published in financial journals in 1928 and 1929 that accurately predicted the impending depression. AIER was housed initially in an office at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], then moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. At the end of World War II, Harwood relocated to a "white elephant" manor house in Great Barrington. In 1956-57, a print shop annex and warehouse were built, and in 1962 a research library was added to the hillside below the annex. The print shop closed in 2008, as AIER transitioned from print to digital dissemination of its research.

'''American urban history''' is the study of cities of the United States. [[Local history|Local historians]] have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch,  "American urban history as an example of recent historiography." ''History and Theory'' (1979): 350-377. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2504535 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=2344 Online review by  Andrea Tuttle Kornbluh  1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's [[History of agrarianism|agrarianism]] and the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, ''Americans Against the City: Anti-Urbanism in the Twentieth Century'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary Sies (2003) argues:
:At the start of the twenty-first century, North American urban history is flourishing. Compared to twenty-five years ago, the field has become more interdisciplinary and intellectually invigorating.  Scholars are publishing increasingly sophisticated efforts to understand how the city as space intersects the urbanization process, as well as studies that recognize the full complexity of experiences for different metropolitan cohorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Mary Corbin |last = Sies|title = North American Urban History: The Everyday Politics and Spatial Logics of Metropolitan Life|journal = Urban History Review/Revue d'histoire urbaine|volume = 32|number =1 |date =2003|pages = 28-42|url = http://www.erudit.org/revue/uhr/2003/v32/n1/1015740ar.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
American urban history is a branch of the [[history of the United States]] and of the broader field of [[Urban history]]. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of [[urbanization]]. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like [[social history]], [[architectural history]], [[urban sociology]], [[urban geography]] [[business history]], and even [[archaeology]]. [[Urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of [[modernization]], or the transformation of rural traditional societies.

In the United States from the 1920s to the 1990s many influential monographs began as one of the 140 PhD dissertations at Harvard University directed by [[Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.]] (1888–1965) or [[Oscar Handlin]] (1915–2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Stave, ed., ''The Making of Urban History: Historiography through Oral History'' (1977) [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0803908687 in Google]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terrence J. McDonald, "Theory and Practice in the 'New' History: Rereading Arthur Meier Schlesinger's The Rise of the City, 1878-1898," ''Reviews in American History'' (1992) 20#3 pp. 432-445 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703171 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Schlesinger and his students took a group approach to history, sharply downplaying the role of individuals. Handlin added a focus on groups defined by ethnicity (that is Germans, Irish, Jews, Italians Hispanics etc.) or by class (working class or middle class). The Harvard model was that the urban environment, including the interaction with other groups, shaped their history and group outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Zane L. Miller,  "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City." ''Reviews in American History'' 24.3 (1996) pp: 361-368. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v024/24.3miller.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New urban history ===
The "new urban history" was a short-lived movement that attracted a great deal of attention In the 1960s, then quickly disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds., ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt; It used statistical methods and innovative computer techniques to analyze manuscript census data, person by person, focusing especially on the geographical and social mobility of random samples of residents. Numerous monographs appeared, but it proved frustrating to interpret the results. Historian [[Stephan Thernstrom]], the leading promoter of the new approach, soon disavowed it, saying it was neither new nor urban nor history.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Monkkonen, ''America Becomes Urban: The Development of U.S. Cities and Towns, 1780-1980'' (1988) pp 26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall urban history grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, stimulated by the surge of interest in social history.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, "The History of the American City," in William H. Cartwright and Richard L. Watson Jr. eds., ''Reinterpretation of American History and Culture'' (1973)  pp 165-205&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1990s, however, the field has been aging and has had much less attraction to younger scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Bender|title=Intellect and Public Life: Essays on the Social History of Academic Intellectuals in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=240iKp_jVjoC&amp;pg=PR11|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=11|quote= urban history, a field marked by deep decline in historiographical significance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Claims for urban impact ===
Historian [[Richard Clement Wade|Richard Wade]] has summarized the claims that scholars have made for the importance of the city in American history. The cities were the focal points for the growth of the West, especially those along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The cities, especially Boston, were the seed beds of the American Revolution.  Rivalry between cities, such as between Baltimore and Philadelphia, or between Chicago and St. Louis, stimulated economic innovations and growth, especially regarding the railroads.  The cities sponsored [[entrepreneurship]], especially in terms of export and import markets, banking, finance, and the rise of the [[factory system]] after 1812.  The rapidly growing railroad system after 1840 was primarily oriented toward linking together the major cities, which in turn became centers of the wholesale trade.  The railroads allowed major cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, and San Francisco to dominate ever-larger [[hinterland]]s.

The failure of the South to develop an urban infrastructure significantly weakened it during the Civil War, especially as its border cities of Baltimore, Washington, Louisville, and St. Louis, refused to join the Confederacy.  The cities were fonts of innovation in democracy, especially in terms of building powerful political organizations and [[political machine|machines]]; they were also the main base for reformers of those machines.  They became the home base for important immigrant groups, especially the Irish and the Jews.  Cities were the strongholds of labor unions in the 19th and 20th centuries (although no longer so in the 21st century).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wade, "The City in History: Some American Perspectives," in Werner Z. Hirsch, ed., ''Urban Life and Form'' (1963) pp 59-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Zane Miller argues that urban history was rejuvenated in mid-20th century by the realization that the cultural importance of the city went far beyond art galleries and museums. Historians began to emphasize "the importance of individual choices in the past and made the advocacy of lifestyle choices a hallmark of American civilization."  It was the diversity of the city, and the support it provided for diverse lifestyles, that set it so dramatically apart from towns and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, "The Crisis of Civic and Political Virtue: Urban History, Urban Life and the New Understanding of the City."&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s there was increased emphasis on racial minorities, outcasts, and gays and lesbians, as well as studies of leisure activities and sports history.&lt;ref&gt;George Chauncey, ''Gay New York: Gender, urban culture, and the making of the gay male world, 1890-1940'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Riess, ''City games: The evolution of American urban society and the rise of sports'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectuals against the city===
As Morton White demonstrated in ''The Intellectual versus the City: from Thomas Jefferson to Frank Lloyd Wright'' (1962), the overwhelming consensus of American intellectuals has been hostile to the city. The main idea is the Romantic view that the unspoiled nature of rural America is morally superior  to the over civilized cities, which are the natural homes of sharpsters and criminals. American poets did not rhapsodize over the cities. On the contrary they portrayed the metropolis as The ugly scene of economic inequality, crime, drunkenness, prostitution and every variety of immorality. Urbanites were set to rhyme as crafty, overly competitive, artificial, and as having lost too much naturalness and goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. Walker, "The Poet and the Rise of the City." ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1962): 85-99. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonial era and American Revolution ==
Historian [[Carl Bridenbaugh]] examined in depth five key cities: Boston (population 16,000 in 1760), Newport Rhode Island (population 7500), New York City (population 18,000), Philadelphia (population 23,000), and Charles Town (Charlestown, South Carolina), (population 8000). He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. Furthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people meeting welfare.  The cities were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive and corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure and to solve urban problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625-1742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid.  Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as "sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest," public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to "democratic yearnings" for political power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743-1776'' (1955), pp 147, 332&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, "Cities in review,"  ''Common-Place'' (July 2003) 3#4 [http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315142529/http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/reviews/carp.shtml |date=2015-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:View of New Archangel, 1837.tif|thumb|right|380px| The capital of the [[Russian-American Company]] at New Archangel (present day [[Sitka, Alaska]]) in 1837]]
Colonial powers established villages of a few hundred population as administrative centers, providing a governmental presence, as well has trading opportunities, and some transportation facilities. Representative examples include Spanish towns of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], [[San Antonio, Texas]], and [[Los Angeles, California]], French towns of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; Dutch towns of [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City), and the Russian town of [[Sitka, Alaska|New Archangel]] (now Sitka).  When their territory was absorbed into the United States, these towns expanded their administrative roles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Ernest Cooke, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the North American colonies'' (1993) 1: 113-154, 233-244.&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous historians have explored the roles of working-class men, including slaves, in the economy of the colonial cities,&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Work in the Cities of Colonial British North America," ''Journal of Urban History'' (2007) 33#6 pp 1021-1032&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Rockman, "Class and the History of Working People in the Early Republic." ''Journal of the Early Republic'' (2005) 25#4 pp: 527-535. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jer/summary/v025/25.4rockman.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were few cities in the entire South, and Charleston (Charles Town) and New Orleans were the most important before the Civil War. The colony of South Carolina was settled mainly by [[Planter (American South)|planters]] from the overpopulated [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar]] island colony of [[Barbados]], who brought large numbers of African slaves from that island.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Wood, ''Origins of American Slavery'' (1997), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Charleston grew as a port for the shipment of rice and later cotton, so did the community's cultural and social opportunities. The city had a large base of elite merchants and rich planters. The first theater building in America was built in Charleston in 1736, but was later replaced by the 19th-century Planter's Hotel where wealthy planters stayed during Charleston's horse-racing season (now the Dock Street Theatre, known as one of the oldest active theaters built for stage performance in the United States.  Benevolent societies were formed by several different ethnic groups: the South Carolina Society, founded by French [[Huguenot]]s in 1737; the German Friendly Society, founded in 1766; and the Hibernian Society, founded by Irish immigrants in 1801. The [[Charleston Library Society]] was established in 1748 by some wealthy Charlestonians who wished to keep up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. This group also helped establish the [[College of Charleston]] in 1770, the oldest college in South Carolina, the oldest municipal college in the United States, and the 13th oldest college in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Walter J. Fraser, ''Charleston! Charleston!: The History of a Southern City'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1775 the largest city was Philadelphia at 40,000, followed by New York (25,000), Boston (16,000), Charleston (12,000), and Newport (11,000), along with Baltimore, Norfolk, and Providence, with 6000, 6000, and 4400 population. They too were all seaports and on any one day each hosted a large transient population of Sailors and visiting businessmen. On the eve of the Revolution, 95 percent of the American population lived outside the cities—much to the frustration of the British, who were able to capture the cities with their Royal Navy, but lacked the manpower to occupy and subdue the countryside. In explaining the importance of the cities in shaping the American Revolution, Benjamin Carp compares the important role of waterfront workers, taverns, churches, kinship networks, and local politics.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin L. Carp, ''Rebels Rising: Cities and the American Revolution'' (2007) [https://www.questia.com/library/120077070/rebels-rising-cities-and-the-american-revolution online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Gary B. Nash]] emphasizes the role of the working class, and their distrust of their betters, in northern ports. He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia disseminate their ideology to the working class and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash, ''The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution'' (2nd ed. 1986) pp 240-47; the first edition of 1979 was entitled ''Urban Crucible: Social Change, Political Consciousness, and the Origins of the American Revolution)''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|350px|trends in economic growth, 1700–1850]]

== The new nation, 1783–1815 ==
The cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775-83. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy.  Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, as well as Boston, Philadelphia and Charleston for briefer periods.  During the occupations cities were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. The British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants, resume their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.  The older cities finally restored their economic basis; growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts, (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and especially Baltimore, Maryland.  The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. East, "The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763-1795," ''Journal of Economic History''  (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16-27 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and financiers of the cities were especially sensitive to the weakness of the old Confederation system; when it came time to ratify the much stronger new Constitution in 1788, all the nation's cities, North and South, voted in favor, while the rural districts were divided.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, "An Agenda for Urban History," in Herbert J. Bass, ed., ''The State of American History'' (1970) pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

The national capital was at Philadelphia until 1800, when it was moved to Washington. Apart from the murderous Yellow Fever epidemic of 1793, which killed about 10 percent of the population, Philadelphia had a marvelous reputation as the "cleanest, best-governed, healthiest, and most elegant of American cities." Washington, built in a fever-ridden swamp with long hot miserable summers, was ranked far behind Philadelphia, although it did escape Yellow Fever.&lt;ref&gt;Russel Blaine Nye, ''The Cultural Life of the New Nation: 1776-1830'' (1960) pp 127-28&lt;/ref&gt;

World peace only lasted a decade, for in 1793 a two-decade-long war between Britain and France and their allies broke out.  As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798-99 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807-1812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]]. The result was additional serious damage to the mercantile interests.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775-1815'' (1962) remains the best economic overview.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Allen Krout and Dixon Ryan Fox, ''The Completion of Independence, 1790–1830'' (1944) is a wide-ranging social history of the new nation; see pp 1-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all was gloomy in urban history, however. Although there was relatively little immigration from Europe,  the [[American frontier|rapid expansion of settlements]] to the West, and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, open up vast frontier lands. New Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States, and entirely new cities were opened in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Nashville and points west.  Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1820, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[History of New York City (1784–1854)|New York]], with a population of 96,000 in 1810 surged far beyond its rivals, reaching a population of 1,080,000 in 1860, compared to 566,000 in Philadelphia, 212,000 in Baltimore, 178,000 in Boston (289,000 including the Boston suburbs), and 169,000 in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815-1860'' (1951) pp 388-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian Robert Albion identifies four aggressive moves by New York entrepreneurs and politicians that helped it jump to the top of American cities. It set up an auction system that efficiently and rapidly sold imported cargoes; it organized a regular transatlantic packet service to England; it built a large-scale coastwise trade, especially one that brought Southern cotton to New York for reexport to Europe; it sponsored the Erie Canal, which opened a large new market in upstate New York and the Old Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Albion, "New York Port and its disappointed rivals, 1815-1860." ''Journal of Business and Economic History'' (1931) 3: 602-629.&lt;/ref&gt; The main rivals, Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore, tried to compete with the Erie Canal by opening their own networks of canals and railroads; they never caught up.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Rubin, "Canal or railroad? Imitation and innovation in the response to the Erie canal in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston." ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'' (1961): 1-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence V. Roth, "The Growth of American Cities." ''Geographical Review'' (1918) 5#5 pp: 384-398. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/207468 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   Manufacturing was not a major factor in the growth of the largest cities at this point. Instead  factories were chiefly being built in towns and smaller cities, especially in New England, having waterfalls or fast rivers that were harnessed to generate the power, or were closer to coal supplies, as in Pennsylvania.

===National leadership===
America's financial, business and cultural leadership (that is, literature, the arts, and the media) were concentrated in the three or four largest cities. Political leadership was never concentrated. It was divided between Washington and the state capitals, and many states deliberately moved their state capital out of their largest city, including New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and California.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Montès, ''American Capitals: A Historical Geography'' (2014) &amp;&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic and scientific leadership was weak in the United States until the late 19th century, when it began to be concentrated in universities. A few major research-oriented schools were in or close by the largest cities, such as Harvard (Boston),  Columbia (New York), Johns Hopkins (Baltimore) and Chicago. However,  most were located in smaller cities or large towns such as Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; Cornell in Ithaca, New York; Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor; University of Illinois in Urbana; University of Wisconsin in Madison;  University of California in Berkeley, and Stanford in the village of Stanford, California.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Meier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) pp 82-87, 212-16, 247-48&lt;/ref&gt;

{{U.S. cities in the Civil War}}

The cities played a major part in the Civil War, providing soldiers, money, training camps, supplies, and media support for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union war effort]].

In the North, discontent with the 1863 [[Conscription in the United States#Early drafts|draft]] law led to riots in several cities and in rural areas as well. By far the most important were the [[New York City draft riots]] of July 13 to July 16, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Barnet Schecter, ''The Devil's Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholic and other workers fought police, militia and regular army units until the Army used artillery to sweep the streets. Initially focused on the draft, the protests quickly expanded into violent attacks on blacks in New York City, with many killed on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/317749.html The New York City Draft Riots] ''In the Shadow of Slavery: African Americans in New York City'', 1626–1863, by Leslie M. Harris&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the small Michigan cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bratt, "A Great Revolution in Feeling: The American Civil War in Niles and Grand Rapids, Michigan," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (2005) 31#2 pp 43–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] called the war a failure and it became more and more a partisan Republican effort.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Hershock, "Copperheads and Radicals: Michigan Partisan Politics during the Civil War Era, 1860–1865," ''Michigan Historical Review'' (1992) 18#1 pp 28–69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederacy===
Cities played a much less important part in the heavily rural Confederacy. When the war started the largest cities in slave states were seized in 1861 by the Union, including Washington, Baltimore, Wheeling, Louisville, and St. Louis. The largest and most important Confederate city, New Orleans, was captured in early 1862, and Nashville in 1863. All these cities became major logistic and strategic centers for the Union forces.  All the remaining ports were blockaded by the summer of 1861, ending normal commercial traffic, with only very expensive blockade runners getting through. The largest remaining cities were Atlanta, the railroad center which was destroyed in 1864, in the national capital in Richmond which held out to the bitter end.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew L. Slap, and Frank Towers, eds. ''Confederate Cities: The Urban South during the Civil War Era''  (University of Chicago Press, 2015). xiv, 302 pp. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall decline in food supplies, made worse by the inadequate transportation system, led to serious shortages and high prices in Confederate cities. When bacon reached a dollar a pound in 1864, the poor white women of Richmond, Atlanta and many other cities began to riot; they broke into shops and warehouses to seize food. The women expressed their anger at ineffective state relief efforts, speculators, merchants and planters. As wives and widows of soldiers they were hurt by the inadequate welfare system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCurry, "'Bread or Blood!'" ''Civil War Times'' (2011) 50#3 pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Crisp Williams, and David Williams, "'The Women Rising': Cotton, Class, and Confederate Georgia's Rioting Women," ''Georgia Historical Quarterly,'' (2002) 86#12 pp. 49–83&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleven Confederate states in 1860 had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. The number of people (as of 1860) who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population.&lt;ref&gt;Paul F. Paskoff, "Measures of War: A Quantitative Examination of the Civil War's Destructiveness in the Confederacy," ''Civil War History,'' (2008) 54#1 pp 35–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late 19th century growth==
{{Further|Gilded Age}}
===Street traffic===
In a horse-drawn era, streets were unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel.  However, they produced uneven wear, opened new hazards for pedestrians and made for dangerous potholes for bicycles and for motor vehicles. Manhattan alone had 130,000 horses in 1900, pulling streetcars, wagons, and carriages, and leaving their waste behind. They were not fast, and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets.  Small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel, but larger cities wanted much better streets, so they looked to wood or granite blocks.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, "A Century of Parquet Pavements: Wood as a Paving Material In The United States And Abroad, 1840-1940." ''Essays in Economic and Business History'' 15 (1997): 209-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, a third of Chicago's 2000 miles of streets were paved, chiefly with wooden blocks, which gave better traction than mud.  Brick surfacing was a good compromise, but even better was [[asphalt]] paving. With London and Paris as models, Washington laid 400,000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882, and served as a model for Buffalo, Philadelphia and elsewhere. By the end of the century, American cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving, followed by brick construction.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Maier Schlesinger, ''The Rise of the City: 1878-1898'' (1933) p 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the largest cities, street railways were elevated, which increased their speed and lessened their dangers. Street-level trolleys moved passengers at 12 miles per hour for 5 cents a ride (with free transfers), They became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort. The working-class typically walked to nearby factories and patronized small local stores.  Big-city streets became paths for faster and larger and more dangerous vehicles, the pedestrians beware.  Underground subways were a solution, with Boston building one in the 1890s followed by New York a decade later.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Fairfield, "Rapid Transit: Automobility and Settlement in Urban America" ''Reviews in American History'' 23#1 (1995), pp. 80-85 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703240 online].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The new West ===
After 1860, railroads pushed westward into unsettled territory. They built service towns to handle the needs of railroad construction and repair crews, train crews, and passengers who ate meals at scheduled stops.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hudson, "Towns of the western railroads." ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 2#1 (1982): 41-54. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2671&amp;context=greatplainsquarterly online]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gunfights and disorder characterized the [[railhead]] towns that were the target of major [[cattle drive]]s from Texas.  The violence was often exaggerated in [[dime novel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Dykstra, ''The cattle towns'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odie B. Faulk, ''Dodge City: The Most Western Town Of All'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  In most of the South, there were very few cities of any size for miles around, and this held for Texas as well. Railroads finally arrived in the 1880s and they shipped the cattle out; cattle drives became short-distance affairs.  However the passenger trains were often the targets of armed gangs.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Holden, "Law and Lawlessness on the Texas Frontier, 1875-1890." ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' 44.2 (1940): 188-203. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30240564 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denver]]'s economy before 1870 had been rooted in mining; it then grew by expanding its role in railroads, wholesale trade, manufacturing, food processing, and servicing the growing agricultural and ranching hinterland. Between 1870 and 1890, manufacturing output soared from $600,000 to $40 million, and the population grew by a factor of 20 times to 107,000. Denver had always attracted miners, workers, whores and travelers. Saloons and gambling dens sprung up overnight. The city fathers boasted of its fine theaters, and especially the Tabor Grand Opera House built in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Leonard, and Thomas J. Noel, ''Denver: Mining Camp to Metropolis'' (1990) pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, Denver had grown to be the 26th largest city in America, and the fifth-largest city west of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab12.txt|title = Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places: 1890|publisher = U.S. Bureau of the Census|date = 15 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boom times attracted millionaires and their mansions, as well as hustlers, poverty and crime. Denver gained regional notoriety with its range of bawdy houses, from the sumptuous quarters of renowned madams to the squalid "cribs" located a few blocks away. Business was good; visitors spent lavishly, then left town. As long as madams conducted their business discreetly, and "crib girls" did not advertise their availability too crudely, authorities took their bribes and looked the other way. Occasional cleanups and crack downs satisfied the demands for reform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark Secrest. ''Hell's Belles: Prostitution, Vice, and Crime in Early Denver, with a Biography of Sam Howe, Frontier Lawman.'' (2nd ed., 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

With its giant mountain of copper, [[Butte, Montana]] was the largest, richest and rowdiest [[mining camp]] on the frontier. It was an ethnic stronghold, with the Irish Catholics in control of politics and of the best jobs at the leading mining corporation [[Anaconda Copper]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Emmons, ''The Butte Irish: class and ethnicity in an American mining town, 1875-1925'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; City boosters opened a public library in 1894. Ring argues that the library was originally a mechanism of social control, "an antidote to the miners' proclivity for drinking, whoring, and gambling." It was also designed to promote middle-class values and to convince Easterners the Butte was a cultivated city.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel F. Ring, "The Origins of the Butte Public Library: Some Further Thoughts on Public Library Development in the State of Montana," ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' (1993) 28#4 pp.&amp;nbsp;430–44 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25542594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Appreciative crowds filled the large, upscale "Belasco" opera house for full-scale operas and top-name artists.&lt;ref&gt;Archie L. Clark, "John Maguire, Butte's" Belasco"." The Montana Magazine of History (1952): 32-40. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4515771 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skyscrapers and apartment buildings===
{{Main|skyscraper|apartment|tenement}}
In Chicago and New York, new inventions facilitated the emergence of the skyscraper in the 1880s—it was a characteristic American style that was not widely copied around the world until the late 20th century. Construction required several major innovations, the elevator, and the steel beam.  The steel skeleton, developed in the 1880s, replaced the heavy brick walls that were limited to 15 or so stories in height. The skyscraper also required a complex internal structure to solve difficult issues of ventilation, steam heat, gas lighting (and later electricity), and plumbing.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Douglas, ''Skyscrapers: A social history of the very tall building in America'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Urban housing involved a wide variety of styles, but most of the attention focused on the tenement house for the working class, and the apartment building for the middle class.

The apartment building came first, as middle-class professionals, businessmen, and white-collar workers realized they did not need and could scarcely afford single-family dwellings of the type that low land costs in the towns permitted. Boarding houses were inappropriate for family; hotel suites were too expensive.  In smaller cities, there were many apartments over stores and shops, usually occupied by proprietors of small local businesses. The residents paid rent, and did not own their apartments until the emergence of cooperatives in New York City in the 20th century, and condominiums around the country after World War II. Turnover was very high, and there was seldom was a sense of neighborhood community.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Kallman Epstein, "Multifamily Dwellings and the Search for Respectability: Origins of the New York Apartment House," ''Urbanism Past &amp; Present'' (1980) Issue 2, pp 29-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Collins Cromley, ''Alone Together: A History of New York's Early Apartments'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:The Dakota 1880s.jpg|left|180px|thumb|The Dakota luxury apartment building in New York, view from [[Central Park]],  1890]]

Starting with the Stuyvesant luxury apartment house that opened in New York in 1869, and [[The Dakota]] in 1884, affluent tenants discovered that full-time staff handled the upkeep and maintenance, as well as security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Stephen |last = Birmingham|title = Life at the Dakota|date = 1979|publisher = Random House|isbn = 9780394410791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Alpern, ''New York's Fabulous Luxury Apartments: With Original Floor Plans from the Dakota, River House, Olympic Tower and Other Great Buildings'' (1987) covers 75 famous buildings starting in 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

The less-lavish middle-class apartment buildings provided gas lighting, elevators, good plumbing, central heating, and maintenance men on call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Elizabeth|last = Blackmar|title =Manhattan for Rent, 1785-1850|date =1989 |publisher = Cornell University Press|isbn = 9780801420245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston contractors build 16,000 "Triple-Deckers" Between 1870 and 1920. They were modern well-equipped buildings with a single large apartments on each floor. Chicago built thousands of apartment buildings, with the upscale ones close to the lake, where it was warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Harris, ''Chicago Apartments: A Century of Lakefront Luxury'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In every city, apartment buildings were built along the paths of the street railways, for the middle-class tenants rode the streetcar to work, while the working class saved a nickel each way and walked.

The working class crowded into tenement houses, with far fewer features and amenities. They were cheap and easy to build, and filled up almost the entire lot. There were typically five story walk-ups, with four separate apartments on each floor. There was minimal air circulation and sunlight. Until the reforms of 1879, New York tenements lacked running water or indoor toilets. Garbage pickup was erratic until late in the 19th century. Rents were cheap for those who could endure the dust, clutter, smells and noises; the only cheaper alternatives were squalid basement rooms in older buildings.  Most of the tenements survived until the urban renewal movement of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Plunz, ''A History of Housing in New York City: Dwelling Type and Social Change in the American Metropolis'' (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lure of the metropolis===
Jeffersonian America distrusted the city, and rural spokesmen repeatedly warned their young men away.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, ''The rise of the city'' pp 53-77&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881 ''The Evening Wisconsin'' newspaper warned cautious boys to stay on the farm. As paraphrased by historian Bayrd Still, the editor painted a grim contrast:
:Pure milk, wholesome water, mellow fruit, vegetables, and proper sleep and exercise are lacking in the city; and the "dense centers of population are unfavorable to moral growth as they are to  physical development." Sharpness and deception characterize the city merchant, mechanic, and professional man as well. How different is the situation of the "sturdy farmer removed from the dust and smoke and filth and vice of the crowded city....Content in his cottage...why should he long for the fare and follies of the madding crowd in the Gay Metropolis?"
The response came from a Milwaukee newspaper editor in 1871, who boasted that the ambitious young man could not be stopped: 
: The young man in the country no sooner elects for himself his course, than he makes for the nearest town. Scarcely has he grown familiar with his new surroundings, when the subtle attractions of the remoter city begin to tell upon him. There is no resisting it. It draws him like a magnet. Sooner or later, it is tolerably certain, he will be sucked into one of the great centers of life.&lt;ref&gt;Bayrd Still, "Milwaukee, 1870-1900: The Emergence of a Metropolis," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1939) 23#2 pp. 138-162 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4631304 in JSTOR] , quotes at pp 143, and 139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformers===
Historians have developed an elaborate typology of reformers in the late 19th century, focusing especially on the urban reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985) pp 108-37, 218-220&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mugwumps]] Were reform-minded Republicans who acted at the national level in the 1870s and 1880s, especially in 1884 when they split their ticket for Democrat Grover Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald W. McFarland, "The New York mugwumps of 1884: A profile." ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1963): 40-58 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2146666 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Goo Goos" were the local equivalent:  the middle-class reformers who sought "good government" regardless of party.  They typically focused on urban sanitation, better schools, and lower trolley fares for the middle-class commuters. They especially demanded a nonpolitical civil service system to replace the "spoils of victory" approach by which the winners of an election replaced city and school employees. They often formed short-lived citywide organizations, such as The Committee of 70 in New York, the Citizens' Reform Association in Philadelphia, the Citizens' Association of Chicago, and the Baltimore Reform League. They sometimes won citywide elections, but were rarely reelected. Party regulars laughed at them for trying to be independent of the political party machines by forming nonpartisan tickets. The ridicule included suggestions that the reformers were not real men: they were sissies and "mollycoddles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin P. Murphy|title=Political Manhood: Red Bloods, Mollycoddles, and the Politics of Progressive Era Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KZ_tnz6j2EC&amp;pg=PA64|year=2013|publisher=Columbia UP|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1890s, when historians call "structural reformers" were emerging; they were much more successful at reform, and marked the beginning of the [[Progressive era]]. They used national organizations, such as the [[National Municipal League]], and focused on broader principles such as honesty, efficiency, economy, and centralized decision-making by experts.  "Efficiency" was their watchword, they believed one of the problems with the machines was that they wasted enormous amounts of tax money by creating useless patronage jobs and payoffs to mid-level politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, ''The politics of efficiency: Municipal administration and reform in America, 1880-1920'' (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

Social reformers emerged in the 1890s, most famously [[Jane Addams]] Enter large complex network of reformers based at [[Hull House]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kish Sklar, "Hull House in the 1890s: A community of women reformers." ''Signs'' (1985): 658-677 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3174308 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; They were less interested in civil service reform or revising the city charter, and concentrated instead on the needs of working class housing, child labor, sanitation and welfare. Protestant churches promoted their own group of reformers, mostly women activists demanding prohibition  or sharp reductions in the baleful influence of the saloon in damaging family finances and causing family violence.  Rural America was increasingly won over by the prohibitionists, but they rarely had success in the larger cities, where they were staunchly opposed by the large German and Irish elements.&lt;ref&gt;Mohl, ''The New City'' pp 115-33&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] became well organized in cities of every size, and taught middle-class women the techniques of organization, proselytizing, and propaganda. Many of the WCTU veterans graduated into the woman's suffrage movement. Moving relentlessly from West to East, became the vote for women in state after state, and finally nationwide in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Bordin, ''Woman and Temperance: The quest for power and liberty, 1873-1900'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth S. Clemens, "Organizational repertoires and institutional change: Women's groups and the transformation of US politics, 1890-1920." ''American journal of sociology'' (1993): 755-798. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781235 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

School reform was high on the agenda, since local machine politicians used the jobs in the contracts, promote the party interest, rather than the needs of the students. After examining late 19th century reform movements in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Chicago, historian [[David Tyack]] concludes that "what the structural reformers wanted to do, then, was to replace a rather mechanical form of public bureaucracy, which was permeated with 'illegitimate' lay influence, with a streamlined 'professional' bureaucracy in which lay control was carefully filtered through a corporate school board.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Tyack, ''The one best system: A history of American urban education'' (1974) p 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanitation and public health ===
{{further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century. The worst conditions appeared in the largest cities, where the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, where sewage systems were inadequate, and the water supply was of dubious quality.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians took the lead in pointing out problems, and were of two minds on the causes. The older theory of contagion said that germs spread disease, but this theory was increasingly out of fashion by the 1840s or 1850s for two reasons. On the one hand it predicted too much-- microscopes demonstrated so many various microorganisms that there was no particular reason to associate any one of them with a specific disease. There was also a political dimension; a contagious theory of disease called for aggressive public health measures, which meant taxes and regulation the business community rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Neville Bonner, ''Medicine in Chicago: 1850-1950: A chapter in the social and scientific development of a city'' (1957) pp 24-39&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the 1880s, most experts believed in the "[[Miasma theory]]" which attributed the spread of disease to "bad air" caused by the abundance of dirt and animal waste. It indicated the need for regular garbage pickup.  By the 1880s, however, European discovery of the germ theory of disease proved decisive for the medical community, although popular belief never shook the old "bad air" theory.  Medical attention shifted from curing the sick patient to stopping the spread of the disease in the first place.  It indicated a system of quarantines, hospitalization, clean water, and proper sewage disposal.&lt;ref&gt;Martin V. Melosi, ''The Sanitary City: Urban Infrastructure in America from Colonial Times to the Present'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr [[Charles V. Chapin]] (1856-1941), head of public health in Providence Rhode Island, was a tireless campaigner for the germ theory of disease, which he repeatedly validated with his laboratory studies.  Chapin  emphatically told popular audiences germs were the true culprit, not  filth; that diseases were not indiscriminately transmitted through the smelly air; and that disinfection was not a cure-all.  He paid little attention to environmental or chemical hazards in the air and water, or to tobacco smoking, since germs were not involved. They did not become a major concern of the public health movement until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Cassedy, ''Charles V. Chapin and the Public Health Movement'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;  The second stage of public health, building on the germ theory, brought in engineers to design elaborate water and sewer systems. Their expertise was welcomed, and many became city managers after that reform was introduced in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley K. Schultz, and Clay McShane. "To engineer the metropolis: sewers, sanitation, and city planning in late-nineteenth-century America." ''Journal of American History'' (1978): 389-411. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1894086 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The Unheralded Triumph: City Government in America, 1870-1900'' (1984) pp 134-41&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century==
In the era 1890-1930, the larger cities were the focus of national attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs existed, but they Were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco dominated the West, Atlanta dominated the South, Boston dominated New England. Chicago, the nation's railroad hub, dominated the Midwest,  New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, as well as popular culture and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Goldfield and Blaine A. Brownell, ''Urban America: A History''(2nd ed. 1990), p 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive era: 1890s–1920s===
During the [[Progressive Era]] a coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts and reformers hostile to the political machines introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste and inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in Detroit Michigan, where Republican mayor [[Hazen S. Pingree]] first put together the reform coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin G. Holli, ''Reform in Detroit: Hazen S. Pingree and Urban Politics'' (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments. Progressive mayors were important in many cities,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Finegold, "Traditional Reform, Municipal Populism, and Progressivism," ''Urban Affairs Review'', (1995) 31#1 pp 20–42&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] (especially Mayor [[Tom L. Johnson|Tom Johnson]]); [[Toledo, Ohio]];&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. DeMatteo, "The Progressive As Elitist: 'Golden Rule' Jones And The Toledo Charter Reform Campaign of 1901," ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'', (1997) 69#1 pp 8–30&lt;/ref&gt; Jersey City, New Jersey;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Tobin, "The Progressive as Single Taxer: Mark Fagan and the Jersey City Experience, 1900–1917," ''American Journal of Economics &amp; Sociology'', (1974) 33#3  pp 287–298&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]];&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Schiesl, "Progressive Reform in Los Angeles under Mayor Alexander, 1909–1913," ''California Historical Quarterly,'' (1975) 534#1, pp:37–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Memphis, Tennessee]];&lt;ref&gt;G. Wayne Dowdy, "'A Business Government by a Business Man': E. H. Crump as a Progressive Mayor, 1910–1915," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly,'' (2001) 60#3 3, pp 162–175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louisville, Kentucky]];&lt;ref&gt;William E. Ellis, "Robert Worth Bingham and Louisville Progressivism, 1905–1910," ''Filson Club History Quarterly'', (1980) 54#2 pp 169–195&lt;/ref&gt; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In [[History of Illinois|Illinois]], Governor [[Frank Lowden]] undertook a major reorganization of state government.&lt;ref&gt;William Thomas Hutchinson, ''Lowden of Illinois: the life of Frank O. Lowden'' (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin was the stronghold of [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert La Follette]], who led a wing of the Republican Party. His [[Wisconsin Idea]] used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progressivism and the Wisconsin Idea|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/tp-036/?action=more_essay|publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most dramatic changes came in [[Galveston, Texas]] were a devastating hurricane and flood overwhelmed the resources of local government. Reformers abolished political parties in municipal elections, and set up a five-man commission of experts to rebuild the city. The Galveston idea was simple, efficient, and much less conducive to corruption. If lessened the Democratic influences of the average voter, but multiplied the influence of the reform minded middle-class.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, "The Galveston Plan of City Government by Commission: The Birth of a Progressive Idea." ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'' (1975): 365–408.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Galveston plan was quickly copied by many other cities, especially in the West.  By 1914 over 400 cities had nonpartisan elected commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley R. Rice, ''Progressive Cities: The Commission Government Movement in America, 1901–1920'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dayton, Ohio]] Had its great flood in 1913, and responded with the innovation of a paid, non-political [[city manager]], hired by the commissioners to run the bureaucracy; mechanical engineers were especially preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Couperus,  "The managerial revolution in local government: municipal management and the city manager in the USA and the Netherlands 1900–1940."

=== Urban planning===
{{main|History of urban planning}}
The [[Garden city movement]] was brought over from England and evolved into the "Neighborhood Unit" form of development. In the early 1900s, as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time, residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic. The response, seen first in Radburn, New Jersey, was the Neighborhood Unit-style development, which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street. The neighborhood is distinctively organized around a school, with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ann Christensen, ''The American garden city and the new towns movement'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schaffer, ''Garden Cities for America: The Radburn Experience'' (Temple University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Great Depression ===
{{main|Great Depression in the United States}}
Urban America had enjoyed strong growth and steady prosperity in the 1920s .  Large-scale immigration had ended in 1914, and never fully resumed, so that ethnic communities have become stabilized and Americanized. Upward mobility was the norm, in every sector of the population supported the rapidly growing high school system.  After the stock market crash of October 1929, the nation's optimism suddenly turned negative, with both business investments and private consumption overwhelmed by a deepening pessimism that encouraged people to cut back and reduce their expectations. The economic damage to the cities was most serious in the collapse of 80 to 90 percent of the private sector construction industry.  Cities and states started expanding their own construction programs as early as 1930, and they became a central feature of the New Deal, but private construction did not fully recover until after 1945. Many landlords so their rental income drained away and many went bankrupt. After construction,  came the widespread downturn in heavy industry, especially manufacturing of durable goods such as automobiles, machinery, and refrigerators.  The impact of unemployment was higher in the manufacturing centers in the East and Midwest, and lower in the South and West, which had less manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;William H, Mullins, ''The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929-1933: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huts and unemployed, West Houston and Mercer St., Manhattan (NYPL b13668355-482853).jpg|thumb|Huts and unemployed men in New York City, 1935.]]
One visible effect of the depression was the advent of [[Hooverville]]s, which were  ramshackle assemblages on vacant lots of cardboard boxes, tents, and small rickety wooden sheds built by homeless people. Residents lived in shacks and begged for food or went to soup kitchens. The term was coined by Charles Michelson, publicity chief of the Democratic National Committee, who referred sardonically to President [[Herbert Hoover]] whose policies he blamed for the depression.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kaltenborn, ''It Seems Like Yesterday'' (1956) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment reached 25 percent in the worst days of 1932-33, but it was unevenly distributed.  Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs.  The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Jensen, "The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553-583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR] ; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]&lt;/ref&gt;  City governments in 1930-31 tried to meet the depression by expanding public works projects, as president Herbert Hoover strongly encouraged. However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief.  They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.

The federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis.  The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector.  FERA, CCC and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.

The Democrats won easy landslides in 1932 and 1934, and an even bigger one in 1936; the hapless Republican Party seemed doomed.  The Democrats capitalized on the magnetic appeal of Roosevelt to urban America. The key groups were low skilled ethnics, especially Catholics, Jews, and blacks. The Democrats promised and delivered in terms of beer, political recognition, labor union membership, and relief jobs.  The city machines were stronger than ever, for they mobilize their precinct workers to help families who needed help the most navigate the bureaucracy and get on relief.  FDR won the vote of practically every group in 1936, including  taxpayers, small business and the middle class. However the Protestant middle class voters but turned sharply against him after the recession of 1937-38 undermined repeated promises that recovery was at hand. Historically, local political machines were primarily interested in controlling their wards and citywide elections; the smaller the turnout on election day, the easier it was to control the system.  However, for Roosevelt to win the presidency in 1936 and 1940, he needed to carry the electoral college and that meant he needed the largest possible majorities in the cities to overwhelm the out state vote.  The machines came through for him.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Biles, ''Big City Boss in Depression and War: Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago'' (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3.5 million voters on relief payrolls during the 1936 election cast 82% percent of their ballots for Roosevelt. The rapidly growing, energetic labor unions, chiefly based in the cities, turned out 80% for FDR, as did Irish, Italian and Jewish communities. In all, the nation's 106 cities over 100,000 population voted 70% for FDR in 1936, compared to his 59% elsewhere.  Roosevelt worked very well with the big city machines, with the one exception of his old nemesis, [[Tammany Hall]] in Manhattan. There he [[History of New York City (1898–1945)#Politics|supported the complicated coalition]] built around the nominal Republican [[Fiorello La Guardia]],  and based on Jewish and Italian voters mobilized by labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;Mason B. Williams, ''City of Ambition: FDR, LaGuardia, and the Making of Modern New York'' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the Republicans made an unexpected comeback, and Roosevelt’s efforts to purge the Democratic Party of his political opponents backfired badly. The conservative coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats took control of Congress, outvoted the urban liberals, and handed the expansion of New Deal ideas.  Roosevelt survived in 1940 thanks to his margin in the Solid South and in the cities.  In the North the cities over 100,000 gave Roosevelt 60% of their votes, while the rest of the North favored the GOP candidate Wendell Willkie 52%-48%.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, "The cities reelect Roosevelt: Ethnicity, religion, and class in 1940." ''Ethnicity. An Interdisciplinary Journal of the Study of Ethnic Relations'' (1981) 8#2: 189-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of full-scale war mobilization in the summer of 1940, the economies of the cities rebounded.  Even before Pearl Harbor, Washington pumped massive investments into new factories and funded round-the-clock  munitions production, guaranteeing a job to anyone who showed up at the factory gate.&lt;ref&gt;Jon C. Teaford, ''The twentieth-century American city'' (1986) pp 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The war brought a restoration of prosperity and hopeful expectations for the future across the nation. It had the greatest impact on the cities of the West Coast, especially Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Lotchin, ''The Bad City in the Good War: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Diego'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929-1937.  They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending  (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide, and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Whaples and Randall E.

The Belgian Scientific Expedition to the Great Barrier Reef was a seven month expedition beginning in 1967, sponsored by the [[University of Liège|University of Liege]], Belgium, the Belgium Ministry of Education and the National Foundation for Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monty|first=C.L.V.|date=May 1979|title=SCIENTIFIC REPORTS OF THE BELGIAN EXPEDITION ON THE AUSTRALIAN GREAT BARRIER REEFS, 1967.

This earlier expedition had studied the northern Great Barrier Reef primarily around [[Low Island (Queensland)|Low Isles]] Reef.

The 1967 expedition, led by Professor Albert Disteche&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coralseaoz.blogspot.com/2012/07/birds.html|title=The Coral Sea (Australia): No.10 THE BELGIAN EXPEDITION (1967)|last=Harding|first=John H.|date=2012-07-06|website=The Coral Sea (Australia)|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place between [[Lady Musgrave Island]] and [[Lizard Island National Park|Lizard Island]] off the coast of Queensland on the Great Barrier Reef. Seventy-five ship’s crew, many researchers and guests were involved in the expedition. Its primary objective was to make scientific marine biology films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsara.tv/fatp/2017/en/film/la-grande-barriere-de-corail/|title=La grande barrière de corail : Filmer à Tout Prix|website=www.gsara.tv|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron and Valerie Taylor|Ron Taylor]], who would become famous for his films and diving work with sharks was one of the cinematographers hired to undertake the underwater filming using a 35mm motion picture camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://74.220.29.245/bio_taylor_ron.html|title=Ron Taylor - NOGI|website=74.220.29.245|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former British warship, the De Moor was utilised for the study by the [[Belgian Navy]]. Captain Wally Muller was contracted to guide the De Moor through the [[Swain Reefs National Park|Swain Reefs]] and remain with the expedition, on his charter vessel, the Careelah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thejohnharding3.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/belgian-expedition-great-barrier-reef-1967/|title=BELGIAN EXPEDITION – (GREAT BARRIER REEF 1967), WALLY MULLER, CROWN of THORNS|date=2010-07-26|work=John Harding|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral reef scientists participated in the study as time permitted. The ship would return to shore every 10 days. Among these scientists were David Barnes from the Townsville area and [[Robert Endean]] from the [[University of Queensland]]. Sir Maurice Yonge would also visit during this expedition, in recognition of his earlier work in 1928.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later studies of the Reef would be conducted and published as part of Project Stellaroid, which surveyed coral reefs in the North Pacific Ocean and their damage by the [[Crown-of-thorns starfish|Crown of Thorns]] starfish.

'''CMAQ''' is an acronym for the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/Research/RIA/cmaq.html |title=Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model &amp;#124; Research in Action &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.cmascenter.org/cmaq/ |title=Community Modeling and Analysis (CMAS) - CMAQ |publisher=Cmascenter.org |date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sophisticated [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] to address regional air pollution problems. An example of a regional air pollution problem is a multi-state area where ozone or fine particulate levels exceed the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards|US health standards]]. In addition to simulating the emission, advection, diffusion, and deposition of air pollutants, CMAQ treats a wide array of chemical reactions that occur throughout the lower atmosphere.  For example, [[Tropospheric ozone|ozone]] forms in the atmosphere when [[nitrogen oxide]]s interact with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight.  Ammonium sulfate is formed in [[Particulates|fine particulate matter]] when sulfuric acid (formed largely in cloud water) interacts with gas-phase ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2014/534675/ |title=The Impact of Nonlocal Ammonia on Submicron Particulate Matter and Visibility Degradation in Urban Shanghai |publisher=Hindawi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meteorological conditions such as subsidence [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversions]], decrease the amount of fresh air available for dilution of air emissions, and increase the rate of production of secondary air pollutants.  CMAQ has the capability to accurately predict air pollution concentrations resulting from secondary formation.  Like any air dispersion model, CMAQ inputs air pollutant emissions and meteorological data and outputs air pollutant concentrations and deposited totals.  Its particular strength is in assessing the efficacy of regional emissions control strategies in reducing regional air pollution levels.

'''CMAQ''' may also refer to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, a program of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/air_quality/cmaq/|website=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''case method''' is a [[Teaching method|teaching approach]] that uses decision-forcing cases to put students in the role of people who were faced with difficult decisions at some point in the past. It developed during the course of the twentieth-century from its origins in the [[casebook method]] of teaching law pioneered by Harvard legal scholar [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. In sharp contrast to many other teaching methods, the case method requires that instructors refrain from providing their own opinions about the decisions in question.  Rather, the chief task of instructors who use the case method is asking students to devise and defend solutions to the problems presented by each case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&amp;sid=2257175]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Comparison with the casebook method of teaching law ==
The case method evolved from the [[casebook method]], a mode of teaching based on [[Socratic method|Socratic principles]] pioneered at [[Harvard University]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. Like the casebook method the case method calls upon students to take on the role of an actual person faced with a difficult problem.
== Decision-forcing cases ==

A decision-forcing case is a kind of [[Decision Game | decision game]].  Like any other kinds of decision games, a decision-forcing case puts students in a role of person faced with a problem (often called the "protagonist") and asks them to devise, defend, discuss, and refine solutions to that problem.  However, in sharp contrast to decision games that contain fictional elements, decision-forcing cases are based entirely upon reliable descriptions of real events.

A decision-forcing case is also a kind of case study.  That is, it is an examination of an incident that took place at some time in the past.  However, in contrast to a retrospective case study, which provides a complete description of the events in question, a decision-forcing case is based upon an "interrupted narrative."  This is an account that stops whenever the protagonist finds himself faced with an important decision.  In other words, while retrospective case studies ask students to analyze past decisions with the aid of hindsight, decision-forcing cases ask students to engage problems prospectively. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/degree-programs/teaching/Contributed-Case-Packet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of decision-forcing cases ==
In recent years, following corporate scandals and the global financial crisis, the case method has been criticized for contributing to a narrow, instrumental, amoral, managerial perspective on business where making decisions which maximise profit is all that matters, ignoring the social responsibilities of organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgman|first1=Todd|title=Beyond the Manager’s Moral Dilemma: Rethinking the ‘Ideal Type’ Business Ethics Case|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=2010|volume=94|page=311-322|doi=10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that the case method puts too much emphasis on taking action and not enough on thoughtful reflection to see things from different perspectives. It has been suggested that different approaches to case writing, that do not put students in the ‘shoes’ of a manager, be encouraged to address these concerns. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bridgman|first=Todd|last2=Cummings|first2=Stephen|last3=McLaughlin|first3=Colm|date=2016-12-01|title=Restating the Case: How Revisiting the Development of the Case Method Can Help Us Think Differently About the Future of the Business School|url=http://amle.aom.org/content/15/4/724|journal=Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education|language=en|volume=15|issue=4|pages=724–741|doi=10.5465/amle.2015.0291|issn=1537-260X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role play ==

Every decision-forcing case has a protagonist, the historical person who was faced with the problem or problem that students are asked to solve.  Thus, in engaging these problems, students necessarily engage in some degree of role play.

Some case teachers, such as those of the Marine Corps University, place a great deal of emphasis on role play, to the point of addressing each student with the name and titles of the protagonist of the case.  (A student playing the role of a king, for example, is asked "Your Majesty, what are your orders?")  Other case teachers, such as those at the Harvard Business School, place less emphasis on role play, asking students "what would you do if you were the protagonist of the case."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbs.edu/teaching/case-method-in-practice/leading-in-the-classroom/openings.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical solution ==

After discussing student solutions to the problem at the heart of a decision-forcing case, a case teacher will often provide a description of the historical solution, that is, the decision made by the protagonist of the case.  Also known as "the rest of the story", "the epilogue", or (particularly at Harvard University) "the 'B' case", the description of the historical solution can take the form of a printed article, a video, a slide presentation, a short lecture, or even an appearance by the protagonist.

Whatever the form of the description of the historical solution, the case teacher must take care to avoid giving the impression that the historical solution is the "right answer."  Rather, he should point out that the historical solution to the problem serves primarily to provide students with a baseline to which they can compare their own solutions.

Some case teachers will refrain from providing the historical solution to students.  One reason for not providing the historical solution is to encourage students to do their own research about the outcome of the case.  Another is to encourage students to think about the decision after the end of the class discussion. "Analytic and problem-solving learning," writes Kirsten Lundgren of Columbia University, "can be all the more powerful when the 'what happened' is left unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid%3D3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009025732/https://casestudies.jrn.columbia.edu/casestudy/www/case_method.asp?nid=3 |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complex cases ==

A classic decision-forcing case asks students to solve a single problem faced by a single protagonist at a particular time.  There are, however, decision-forcing cases in which students play the role of a single protagonist who is faced with a series of problems, two or more protagonists dealing with the same problem, or two or more protagonists dealing with two or more related problems.

== Decision-forcing staff rides ==

A decision-forcing case conducted in the place where the historical decisions at the heart of the case were made is called a "decision-forcing staff ride."  Also known as an "on-site decision-forcing case", a decision-forcing staff ride should not be confused with the two very different exercises that are also known as "[[staff ride |staff rides]]": retrospective battlefield tours of the type practiced by the United States Army in the twentieth century and the on-site contingency planning exercises (Stabs Reisen, literally "staff journeys") introduced by [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] in 1801 and made famous by [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder | the elder Hellmuth von Moltke]] in the middle years of the nineteenth century.

To avoid confusion between "decision-forcing staff rides" and staff rides of other sorts, the Case Method Project at the [[Marine Corps University]] in Quantico, Virginia, has adopted the term "Russell Ride" to describe the decision-forcing staff rides that it conducts.  The term is an homage to Major General[[John Henry Russell Jr.]],USMC, the 16th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the [[United States Marine Corps]] and an avid supporter of the applicatory method of instruction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://onsitetoughcase.blogspot.com/2015/11/decision-forcing-staff-ride.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Sandwich metaphors ==

Decision-forcing cases are sometimes described with a system of metaphors that compares them to various types of sandwiches.  In this system, pieces of bread serve as a metaphor for narrative elements (i.e. the start, continuation, or end of an account) and filling of the sandwich serves as a metaphor for a problem that students are asked to solve.

A decision-forcing case in which one protagonist is faced with two problems is thus a "triple-decker case."  (The bottom piece of bread is the background to the first problem, the second piece of bread is both the historical solution to the first problem and the background to the second problem, and the third piece of bread is the historical solution to the second problem.) Similarly, a decision-forcing case for which the historical solution is not provided (and is thus a case with but one narrative element) is an [[Open sandwich|"open-face"]] or [[Open sandwich|"smørrebrød"]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-sandwich-metaphor.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A decision-forcing case in which students are asked to play the role of a decision-maker who is faced with a series of decisions is sometimes called a [[White Castle (restaurant)|"White Castle"]] or [[Slider (sandwich)|"slider"]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casemethodusmc.blogspot.com/2014/10/white-castle-cases.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Case materials ==

Case materials are any materials that are used to inform the decisions made by students in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Commonly used case materials include articles that were composed for the explicit purpose of informing case discussion, secondary works initially produced for other purposes, historical documents, artifacts, video programs, and audio programs.

Case materials are made available to students at a variety times in the course of a decision-forcing case.  Materials that provide background are distributed at, or before, the beginning of the class meeting.  Materials that describe the solution arrived at by the protagonist and the results of that solution are passed out at, or after, the end of the class meeting. (These are called "the B-case", "the rest of the story", or "the reveal.")  Materials that provide information that became available to the protagonist in the course of solving the problem are given to students in the course of a class meeting.  (These are often referred to as "handouts.") &lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/content.php?pid=273794&amp;sid=4468541]&lt;/ref&gt;

Case materials may be either "refined" or "raw." Refined case materials are secondary works that were composed expressly for use as part of decision-forcing cases. (Most of the case materials that are available from case clearing houses and academic publishers are of the refined variety.) Raw case materials are those that were initially produced for reasons other than the informing of a case discussion. These include newspaper articles, video and audio news reports, historical documents, memoirs, interviews, and artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.yale.edu/our-programs/full-time-mba/curriculum/raw-case-approach]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Published case materials ==

A number of organizations, to include case clearing houses, academic publishers, and professional schools, publish case materials.  These organizations include:

* Globalens at the [[University of Michigan]]
* [[Harvard Business School]]
* [[Nagoya University of Commerce &amp; Business]]
* [[Darden School]] at the [[University of Virginia]]
* [[Asian Institute of Management]]
* [[Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad]]
* Asian Case Research Centre at the [[University of Hong Kong]]

==The narrative fallacy==

The presentation of a decision-forcing case necessarily takes the form of a story in which the protagonist is faced with a difficult problem.  This can lead to "the narrative fallacy", a mistake that leads both case teachers and the developers of case materials to ignore information that, while important to the decision that students will be asked to make, complicates the telling of the story.  This, in turn, can create a situation in which, rather than engaging the problem at the heart of the case, students "parse the case materials."  That is, they make decisions on the basis of the literary structure of the case materials rather than the underlying reality. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2008-01-23/the-case-against-case-studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques for avoiding the narrative fallacy include the avoidance of standard formats for case materials;  awareness of tropes and clichés; the use of case materials originally created for purposes other than case teaching; and the deliberate inclusion of "distractors" - information that is misleading, irrelevant, or at odds with other information presented in the case.

==Purpose of the case method==

The case method gives students the ability to quickly make sense of a complex problem, rapidly arrive at a reasonable solution, and communicate that solution to others in a succinct and effective manner. In the course of doing this, the case method also accomplishes a number of other things, each of which is valuable in its own right.  By exciting the interest of students, the case method fosters interest in professional matters.  By placing such things in a lively context, the case method facilitates the learning of facts, nomenclature, conventions, techniques, and procedures.  By providing both a forum for discussion and concrete topics to discuss, the case method encourages professional dialogue.  By providing challenging practice in the art of decision-making, the case method refines professional judgement.  By asking difficult questions, the case method empowers students to reflect upon the peculiar demands of their profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://guides.grc.usmcu.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=1246140]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his classic essay on the case method ("Because Wisdom Can't Be Told"), Charles I. Gragg of the Harvard Business School argued that "the case system, properly used, initiates students into the ways of independent thought and responsible judgement."  &lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.auckland.ac.nz/display/BUSINESS304/Because+wisdom+can't+be+told+-+1940]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompatible objectives==

While the case method can be used to accomplish a wide variety of goals, certain objectives are at odds with its nature as an exercise in professional judgement.  These incompatible objectives include attempts to use decision-forcing cases to:

* provide an example to be emulated 
* paint a particular person as a hero or a villain 
* encourage (or discourage) a particularly type of behavior 
* illustrate a pre-existing theory 

Thomas W. Shreeve, who uses the case method to teach people in the field of military intelligence, argues that "Cases are not meant to illustrate either the effective or the ineffective handling of administrative, operational, logistic, ethical, or other problems, and the characters in cases should not be portrayed either as paragons of virtue or as archvillains. The instructor/casewriter must be careful not to tell the students what to think—they are not empty vessels waiting to be filled with wisdom. With this method of teaching, a major share of the responsibility for thinking critically about the issues under discussion is shifted to the students, where it belongs." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ni-u.edu/ni_press/pdf/Experiences_to_Go.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disclaimers==

Case materials are often emblazoned with a disclaimer that warns both teachers and students to avoid the didactic, hortatory, and "best practices" fallacies.  Here are some examples of such disclaimers:


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em"&gt;This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation.&lt;/div&gt;


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em"&gt;This decision-forcing case is an exercise designed to foster empathy, creativity, a bias for action, and other martial virtues.  As such, it makes no argument for the effectiveness of any particular course of action, technique, procedure, or convention. &lt;/div&gt;''


''&lt;div style="text-indent: 2em&gt;This case is intended to serve as the basis for class discussion rather than to illustrate either the effective or ineffective handling of a situation. Its purpose is to put the student in the shoes of the decision-maker in order to gain a fuller understanding of the situations and the decisions made.&lt;/div&gt;''

== Use of the case method in professional schools ==

The case method is used in a variety of professional schools.  These include the:

The '''Center for Nanotechnology in Society''' at the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] (CNS-UCSB) is funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and "serves as a national research and education center, a network hub among researchers and educators concerned with societal issues concerning nanotechnologies, and a resource base for studying these issues in the US and abroad." The CNS-UCSB began its operations in January 2006.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.cns.ucsb.edu/about "About CNS–UCSB"] Center for Nanotechnology in Society, accessed May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guston|first1=David H.|title=Encyclopedia of Nanoscience and Society|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=1452266174|pages=80–82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vyp1AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanotechnology]] (sometimes shortened to nanotech or nano) is the study of manipulating matter on an [[atom]]ic and [[molecular]] scale. Generally, nanotechnology deals with structures sized between 1 and 100 [[nanometre]] in at least one dimension, and involves developing materials or devices possessing at least one dimension within that size. [[quantum mechanics|Quantum mechanical]] effects are very important at this scale,  which is in the [[quantum realm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703014917/http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=BJIOBN00000200000400MR17000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=Yes|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-03|author1=Cristina Buzea |author2=Ivan Pacheco |author3=Kevin Robbie |title=Nanomaterials and Nanoparticles: Sources and Toxicity|volume=2|year=2007|journal=Biointerphases|doi=10.1116/1.2815690|pmid=20419892|issue=4|pages=MR17–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNS-UCSB looks at the societal implications of nano, including governance, economics, technological development, potential environmental and health risks ([[risk perception]]), and "social risks" such as distribution of benefits.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

== History ==

The Center received its first five years of funding from the [[U.S. National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt; The Center aims to disseminate both its technological and social scientific findings on [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale science]] to policymakers and those outside the nano field, and to facilitate broader public participation in the nanotechnological enterprise. It does this through public engagement between academic researchers with regulators, educators, industrial scientists, and policy makers, as well as community-based organizations and [[NGO]]s. The Center’s education and outreach programs include students and people outside the nanotech field.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

== Focus ==

The Center has three main areas of research:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;

#the historical context of the nano-enterprise;
#innovation processes and global diffusion of nanotech;
#risk perception and the public sphere.

== Partnerships ==

CNS–UCSB researchers collaborate with the [[California NanoSystems Institute]], [[UC Santa Cruz]], [[UC Berkeley]], the [[Science History Institute]] (formerly the Chemical Heritage Foundation), [[Duke University]], [[Rice University]], [[SUNY]] Levin Institute, and SUNY New Paltz in the US, and [[Cardiff University]], UK, [[University of British Columbia]], Canada, [[University of Edinburgh]], UK, [[University of East Anglia]], UK, as well as institutes and centers in China and East Asia.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

'''ClickWorkers''' is a small [[NASA]] experimental [[project]] that uses public [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s (nicknamed "clickworkers" on the site) for scientific tasks. Clickworkers are able to work when, and for however long they choose, doing routine analysis that would normally require months of work by [[scientist]]s or [[graduate school|graduate]] students. The web site and database were created and maintained by one engineer, Bob Kanefsky, and advised by two scientists, Nadine Barlow and Virginia Gulick.&lt;ref&gt;Kanefsky, B., N.G. Barlow, and V.C. Gulick. (2001). "Can Distributed Volunteers Accomplish Massive Data Analysis Tasks?" ''Proceedings of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' XXXII.[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001LPI....32.1272K]&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot study was sponsored by the [[NASA Ames Director's Discretionary Fund]].

== Identifying Martian craters ==
The original phase ran from November 2000 to September 2001, identifying and classifying the age of craters on Mars images from [[Viking Orbiter]] that had already been analyzed by NASA. The goal was to answer two meta-science questions:
# Is the public ready, willing, and able to help science?
# Does this new way of powering science analysis produce results that are just as good as the traditional way?

In February 2001 clickworkers started processing new images from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], surveying small craters never before cataloged. Clickworkers also searched Mars images for "honeycomb" terrain, although no further images were discovered and it is suspected that this is an illusory feature type. Their analysis might potentially be useful for scientists, although there are no specific plans for using it yet.

{{As of|2007}}, new beta tasks are up on the Clickworker site. This time workers are being asked to help catalog Mars landforms in one of two ways. In the first task, high resolution images from the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter are displayed and the volunteers are to stamp areas on the image with appropriate landform types. The second task takes a different approach and displays wider field views from the older MOC camera on Mars Global Surveyor. The landforms on these wider views are then marked, and interesting features can be tagged for possible future hi-res imaging with HiRISE. As of November 2009 the HiRISE site was down.

== New site ==
In November 2009 it was announced that NASA has developed a new website to allow volunteer users to help in Martian mapping. The site "Be a Martian" went live on November 17, 2009, and allows users to either map features or count craters on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8364865.stm BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Science &amp; Environment &amp;#124; How to explore Mars and have fun]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crowdsourcing ==
A clickworker is a type of online worker, usually performing duties within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform and generally on a per-task pay rate.

Those on the far side do not obstruct this light source and so do not have this dark appearance.&lt;ref name=Meaburn /&gt;

== Relation to other photoevaporation flows ==

Cometary knots are one type of ionized [[photoevaporation]] flow, which is characteristically associated with planetary nebulae, but several other types of photoevaporation flows ([[proplyd]]s, [[cometary globule]]s, [[Elephant trunk (astronomy)|elephant trunks]], and [[champagne flow]]s) are known from [[H II region]]s such as the [[Orion Nebula]].  Cometary knots are described as more [[advection]]-dominated than the other varieties, which are [[Plasma recombination|recombination]]-dominated or dust-dominated.  The distinction can be made in terms of the formula for the "dynamic ionization balance within a photoevaporation flow", F&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ ''μn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + αn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;h''.  Here F&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; is the "ionizing photon flux incident on the outside of the flow", μ is the "initial velocity of the flow", α is the "recombination coefficient", n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the "peak ionized density in the flow", and h, which is approximately 0.1 r&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is the "effective thickness of the flow".  In advection-dominated flows, ''μn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is greater than ''αn&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;h'', and most of the incoming photons reach the ionization front and ionize fresh gas.  In other flows, most photons fail to reach the ionization front, and instead balance recombinations in the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2001IAUS..205..272H|title=Title: Classification of ionized photoevaporation flows|author=Henney, W.

Several structures have been described as cometary knots or [[cometary globule]]s that surround [[R Coronae Borealis]], which is a peculiar star described as potentially the result of a [[white dwarf]] merger or final helium shell flash that periodically dims due to a build-up of carbon dust surrounding it, acting as a 'natural [[coronograph]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/743/1/44/meta;jsessionid=EC354DAF84FB2F91B95476AD5F9A873B.c1|title=The circumstellar environment of R Coronae Borealis: white dwarf merger of final-helium-shell flash?|author=Geoffrey C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36857">'''Computational chemistry''' is a branch of [[chemistry]] that uses [[computer simulation]] to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of [[theoretical chemistry]], incorporated into efficient [[computer program]]s, to calculate the structures and properties of [[molecule]]s and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion ([[dihydrogen cation]], see references therein for more details), the quantum [[many-body problem]] cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form.  While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical [[experiment]]s, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical [[phenomena]]. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.

Examples of such properties are structure (i.e., the expected positions of the constituent atoms), absolute and [[interaction energy|relative]] (interaction) [[energy|energies]], [[electron]]ic [[charge density]] distributions, [[dipole]]s and higher [[multipole moment]]s, [[vibrational spectroscopy|vibrational frequencies]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], or other [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] quantities, and [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for [[scattering theory|collision]] with other particles.

The methods used cover both static and dynamic situations. In all cases, the computer time and other resources (such as memory and disk space) increase rapidly with the size of the system being studied.  That system can be one molecule, a group of molecules, or a solid.  Computational chemistry methods range from very approximate to highly accurate; the latter are usually feasible for small systems only. [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''Ab initio'' methods]] are based entirely on [[quantum mechanics]] and basic [[physical constant]]s. Other methods are called empirical or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical]] because they use additional empirical parameters.

Both ''[[ab initio]]'' and semi-empirical approaches involve approximations.  These range from simplified forms of the first-principles equations that are easier or faster to solve, to approximations limiting the size of the system (for example, [[periodic boundary conditions]]), to fundamental approximations to the underlying equations that are required to achieve any solution to them at all.  For example, most ''ab initio'' calculations make the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which greatly simplifies the underlying [[Schrödinger equation]] by assuming that the nuclei remain in place during the calculation.  In principle, [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|''ab initio'' methods]] eventually converge to the exact solution of the underlying equations as the number of approximations is reduced.  In practice, however, it is impossible to eliminate all approximations, and residual error inevitably remains.  The goal of computational chemistry is to minimize this residual error while keeping the calculations tractable.

In some cases, the details of electronic structure are less important than the long-time [[phase space]] behavior of molecules. This is the case in conformational studies of proteins and protein-ligand binding thermodynamics. Classical approximations to the [[potential energy surface]] are used, as they are computationally less intensive than electronic calculations, to enable longer simulations of [[molecular dynamics]]. Furthermore, [[cheminformatics]] uses even more empirical (and computationally cheaper) methods like [[machine learning]] based on physicochemical properties. One typical problem in cheminformatics is to predict the binding affinity of drug molecules to a given target.

== History ==
Building on the founding discoveries and theories in the [[history of quantum mechanics]], the first theoretical calculations in chemistry were those of [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] in 1927. The books that were influential in the early development of computational quantum chemistry include [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. Bright Wilson]]'s 1935 ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics – with Applications to Chemistry'', [[Henry Eyring (chemist)|Eyring]], Walter and Kimball's 1944 ''Quantum Chemistry'', Heitler's 1945 ''Elementary Wave Mechanics – with Applications to Quantum Chemistry'', and later [[Charles Coulson|Coulson]]'s 1952 textbook ''Valence'', each of which served as primary references for chemists in the decades to follow.

With the development of efficient [[computer]] technology in the 1940s, the solutions of elaborate [[wave equation]]s for complex [[atom]]ic systems began to be a realizable objective.  In the early 1950s, the first semi-empirical atomic orbital calculations were performed. Theoretical chemists became extensive users of the early digital computers. One major advance came with the 1951 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics by Clemens C. J. Roothaan in 1951, largely on the "LCAO MO" approach (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals Molecular Orbitals), for many years the second-most cited paper in that journal. A very detailed account of such use in the United Kingdom is given by Smith and Sutcliffe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Smith |first= S. J. |last2= Sutcliffe |first2= B. T. |title= The development of Computational Chemistry in the United Kingdom |journal= Reviews in Computational Chemistry |volume= 10 |pages= 271–316 |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''ab initio'' [[Hartree–Fock method]] calculations on diatomic molecules were performed in 1956 at MIT, using a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]] of [[Slater orbital]]s. For diatomic molecules, a systematic study using a minimum basis set and the first calculation with a larger basis set were published by Ransil and Nesbet respectively in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schaefer |first =Henry F. III |title= The electronic structure of atoms and molecules |publisher= Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. |year= 1972 |page= 146 |location= Reading, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first polyatomic calculations using [[Gaussian orbital]]s were performed in the late 1950s. The first [[configuration interaction]] calculations were performed in Cambridge on the [[EDSAC]] computer in the 1950s using Gaussian orbitals by [[Francis Boys|Boys]] and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boys |first= S.

In 1964, [[Hückel method]] calculations (using a simple [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) method to determine electron energies of molecular orbitals of π electrons in conjugated hydrocarbon systems) of molecules, ranging in complexity from [[butadiene]] and [[benzene]] to [[ovalene]], were generated on computers at Berkeley and Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Streitwieser |first= A. |last2=Brauman |first2= J.

In the early 1970s, efficient ''ab initio'' computer programs such as ATMOL, [[Gaussian (software)|Gaussian]], IBMOL, and POLYAYTOM, began to be used to speed ''ab initio'' calculations of molecular orbitals. Of these four programs, only Gaussian, now vastly expanded, is still in use, but many other programs are now in use. At the same time, the methods of [[molecular mechanics]], such as MM2 [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], were developed, primarily by [[Norman Allinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Allinger |first= Norman |authorlink= Norman Allinger

One of the first mentions of the term ''computational chemistry'' can be found in the 1970 book ''Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences'' by Sidney Fernbach and Abraham Haskell Taub, where they state "It seems, therefore, that 'computational chemistry' can finally be more and more of a reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fernbach |first= Sidney |last2=Taub |first2= Abraham Haskell |title= Computers and Their Role in the Physical Sciences |publisher= Routledge |year= 1970 |isbn= 0-677-14030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, widely different methods began to be seen as part of a new emerging discipline of ''computational chemistry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/bookhome/114034476 |title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry |chapter=vol 1, preface|doi=10.1002/9780470125786}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Journal of Computational Chemistry]]'' was first published in 1980.

Computational chemistry has featured in several Nobel Prize awards, most notably in 1998 and 2013. [[Walter Kohn]], "for his development of the density-functional theory", and [[John Pople]], "for his development of computational methods in quantum chemistry", received the 1998 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1998/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1998|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Karplus]], [[Michael Levitt]] and [[Arieh Warshel]] received the 2013 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry for "the development of multiscale models for complex chemical systems".&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite press release

== Fields of application ==

The term ''theoretical chemistry'' may be defined as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas ''computational chemistry'' is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on a computer. In theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop [[algorithm]]s and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for [[chemical reaction]]s. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.

Computational chemistry has two different aspects:
* Computational studies, used to find a starting point for a laboratory synthesis, or to assist in understanding experimental data, such as the position and source of spectroscopic peaks.
* Computational studies, used to predict the possibility of so far entirely unknown molecules or to explore reaction mechanisms not readily studied via experiments.

Thus, computational chemistry can assist the experimental chemist or it can challenge the experimental chemist to find entirely new chemical objects.

Several major areas may be distinguished within computational chemistry:
* The prediction of the molecular structure of molecules by the use of the simulation of forces, or more accurate quantum chemical methods, to find stationary points on the energy surface as the position of the nuclei is varied.
* Storing and searching for data on chemical entities (see [[chemical database]]s).
* Identifying [[correlation]]s between [[chemical structure]]s and properties (see ''quantitative structure–property relationship'' (QSPR) and ''[[quantitative structure–activity relationship]]'' (QSAR)).
* Computational approaches to help in the efficient synthesis of compounds.
* Computational approaches to design molecules that interact in specific ways with other molecules (e.g. [[drug design]] and [[catalysis]]).

== Accuracy ==
The words ''exact'' and ''perfect'' do not apply here, as very few aspects of chemistry can be computed exactly. However, almost every aspect of chemistry can be described in a qualitative or approximate quantitative computational scheme.

Molecules consist of nuclei and electrons, so the methods of [[quantum mechanics]] apply. Computational chemists often attempt to solve the non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]], with relativistic corrections added, although some progress has been made in solving the fully relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. In principle, it is possible to solve the Schrödinger equation in either its time-dependent or time-independent form, as appropriate for the problem in hand; in practice, this is not possible except for very small systems. Therefore, a great number of approximate methods strive to achieve the best trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Accuracy can always be improved with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in [[ab initio]] models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of small molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with errors for energies less than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen atoms is computationally tractable by more approximate methods such as [[density functional theory]] (DFT).

There is some dispute within the field whether or not the latter methods are sufficient to describe complex chemical reactions, such as those in biochemistry. Large molecules can be studied by semi-empirical approximate methods. Even larger molecules are treated by [[classical mechanics]] methods that use what are called [[molecular mechanics]] (MM).  In QM-MM methods, small parts of large complexes are treated quantum mechanically (QM), and the remainder is treated approximately (MM).

== Methods ==
One molecular formula can represent more than one molecular isomer: a set of isomers. Each isomer is a local minimum on the energy surface (called the [[potential energy surface]]) created from the total energy (i.e., the electronic energy, plus the repulsion energy between the nuclei) as a function of the coordinates of all the nuclei. A stationary point is a geometry such that the derivative of the energy with respect to all displacements of the nuclei is zero. A local (energy) minimum is a stationary point where all such displacements lead to an increase in energy. The local minimum that is lowest is called the global minimum and corresponds to the most stable isomer. If there is one particular coordinate change that leads to a decrease in the total energy in both directions, the stationary point is a [[Transition state|transition structure]] and the coordinate is the [[reaction coordinate]]. This process of determining stationary points is called [[geometry optimization]].

The determination of molecular structure by [[geometry optimization]] became routine only after efficient methods for calculating the first derivatives of the energy with respect to all atomic coordinates became available. Evaluation of the related second derivatives allows the prediction of vibrational frequencies if harmonic motion is estimated. More importantly, it allows for the characterization of stationary points. The frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the [[Hessian matrix]], which contains second derivatives. If the eigenvalues are all positive, then the frequencies are all real and the stationary point is a local minimum. If one eigenvalue is negative (i.e., an imaginary frequency), then the stationary point is a transition structure. If more than one eigenvalue is negative, then the stationary point is a more complex one, and is usually of little interest. When one of these is found, it is necessary to move the search away from it if the experimenter is looking solely for local minima and transition structures.

The total energy is determined by approximate solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, usually with no relativistic terms included, and by making use of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which allows for the separation of electronic and nuclear motions, thereby simplifying the Schrödinger equation. This leads to the evaluation of the total energy as a sum of the electronic energy at fixed nuclei positions and the repulsion energy of the nuclei. A notable exception are certain approaches called [[direct quantum chemistry]], which treat electrons and nuclei on a common footing. Density functional methods and semi-empirical methods are variants on the major theme. For very large systems, the relative total energies can be compared using molecular mechanics. The ways of determining the total energy to predict molecular structures are:

=== ''Ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main article|Ab initio quantum chemistry methods}}

The programs used in computational chemistry are based on many different [[quantum chemistry|quantum-chemical]] methods that solve the molecular [[Schrödinger equation]] associated with the [[molecular Hamiltonian]]. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations&amp;nbsp;– being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data&amp;nbsp;– are called ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]''. This does not imply that the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best that is possible with a finite [[word length]] on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).

[[File:Electron correlation.png|thumb|right|300px|Diagram illustrating various ''ab initio'' electronic structure methods in terms of energy. Spacings are not to scale.]]

The simplest type of ''ab initio'' electronic structure calculation is the [[Hartree–Fock method]] (HF), an extension of [[molecular orbital theory]], in which the correlated electron-electron repulsion is not specifically taken into account; only its average effect is included in the calculation. As the basis set size is increased, the energy and wave function tend towards a limit called the Hartree–Fock limit. Many types of calculations (termed [[post-Hartree–Fock]] methods) begin with a Hartree–Fock calculation and subsequently correct for electron-electron repulsion, referred to also as [[electronic correlation]]. As these methods are pushed to the limit, they approach the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. To obtain exact agreement with experiment, it is necessary to include relativistic and [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|spin orbit]] terms, both of which are far more important for heavy atoms. In all of these approaches, along with choice of method, it is necessary to choose a [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. This is a set of functions, usually centered on the different atoms in the molecule, which are used to expand the molecular orbitals with the [[linear combination of atomic orbitals]] (LCAO) molecular orbital method [[ansatz]]. Ab initio methods need to define a level of theory (the method) and a basis set.

The Hartree–Fock wave function is a single configuration or determinant. In some cases, particularly for bond breaking processes, this is inadequate, and several [[Multi-configurational self-consistent field|configurations]] must be used. Here, the coefficients of the configurations, and of the basis functions, are optimized together.

The total molecular energy can be evaluated as a function of the [[molecular geometry]]; in other words, the [[potential energy surface]]. Such a surface can be used for reaction dynamics. The stationary points of the surface lead to predictions of different [[isomer]]s and the [[Transition state theory|transition structures]] for conversion between isomers, but these can be determined without a full knowledge of the complete surface.

A particularly important objective, called computational [[thermochemistry]], is to calculate thermochemical quantities such as the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]] to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is generally considered to be 1&amp;nbsp;kcal/mol or 4&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called [[quantum chemistry composite methods]].

=== Density functional methods ===
{{Main article|Density functional theory}}

Density functional theory (DFT) methods are often considered to be ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio methods]]'' for determining the molecular electronic structure, even though many of the most common [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] use parameters derived from empirical data, or from more complex calculations. In DFT, the total energy is expressed in terms of the total one-[[electronic density|electron density]] rather than the wave function. In this type of calculation, there is an approximate [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] and an approximate expression for the total electron density. DFT methods can be very accurate for little computational cost. Some methods combine the density functional exchange functional with the Hartree–Fock exchange term and are termed [[hybrid functional]] methods.

=== Semi-empirical methods ===
{{Main article|Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods}}

Semi-empirical [[quantum chemistry]] methods are based on the [[Hartree–Fock method]] formalism, but make many approximations and obtain some parameters from empirical data. They were very important in computational chemistry from the 60s to the 90s, especially for treating large molecules where the full Hartree–Fock method without the approximations were too costly. The use of empirical parameters appears to allow some inclusion of correlation effects into the methods.

Primitive semi-empirical methods were designed even before, where the two-electron part of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is not explicitly included. For π-electron systems, this was the [[Hückel method]] proposed by [[Erich Hückel]], and for all valence electron systems, the [[extended Hückel method]] proposed by [[Roald Hoffmann]]. Sometimes, Hückel methods are referred to as "completely emprirical" because they do not derive from a Hamiltonian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Counts|first=Richard W.|date=1987-07-01|title=Strategies I|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01676961|journal=Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=177–178|doi=10.1007/bf01676961|issn=0920-654X|bibcode=1987JCAMD...1..177C}}&lt;/ref&gt;Yet, the term "empirical methods", or "empirical force fields" is usually used to describe Molecular Mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470125793.ch4/summary|title=Reviews in Computational Chemistry|last=Dinur|first=Uri|last2=Hagler|first2=Arnold T.|date=1991|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=9780470125793|editor-last=Lipkowitz|editor-first=Kenny B.|pages=99–164|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470125793.ch4|editor-last2=Boyd|editor-first2=Donald B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular mechanics ===
{{Main article|Molecular mechanics}}

In many cases, large molecular systems can be modeled successfully while avoiding quantum mechanical calculations entirely. [[Molecular mechanics]] simulations, for example, use one classical expression for the energy of a compound, for instance the [[harmonic oscillator]]. All constants appearing in the equations must be obtained beforehand from experimental data or ''ab initio'' calculations.

The database of compounds used for parameterization, i.e., the resulting set of parameters and functions is called the [[Force field (chemistry)|force field]], is crucial to the success of molecular mechanics calculations. A force field parameterized against a specific class of molecules, for instance proteins, would be expected to only have any relevance when describing other molecules of the same class.

These methods can be applied to proteins and other large biological molecules, and allow studies of the approach and interaction (docking) of potential drug molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/JMGM_article.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jmgm.2006.02.008|pmid=16574446|title=Molecular dynamics of a biophysical model for β2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation|journal=Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling|volume=25|issue=4|pages=396|year=2006|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Zauhar|first2=Randy J.|last3=Lanzara|first3=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bio-balance.com/GPCR_Activation.pdf|doi=10.1016/S0166-1280(98)90217-2|title=Activation of G protein-coupled receptors entails cysteine modulation of agonist binding|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM|volume=430|pages=57|year=1998|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Lester A.|last2=Lanzara|first2=Richard G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods for solids ===
{{Main article|Computational chemical methods in solid state physics}}

Computational chemical methods can be applied to [[solid state physics]] problems. The electronic structure of a crystal is in general described by a [[band structure]], which defines the energies of electron orbitals for each point in the [[Brillouin zone]]. Ab initio and semi-empirical calculations yield orbital energies; therefore, they can be applied to band structure calculations. Since it is time-consuming to calculate the energy for a molecule, it is even more time-consuming to calculate them for the entire list of points in the Brillouin zone.

=== Chemical dynamics ===
Once the electronic and [[molecular geometry|nuclear]] variables are [[separation of variables|separated]] (within the Born–Oppenheimer representation), in the time-dependent approach, the [[wave packet]] corresponding to the nuclear [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] is propagated via the [[time evolution]] [[operator (physics)]] associated to the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] (for the full [[molecular Hamiltonian]]). In the [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]] energy-dependent approach, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is solved using the [[scattering theory]] formalism. The potential representing the interatomic interaction is given by the [[potential energy surface]]s. In general, the [[potential energy surface]]s are coupled via the [[vibronic coupling]] terms.

The most popular methods for propagating the [[wave packet]] associated to the [[molecular geometry]] are:
* the [[split operator technique]],
* the [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev (real) polynomial]],
* the [[multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree]] method (MCTDH),
* the semiclassical method.

=== Molecular dynamics ===
{{Main article|Molecular dynamics}}

Molecular dynamics (MD) use either [[quantum mechanics]], [[molecular mechanics]] or a [[QM/MM|mixture of both]] to calculate forces which are then used to solve [[Newton's laws of motion]] to examine the time-dependent behaviour of systems. The result of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory that describes how the position and velocity of particles varies with time.

=== Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) ===
{{Main article|QM/MM}}
QM/MM is a hybrid method that attempts to combine the accuracy of quantum mechanics with the speed of molecular mechanics. It is useful for simulating very large molecules such as [[enzyme]]s.

== Interpreting molecular wave functions ==

The [[atoms in molecules]] (QTAIM) model of [[Richard Bader]] was developed to effectively link the quantum mechanical model of a molecule, as an electronic wavefunction, to chemically useful concepts such as atoms in molecules, functional groups, bonding, the theory of [[Lewis pair]]s, and the [[Valence bond theory|valence bond model]]. Bader has demonstrated that these empirically useful chemistry concepts can be related to the [[topology]] of the observable charge density distribution, whether measured or calculated from a quantum mechanical wavefunction. QTAIM analysis of molecular wavefunctions is implemented, for example, in the [[AIMAll]] software package.

== Software packages ==
Many self-sufficient [[:Category:Computational chemistry software|computational chemistry software packages]] exist. Some include many methods covering a wide range, while others concentrate on a very specific range or even on one method. Details of most of them can be found in:
* [[Biomolecular]] modelling programs: [[List of protein structure prediction software|proteins]], [[Comparison of nucleic acid simulation software|nucleic acid]].
* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling|Molecular mechanics]] programs.
* [[List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software|Quantum chemistry and solid state physics software]] supporting several methods.
* [[Molecular design software]]
* [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] programs.
* [[Valence bond programs]].

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==

The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S. J. |last2=Sack |first2=L. |last3=Franklin |first3=C. E. |last4=Farrell |first4=A. P. |last5=Beardall |first5=J. |last6=Wikelski |first6=M. |last7=Chown |first7=S.

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;

=== Natural resource conservation ===

Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=www.ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175825/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection. For recent discussions, see: {{cite journal |author=Kay CE |title=The Ultimate Tragedy of Commons |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=1447–8 |year=1997 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.97069.x}}&lt;br/&gt;''and'' {{cite journal|vauthors=Wilson DS, Wilson EO |title=Rethinking the theoretical foundation of sociobiology |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=82 |issue=4 |pages=327–48 |date=December 2007 |pmid=18217526 |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/resources/publications_resources/Rethinking |doi=10.1086/522809 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326151243/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/dswilson/resources/publications_resources/Rethinking%20sociobiology.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]]. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004).

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the [[Tao]], [[Shinto]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primack 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Primack | first =Richard B. | title = A Primer of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year= 2004 | pages = 320pp. | isbn = 0-87893-728-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture [[land degradation]]: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, E., and H.

=== Early naturalists ===

[[File:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[gyrfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]] ]]

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E. O. Wilson |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E. L. | year = 1972 | title = James Burnett, Lord Monboddo | publication-place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 196 | isbn = 0-19-812437-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of thinkers, among them notably [[Lord Monboddo]],&lt;ref name="Cloyd" /&gt; described the importance of "preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in [[Christian theology]].

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author1=G.

In the [[United States]], the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] gave the President power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, and the [[New York Zoological Society]] was set up in 1895. A series of [[National Park|national forests and preserves]] were established by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from 1901 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation - Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223142405/http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-23 |title=Environmental timeline 1890–1920 |website=runet.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Davis96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7185-1548-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring extinction rates ===
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E. O. Wilson|title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems.

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.'&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Conservation priorities ===

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | isbn= | pmid=20056880 | ref=harv|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Will R. |last2=Brandon |first2=Katrina |last3=Brooks |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Costanza |first4=Robert |last5=da Fonesca |first5=Gustavo A. B. |last6=Portela |first6=Rosimeiry |title=Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=10 |year=2007 |pages=868–73 |doi=10.1641/B571009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A.

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where [[biomass]], not biodiversity, reigns supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Underwood EC, Shaw MR, Wilson KA |title=Protecting Biodiversity when Money Matters: Maximizing Return on Investment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e1515 |year=2008 |pmid=18231601 |pmc=2212107 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001515 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001515|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1515U |editor1-last=Somers |editor1-first=Michael |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the [[endemic species]] to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroux SJ, Schmiegelow FK |title=Biodiversity concordance and the importance of endemism |journal=Conserv.

Summary of 2006 [[IUCN Red List]] categories

Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|title= The Biodiversity Hotspots|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222043456/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate= 2008-12-22|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass.&lt;ref name="Wood08" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2012}} Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary [[adaptation|adaptability]], and biomass.&lt;ref&gt;The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowen |first=B.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main article|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main article|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Miner's canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C. Dennis |author2=Meffe, Gary K. |title=Principles of conservation biology |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1997 |isbn=0-87893-521-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|88–89}}).

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main article|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;Fedriani JM, García L, Sanchéz M, Calderon J, and C Ramo. 2017. Long-term impact of protected colonial birds on a jeopardized cork oak population: conservation bias leads to restoration failure. Journal of Applied Ecology 54: 450-458.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and trends ==

Conservation biologists study trends and process from the [[paleontological]] past to the [[ecological]] present as they gain an understanding of the context related to [[species extinction]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt; It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include: the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|Ordovician]] (440 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian]] (370 mya), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] (245 mya), [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] (200 mya), and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (66 mya) extinction spasms. Within the last 10,000 years, human influence over the Earth's ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost;&lt;ref name="Ehrlich"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ehrlich, Anne H. |author2=Ehrlich, Paul R. |title=Extinction: the causes and consequences of the disappearance of species |publisher=Random House |location=New York |year=1981 |isbn=0-394-51312-6 }}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is to say the rates of [[deforestation]], [[Coral reef destruction|reef destruction]], [[Threats to wetlands|wetland draining]] and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species.

=== Status of oceans and reefs ===
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}}

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005.

This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d. Web. 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=C. |title=Ecology: Report Warns of Looming Pollination Crisis in North America |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |page=397 |year=2006 |pmid=17053115 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5798.397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |title=Entomology: The Case of the Empty Hives |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=970–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17510336 |doi=10.1126/science.316.5827.970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main article|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

=== Threats to biodiversity ===
{{Main article|Biodiversity threats}}

Today, many threats to Biodiversity exist. An acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day H.I.P.P.O stands for Habitat Loss, Invasive Species, Pollution, Human Population, and Overharvesting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog030/node/394|title=Threats to Biodiversity {{!}} GEOG 030: Geographic Perspectives on Sustainability and  Human-Environment Systems, 2011|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary threats to biodiversity are [[habitat destruction]] (such as [[deforestation]], [[agricultural expansion]], [[Urban planning|urban development]]), and [[overexploitation]] (such as [[wildlife trade]]).&lt;ref name="Ehrlich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freckleton |first1=Rob |last2=Sodhi |first2=Navjot S. |last3=Bickford |first3=David |last4=Diesmos |first4=Arvin C. |last5=Lee |first5=Tien Ming |last6=Koh |first6=Lian Pin |last7=Brook |first7=Barry W. |last8=Sekercioglu |first8=Cagan H. |last9=Bradshaw |first9=Corey J.

'''Corrected speed''' is the [[Rotational speed|speed]] a component would rotate at if the inlet temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at [[sea level]], on a standard day (i.e. 288.15&amp;nbsp;K).

Corrected speed '''&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;''' can be calculated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{\theta} = N/\sqrt{T/288.15}.&lt;/math&gt;

Corrected speed is often abbreviated to &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; (for '''referred speed''').

So-called '''non-dimensional speed''' &lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{T}&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to corrected speed:

:&lt;math&gt;N/\sqrt{T}= (N/\sqrt{\theta}) / \sqrt{288.15}&lt;/math&gt;

Nomenclature:

*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; – stagnation (or total) temperature (in [[kelvin]]s),
*&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; – real shaft speed,
*&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; – referred temperature.

In relative form, corrected speed, referred speed and non-dimensional speed are all measures of peripheral [[Mach number]].

A '''data item''' describes an atomic state of a particular object concerning a specific property at a certain time point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.unece.org/stat/platform/download/attachments/14319930/Neuchatel+Model+V1.pdf?version=1 |title=Neuchâtel Terminology Model PART II: Variables and related concepts }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of data items for the same object at the same time forms an object instance (or table row). Any type of complex information can be broken down to elementary data items (atomic state). Data items are identified by [[Object (computer science)|object]] (o), [[property]] (p) and [[time]] (t), while the value (v) is a function of o, p and t: '''v = F(o,p,t)'''.

Values typically are represented by [[symbols]] like numbers, texts, images, sounds, videos or others. Values are not necessarily atomic. The complexity of a value depends on the complexity of the property and time component.

When looking at databases or XML files, the object is usually identified by an object name or other type of object identifier, which is part of the "data". Properties are defined as columns (table row), properties (object instance) or tags (XML). Often, time is not explicitly expressed and is an attribute applying to the complete data set. Other data collections provide time on the instance level (time series), on column level or even on attribute/property level.

The '''Economic Warfare School''' (EGE in French) is a French academic curriculum dedicated to [[competitive intelligence]].

== History ==
The Economic Warfare School was created in October 1997 by General Officer Jean Pichot-Duclos, former head of the [[French Army]] Intelligence Training Centre and Christian Harbulot Chief Operating Officer for [[competitive intelligence]] at [[Défense conseil international|DCI group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/economie/1997/05/08/-_206297|title=La guerre économique, un art qui s'enseigne|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Economic Warfare School offers [[Master of Business Administration|MBA program]] specialized in [[Competitive intelligence]] and [[Strategy]] for students who have graduated from prestigious schools and universities. It also offers a one-year professional program for senior managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/les-formations-executives.html|title=Les formations executives - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/la-formation-initiale.html|title=Les formations initiales - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curriculum and research program  of the Economic Warfare School are based on a forward-looking [[risk management]] methodology which goes beyond those traditionally used by corporate management and market competition theories so that they are specifically tailored to suit decision-makers' needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/l-ecole/presentation/economic-warfare-school-of-paris.html|title=Economic Warfare School of Paris - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté|website=www.ege.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique academic approach of the school combines constant production of knowledge, investigation and use of information technologies. Throughout their entire program the students work for the benefit of real actors of the public and private sector allowing them to face the reality and responsibilities of their future jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/la-formation-initiale/programme-mercurie.html |title=Programme MercurIE - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté |publisher=Ege.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unique teaching programme makes it one of the most renowned school in its field worldwilde and enables its graduates to be directly operational for [[Competitive intelligence|competitive]] and [[business intelligence]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ege.fr/index.php/actualites/evenements/item/classement-international-best-masters-2017-l-ege-en-tete-des-formations-francaises-en-intelligence-economique.html |title=Classement international Best Masters 2017 : L’EGE en tête des formations françaises en intelligence économique - Formations Intelligence économique Cyber Sûreté |publisher=Ege.fr |date= |accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Ranking ==
The Economic Warfare School is ranked at the 1st place since 2002 in the [[Eduniversal|Eduniversal SMBG ranking]] for the best [[Master's degree in Europe|Masters]] and [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in [[Competitive Intelligence]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.meilleurs-masters.com/master-intelligence-economique/ecole-de-guerre-economique-groupe-eslsca-mba-specialise-strategie-et-intelligence-economique.html|title=EGE Ecole de Guerre Economique N°1  au classement Masters Intelligence Economique, MBA Stratégie et Intelligence Economique|website=www.meilleurs-masters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eglinton Castle''' was a large Gothic castellated mansion in [[Kilwinning]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]].

==History==

===The castle===
[[Image:Eglintoncastle1876.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Tournament Bridge and castle in 1876&lt;ref name="Dobie"&gt;Dobie, James (1876). ''Pont's Cuninghame'' Pub. John Tweed.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Eglinton castle (old).jpg|thumb|190px|right|Eglintoune castle from the south, prior to the rebuild of 1805]]
The ancient seat of the [[Earl of Eglinton|Earls of Eglinton]], it is located just south of the town of [[Kilwinning]]. The original Eglinton Castle was burnt by the [[Earl of Glencairn]] in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). ''Collins Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia''. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 278 - 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The current castle was built between 1797 and 1802 in Gothic [[castellated]] style dominated by a central {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} large round [[keep]] and four {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on}} outer towers, it was second only to [[Culzean Castle]] in appearance and grandeur. The foundation stone of the new Eglinton Castle in Kilwinning was laid in 1797, the 12th Earl of Eglinton, was proud to have the ceremony performed by Alexander Hamilton of [[Kerelaw House|Grange]], grandfather of the American Hero [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/450posteric.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.kilwinning.org/eglintoncastle/default.htm&amp;usg=__mIQHTNpIt-5W7ywc3whs7VG1lEU=&amp;h=153&amp;w=450&amp;sz=21&amp;hl=en&amp;start=39&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=QO0c96naJtfSFM:&amp;tbnh=43&amp;tbnw=127&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3DEarl%2Bof%2BEglinton%26ndsp%3D20%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26channel%3Ds%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DN%26start%3D20%26um%3D1 Kilwinning Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ainslie's Eglinton in 1790.JPG|thumb|200px|John Ainslie's 1790 map showing formal pleasure or possibly kitchen gardens on the opposite side of the Lugton Water to the castle]]
Eglinton was the most notable post-Adam Georgian castle in Ayrshire.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;Sanderson, Maragaret H. B. (1993), ''Robert Adam in Ayrshire''. Ayr Arch Nat Hist Soc. Monograph No. 11. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many items of interest, the castle contained a chair built from the oak timbers of [[Alloway]] kirk and the back of the chair was inlaid with a brass plaque which bore the whole of Burns' poem ''Tam o' Shanter''.&lt;ref name ="Alloway"&gt;Aikman, J. &amp; Gordon, W. (1839) An Account of the Tournament at Eglinton. Pub. Hugh Paton, Carver &amp; Gilder. Edinburgh. M.DCCC.XXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt; This was sold at an auction in 1925.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"&gt;Dowells Ltd. ''Catalogue of the Superior Furnishings, French Furniture, etc.'' Tuesday, 1 December 1925, and four following days.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous Eglington castle (sic) was described circa 1563–1566 as a ''fare castell, but noo strength againsts any power.''&lt;ref name="Arch Ayr Wigton"&gt;''Military Report on the Districts of Carrick, Kyle &amp; Cunningham.'' Archaeological &amp; Historical Collections relating to Ayr &amp; Wigton. 1884. Vol. IV. Pub. Ayr &amp; Wigton Arch Assoc. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; An escape tunnel is said to run from the old castle to the area of the rockery on the castle lawns. The appearance of the old waterfall may have inspired this story as it looks like a sealed doorway.&lt;ref name="Barr"&gt;Barr, Allison (2008), Five Roads / Corsehillhead resident.&lt;/ref&gt; The total acreage of the Earl of Eglinton's holdings was 34,716 Scots Acres (1 Scots acre = 1.5 English Acres) in 1788.&lt;ref name="NAS"&gt;National Archives of Scotland. RHP35796/1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This included Little Cumbrae, and lands at Southannan and Eaglesham (Polnoon).

The original castle of Eglinton may have been near Kidsneuk, Bogside (NS 309 409) where a substantial earth mound or motte stands and excavated pottery was found tentatively dating the site to the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Anne Turner and Stevenson, Sylvia (1980), Historic Irvine the archaeological implications of development. Scottish Burgh Survey. Dept. Archaeology, Univ Glasgow. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montgomerys' first holdings were the Barony of [[Eaglesham]] and its [[Polnoon Castle|Castle of Polnoon]].
[[File:Scotia Depicta - Eglinton Castle -Plate-.jpg|300px|thumb|Etching of Eglinton Castle by [[James Fittler]] in Scotia Depicta published 1804]]
In 1691 the 'Hearth Tax for Ayrshire' records show 25 hearths in use, the highest number for a single dwelling in Ayrshire. It is noted that the earl had not paid the tax. The earl's house in Kilwinning, Easter Chambers or the old abbot's dwelling, had 15 hearths. Thirty-seven other dwellings were listed within the barony of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"&gt;Urquhart, Page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

The stables were built from stones taken from the Easter Chambers of Kilwinning Abbey; being the Abbots lodgings and later that of the Earls of Eglinton. In 1784, over a period of four months, the building was demolished and the stones were taken to Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the new castle was not universally accepted as beneficial; Fullarton records that "The hoary grandeur of the old fortalice lay deeply buried amid the dense groves of immemorial growth which closely invested and obscured it; no innovating projects of improvement, nor change of any kind, had ever been permitted to disturb the sanctity of its seclusion, or to ruffle the feelings even of the most fastiduous worshipper of things as they are, or, more properly perhaps, chance to be".&lt;ref&gt;Fullarton, Page 85&lt;/ref&gt; The castle is said to have had a moat.&lt;ref&gt;Anstruther, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

====Covenating times====
In the 1640s [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] had been sent by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|Montrose]] to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. He plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Neil Montgomery of [[Corsehill|Lainshaw]] negotiated a 4,000 merks penalty for the Eglinton Estates; three tenants having already been killed, with some deer and sheep also taken from the park.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior. Alasdair MacColla and the Civil Wars. Edinburgh: The Saltire Society. {{ISBN|0-85411-059-3}}. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ley tunnels====
Persistent rumours exist of a [[Ley tunnel]] which is said to run from Kilwinning Abbey, under the 'Bean Yaird', below the 'Easter Chaumers' and the 'Leddy firs', and then underneath the Garnock and on to Eglinton Castle. No evidence exists for it, although it may be related to the underground burial vault of the Montgomeries which does exist under the old abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 48.&lt;/ref&gt; A ley or an escape tunnel is also said to run from the castle to exit at the old waterfall near the rockery. It is reported that a tunnel ran from the castle to near the existing Castle Bridge. This tunnel was stone lined and tall enough for a man to walk through. This is likely to have been the main drain from the castle.

===The Pleasure gardens===

[[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]] in 1636 describes the landscape on his journey south from Glasgow as "a barren and poor country", but the earls had clearly enhanced Eglinton for he comments that the land at Irvine was "dainty, pleasant, level, champaign country."&lt;ref&gt;Brereton&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eglinton Temple, Kilwinning, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Temple which the Countess of Eglinton had proposed for the Belvidere Hill.]]

The grounds of the castle were described in one record of the 1840s as follows:

''Its princely gates soon presented themselves and we thought we should easily find our way to Irvine through the park. It was a rich treat to wander in these extensive grounds. We soon made way through a handsome avenue to the gardens. The hot-houses for fruits and flowers are on a magnificent scale, and on reaching the parterre we were delighted with the elegance which pervaded it. A glassy river with a silvery cascade came gliding gently through these fairy regions, as though conscious of the luxuriant paradise which it was watering. Nor was the classic taste wanting, nor horticultural skill, to render this a region of enchantment. Two elegant cast-iron bridges, vases, statues, a sun-dial; these pretty combinations from the world of art could not fail to please the beholder. Leaving these luxurious regions we again wandered among thick woods, and occasionally obtained glimpses of the proud castle, peering over the trees. At length we found our way to a seat beneath some noble weepers of the ash tribe, and here we had a fine view of the castle, towering majestically over the dense foliage.''
[[File:Map of Dunduff castle &amp; roads.jpg|thumb|200px|A map of Ayrshire by William Aiton, 1811]]
''Among our wanderings we passed an enormous quadrangular building, resembling some of our London hospitals. It forms the stables, and it is quite detached, at some distance from the Castle. We mistook our way, owing to the many devious paths, and wandered deeper and deeper into the recesses of this extensive domain. In passing through one long avenue, which was so dark that we were unable to see our steps; myriads of rooks took flight at our approach, and the air was quite blackened with them. At one time, we found ourselves walking alongside of the preserves, at another we were wandering in the deer park, and startling the early slumbers of these pretty creatures. At length we reached a gate, which we fully expected would lead into the high road to Irvine: but, to our great consternation, we found it was the point from which several roads diverged, each, apparently, leading into a thick forest, and it was evident that we had much space yet to traverse ere we could be clear of the extensive grounds of Eglintoun.''&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, pages 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mention in Badderley's 'Through Guide' circa 1890 indicates that the Eglinton Castle grounds were open to the public on Saturdays.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter (1989), Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notable trees====
The 'Fauna, Flora and Geology of the Clyde Area'&lt;ref&gt;Scott Elliot, G. F., Laurie, M. and Murdoch, J. B. (1901). Glasgow: British Association. pages 131–147.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the notable Clyde Area trees at Eglinton in 1901, showing that the estate at the time had one of the foremost collection of significant trees in southern Scotland. Tree removal for sale as timber was one of the first acts of the new owners of the estate when it was sold in the late 1940s, however many had already been removed in 1925 by Neill of Prestwick and Howie of Dunlop, both being timber merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archives, Eglinton Country Park.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significant trees were:- Holly (6' 10'' girth); Sycamore (13' 2'' girth – Deer Park); Field Maple (6' 5'' girth); Horse Chestnut (11' 4'' girth); Gean (girth 11' girth – Bullock Park); Hawthorn (8' 3'' girth); Fraxinus heterophylla (4' 6'' girth – Lady Jane's Cottage); Elm (12' 7' girth – castle); Hornbeam (14' girth – between Castle &amp; Mains); Holly Oak (5' 2'' girth – gardens); Sweet Chestnut (16' girth – Bullock Park); Beech (18' 3'' girth – Old Wood); Cut-leaved Beech (8' 11'' girth); Larch (8' 9'' girth); Cedar of Lebanon (9' 11'' girth – Bullock Park); Scots Pine (11' girth – between Castle and Mains).

===The Eglinton Tournament===
Eglinton is best remembered for the lavish, if ill-fated [[Eglinton Tournament]], a [[medieval]]-style [[tournament]] organised in 1839 by the [[Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton|13th Earl]]. The expense and extent of the preparations became news across Scotland, and the railway line was even opened in advance of its official opening to ferry guests to Eglinton. Although high summer, in typical Scottish style torrential rain washed the proceedings out, despite the participants, in full period dress, gamely attempting to participate in events such as [[jousting]]. Amongst the participants was Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (the future [[Emperor of the French|Emperor]] [[Napoléon III of France|Napoléon III of the French]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ker, Page 318&lt;/ref&gt;

The immense cost of upkeep, the poor condition of the castle and death duties took their toll on the family finances; the castle was abandoned in 1925. De-roofed in 1926, the lead being removed and sold,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt; after a house contents sale in December 1925, and progressively ruinous, the building finally came to an undignified end during the [[Second World War]] when it was seriously damaged during [[British Army|army]] training held there. The army also partly destroyed the iron bridge running to the old walled gardens.

The 1925 house sale by Dowell's Limited, included 1,960 items auctioned, raising £7,004 19s 6d. The auction catalogue provides an interesting insight into the feelings of the family at this sad time, with much of the Montgomerie history sold off, such as the 13th Earl's suit of armour from the tournament, the panel from the door of the murdered 10th Earl's coach and many paintings of the family and the castle, including a portrait of that great beauty, Susanna Kennedy, Countess of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="Dowells2"/&gt; The family moved to [[Skelmorlie Castle]] near [[Largs]] in 1925.

Architects drawings from March 1930 survive for plans to adapt the stable buildings as a residence for the Earl of Eglinton and Winton.&lt;ref name="Eglinton Archive"&gt;Eglinton Archive&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial remains of the castle survived WW2, however the buildings were rationalised in 1973 and only one main tower was kept, together with some outer wall, foundations and parts of the castle wings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Page 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Eglinton Castle is said by one of the gardeners to have had a room which was never opened. In about 1925 a young man from Kilwinning decided to take some of the panelling from a room in the castle as it was all being allowed to rot in the rain anyway, the roof had been removed. He went the castle to take away as much as he could carry, however one of the last pieces he selected left exposed the skeletal hand of a woman. The whole skeleton was later removed by a student doctor, but for fear of prosecution the matter was never reported to the police.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomeries of Eglinton, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eglinton family micro-history==
[[File:Sophia, Countess of Eglinton, Memorial.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Memorial to Lady Sophia Montgomerie, wife of the 14th Earl]]

In 1583 Lady Anne Montgomerie brought her husband, Lord Semple, a dowry of 6000 [[merks]], a considerable sum.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Frances Montgomerie was buried at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in Edinburgh on 11 May 1797. She was the daughter of Archibald, 12th Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref name="DanielA"&gt;Daniel, page 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the coronation of [[Charles I of Great Britain|Charles I]] at Holyrood, the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of bearing the king's spurs.&lt;ref name="DanielB"&gt;Daniel, page 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glasgow University]]'s Eglinton Arts Fellowship was established in 1862 by subscription to commemorate the public services of Archibald William, 13th Earl of Eglinton, Rector of the University 1852–54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf Glasgow University Art's Fellowship.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011075845/http://senate.gla.ac.uk/awards/prizes/prizeterms.pdf |date=2006-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the christening of King James IV the Earl of Eglinton had the honour of carrying the salt.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potato was first heard of in Scotland in 1701; it was not popular at first. In 1733 it is however recorded as being eaten at supper by the Earl of Eglinton.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Huchoun]] ("little Hugh") or Huchown is a poet conjectured to have been writing sometime in the 14th century. Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858–1923), have identified him with Hugh of Eglington, and advanced his authorship of several other significant pieces of verse.

[[Viva Seton Montgomerie]] records that a gipsy put a curse on the Montgomerie family that for three generations the property would not go from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the family crest is unclear, however a link may exist with the popular biblical story of an [[Holofernes]], an Assyrian general of Nebuchadnezzar. The general laid siege to Bethulia, and the city almost surrendered. It was saved by Judith, a beautiful Hebrew widow who entered Holofernes's camp, seduced, and then beheaded Holofernes while he was drunk. She returned to Bethulia with Holofernes head, and the Hebrews subsequently defeated the enemy. Judith is considered as a symbol of liberty, virtue, and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause.

===Eglinton Country Park===

{{main|Eglinton Country Park}}

In the 1970s plans were made to open the extensive grounds (988 acres) around the ruins to the public, and to that end what remained of the structure was made safe by demolishing all but a wing facade and a single tower. Eglinton Country Park is now fully established with free entry and is one of the most popular visitor attractions in Ayrshire.

Eglinton Estate was in disrepair until Robert Clement Wilson purchased the grounds and built a meat canning factory in what was the old stable block. He also restored the grounds to their former splendour at his own expense. The canning factory, which supplied all the major multiples{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, closed following the BSE crises in 1996.

In 1963 [[Ian Anstruther]] wrote an entertaining account of the 1839 tournament entitled ''The Knight and the Umbrella''.

===Estate features===

====Lady Susanna's Cottage====
[[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna Montgomerie]], wife of the 9th Earl of Eglinton, was a renowned society beauty and her husband built for her at Kidsneuk a copy of the [[Hameau de la Reine]] 'cottage orné' that [[Marie Antoinette]] had famously possessed at [[Château de Versailles|Versailles]]. This building, now a golf clubhouse, was thatched until the 1920s and is built of whin with steeply pitched roof sections and many gables.&lt;ref&gt;Close (2012), Page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dower houses====
The tradition was that a dowager countess would move out of the Earl's ancestral seat and move to a lesser dwelling. The [[Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton|Lady Susanna]], wife of the 9th Earl, moved to Kilmaurs House and then to Auchans Castle for instance. Over the centuries Seagate Castle, the Garden or Easter Chambers in Kilwinning,&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"&gt;Fullarton, Page 21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kilmaurs Place|Kilmaurs House]], [[Auchans Castle, Ayrshire|Auchans Castle]] and Redburn House were some of the dower houses used.

====The Rackets Hall====
[[File:Rackets Hall, Eglinton Castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Rackets Hall built by the 13th Earl.]]
Eglinton has a 'Racket Hall' which was built shortly after 1839, the first recorded match being in 1846. The court floor is of large granite slabs, now hidden by the wooden floor. It is the very first covered racquet court, built before the court size was standardised and is now the oldest surviving court in the World, as well as being the oldest indoor sports building in Scotland.&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;Eglinton Country Park archive&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 the earl employed a rackets professional, John Mitchell and Patrick Devitt replaced him. Mitchell owned a pub in Bristol with its own rackets court and this was named the "Eglinton Arms", having been the "Sea Horse" previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ashford, P. K. (1994). Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park&lt;/ref&gt;

====Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet====
A croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between the castle and the Lugton Water, also the old site of the marquee for the tournament banquet. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named 'Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle Croquet', which had small bells on the hoops 'to ring the changes' and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist. It is not known why the earl named it thus.&lt;ref&gt;Eglinton Archive, Eglinton Country Park - falconer&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear}}

====Lady Ha'====
The Montgomerie family are said to have had a pre-reformation chapel in the Weirston - Lady Ha' area dedicated to Saint Issyn. A 'Ladiehall' dwelling still existed in 1691, occupied by John and James Weir. Two other 'Weir' families also lived on the estate.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

==Estate microhistory==

===Lady Egidia===
The "Egidia" was one of the largest, if not the largest wooden vessels ever built in Scotland. She measured 219 feet long, extreme breadth 37 feet, depth 22 feet, registered tonnage 1,235, builders measurements 1,461 tons. Lady Egidia was the daughter of the Earl of Eglinton. The Earl launched her at Ardrossan in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html The Ships List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930053937/http://www.theshipslist.com/accounts/ladyegidia.html |date=2011-09-30 }} Retrieved: 2011-07-03&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Pavilion===
In the early 1900s, the Earl of Eglinton and Winton had a summer residence called the Pavilion at 1 South Crescent Road, Ardrossan. It was built at the beginning of the previous century. In the 1920s the Pavilion, two lodges, stables and walled garden in 3.4 acres of ground were sold to the Roman Catholic Church on 30 January 1924 for £4500. The pavilion was demolished and the present day church and manse built on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintpeterinchains.net/ St Peter in Chains] Retrieved: 2010-11-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===White or Chillingham Cattle===
In 1759 the Earl of Eglinton formed a herd of the ancient breed of White or [[Chillingham Cattle]] at [[Ardrossan]], probably using stock from the [[Cadzow Castle|Cadzow herd]]. The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in this herd were hornless.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garden or Easter Chambers===
After the destruction of the main buildings at [[Kilwinning Abbey]] the Garden or Easter Chambers within the boundary walls of the old abbey, previously the dwelling of the abbot were used by the new owners, the Earls of Eglinton, as a dower house and family dwelling. Lady Mary Montgomerie lived here after the death of her husband in the 17th century and her son may have remained here until he succeeded to the Earldom. The building, which stood to the south of the abbey, was eventually demolished in 1784 and the stones used in building projects at the castle, particularly the stable offices.&lt;ref name="Fullarton, Page 21"/&gt; The 1691 Hearth Tax records show that this substantial building had 15 hearths.&lt;ref name="Urquhart, Page 92"/&gt;

===Daft Will Speirs===
A well known Ayrshire eccentric, Will had been a high spirited youth, punished by being hung over the edge of a bridge over the River Garnock whilst it was in flood, resulting in a form of nervous breakdown which left him as a likeable character, accepted by most and a regular visitor to many a laird or earl's estates. Will died at Corsehillmuir whilst going from Bannoch to Moncur, falling into an old mine shaft whilst trying to rescue a collie dog.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Pages 42 - 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Buffalo Park===
An area below the old Mains Farm was known as the 'Buffalo Park' and this may relate to the 11th Earl having been involved in the British army's subdugation of the [[Cherokee]] Indians in North America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Irish Giant===
John Service relates an Ayrshire legend that an Irish Giant came to mock the warlock Laird of Auchenskeith who lived near [[Dalry, Ayrshire|Dalry]] and the laird chased him across to Eglinton where the giant went to crush him with a great beech tree. The laird pierced him through the arm bones with his sword and the giants hand remained attached to the tree for centuries. It could be seen from a distance of about a mile - from Kilwinning, between Dykehead and the Redburn.&lt;ref&gt;Service, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vagrants and the unemployed===
In 1662 the Earl was given the rights to the manual labour of all the vagrants and temporarily unemployed in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and Galloway. These individuals were taken to [[Montgomerieston]] at the Citadel of Ayr where the Earl had a wool factory. The parishes had to support them whilst there and the Earl only had to provide food and clothing. The rights lasted for 15 years for the vagrants and five years for the unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauchland, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===The National Covenant===
A painting by W. Hole RSA of the 1638 ''Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Churchyard'' features the Earl of Eglinton in the crowd, just prior to his putting his signature to the document.

===Lady Jane's Cottage===
A similar style of cottage existed at Kidsneuk and on the [[Crosbie Castle and the Fullarton estate|Fullarton estate]] in [[Troon]] as a lodge house near the Crosbie Kirk ruins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-115-409-C Heather House, Troon. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; Lilliput Lane has produced a model of Lady Jane's cottage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrsaville.co.uk/ll_Scotland_NV.htm Lilliput Lane - Scottish models. Accessed: 2009-12-11]&lt;/ref&gt; An ash of the species Fraxinus heterophylla of 4' 6'' girth – once grew at Lady Jane's Cottage.

===Cigarette Cards===
The castle and bridge were featured in the series on castles, abbeys and houses by Salmon &amp; Gluckstein Ltd.

===Annick School===
The Earl of Eglinton built a large schoolroom and a house for the teacher at Annick near [[Lands of Doura|Doura]]; he also provided a garden and a playground.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The building ceased to be a school and was used as a cafe for a few years before being adapted to become private accommodation.

===Hare Coursing===
The Ardrossan Hare Coursing Club used to pursue hares on Ardrossan Hill in the 1840s and would then return to Eglinton Castle for refreshments provided by the 13th Earl. This bloodsport finally became illegal in Scotland in 2002. A famous greyhound owned by Lord Eglinton was named 'Heather Jock' after a colourful local character of that name.

===Religion===
In the 1622 persecution the minister of Irvine, Mr David Duckson, was banished, however the earl had him returned to his charge. [[Anne Livingstone|Anne, Countess of Eglinton]], daughter of [[Alexander Livingstone, 1st Earl of Linlithgow]], was very religious, and Eglinton was a safe haven for persecuted ministers. She took an interest in the [[Stewarton|Stewarton Revival]] and invited some of the adherents to meet the earl and the castle.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, Page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century the Montgomerie's of Eglinton were supporters of the Scottish Episcopalian church and the Rev W. S. Wilson travelled to the castle on Sunday afternoons to conduct services. The earl granted a piece of land in Ardrossan with a nominal feu duty to the church and his countess laid the church foundation stone on 30 November 1874; it opened in 1875 and consecrated in 1882 by Bishop Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farms===
Aiton in 1811 records that nearly all the farms on the extensive estates of the 10th Earl of Eglinton were ''elegant, commodious, and substantial.''&lt;ref&gt;Aiton, Page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Montgomerystown===
Ayr citadel, later called the Fort, was constructed by Oliver Cromwell in 1652 with stones taken from the Earl's castle at Ardrossan. It occupied an area of about 12 acres, on a hexagonal ground plan, with bastions at the angles, and enclosed the church of St John the Baptist, converted by Cromwell into an armoury and guard-room. After Cromwell's time it was dismantled and the ground it occupied, together with its buildings, presented to the Earl of Eglinton as compensation for losses sustained during the Great Rebellion. Renamed [[Montgomerieston|Montgomerystown]], it was created a burgh of regality, and became the seat of a considerable trade, including a family owned brewery. In 1726 it was purchased by four merchants from the town, and circa 1870, most of it covered with high quality housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory478.html Gazetteer for Scotland] Retrieved: 2011-02-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early automobile accident===
In 1911, a motor van belonging to the American Steam Laundry Company, Kilmarnock, while proceeding along the country road between Burnhouse and East Middleton on its way towards Lugton, through the steering gear going wrong, was overturned in a ditch. All 4 occupants were thrown out and two of them were seriously injured. Lord Eglinton was passing in his car at the time and had the injured parties taken to Beith in his car. The injured parties were treated for head and body injuries after which they were driven to Lugton and entrained for Kilmarnock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ Early automobile accident] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705134715/http://www.beith.org/2010/06/30/june-1911/ |date=2010-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rozelle===
Archibald Hamilton, a younger son of John Hamilton of Sundrum, married Lady Jane Montgomerie of Coilsfield (his cousin), daughter of the 12th Earl of Eglinton and doting aunt to the 13th Earl of Eglinton. The 13th earl gave the couple a life-rent interest in the mansion house of Rozelle. The estate of Rozelle (formerly Rosel) had been part of the lands of the Barony of Alloway. The future estate was purchased by Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill, his uncle, a former Jamaica merchant who named it after a Jamaican property and also built the mansion house (1760). Archibald Hamilton rebuilt the house in the 1830s to designs by the architect David Bryce and in 1837 he purchased the Rozelle estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; SCRAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003224917/http://195.153.34.9/catalogue/person.aspx?code=NA22601&amp;st=1&amp; |date=2011-10-03 }} Retrieved: 2011-08-21&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency-dependent foraging''' is defined as the tendency of an individual to selectively forage on a certain species or  [[polymorphism (biology)|morph]] based on its relative frequency within a population.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin 1972. Low frequency disadvantage in the exploitation of pollinators by corolla variants in Phlox. Am. Nat., 106: 453-460.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically for [[pollinators]], this refers to the tendency to visit a particular floral morph or plant species based on its frequency within the local plant community, even if [[nectar]] rewards are equivalent amongst different morphs. Pollinators that forage in a frequency-dependent manner will exhibit [[flower constancy]]&lt;ref&gt;Chittka, L, JD Thomson and NM Waser. 1999. Flower constancy, insect psychology, and plant evolution. Naturwissenschaften, 86: 361-377.&lt;/ref&gt; for a certain morph, but the preferred floral type will be dependent on its frequency. Additionally, frequency-dependent foraging differs from density-dependent foraging as the latter considers the absolute number of certain morphs per unit area as a factor influencing pollinator choice.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, M and NM Waser. 1999. Effects of local density on pollination and reproduction in Delphinium nuttallianum and Aconitum columbianum (Ranunculaceae). Am. J. Bot. 86: 871-879.&lt;/ref&gt; Although density of a morph will be related to its frequency, common morphs are still preferred when overall plant densities are high.&lt;ref name="S97a"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997a. Density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection by bumblebees Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Biol J Linn Soc., 60: 401-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Bumblebee 05.JPG|thumb|200px|Bumblebee (probably ''Bombus terrestris'') with collected pollen visible on hindleg.]]
Floral traits, such as [[corolla (flower)|corolla]] color, flower shape, size and scent, appear to have evolved primarily for the purpose of attracting pollinators&lt;ref&gt;Waser, NM. 1983. The adaptive nature of floral traits: ideas and evidence. 242-285. In LA Real (Ed.). Pollination Biology. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and many pollinators have learned to associate these floral signals with the reward that is present there.&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, R. 1985. Learning in honey bees in an ecological and behavioural context. 55-74. In B Holldobler and M Lindauer (Eds.). Experimental Behavioral Ecology. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer.&lt;/ref&gt; As pollinators are essential in the process of pollen transfer (and therefore, reproductive success) of many [[angiosperms]], visitation behavior will impose [[frequency-dependent selection]] on the flower morphs that they visit.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt; If pollinators selectively visit a particular morph, this will cause this morph to increase in frequency, and may ultimately lead to the fixation of this [[phenotype]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, V. 1984. Polymorphism under apostatic and aposematic selection. Heredity, 53: 677-686.&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[directional selection]]. Alternatively, if rare morphs are preferred, this should promote [[phenotypic variation|phenotypic diversity]], known as [[balancing selection|balancing]] or [[stabilizing selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962a. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species, 47-70. In D Nichols (Ed.). Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, B. 1962b. Natural selection in mixed populations of two polymophyic snails. Heredity, 17: 319-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in frequency-dependent selection dates back to the time of Charles Darwin, who predicted that insects should demonstrate floral constancy&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1876. The effects of cross- and self-fertilization in the animal kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; and puzzled over the occurrence of deceptive orchid species.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1888. Fertilisation of orchids: the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects, 2nd ed. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon received little attention until the 1970s when Donald Levin suggested that one of the most important factors determining pollinator visitation behavior is the floral trait's frequency in the population relative to other floral elements.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt; Since this time, attention has focussed on understanding how obligately pollinated, unrewarding species can persist as they offer pollinators no incentive to visit.&lt;ref name="S97b"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997b. Negative frequency-dependent selection by pollinators on artificial flowers without rewards. Evolution, 51: 715-723.&lt;/ref&gt; Much less research has been conducted on frequency-dependent foraging on rewarding species, but experiments using bumblebees have illustrated that frequency likely plays a role in reproductive success of flowering plants.&lt;ref name="S96"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1996. Frequency-dependent selection of pollinators: mechanisms and consequences with regard to behaviour in bumblebees Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). J. Evol. Biol., 9: 571-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bumblebee heuchera.jpg|thumb|200px|Bumblebee with tongue extracted about to visit a ''[[Heuchera]]'' plant for nectar.]]

==Experimental evidence==
Researchers studying frequency-dependent visitation behavior seek to understand if pollinator preference is strong enough to induce fixation of traits or to maintain floral polymorphisms observed in natural populations.&lt;ref name="S2"&gt;Smithson, A. 2001. Pollinator preference, frequency dependence, and floral evolution. 237-258. In LD Chittka and JD Thomson (Eds.). Cognitive ecology of pollination: animal behaviour and floral evolution. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory experiments use artificial flowers to test how pollinator preference varies with frequency. Typical experiments use two or more colored discs or artificial flowers (to represent flower morphs) that are arranged in various patterns and frequencies.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; It is predicted that if pollinators do not exhibit frequency-dependent foraging, morph preference will not correlate with the relative frequency of that morph. Instead, this preference may depend on some frequency-independent quality, such as an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]] attraction toward a certain color.&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;Lunau, K and EJ Maier. 1995. Innate colour preferences of flower visitors. J. Comp. Physiol. A., 177: 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Western honey bee.jpg|thumb|200px|Honeybee on a blue flower.]]

===Bumblebees===

====Laboratory experiments====
Frequency-dependent foraging has most often been observed and studied in [[bumblebees]] (''Bombus'') as they tend to forage for long periods of time without becoming satiated, making them ideal experimental subjects.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Simple experiments using two morphs have revealed that after visiting many flowers (more than 100) bumblebees tend to prefer to visit the common morph when rewards associated with both morphs are equal.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; This pattern is consistent for a variety of nectar concentrations.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; An exception to this pattern occurs when one morph contains variable amounts of nectar. This reward variability tends to cause the strength of the observed frequency dependence to decrease. However, when both rare and common morphs are unrewarding, bumblebees tend to reverse their behavioral pattern and demonstrate rare morph preference.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt;
[[Image:Dawn Endico Bee.jpg|thumb|200px|Corolla morphs may not be as distinctly colored in natural populations as they are in laboratory experiments.]]
Even though these experiments demonstrate that bumblebees forage in a frequency-dependent manner, the strength of this response can be asymmetric for different colors. For example, experiments using blue and yellow discs to represent corolla colors demonstrated that, although bumblebees preferentially foraged on the most common morph when rewards were present, the threshold for switching to the common morph was different for both colors.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Bumblebees exhibit an innate preference for blue corollas, as this color is very conspicuous to bees against green-colored backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt; It was observed that in order for bees to switch from blue flowers to yellow, the yellow-to-blue ratio had to be much higher than the ratio of blue-to-yellow flowers that were required for the opposite switch.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; In other words, bees would forage on blue flowers until morphs of this colour reached relatively lower frequencies compared to yellow flowers. However, this preference for blue was not as pronounced when both morphs contained high levels of nectar. Therefore, frequency-dependent preferences must be considered along-with frequency-independent preferences to truly understand the visitation behavior of pollinators.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Additionally, when density of equally rewarding color morphs were manipulated, bumblebees still preferred to forage on the common morphs, even at high densities.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;

====Field experiments====
Experiments conducted in the field have yielded mixed results. Some studies have demonstrated that bumblebees prefer the relatively common corolla color,&lt;ref&gt;Epperson, BK and MT Clegg. 1987. Frequency-dependent variation for outcrossing rate among flower-color morphs of Ipomoea purpurea. Evolution, 41: 1302-1311.&lt;/ref&gt; but in other studies there did not appear to be any observable pattern of bee visitation behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, KN. 1996. Pollinator behavior and postpollination reproductive success in alternative floral phenotypes of Clarkia gracilis (Onagraceae). Int J Plant Sci., 157: 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy between laboratory and field studies may be due to the fact that laboratory studies use highly contrasting corolla colors and it is likely that color polymorphisms in the wild are not this distinct, making frequency-dependence weaker in natural settings.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Additionally, in natural populations multiple traits that are attractive to pollinators may be genetically correlated with one another ([[pleiotropy]]&lt;ref&gt;Waser, NM and MV Price. 1981. Pollinator choice and stabolizing selection for flower color in Delphinium nelsonii. Evolution, 35: 376-390.&lt;/ref&gt;), so looking at pollinator response to a single trait in isolation may not be appropriate under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Also, frequency-dependent foraging is not apparent until many flowers have been visited (more than 100). Therefore, considering morph frequency within localized patches of flowers in natural settings may not be sufficient. Instead, morph frequency may need to be calculated over large spatial ranges to determine the extent to which pollinators are foraging in a frequency-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

[[Image:Monarch Butterfly Pink Zinnia 1800px.jpg|thumb|150px|A monarch butterfly drinking nectar from a Zinnia flower.]]

===Other insects===
Although studies of frequency-dependent foraging in other pollinator groups seems to be rare, at least one study has demonstrated that [[butterflies]] prefer to visit common corolla shapes. This observation was based on reduced seed set of rare morphs in field studies.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==

===Positive frequency-dependent foraging===
Foraging on common morphs will be beneficial if these common morphs are associated with a higher reward than rare morphs. However, if rare morphs have similar nectar quality, skipping over these equally rewarding flowers appears to be inconsistent with [[optimal foraging theory]].&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, RH and ER Pianka. 1966. On the optimal use of a patchy environment. Am. Nat., 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Several hypotheses have been proposed to suggest how this visitation pattern is maintained.

====Search image hypothesis====
It has been observed that [[predation|predators]] tend to select the most common morph in a population or species.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, JA. 1988. Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 319: 485-503.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[prey detection|search image hypothesis]]'' proposes that an individual's [[sensory system]] becomes better able to detect a specific [[predation|prey]] phenotype after recent experience with that same phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool., 13: 265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that plant-pollinator interactions differ from predator-prey relationships, as it is beneficial to both the plant and animal for the pollinator to locate the plant. However, it has been suggested that [[Flower constancy#Memory limitation as an explanation for flower constancy|cognitive constraints]] on [[short-term memory]] capabilities may limit pollinators from identifying and handling more than one floral type at a time,&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, R and LA Real. 1993. Learning constraints and floral choice behaviour in bumble bees. Anim. Behav., 46: 637-644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chittka, L and JD Thomson. 1997. Sensori-moyor learning and its relevance for task specialization in bumble bees. Behav Ecol Sociobiol., 41: 385-398.&lt;/ref&gt; making plant-pollinator relationships theoretically similar to predator-prey relationships in regards to the ability to identify food sources.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Although plant traits that have evolved to attract pollinators are not [[crypsis|cryptic]], corolla colors can be more or less conspicuous with the background&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, R and A Shmida. 1993. The ecology of flower colours and the natural colour vision of insect pollinators. The Israeli flora as a case study. Biol. Rev., 68: 81-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and pollinators that are more efficient at detecting a particular morph will minimize their [[optimal foraging theory|search time]]. Studies have demonstrated that the degree of frequency-dependence increases with the number of flowers visited, which suggests this is a learned response that develops gradually.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

[[Image:Wildflowers in SNRA 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Flower morphs may differ in their relative conspicuousness against the background.]]

====Search rate hypotheses====
Alternative mechanisms, such as the ''optimal search rate hypothesis''&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, RP and JER Staddon. 1983. Searching for cryptic prey: the effect of search rate. Am. Nat., 121: 172-186.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''stare duration hypothesis''&lt;ref&gt;Endler, JA. 1991. Interactions between predators and prey, 169-196. In JR Krebs and NB Davies (Eds.). Behavioural Ecology, and Evolutionary Approach. 3rd edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; both propose that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey. It has been demonstrated that when both density and frequency were manipulated, the strength of the preference for the common morph does not weaken with increased overall density, even when colors that are not innately preferred are the common morph.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; These results are consistent with both of these search time hypotheses, as bees tend to decrease their speed travelling between flowers when density is high, and therefore, may be more efficient at recognizing less conspicuous yellow flowers at lower speeds.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;

====Switching attention hypothesis====
Studies on other organisms have provided evidence that foraging can occur in long runs, but this preference develops after only visiting a few morphs.&lt;ref name="dawk"&gt;Dawkins, M. 1971. Shifts of 'attention' in chicks during feeding. Anim. Behav., 19: 575-582.&lt;/ref&gt; When presented with two equally rewarding morphs, it has been demonstrated that an organism may select to exclusively forage on one morph for a variable amount of time, and then switch to the alternative morph and repetitively forage on this morph.&lt;ref name="dawk" /&gt; Under this ''switching attention hypothesis'', selectively foraging on the common morph can occur without invoking a learned response, as the probability of visiting a particular morph first increases as the relative frequency of that morph increases. In other words, it is likely pollinators will select common morphs first due to chance since they are more common and will continue to forage on these morphs during foraging bouts.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

===Negative frequency-dependent foraging===
Pollinators appear to forage in a negative frequency-dependent manner when flowers do not provide nectar rewards, likely to avoid unrewarding morphs. This behaviour results in [[disassortative mating]] between different morph types.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; However, it seems likely that deceptive species would have low reproductive success as pollinators would learn to avoid areas where only unrewarding species are present.&lt;ref&gt;Gumbert, A and J Kunze. 2001. Colour similarity to rewarding model plants affects pollination in a food deceptive orchid, Orchis boryi. Biol J Linn Soc., 72: 419-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dactylorhiza sambucina pink NRM.jpg|thumb|250px|A deceptive orchid, ''Dactylorhiza sambucina'', does not provide a nectar reward for its pollinaors.]]

====Naive pollinators====
One hypothesis as to how unrewarding species can persist in the population is that they only receive visits from naive pollinators.&lt;ref name="nil"&gt;Nilsson, LA. 1980. The pollination ecology of Dactylorhiza sambucina (Orchidaceae). Botaniska Notiser, 133: 367-385.&lt;/ref&gt; As pollinators do not appear to be able to distinguish between rewarding and unrewarding flowers prior to landing,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, JD. 1986. Pollen transport and deposition by bumble bees in Erythronium – Influences of floral nectar and bee grooming. J. Ecology, 74: 329-341.&lt;/ref&gt; they need to make test visits so they can learn to avoid particular morph types.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. 1975. Bee flowers: a hypothesis on flower variety and blooming times. Evolution, 29: 325-334.&lt;/ref&gt; When a preferred rewarding morph type becomes locally depleted, pollinators may be initially attracted to unrewarding morphs if these morphs exploit signals that are innately attractive&lt;ref name="nil" /&gt; or closely [[floral mimicry|mimic]] rewarding species.&lt;ref&gt;Dafni, A. 1984. Mimicry and deception in pollination. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics. 15: 259-278.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under this hypothesis, the pollinator should learn to associate this morph with no reward and consequently avoid it on future foraging bouts.

====Negative frequency-dependent selection====
A different hypothesis does not assume that only naive pollinators visit [[floral mimicry|deceptive species]]. Instead, the negative reinforcement associated with visiting an unrewarding flower is assumed to be stored in short-term memory.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; This causes the pollinator to go to a different morph type on its next visit. In other words, if deceptive species were to occur at a low enough frequency that pollinators do not encounter them very often, it is unlikely they will have the opportunity to relocate this information to their [[long-term memory]]. Studies have shown that the number of flowers of an unrewarding morph type that are sampled depends on the frequency of those morphs within a population.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; For example, many species of obligately animal-pollinated, deceptive orchids that co-occur with rewarding flowers are only reproductively successful when they occur at low frequencies.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; It is worth mentioning that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive in that morph populations that are visited by naive pollinators are also likely to be found at low frequencies relative to rewarding morphs.

==Implications==
Regardless of the mechanism, pollinators foraging in a frequency-dependent manner on common morphs will lead to [[assortative mating]] between similar phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ML. 1987. Reproductive biology of petal colour variants in wild populations of Raphanus saticus: I. Pollinator response to color morphs. Am. J. Bot., 74: 178-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, rare morphs may be at a disadvantage if reproductive success is correlated with number of pollinator visits, and this may lead to higher rates of [[self-pollination|selfing]] and ultimately [[inbreeding depression]], in [[Self-incompatibility#Self-compatibility|self-compatible]] plants.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; The potential for a decrease in [[genetic diversity]] due to assortative mating can have negative implications.

[[Image:Lady Orchid and Lady-Monkey Orchid hybrid - geograph.org.uk - 1314589.jpg|thumb|250px|Lady orchid (left) and naturally occurring lady/monkey hybrid (right).]]

===Climate change===
In response to climate change, plants may begin to flower earlier in the season due to regional [[aridification]] and a rise in mean global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2007. Climate change 2007: the physical science basis. Contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the IPCC. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, reproductive success of flowering plants that are obligately pollinated ultimately depends on a corresponding change in the timing of pollinator visitors.&lt;ref name="for"&gt;Forrest, J and JD Thomson. 2008. Pollinator experience, neophobia and the evolution of flowering time. Proc. R. Soc. B, 276: 935-943.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest bloomers of any species will be rare since the majority of conspecific plants have not yet flowered. Since many pollinators prefer to forage on common phenotypes, the flowers that bloom earliest in the season may be skipped.&lt;ref name="for" /&gt; This may lead to a constraint on plant flowering evolution and the inability of flowering plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt;

===Hybrid zones===
Additionally, positive frequency-dependent foraging may help maintain [[hybrid zone]]s between closely related species.&lt;ref name="tas"&gt;Tastard, E, C Andalo, M Giurfa, M Burrus and C Thebaud. 2008. Flower colour variation across a hybrid zone in Antirrhinum as perceived by bumblebee pollinators. Arthropod-Plant Interactions, 2: 237-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid zones generally contain a wide variety of phenotypes, including novel or extremely rare morphs. Since certain pollinators tend to prefer common morphs, there is a low probability that they will visit rare morphs in the hybrid zone, thus keeping [[gene flow]] between species relatively low.&lt;ref name="tas" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16697">'''Glycosylation''' (see also [[chemical glycosylation]]) is the reaction in which a [[carbohydrate]], i.e. a [[glycosyl donor]], is attached to a hydroxyl or other functional group of another molecule (a [[glycosyl acceptor]]). In biology, '''glycosylation''' mainly refers in particular to the enzymatic process that attaches [[glycans]] to [[glycoprotein|protein]]s, or other [[glycoside|organic molecules]]. This enzymatic process produces one of the fundamental [[biopolymers]] found in cells (along with [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[proteins]]). Glycosylation is a form of co-translational and [[post-translational modification]]. Glycans serve a variety of structural and functional roles in membrane and secreted proteins.&lt;ref name="varki"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1908/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of proteins synthesized in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]] undergo glycosylation. It is an [[enzyme]]-directed site-specific process, as opposed to the non-enzymatic chemical reaction of [[glycation]]. Glycosylation is also present in the [[cytoplasm]] and nucleus as the ''O''-GlcNAc modification. Aglycosylation is a feature of engineered antibodies to bypass glycosylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung ST, Kang TH, Kelton W, Georgiou G | title = Bypassing glycosylation: engineering aglycosylated full-length IgG antibodies for human therapy | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 858–67 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21420850 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2011.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263802548_Transgenic_plants_of_Nicotiana_tabacum_L._express_aglycosylated_monoclonal_antibody_with_antitumor_activity|title=Transgenic plants of ''Nicotiana tabacum'' L. express aglycosylated monoclonal antibody with antitumor activity|year=2013|journal=Biotecnologia Aplicada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five classes of glycans are produced:
* ''N''-linked glycans attached to a [[nitrogen]] of [[asparagine]] or [[arginine]] [[Side chain|side-chains]]. [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-linked glycosylation]] requires participation of a special lipid called dolichol phosphate. 
* ''O''-linked glycans attached to the [[hydroxyl]] [[oxygen]] of [[serine]], [[threonine]], [[tyrosine]], [[hydroxylysine]], or [[hydroxyproline]] side-chains, or to oxygens on lipids such as [[ceramide]]
* phosphoglycans linked through the phosphate of a phosphoserine;
*''C''-linked glycans, a rare form of glycosylation where a sugar is added to a carbon on a [[tryptophan]] side-chain
* [[glypiation]], which is the addition of a GPI anchor that links proteins to lipids through glycan linkages.

== Purpose ==
Glycosylation is the process by which a [[carbohydrate]] is [[covalent]]ly attached to a target [[macromolecule]], typically [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s.  This modification serves various functions.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press, USA | isbn = 978-0-19-928278-4 | vauthors = Drickamer K, Taylor ME | title = Introduction to Glycobiology | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;  In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain [[oligosaccharide]]s linked at the [[amide]] [[nitrogen]] of certain [[asparagine]] residues. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, ''N''-linked glycans mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalziel M, Crispin M, Scanlan CN, Zitzmann N, Dwek RA | title = Emerging principles for the therapeutic exploitation of glycosylation | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 1235681 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24385630 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-to-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the [[immune system]]) via sugar-binding proteins called [[lectins]], which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties.&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt; Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as [[monoclonal antibodies]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Glycosylation also underpins the [[ABO blood group]] system. It is the presence or absence of [[glycosyltransferase]]s which dictates which blood group [[antigen]]s are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to [[zoonotic]] transmission of viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Harvey DJ, Bitto D, Bonomelli C, Edgeworth M, Scrivens JH, Huiskonen JT, Bowden TA | title = Structural plasticity of the Semliki Forest virus glycome upon interspecies transmission | language = EN | journal = Journal of Proteome Research | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 1702–12 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24467287 | pmc = 4428802 | doi = 10.1021/pr401162k | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr401162k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, glycosylation is often used by viruses to shield the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the [[human immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispin M, Doores KJ | title = Targeting host-derived glycans on enveloped viruses for antibody-based vaccine design | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 11 | pages = 63–9 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25747313 | pmc = 4827424 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.02.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625715000267 | series = Viral pathogenesis • Preventive and therapeutic vaccines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, glycosylation needs to be understood by the likely evolutionary selection pressures that have shaped it. In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as [[cell trafficking]]). However, it is more likely that diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. ''[[Helicobacter]]'' attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.

==Glycoprotein diversity==

Glycosylation increases diversity in the [[proteome]], because almost every aspect of glycosylation can be modified, including:
*[[Glycosidic bond]]—the site of glycan linkage
*Glycan composition—the types of sugars that are linked to a given protein
*Glycan structure—can be unbranched or branched chains of sugars
*Glycan length—can be short- or long-chain oligosaccharides

== Mechanisms ==

There are various mechanisms for glycosylation, although most share several common features:&lt;ref name="varki"/&gt;
*Glycosylation, unlike [[glycation]], is an enzymatic process. Indeed, glycosylation is thought to be the most complex [[Posttranslational modification|post-translational modification]], because of the large number of enzymatic steps involved.&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Roberts and Co. Publishers, Englewood, CO | isbn = 0974707732 | last = Walsh | first = Christopher |  name-list-format = vanc |title = Posttranslational Modification of Proteins: Expanding Nature's Inventory | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The donor molecule is often an activated [[nucleotide sugar]].
*The process is non-templated (unlike DNA [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] or protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]]); instead, the cell relies on segregating enzymes into different cellular compartments (e.g., [[endoplasmic reticulum]], cisternae in [[Golgi apparatus]]). Therefore, glycosylation is a site-specific modification.

== Types ==

=== ''N''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|N-linked glycosylation}}
''N''-linked glycosylation is a very prevalent form of glycosylation and is important for the folding of many eukaryotic glycoproteins and for cell&amp;ndash;cell and cell&amp;ndash;[[extracellular matrix]] attachment. The ''N''-linked glycosylation process occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and widely in [[archaea]], but very rarely in [[bacteria]].  In addition to their function in protein folding and cellular attachment, the ''N''-linked glycans of a protein can modulate a protein's function, in some cases acting as an on/off switch.&lt;ref name = "immune_glycan"/&gt;

=== ''O''-linked glycosylation ===
{{main article|O-linked glycosylation}}
''O''-linked glycosylation is a form of glycosylation that occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the [[Golgi apparatus]],&lt;ref name="Flynne2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=William G. |last=Flynne | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEBBP5IYqJQC&amp;pg=PA45|access-date=13 November 2010|year=2008|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-60456-067-1|pages=45ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also occurs in [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]].

=== Phosphoserine glycosylation ===
[[Xylose]], [[fucose]], [[mannose]], and [[GlcNAc]] [[phosphoserine]] [[glycan]]s have been reported in the literature.  Fucose and GlcNAc have been found only in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'', mannose in ''[[Leishmania mexicana]]'', and xylose in ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.  Mannose has recently been reported in a vertebrate, the mouse, ''Mus musculus'', on the cell-surface laminin receptor alpha dystroglycan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. It has been suggested this rare finding may be linked to the fact that alpha dystroglycan is highly conserved from lower vertebrates to mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida-Moriguchi T, Yu L, Stalnaker SH, Davis S, Kunz S, Madson M, Oldstone MB, Schachter H, Wells L, Campbell KP | title = O-mannosyl phosphorylation of alpha-dystroglycan is required for laminin binding | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5961 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20044576 | pmc = 2978000 | doi = 10.1126/science.1180512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''C''-mannosylation ===
A [[mannose]] sugar is added to the first [[tryptophan]] residue in the sequence W&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;X&amp;ndash;W (W indicates tryptophan; X is any amino acid).  [[Thrombospondins]] are one of the most commonly ''C''-modified proteins, although this form of glycosylation appears elsewhere as well. ''C''-mannosylation is unusual because the sugar is linked to a [[carbon]] rather than a reactive atom such as [[nitrogen]] or [[oxygen]]. Recently,{{when|date=January 2018}} the first crystal structure of a protein containing this type of glycosylation has been determined—that of human complement component 8, {{PDB|3OJY}}.

=== Formation of GPI anchors (glypiation) ===
(Main Article:[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glypiation|Glypiation]])
A special form of glycosylation is the formation of a [[GPI anchor]]. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also [[prenylation]].)

=== Chemical glycosylation ===
Glycosylation can also be effected using the tools of [[synthetic organic chemistry]].  Unlike the biochemical processes, synthetic glycochemistry relies heavily on protecting groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crich D | title = Mechanism of a chemical glycosylation reaction | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 1144–53 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20496888 | doi = 10.1021/ar100035r }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. the 4,6-O-benzylidene) in order to achieve desired regioselectivity. The other challenge of chemical glycosylation is the stereoselectivity that each glycosidic linkage has two stereo-outcomes, alpha-/beta or cis-/trans. Generally, the alpha- or cis- glycoside is more challenging to synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nigudkar SS, Demchenko AV | title = cis glycosylation as the driving force of progress in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry | journal = Chemical Science | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 2687–2704 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26078847 | pmc = 4465199 | doi = 10.1039/c5sc00280j | url = http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C5SC00280J }}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods have been developed based on solvent participation or the formation of bicyclic sulfonium ions as chiral-auxiliary groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang T, Gu Y, Huang W, Boons GJ | title = Mechanism of Glycosylation of Anomeric Sulfonium Ions | language = EN | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 138 | issue = 9 | pages = 3002–11 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26878147 | pmc = 5078750 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.5b08436 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5b08436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Clinical==
Over 40 [[congenital disorder of glycosylation|disorders of glycosylation]] have been reported in humans.&lt;ref name=Jaeken2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeken J | title = Congenital disorders of glycosylation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | issue =  | pages = 1737–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622397 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00044-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be divided into four groups: disorders of protein [[N-linked glycosylation|''N''-glycosylation]], disorders of protein ''O''-glycosylation, disorders of lipid glycosylation and disorders of other glycosylation pathways and of multiple glycosylation pathways. No effective treatment is known for any of these disorders. 80% of these affect the nervous system.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Effects on therapeutic efficacy ===
It has been reported that mammalian glycosylation can improve the therapeutic efficacy of [[biotherapeutic]]s. For example, therapeutic efficacy of recombinant [[Interferon gamma|human interferon gamma]], expressed in [[HEK 293 cells|HEK&amp;nbsp;293]] platform, was improved against drug-resistant [[ovarian cancer]] cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razaghi A, Villacrés C, Jung V, Mashkour N, Butler M, Owens L, Heimann K | title = Improved therapeutic efficacy of mammalian expressed-recombinant interferon gamma against ovarian cancer cells | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 359 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–29 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28803068 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2017.08.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Grasshopper''' is a [[visual programming language]] and environment developed by David Rutten at Robert McNeel &amp; Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Tedeschi | first = Arturo | title = Intervista a David Rutten | newspaper = MixExperience Tools1 | location =  Naples, Italy | pages = 28–29 | language = Italian, English | publisher = MixExperience | date = January 2011 | url = http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1qies/mixexperiencetoolsnu/resources/28.htm | accessdate = February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that runs within the [[Rhinoceros 3D]] [[computer-aided design|computer-aided design (CAD)]] application. Programs are created by dragging components onto a canvas.  The outputs to these components are then connected to the inputs of subsequent components.

Grasshopper is primarily used to build generative algorithms, such as for [[generative art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Loomis  | first = Mark  | authorlink = | title = About Generative Design platforms by Mark Loomis   | publisher = Designplaygrounds | date = Dec 23, 2010  | url = http://designplaygrounds.com/deviants/about-generative-design-platforms-by-mark-loomis/ | format = Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Loomis | first = Mark | authorlink = | title = Rhino Grasshopper VS Generative Components  | publisher = Designplaygrounds  | date = Jan 10, 2011  | url = http://designplaygrounds.com/deviants/rhino-grasshopper-vs-generative-components/  | format = Blog  | accessdate = Feb 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Grasshopper's components create 3D geometry.&lt;ref group=ex name=ex01&gt;{{cite book |title=A sample of grasshopper generated forms  |last=Akos  |first=Gil  |last2=Parsons  |first2=Ronnie | publisher = StudioMode Beta   | url = http://studiomode.nu/  | format = Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs may also contain other types of algorithms including numeric, textual,&lt;ref group=ex name=ex02&gt;A list of functions to link to datastreams containing numbers and text information {{Cite web  | last = Fraguada  | first = Luis | authorlink = | title =  LaN co-director  | url = http://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ghowl  }}&lt;/ref&gt; audio-visual&lt;ref group=ex name=ex03&gt;{{Cite conference  | first = Kudless | last = Andrew  | booktitle = Biodynamic Structures Workshop |title=Biodigital Architecture Master |pages =[https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/biodynamicstructures/ photos] |publisher = AA San Francisco Visiting School  | date = July 2011  | location = California College of the Arts, San Francisco  | url = http://sanfrancisco.aaschool.ac.uk/  | accessdate = Feb 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and haptic applications.&lt;ref group=ex name=ex04&gt;{{Citation  | last = Payne  | first=Andrew |title=Using a WII Nunchuck to Control Grasshopper |url = http://www.liftarchitects.com/journal/2009/9/8/using-a-wii-nunchuck-to-control-grasshopper.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User Interface==
[[File:Grasshopper FindGUI.png|thumb|200px|The Find Dialog displaying metaball outlines around search results]]
Grasshopper features an advanced [[user interface]]. The main window consist mainly of the component 'palettes' and the 'canvas'. Since Grasshopper is a plug-in to [[Rhinoceros 3D]], the layout of the main window is kept minimal.

GUI elements include:
*'''[[Palette window|Component Palettes]]''' - All installed commands appear within component palettes, with each group of commands in one tab. Additional component palettes may be installed with various grasshopper add-ons. Commands are dragged out of these palettes onto the canvas.
*'''[[Node (computer science)|Node Based Editor]]''' - Programs are edited in grasshopper using a node-based interface. Components are dragged out of palettes, and placed onto the canvas. Each component node represents a certain function, with input and output pins. Pins can be interconnected to form programs.
*'''[[Zooming User Interface]]''' - Some objects drawn on the canvas adjust their display based on the zoom-level. This results in a less detailed view when zoomed out and additional information when zoomed in.
*'''[[Search algorithm|Find Dialog]]''' - The search function lists both exact and similar matches. The Find dialog provides both textual and spatial feedback regarding the search hits. Objects are highlighted on the canvas by a Metaball outline and arrows on the dialog point towards the location of the search results.
*'''[[color picker|Color Picker]]''' - The in-built color picker supports and displays color values and transparency values.
*'''Command Prediction''' - A [[Markov chain]] database is maintained of all the add actions of the user. This enables Grasshopper to predict with a reasonable level of accuracy which command(s) will be called upon next.
*'''[[Multiple document interface|Multi Document Interface]]''' - The multiple document interface menu contains small preview images of the documents currently open
*'''Recently Used Documents''' - The MRU menu maintains not just a large collection of previously used documents, but also checks each file for availability. Files which are no longer present on the system are shown greyed out. In addition, the history of the MRU is categorized into distinct period such as "Just Now", "Today", "Thursday" and "Last Week".

==Node based editor==
The main interface for algorithm design in Grasshopper is the node-based editor. Data is passed from component to component via connecting wires which always connect an output grip with an input grip. Data can either be defined locally as a constant, or it can be imported from the Rhino document or a file on the computer. Data is always stored in parameters, which can either be free-floating or attached to a component as input and outputs objects.

[[File:Grasshopper NodeBasedSubtraction.png]]

In the image above we see three free-floating parameters that are hooked up to a subtraction component. The two yellow boxes on the left both define a set of numeric constants. The top-most panel contains four integers (6, 7, 8 and 12) while the bottom-most panel contains only a single value. These floating parameters supply the subtraction component with input data, which results in four output values (6-5=1, 7-5=2, 8-5=3 and 12-5=7). The same result can be achieved using textual expressions and an evaluator component. In this fashion Grasshopper allows users to combine both visual and textual programming within the same environment.

[[File:Moss flowers.jpg|thumb|right|Moss plants with gynoecia, clusters of archegonia at the apex of each shoot.]]
'''Gynoecium''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:γυνή#Ancient Greek|γυνή]]}}, ''gyne'', meaning ''woman'', and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:οἶκος#Ancient Greek|οἶκος]]}}, ''oikos'', meaning ''house'') is most commonly used as a collective term for the parts of a [[flower]] that produce [[ovule]]s and ultimately develop into the [[fruit]] and [[seed]]s. The gynoecium is the innermost [[whorl (botany)|whorl]] of a flower, it consists of (one or more) '''[[#Pistils|pistils]]''' and is typically surrounded by the [[pollen]]-producing [[Plant reproductive morphology|reproductive organs]], the [[stamen]]s, collectively called the [[androecium]]. The gynoecium is often referred to as the "[[female]]" portion of the flower, although rather than directly producing female [[gamete]]s (i.e. [[egg cell]]s), the gynoecium produces [[megaspore]]s, each of which develops into a female [[gametophyte]] which then produces egg cells.

The term gynoecium is also used by botanists to refer to a cluster of [[archegonia]] and any associated modified leaves or stems present on a [[gametophyte]] shoot in [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] and [[hornwort]]s. The corresponding terms for the male parts of those plants are clusters of [[antheridium|antheridia]] within the androecium.

Flowers that bear a gynoecium but no stamens are called '''pistillate''' or '''carpellate'''. Flowers lacking a gynoecium are called [[stamen|staminate]].

The gynoecium is often referred to as [[female]] because it gives rise to female (egg-producing) gametophytes, however, strictly speaking [[sporophyte]]s do not have a sex, only gametophytes do.&lt;ref name=Judd07/&gt;

Gynoecium development and arrangement is important in systematic research and identification of angiosperms, but can be the most challenging of the floral parts to interpret.&lt;ref name=Satt74/&gt;

==Pistils==
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|right|thumb|350px|A monocarpous (single carpel) gynoecium in context. The gynoecium (whether composed of a single carpel or multiple "fused" carpels) is typically made up of an [[ovary (plant)|ovary]], style, and [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] as in the center of the flower.]]
The gynoecium may consist of one or more separate pistils. A pistil typically consists of an expanded basal portion called the [[ovary (botany)|ovary]], an elongated section called a '''style''' and an apical structure that receives pollen called a [[stigma (botany)|stigma]].
*The ovary (from Latin ''ovum'' meaning egg), is the enlarged basal portion which contains '''placentas''', ridges of tissue bearing one or more [[ovules]] (integumented [[megasporangium|megasporangia]]). The placentas and/or ovule(s) may be born on the gynoecial appendages or less frequently on the floral apex.&lt;ref name=Macd73/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt73/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Satt82/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=130}} The chamber in which the ovules develop is called a '''[[locule]]''' (or sometimes cell).
*The style (from Ancient Greek [[Wikt:στῦλος#Ancient Greek|''στῦλος'']], ''stylos'' meaning a pillar), is a pillar-like stalk through which pollen tubes grow to reach the ovary. Some flowers such as ''[[Tulipa]]'' do not have a distinct style, and the stigma sits directly on the ovary. The style is a hollow tube in some plants such as [[Lilium|lilies]], or has transmitting tissue through which the pollen tubes grow.&lt;ref name=Esau&gt;{{Cite book |last=Esau |first=K. |year=1965 |title=Plant Anatomy |edition=2nd |publication-place=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |oclc=263092258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The stigma (from Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[wikt:στίγμα#Ancient Greek|στίγμα]]}}, ''stigma'' meaning mark, or puncture), is usually found at the tip of the style, the portion of the carpel(s) that receives [[pollen]] (male [[gametophyte]]s). It is commonly sticky or feathery to capture pollen.

The word "pistil" comes from [[Latin]] ''pistillum'' meaning [[pestle]]. A sterile pistil in a male flower is referred to as a '''pistillode'''.

== Carpels ==
&lt;!--[[Carpel]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
The pistils of a flower are considered to be composed of '''carpels'''.{{Refn|carpel (also carpophyl) —Gr. καρπός (karpós, “fruit”) + Gr. φύλλον (phúllon, “leaf”) [L. folium].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Century Dictionary: The Century dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0dFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA832|year=1914|publisher=Century Company|page=832|chapter=Carpophyl}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=Carpel.name|group=note}} A carpel is the female reproductive part of the flower, interpreted as modified leaves bearing structures called [[ovule]]s, inside which the egg cells ultimately form. A pistil may consist of one carpel, with its ovary, style and stigma, or several carpels may be joined together with a single ovary, the whole unit called a pistil. The gynoecium may consist of one or more uni-carpellate (with one carpel) pistils, or of one multi-carpellate pistil. The number of carpels is described by terms such as '''tricarpellate''' (three carpels).

Carpels are thought to be [[phylogenetically]] derived from ovule-bearing leaves or leaf homologues ([[megasporophyll]]s), which evolved to form a closed structure containing the ovules. This structure is typically rolled and fused along the margin.

Although many flowers satisfy the above definition of a carpel, there are also flowers that do not have carpels according to this definition because in these flowers the ovule(s), although enclosed, are borne directly on the shoot apex, and only later become enclosed by the carpel.&lt;ref name=Satt88/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=D'Arcy, W.G. |author2=Keating, R.C. |year=1996  |title=The Anther: Form, Function, and Phylogeny |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=9780521480635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuUVYOFCTwYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different remedies have been suggested for this problem. An easy remedy that applies to most cases is to redefine the carpel as an appendage that encloses ovule(s) and may or may not bear them.&lt;ref name=Satt82/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=130}}&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt;

[[File:RanunculusRepens-FoxRoost-Newfoundland - stamens and pistils closeup.jpg|thumb|Centre of a ''[[Ranunculus repens]]'' (creeping buttercup) showing multiple unfused carpels surrounded by longer stamens]]
[[File:Narcis zaadhokken.jpg|thumb|Cross-section through the ovary of ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' showing multiple connate carpels (a compound pistil) fused along the placental line where the ovules form in each locule]]

== Types ==

If a gynoecium has a single carpel, it is called '''monocarpous'''. If a gynoecium has multiple, distinct (free, unfused) carpels, it is '''apocarpous'''. If a gynoecium has multiple carpels "fused" into a single structure, it is '''syncarpous'''. A syncarpous gynoecium can sometimes appear very much like a monocarpous gynoecium.

The degree of connation ("fusion") in a syncarpous gynoecium can vary. The carpels may be "fused" only at their bases, but retain separate styles and stigmas. The carpels may be "fused" entirely, except for retaining separate stigmas. Sometimes (e.g., [[Apocynaceae]]) carpels are fused by their styles or stigmas but possess distinct ovaries. In a syncarpous gynoecium, the "fused" ovaries of the constituent carpels may be referred to collectively as a single compound ovary. It can be a challenge to determine how many carpels fused to form a syncarpous gynoecium. If the styles and stigmas are distinct, they can usually be counted to determine the number of carpels. Within the compound ovary, the carpels may have distinct '''locules''' divided by walls called '''septa'''. If a syncarpous gynoecium has a single style and stigma and a single locule in the ovary, it may be necessary to examine how the ovules are attached. Each carpel will usually have a distinct line of placentation where the ovules are attached.

=== Pistil development ===
Pistils begin as small primordia on a floral apical meristem, forming later than, and closer to the (floral) apex than sepal, petal and stamen primordia. [[morphology (biology)|Morphological]] and [[molecular]] studies of pistil ontogeny reveal that carpels are most likely homologous to leaves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A carpel has a similar function to a [[megasporophyll]], but typically includes a stigma, and is fused, with ovules enclosed in the enlarged lower portion, the ovary.&lt;ref name=GiffFost89/&gt;

In some [[basal angiosperm]] lineages, [[Degeneriaceae]] and [[Winteraceae]], a carpel begins as a shallow cup where the ovules develop with laminar placentation, on the upper surface of the carpel. The carpel eventually forms a folded, leaf-like structure, not fully sealed at its margins. No style exists, but a broad stigmatic crest along the margin allows pollen tubes access along the surface and between hairs at the margins.&lt;ref name=GiffFost89/&gt;

Two kinds of fusion have been distinguished: postgenital fusion that can be observed during the development of flowers, and congenital fusion that cannot be observed i.e., fusions that occurred during phylogeny. But it is very difficult to distinguish fusion and non-fusion processes in the evolution of flowering plants. Some processes that have been considered congenital (phylogenetic) fusions appear to be non-fusion processes such as, for example, the de novo formation of intercalary growth in a ring zone at or below the base of primordia.&lt;ref name=Satt78/&gt;{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=67–69, 142–145}}&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt; Therefore, "it is now increasingly acknowledged that the term 'fusion,' as applied to phylogeny (as in 'congenital fusion') is ill-advised."{{sfn|Greyson|1994|p=142}}

== Gynoecium position ==
[[Image:Spathoglottis flwrs reduced.jpg|thumb|200px|Flowers and fruit (capsules) of the ground orchid, ''[[Spathoglottis]] plicata'', illustrating an '''inferior''' ovary.]]
Basal angiosperm groups tend to have carpels arranged spirally around a conical or dome-shaped [[receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]. In later lineages, carpels tend to be in [[whorl (botany)|whorl]]s.

[[Image:Hegi ovary.png|250px|thumb|Illustration showing longitudinal sections through hypogynous (a), perigynous (b), and epigynous (c) flowers]]

The relationship of the other flower parts to the gynoecium can be an important systematic and taxonomic character. In some flowers, the stamens, petals, and sepals are often said to be "fused" into a "floral tube" or '''[[hypanthium]]'''. However, as Leins &amp; Erbar (2010) pointed out, "the classical view that the wall of the inferior ovary results from the "congenital" fusion of dorsal carpel flanks and the [[floral axis]] does not correspond to the ontogenetic processes that can actually be observed. All that can be seen is an intercalary growth in a broad circular zone that changes the shape of the floral axis (receptacle)."&lt;ref name=Leins/&gt; And what happened during evolution is not a phylogenetic fusion but the formation of a unitary intercalary meristem. Evolutionary developmental biology investigates such developmental processes that arise or change during evolution.

If the hypanthium is absent, the flower is ''hypogynous'', and the stamens, petals, and sepals are all attached to the receptacle below the gynoecium. Hypogynous flowers are often referred to as having a ''superior ovary''. This is the typical arrangement in most flowers.

If the hypanthium is present up to the base of the style(s), the flower is ''epigynous''. In an epigynous flower, the stamens, petals, and sepals are attached to the hypanthium at the top of the ovary or, occasionally, the hypanthium may extend beyond the top of the ovary. Epigynous flowers are often referred to as having an ''inferior ovary''. Plant families with epigynous flowers include [[Orchidaceae|orchids]], [[Asteraceae|asters]], and [[Onagraceae|evening primroses]].

Between these two extremes are ''perigynous'' flowers, in which a hypanthium is present, but is either free from the gynoecium (in which case it may appear to be a cup or tube surrounding the gynoecium) or connected partly to the gynoecium (with the stamens, petals, and sepals attached to the hypanthium part of the way up the ovary). Perigynous flowers are often referred to as having a ''half-inferior ovary'' (or, sometimes, ''partially inferior'' or ''half-superior''). This arrangement is particularly frequent in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] and [[Saxifragaceae|saxifrages]].

Occasionally, the gynoecium is born on a stalk, called the [[gynophore]], as in ''Isomeris arborea''.

== Placentation ==
{{Main|Ovule}}
Within the ovary, each ovule is born by a placenta or arises as a continuation of the floral apex. The placentas often occur in distinct lines called lines of [[placentation#Placentation in plants|placentation]]. In monocarpous or apocarpous gynoecia, there is typically a single line of placentation in each ovary. In syncarpous gynoecia, the lines of placentation can be regularly spaced along the wall of the ovary ('''parietal placentation'''), or near the center of the ovary. In the latter case, separate terms are used depending on whether or not the ovary is divided into separate locules. If the ovary is divided, with the ovules born on a line of placentation at the inner angle of each locule, this is '''axile placentation'''. An ovary with '''free central placentation''', on the other hand, consists of a single compartment without septae and the ovules are attached to a central column that arises directly from the floral apex (axis). In some cases a single ovule is attached to the bottom or top of the locule ('''basal''' or '''apical placentation''', respectively).

== The ovule ==
{{Main|Ovule}}
[[Image:Femalesquash3747.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Longitudinal section of carpellate flower of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] showing ovary, ovules, stigma, style, and petals]]
In flowering plants, the ''ovule'' (from Latin ''ovulum'' meaning small egg) is a complex structure born inside ovaries. The ovule initially consists of a stalked, integumented ''megasporangium'' (also called the ''nucellus''). Typically, one cell in the megasporangium undergoes [[meiosis]] resulting in one to four megaspores. These develop into a megagametophyte (often called the embryo sac) within the ovule. The megagametophyte typically develops a small number of cells, including two special cells, an egg cell and a binucleate central cell, which are the [[gamete]]s involved in [[double fertilization]]. The central cell, once fertilized by a sperm cell from the pollen becomes the first cell of the [[endosperm]], and the egg cell once fertilized become the [[zygote]] that develops into the [[embryo]]. The gap in the integuments through which the pollen tube enters to deliver sperm to the egg is called the [[micropyle (botany)|micropyle]]. The stalk attaching the ovule to the placenta is called the funiculus.

== Role of the stigma and style ==
{{anchor|StyleBotany}}
[[Image:Marijuana Pistil.jpg|thumb|Stigmas and style of ''Cannabis sativa'' held in a pair of forceps]]
[[File:Crocus macro crop.jpg|thumb|Stigma of a ''[[Crocus]]'' flower.]]
{{Main|Stigma (botany)}}

Stigmas can vary from long and slender to globe-shaped to feathery. The stigma is the receptive tip of the carpel(s), which receives pollen at [[pollination]] and on which the pollen grain [[germination|germinates]]. The stigma is adapted to catch and trap pollen, either by combining pollen of visiting insects or by various hairs, flaps, or sculpturings.&lt;ref name=BlacToot84/&gt;

The style and stigma of the flower are involved in most types of [[self incompatibility in plants|self incompatibility]] reactions. Self-incompatibility, if present, prevents [[fertilisation|fertilization]] by pollen from the same plant or from genetically similar plants, and ensures outcrossing.

'''Hendon and District Archaeological Society''' ('''HADAS''') is an amateur archaeological society based in the [[London Borough of Barnet]], England, and is registered as a charity with the UK [[Charity Commission]] (Registration number 269949).

==History==
HADAS was founded in 1961 by Themistocles Constantinides to investigate the Saxon origins of [[Hendon]] and since has grown to over 150 members covering the whole of the London Borough of Barnet, and addressing all archaeological periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/English/ArchiveResearch/LondonArchaeology/Barnet.htm Museum of London]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The London Archaeologist”, Volume 11, Summer 2007, pp 242 - 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.co.uk/local-societies/hendon-and-district-archaeological-society-hadas.htm “Current Archaeology”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“The London Archaeologist”, Volume 9, pp. 266 and 294&lt;/ref&gt; Its two declared objectives are to undertake archaeological and historical research, and education for the public benefit, with particular reference to the London Borough of Barnet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/ShowCharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=269949&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological activities==
The society has been active in many excavations and other fieldwork in the Borough of Barnet and surrounding areas, the results of which are published in the Society’s Journal and newsletters, or published in books such as ''A Place in Time – The London Borough of Barnet up to c.1500'' ({{ISBN|0 9503050 6 5}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finchleysociety.org.uk/acthistlist.htm The Finchley Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The first excavation in 1961 was at the ruins of Church End Farm, near the parish church of Hendon St Mary’s.&lt;ref name="barnet"&gt;[http://www.barnet.gov.uk/index/leisure-culture/libraries/archives/archives-histories/archives-hendonhistories/archives-hendon-churchend.htm London Borough of Barnet]&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations have included the West Heath Mesolithic camp site at [[Hampstead]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-457-1/dissemination/pdf/vol02/vol02_16/02_16_407_409.pdf Council for British Archaeology, Archaeology Data Service]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The London Archaeologist", 2:16 (September 1976), pp.407-409&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Hendon,&lt;ref name="barnet" /&gt; medieval [[Chipping Barnet]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/6347570/Victors-Way-Barnet Scribd/Wessex Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Roman site of [[Sulloniacis]] at [[Brockley Hill]], a centre of Roman pottery production.&lt;ref name="molas"&gt;Museum of London “A Research Framework for London Archaeology”, 2002, Page 100 [http://www.museumoflondonarchaeology.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/397CCC6B-CFF6-45AA-B402-A8F06C22677A/0/EditedResearchFramework.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the introduction of the UK Government’s [[PPG 16]] (Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning) in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/ppg16 UK Department of Communities and Local Government]&lt;/ref&gt; the opportunities for amateur societies to undertake invasive archaeology, such as excavations, reduced greatly&lt;ref&gt;UK Government All Party Parliamentary Archaeology Group, APPAG Report, page 15 [http://www.appag.org.uk/documents/appag_report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and so the Society has developed its use of non-invasive techniques such as ground resistivity analysis, and expanded its activities towards its other stated goal, that of education.

==Educational activities==
A training programme was created in 2003 in association with [[Birkbeck College]], University of London, in the area of post-excavation analysis. The first instance of this was run under the title “Post-Excavation: Analysis of materials from the Ted Sammes archive”,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/41859.print The Daily Echo]&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in a book published in 2006 in association with Birkbeck College and the [[Museum of London]] entitled ''The Last Hendon Farm: The archaeology and history of Church End Farm'' ({{ISBN|978-0-9503050-7-3}}).&lt;ref name="molas" /&gt; This book won a commendation at the British Archaeology Awards (BAA) in 2006 in the section for the Pitt-Rivers Award for the best project by a volunteer organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/ British Archaeology Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The latest course in this series is entitled “Looking at Finds – A Practical Course in Post-Excavation Studies”, and is tutored by Jacqui Pearce BA, FSA, MlfA, of the Museum of London Archaeological Service ([[MoLAS]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/study/ce/modules/FFAR151S5.html Birkbeck College, University of London]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the UK Government's Equivalent or Lower Qualification regulations (ELQ) the cost of providing this course through Birkbeck College would have increased significantly and it is now provided independently by HADAS.&lt;ref&gt;"Current Archaeology", Issue 239, February 2010, page 48&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 HADAS and Jacqui Pearce were jointly awarded the [[Ralph Merrifield]] Award for London Archaeology for this course by LAMAS (London and Middlesex Archaeological Society).

Training excavations are performed for local schools, such as Hendon School and St Mary’s CoE High School, Hendon,&lt;ref&gt;”The London Archaeologist”, “London Fieldwork and Publication Roundup 2007”, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of introducing archaeological concepts and skills to young people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/hendonnews/4504519.Pupils_dig_in_for_archaeological_excavation/ “Barnet Times”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnet-today.co.uk/tn/news.cfm?id=28127&amp;searchword=hadas  “Barnet Press”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-archer.co.uk/archive/2005/2005Sep05.pdf “The Archer”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.churchfarmhousemuseum.co.uk/EXCAVATION.htm Church Farmhouse Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; These excavations are operated in conjunction with the Widening Participation Initiative of [[University College London]], University of London (UCL), and took place either in the school’s own grounds or in those of the [[Church Farmhouse Museum]] in Hendon, a facility that has now closed. Barnet Council voted to withdraw funding from Church Farmhouse Museum, as well as [[Barnet Museum]], from April 2011. The Council’s cabinet met on 13 December 2010 and approved the budget for 2010/2011 which included this proposal. There was a period of public consultation up to 17 January 2011, followed by a final recommendation by the Cabinet in February, as a result of which the museum closed on 31 March 2011.

A programme of monthly lectures on archaeological or historical topics is open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnet.gov.uk/whats_on.htm London Borough of Barnet]&lt;/ref&gt; Given by external subject-matter specialists, these take place on a Tuesday at [[Avenue House]], East End Road, [[Finchley]], N3 3QE.

HADAS also participates in the [[Council for British Archaeology]]’s annual [[Festival of British Archaeology]],&lt;ref&gt;Council for British Archaeology “London Newsletter”, Winter 2009&lt;/ref&gt; designed to stimulate public interest in archaeology, usually providing an active demonstration for the public, such as in 2009 a demonstration of Roman cookery techniques and kitchenware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.britarch.ac.uk/news/090813hadas Council for British Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the HADAS contribution to this festival was an excavation in the grounds of Church Farmhouse Museum, Hendon, and the survey and excavation of a [[second world war]] public air-raid shelter and bunker complex in Sunny Hill Park, Hendon, in conjunction with Subterranea Britannica.

An '''injection well''' is a device that places fluid deep underground into [[porous rock]] formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow [[soil]] layer. The fluid may be [[water]], [[wastewater]], [[brine]] (salt water), or water mixed with chemicals.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC| url=http://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells |title=General Information About Injection Wells |date=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition ==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines an injection well as "a bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or a dug hole that is deeper than it is wide, or an improved sinkhole, or a subsurface fluid distribution system".&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Well construction depends on the injection fluid injected and depth of the injection zone. Deep wells that are designed to inject [[hazardous wastes]] or carbon dioxide deep below the Earth's surface have multiple layers of protective casing and cement, whereas shallow wells injecting non-hazardous fluids into or above drinking water sources are more simply constructed.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt;

==Applications==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Injection wells are used for many purposes.

=== Waste disposal ===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
{{Expert-subject|Engineering|section|date=July 2010}} 
In [[waste water]] disposal, treated waste water is injected into the ground between [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] layers of rocks to avoid polluting [[fresh water]] supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters. Injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation in order to prevent injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques, injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water.  This method of waste water disposal also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area, further decreasing environmental impacts.

Critics of waste water injection wells cite concerns relating to the injectate polluting receiving waters.&lt;ref name="ProPublica-Poison-Beneath"&gt;ProPublica non-profit news agency. New York, NY. [https://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us "Injection Wells: The Poison Beneath Us"] Updated 2014-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[environmental engineering]] professionals,{{who|date=September 2013}} however, consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells to be the most cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The only known alternatives to injection wells are direct discharge of treated waste water to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation. Direct discharge does not disperse the water over a wide area; the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody. Extensive irrigation is often prohibitively expensive and requires ongoing maintenance and large electricity usage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Since the early 1990s, [[Maui County]], Hawaii has been engaged in a struggle over the 3-5 million gallons per day of wastewater that it injects below the [[Lahaina]] sewage treatment plant, over the claim that the water was emerging in seeps that were causing [[algae bloom]]s and other environmental damage. After some twenty years, it was sued by environmental groups after multiple studies showed that more than half the injectate was appearing in nearby coastal waters. The judge in the suit rejected the County's arguments, potentially subjecting it to millions of dollars in federal fines. A 2001 consent decree required the county to obtain a water quality certification from the Hawaii Department Of Health, which it failed to do until 2010, after the suit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/07/federal-judge-rejects-maui-county-arguments-on-lahaina-plant-violations/#comments |title=Federal Judge Rejects Maui County Arguments on Lahaina Plant Violations |publisher=Civil Beat |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas production===
{{see|Enhanced oil recovery|Hydraulic fracturing}}
Another use of injection wells is in [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]] [[Extraction of petroleum|production]]. Steam, [[carbon dioxide]], water, and other substances can be [[water injection (oil production)|injected into an oil-producing unit]] in order to maintain [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] pressure, heat the oil or lower its viscosity, allowing it to flow to a producing well nearby.&lt;ref name="EPA Class II"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/class-ii-oil-and-gas-related-injection-wells "Class II Oil and Gas Related Injection Wells."] Updated 2015-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste site remediation===
Yet another use for injection wells is in [[environmental remediation]], for cleanup of either [[soil contamination|soil]] or [[groundwater contamination]].  Injection wells can insert clean water into an [[aquifer]], thereby changing the direction and speed of groundwater flow, perhaps towards [[extraction well]]s downgradient, which could then more speedily and efficiently remove the contaminated groundwater.  Injection wells can also be used in cleanup of soil contamination, for example by use of an ozonation system. Complex [[hydrocarbons]] and other contaminants trapped in soil and otherwise inaccessible can be broken down by [[ozone]], a highly reactive gas, often with greater cost-effectiveness than could be had by digging out the affected area. Such systems are particularly useful in built-up urban environments where digging may be impractical due to overlying buildings.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. New York, NY (2003-04-17). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/6427a6b7538955c585257359003f0230/7bfcdcd6fef70da285257163005c159c!OpenDocument "EPA Announces Cleanup Plan for Contaminated Soil and Ground Water at Central Islip Superfund Site."] Example of use of ozonation wells for remediation ''in situ.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquifer recharge===
Recently the option of [[Groundwater recharge|refilling natural aquifers]] with injection or percolation has become more important, particularly in the driest region of the world, the [[MENA]] region (Middle East and North Africa).&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2010-10-16). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2010/10/strategic-reserve/ "Strategic reserve"] by Anoop K Menon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface runoff can also be recharged into [[dry well]]s, or simply barren wells that have been modified to functions as cisterns.&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2011-05-03). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2011/05/recharging-dry-wells/ "Recharging dry wells."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt; These hybrid [[stormwater]] management systems, called [[recharge well]]s, have the advantage of aquifer recharge and instantaneous supply of potable water at the same time. They can utilize existing infrastructure and require very little effort for the modification and operation. The activation can be as simple as inserting a polymer cover (foil) into the well shaft. Vertical pipes for conduction of the overflow to the bottom can enhance performance. The area around the well acts as funnel. If this area is maintained well the water will require little purification before it enters the cistern.&lt;ref&gt;Prototype-Creation (2011-04-20). [http://www.prototype-creation.de/recharge_wells.pdf "Recharge wells and ASR."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal energy===
Injection wells are used to tap [[geothermal energy]] in hot, porous rock formations below the surface by injecting fluids into the ground, which is heated in the ground, then extracted from adjacent wells as fluid, steam, or a combination of both. The heated steam and fluid can then be utilized [[geothermal power|to generate electricity]] or directly for [[geothermal heating]].&lt;ref name="EERE pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tapping the Earth’s energy to meet our heat and power needs |url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36025.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch and Matlick 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitch |first1=David |last2=Matlick |first2=Skip |title=Gold, silver and Other Metals in scale—  Puna Geothermal Venture, Hawaii |journal=GRC  Transactions |date=2008 |volume=32 |pages=385-388 |url=http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1028353.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Direct uses"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Andrea T. |title=Prospective Direct Use Enterprises in Kapoho, Hawaii |url=https://energy.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Prospective-Direct-Use-Enterprises-in-Kapoho-Hawaii.pdf |publisher=Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, Strategic Industries Division |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory requirements==
In the United States, injection well activity is regulated by EPA and state governments under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA).&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; EPA has issued Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations in order to protect drinking water sources.&lt;ref name="EPA Regs"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/underground-injection-control-regulations "Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Updated 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. (July 2001). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=2000E99H.PDF "Technical Program Overview: Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Document no. EPA 816-R-02-025.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA regulations define six classes of injection wells. Class I wells are used for the injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production, including waste from hydraulic fracturing. Class III wells are used for the injection of fluids used in mineral [[solution mining]] beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class IV wells, like Class I wells, were used for the injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below. EPA banned the use of Class IV wells in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic/class-iv-shallow-hazardous-and-radioactive-injection-wells |title=Class IV Shallow Hazardous and Radioactive Injection Wells |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-06 |website=Underground Injection Control |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class V wells are those used for all non-hazardous injections that are not covered by Classes I through IV. Examples of Class V wells include stormwater drainage wells and [[Septic drain field|septic system leach fields]]. Finally, Class VI wells are used for the injection of carbon dioxide for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]], or long term storage.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Currently, there are no Class VI wells in operation, but 6 to 10 wells are expected to be in use by 2016.

==Injection-induced earthquakes==
[[File:Cumulative induced seismicity.png|thumbnail|Cumulative number of earthquakes in the central U.S. The red cluster at the center of the map shows an area near Oklahoma which experienced the largest increase in activity since 2009.]]
{{see also|Induced seismicity#Waste_disposal_wells|label 1=Induced seismicity § Waste disposal wells}}
A July 2013 study by US Geological Survey scientist William Ellsworth links earthquakes to wastewater injection sites. In the four years from 2010-2013 the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the central and eastern United States increased dramatically. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011, including [[2011 Oklahoma earthquake|a record-breaking 5.7-magnitude earthquake]] near [[Prague, Oklahoma]] which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. USGS scientists have found that at some locations the increase in seismicity coincides with the injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes are thought to be caused by pressure changes due to excess fluid injected deep below the surface and are being dubbed “man-made” earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Man-Made Earthquakes Update"&gt;USGS. [http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/ "Man-Made Earthquakes Update"] Updated January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;3, 2016, [[2016 Oklahoma earthquake|a 5.8-magnitude earthquake]] occurred near [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]], followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within three and one-half hours. The earthquake broke the previous record set five years earlier. Tremors were felt as far away as [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Gilbert, Arizona]]. [[Mary Fallin]], the Oklahoma governor, declared a local emergency and shutdown orders for local disposal wells were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MIDWEST_EARTHQUAKE Record tying Oklahoma earthquake felt as far away as Arizona], ''[[Associated Press]], Ken Miller, September 3, 2016.

Retrieved 4 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.5 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection of waste water by the oil industry.&lt;ref name="usgs_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4362#.Vj-sOpTIxku |title=A Century of Induced Earthquakes in Oklahoma? |last1=Hough |first1=Susan E. |last2=Page |first2=Morgan |date=October 20, 2015 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |quote=Several lines of evidence further suggest that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma during the 20th century may also have been induced by oil production activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">In the [[Petroleum industry]], '''Integrated operations''' (IO) refers to the integration of people, disciplines, organizations, work processes and [[information and communication technology]] to make smarter decisions. In short, IO is collaboration with focus on production.

==Contents of the term==
The most striking part of IO has been the use of always-on videoconference rooms between offshore platforms and land-based offices. This includes broadband connections for sharing of data and video-surveillance of the platform. This has made it possible to move some personnel onshore and use the existing human resources more efficiently. Instead of having e.g. an expert in geology on duty at every platform, the expert may be stationed on land and be available for consultation for several offshore platforms. 
It's also possible for a team at an office in a different time zone to be consulting the night-shift of the platform, so that no land-based workers need work at night.

Splitting the team between land and sea demands new work processes, which together with ICT is the two main focus points for IO. Tools like videoconferencing and 3D-visualization also creates an opportunity for new, more cross-discipline cooperations. For instance, a shared 3D-visualization may be tailored to each member of the group, so that the geologist gets a visualization of the geological structures while the drilling engineer focuses on visualizing the well. Here, real-time measurements from the well are important but the downhole bandwidth has previously been very restricted. Improvements in bandwidth, better measurement devices, better aggregation and visualization of this information and improved models that simulate the rock formations and wellbore currently all feed on each other. An important task where all these improvements play together is real-time production optimization.

In the process industry in general, the term is used to describe the increased cooperation, independent of location, between operators, maintenance personnel, electricians, production management as well as business management and suppliers to provide a more streamlined plant operation.

By deploying IO, the petroleum industry draws on lessons from the process industry. This can be seen in a larger focus on the whole production chain and management ideas imported from the production and process industry. A prominent idea in this regard is real-time [[Process optimization|optimization]] of the whole value chain, from long term management of the [[oil reservoir]], through capacity allocations in pipe networks and calculations of the net present value of the produced oil. Reviews of the application of Integrated Operations can be found in papers presented in the by-annual society of petroleum engineers Intelligent Energy conferences. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|title = The Art of Intelligent Energy(iE) - Insights and Lessons Learned from the application of iE|date = 2010|accessdate = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-128669-MS?sort=&amp;start=0&amp;q=128669&amp;from_year=&amp;peer_reviewed=&amp;published_between=&amp;fromSearchResults=true&amp;to_year=&amp;rows=10#|website = |publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus on the whole production chain is also seen in debates about how to organize people in an IO organisation, with frequent calls for breaking down the [[Information silo]]s in the oil companies. A large oil company is typically organized in [[functional silo]]s corresponding to disciplines such as [[Oil drilling#Drilling|drilling]], [[Oil drilling#Production|production]] and [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] management. This is regarded as inefficient by the IO movement, pointing out that the activities in any well or field by any of the silos will involve or affect all of the others. 
While some companies focus on their inhouse management structure, others also emphasize the integration and coordination of outside suppliers and collaborators in offshore-operations. For instance, it is pointed out that the oil and gas industry is lagging behind other industries in terms of [[Operational intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Brulé - Digital Energy Journal sep09 p22 www.digitalenergyjournal.com/issues/DEJ20web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas and theories that IO management and work processes build on will be familiar from [[operations research]], [[knowledge management]] and [[continual improvement]] as well as [[information systems]] and [[business transformation]]. This is perhaps most evident in the repeated referral to "people, process and technology"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.integrated-operations.co.uk/ "Integrated Operations is about ensuring people, processes and technology work much more efficiently together"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/page.cfm/Link=65/t=m/goSection=16 "the 3 inter-related categories of:
People, process and organisational change; Technology and data; Case studies"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchoilandgas.com/distance-nothing-operation-everything-a143-1.html "The Third Efficiency Leap – Focus on People, Process and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt; in IO discussions
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalio.com/what-is-io/ "Achieving a high performing IO program requires four fundamental building blocks:Transformational Leadership, Right People, Business Processes and Technology"&lt;/ref&gt;. As bullet-points this mirror many of the aforementioned fields.

Since 2010 major mining companies have become implementers of Integrated Operations, most notable Rio Tinto, BHP Biliton and Codelco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176814-MS|title = Integrated Operations (IO) in Mining and Oil and Gas, What can we learn from each other?|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = OnePetro|publisher = Society of Petroleum Engineers|last = Edwards|first = Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Incentives==
Common to most companies is that IO leads to cost savings as fewer people are stationed offshore and an increased efficiency. Lower costs, more efficient reservoir management and fewer mistakes during well drilling will in turn raise profits and make more oil fields economically viable. IO comes at a time when the oil industry is faced with more "brown fields", also referred to as "tail production", where the cost of extracting the oil will be higher than its market value, unless major improvements in technology and work processes are made.
It has been estimated that deployment of IO could produce 300 billion NOK of added value to the Norwegian continental shelf alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tu.no/olje-gass/article138103.ece&lt;/ref&gt; On a longer time-scale, working onshore control and monitoring of the oil production may become a necessity as new fields at deeper waters are based purely on unmanned sub-sea facilities.

Moving jobs onshore has also been touted as a way to keep and make better use of an [[Aging U.S. Workforce|aging workforce]], which is regarded as a challenge by western oil and gas companies. As the average age of the industry workforce is increasing with many nearing retirement, IO is being leveraged for knowledge sharing and training of younger workforce. More comfortable onshore jobs together with "high-tech" tools has also been fronted as a way to recruit young workers into an industry that is seen as "unsexy", "lowtech" and difficult to combine with a normal family life.

==Critique==
The security aspect of reducing the offshore workforce has been raised. Will on-site experience be lost and can familiarity with the platform and its processes be attained from an onshore office? The new working environment in any case demands changes to HSE routines. Some of the challenges also include clear role and responsibility definitions and clarifications between the onshore &amp; offshore personnel. Who in a given situation has the authority to take decisions, the onsite or the offshore staff. The increased integration of the offshore facilities with the onshore office environment and outside collaborators also expose work-critical ICT-infrastructure to the internet and the hazards of everyday ICT. 
As for the efficiency aspect, some criticize the onshore-offshore collaboration for creating a more bureaucratic working environment.

==Naming conventions==
Both the exact terms and the content used to describe IO vary between companies. The oil company [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] has traditionally branded the term '''Smart Fields''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shell.com/home/content/innovation/meeting_demand/getting_more/smartfields/smartfields.html&lt;/ref&gt; which was an extension of '''Smart Wells''' that only referred to remote-controlled well-valves. [[BP]] uses '''Field of the future'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/sectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9025118&amp;contentId=7047802&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/bp-and-technology/more-recovery/real-time-data-and-decisions/field-of-the-future.html&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to its innovations in oil production. Chevron has '''i-field''', Honeywell has [http://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/explore/solutions/industry-solutions/oil-and-gas/off-shore-production/Pages/digital-suites-oil-gas.aspx '''Digital Suites for Oil and Gas'''] (a set of software and services), and [[Schlumberger]] terms it '''Digital Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slb.com/content/news/inside/2009/20090507_digital_energy.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The latter term, understood as referring to oil and gas, is adopted in the title of the [[digital energy journal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalenergyjournal.com/&lt;/ref&gt; This term could have several meanings, as [[GE Enterprise Solutions|GE Digital Energy]] for instance, do not appear to use it in the IO sense.

Other terms include '''e-Field''', '''i-Field''', '''Digital Oilfield''', '''Intelligent Oilfield''', '''Field of the future''' and '''Intelligent Energy'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epmag.com/archives/everyMonth/6264.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Integrated operations has been the preferred term by [[Statoil]], the [[Norwegian Oil Industry Association]] (OLF), a professional body and employer's association for oil and supplier companies&lt;ref&gt;Letter from the editor, Digital Energy Journal April/May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825175106/http://forskningsradet.ravn.no/bibliotek/forskning/200604/200604008.html |archivedate=2007-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vendors such as [[ABB Group|ABB]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abb.no/industries/us/9AAC167609.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; IO is also the preferred term for Petrobras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/integrated-operations-petrobras/68719&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent Energy is the dominant term in publications revolving around the biannual SPE Intelligent Energy conference,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intelligentenergyevent.com/&lt;/ref&gt; which has been one of the major conferences for the IO movement, along with the annual IO Science and Practice conference&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ioconf.no/2010/doku.php&lt;/ref&gt; which obviously supports the IO term.

The '''Istituto Sperimentale per la Zoologia Agraria''' (Centre for Experimental Agricultural Zoology), located in [[Florence, Italy]], is the oldest [[phytopathology]] centre in the world.

Although the Istituto Sperimentale per la Zoologia Agraria, which includes L'Istituto è sede dell' [[Accademia Nazionale Italiana di Entomologia]], was not officially formed until 1875 its activity can be traced back at least ten years prior.

In Florence scientific agriculture, promoted by the [[House of Lorraine|Lorena]] dynasty, was well established at the already centennial [[Academy of the Georgofili]], the Ministry of Agriculture, then in Via Pandolfini. The Lorena family sought the advice of [[Adolfo Targioni Tozzetti]], holder of the chair of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy of the Invertebrates, to obtain answers to the pressing problems presented by [[locusts]], [[scale insects]] which were major pests of [[peach]]es, and other phytophagous insects and by diseases of [[silkworm]]s. He suggested the foundation of a specialised institute.

The resultant station was a centre for the co-ordination of research into agricultural pests, mainly insects for the whole of Italy involving general agrarian representation, the Agricultural Colleges and private individuals. It was the headquarters of the [[La Società Entomologica Italiana|Italian Entomological Society]] following its foundation in 1869.

Targioni, the President of that society for thirty years became the Director of the Institute, the first centre for phytopathogy in the world. His main assistants were [[Fernandino Maria Piccioli]], Aggregate Professor of Entomology and the Curator of the ''Gabinetto di Zoologia e Anatomia'' comparata degli animali invertebrate at the ''R. Museo di Firenze'' Museum of Florence. The conservator at the institute's museum was [[Oreste Battaglini Mancini]].

The first collections of insects originated, partially, from the duplicates from La Specola. Expanded by gifts from Ferdinando Piccioli, and Marquis [[Pietro Bargagli]]. Some very large collections were then acquired:  [[Macrolepidoptera]] from [[Fritz Rühl]] of [[Zurich]], [[Microlepidoptera]] Piralidini from [[Otto Staudinger]] of [[Dresden]],and collections from Professor [[Pietro Stefanelli]]. Many were then added by workers at the Institute and from the [[Forest Institute of Vallombrosa]], from forest Inspectors, the "agencies" of the tobacco cultivations and from private individuals who had requested determinations. The collections are extant.

The library contains publications on agriculture and Zoology, and the institutes own publications on agrarian and forest Entomology. In the 1899 catalogue of the library it contained 1411 entomological works andjournals, these last in various languages. There were 2604 volumes, 3287 pamphlets, making a total of 7,302 units.

The Station produced a series of Reports "Relazioni a S.E. il Ministro de l'Agricoltura, Industria e Commercio, intorno ai lavori della Stazione di Entomologia Agraria", published in part in "Annali del Ministero di Agricoltura, Industria e Commercio", "Giornale delle Stazioni agrarie", in "Bullettino di Notizie Agrarie" and in "Giornale di Agricoltura". Of particular importance is volume 84 (1876) of the "Annali del Ministero di Agricoltura Industria e Commercio" in which Targioni reported on the life of the Institution in 1875, 1876, 1877–1882, 1882-1886.

The first published review from the Station was entitled "Nuove Relazioni intorno ai lavori della R. Stazione di Entomologia Agraria di Firenze", stampata dalla Tipografia di Mariano Ricci. Tali i. Such reports came in succession in years 1875, 1876, 1877–1882, 1882-1886". Each contained an entomologica report and a scientific report.

After Targioni's death from hemiplegia on 27 June 1899 the next Director was [[Antonio Berlese]]. Successive directors were: [[Antonio Melis]], [[Giacomo Del Guercio]], and [[Guido Large]], formerly a Professor of Entomology in Bologna.

The '''jansky''' (symbol '''Jy''') is a non-[[SI]] unit of spectral [[flux density]],&lt;ref&gt;http://science.jrank.org/pages/57879/jansky.html {{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[spectral irradiance]], used especially in [[radio astronomy]]. It is equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s per [[square metre]] per [[hertz]].

The ''flux density'' or ''monochromatic flux'', &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of a source is the integral of the spectral radiance, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, over the source [[solid angle]]:

:&lt;math&gt;S = \iint\limits_\text{source} B(\theta,\phi) \,\mathrm{d}\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

The unit is named after pioneering US radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky]] and is defined as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |author1=Burke, Bernard F. |author2=Graham-Smith, Francis | title=An Introduction to Radio Astronomy
  | page=9 | edition=3rd | date=2009
  | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]
  | isbn=0-521-87808-X }}&lt;!-- Citation is for the first equivalence in this expression. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;1~\text{Jy} = 10^{-26} \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2{\cdot}\text{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[SI]]) &lt;math&gt; = 10^{-23} \frac{\text{erg}}{\text{s} {\cdot}\text{cm}^2{\cdot}\text{Hz}}&lt;/math&gt; ([[centimetre gram second system of units|cgs]]).

Since the jansky is obtained by integrating over the whole source solid angle, it is most simply used to describe point sources; for example, the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] (3C) reports results in Jy.

* For extended sources, the surface brightness is often described with units of Jy per solid angle; for example, far-infrared (FIR) maps from the [[IRAS]] satellite are in MJy/[[Steradian|sr]].
* Although extended sources at all wavelengths can be reported with these units, for radio-frequency maps, extended sources have traditionally been described in terms of a [[brightness temperature]]; for example the [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985BICDS..28...49H Haslam et al.] 408&amp;nbsp;MHz all-sky continuum survey is reported in terms of a brightness temperature in [[kelvin|K]].

==Unit conversions==
Jansky units are not a standard SI Unit, so it may be necessary to convert the measurements made in the unit to the SI equivalent in terms of watts per square metre per hertz (W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz)). However, other unit conversions are possible with respect to measuring this unit.

===AB magnitude===
The flux density in Jy can be converted to a magnitude basis, for suitable assumptions about the spectrum. For instance, converting an [[AB magnitude]] to a flux-density in microjanskys is straightforward:&lt;ref name="fuk95"&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. Fukugita 
| title=Galaxy Colors in Various Photometric Band Systems | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date=1995 | volume=107 | pages=945–958 | doi=10.1086/133643 | last2=Shimasaku | first2=K. | last3=Ichikawa | first3=T.
|bibcode = 1995PASP..107..945F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_v~[\mu\text{Jy}] = 10^{6} \cdot 10^{23} \cdot 10^{-(\text{AB} + 48.6)/2.5} = 10^{(23.9 - \text{AB})/2.5}.&lt;/math&gt;

===dBW/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅Hz)===

The linear flux density in Jy can be converted to a [[decibel]] basis, suitable for use in fields of telecommunication and radio engineering.

1 jansky is equal to −260 [[Decibel watt|dBW]]/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz), or −230 [[dBm]]/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucaf.org/sschool/mike/Units_and_Calculations.ppt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223821/http://www.iucaf.org/sschool/mike/Units_and_Calculations.ppt |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{dBW}/(\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{Hz})} = 10 \log_{10}(P_\text{Jy}) - 260,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\text{dBm}/(\text{m}^2 \cdot \text{Hz})} = 10 \log_{10}(P_\text{Jy}) - 230.&lt;/math&gt;

==Usage==
The flux to which the jansky refers can be in any form of energy.

It was created for and is still most frequently used in reference to electromagnetic energy, especially in the context of radio astronomy.

The brightest [[astronomical radio source]]s have flux densities of the order of 1–100 janskys.  For example, the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] lists some 300 to 400 radio sources in the Northern Hemisphere brighter than 9&amp;nbsp;Jy at 159&amp;nbsp;MHz.  This range makes the jansky a suitable unit for [[radio astronomy]].

[[Gravitational waves]] also carry energy, so their flux density can also be expressed in terms of janskys.  Typical signals on Earth are expected to be 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Jy or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | date=2009-03-04
  | accessdate = 2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of the poor coupling of gravitational waves to matter, such signals are difficult to detect.

When measuring broadband continuum emissions, where the energy is roughly evenly distributed across the detector [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the detected signal will increase in proportion to the bandwidth of the detector (as opposed to signals with bandwidth narrower than the detector bandpass). To calculate the flux density in janskys, the total power detected (in watts) is divided by the receiver collecting area (in square meters), and then divided by the detector bandwidth (in hertz).  The flux density of astronomical sources is many orders of magnitude below 1 W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·Hz), so the result is multiplied by 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to get a more appropriate unit for natural astrophysical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The millijansky, mJy, was sometimes referred to as a milli flux unit (m.f.u.) in the astronomical literature.&lt;ref name=Ross75&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1895">'''Jatun Sacha''' ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]: ''hatun sacha'', "big forest", [[Southern Quechua]]: ''hatun sach'a'', "big tree(s)", "great wilderness", also written with j, sounding "h") is best known as the name of a biological station established in the Ecuadorian Amazon in 1985, the Jatun Sacha Biologial Station.  The management of this station and its associated nature reserve is undertaken by Ecuador's [[Jatun Sacha Foundation]], which since its birth in the 1980s has grown to be Ecuador's largest national level conservation organization with projects distributed throughout mainland [[Ecuador]] as well as on the [[Galápagos Islands]].

In the 21st century the name ''Jatun Sacha'' was also adopted by the Bolivian government for their Proyecto Jatun Sach'a, a forest conservation initiative in collaboration with [[FAO]], [[USAID]], and the [[United Nations]].  

In 2007, a U.S. affiliate of Ecuador's [[Jatun Sacha Foundation]] legally titled 'Jatun Sacha USA' adopted the English translation "Great Wilderness" [http://www.greatwilderness.org] as their public name in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">'''Life chances''' (''Lebenschancen'' in [[German language|German]]) is a social science theory of the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunities]] each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. It is a [[probabilistic]] concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;(Hughes 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, life chances are positively [[correlation|correlated]] with one's [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;Blackwell, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], have a [[career]] and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's [[needs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cuneo, [http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm Max Weber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161957/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Weberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on [[social stratification]] and [[social class]]. Where for Marx the [[class status]] was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as [[social mobility]] and [[social equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowenna Harrison, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140427/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/lowerSixthA.htm Is an unstratified society possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp Life Chances and Social Mobility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916023204/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=ffg&gt;Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mark La Gory, ''Unhealthy places: the ecology of risk in the urban landscape'', Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-92372-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415923727&amp;id=Mh0ZV5fl2cAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=-NoWukzqbmGuxhbpmxpbb402R-4 Google Print, p.90-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of those factors, like age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender]], are random,&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification&amp;nbsp;– how [[social class]], [[social status]] and [[political affiliation]] affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain [[group (sociology)|groups]] have in common a specific [[causal]] component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of [[economic]] factors:&lt;ref&gt;William C. Cockerham ''Health and social change in [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe
'', Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-92081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415920809&amp;id=GOZFhIBmN1gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=oWGnkOVVG5Ih1IjPG0__6J4t5R8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msop&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o2302.htm Multiple Sources of Power&amp;nbsp;– Class, Status, and Party]&lt;/ref&gt; how the [[power (sociology)|power]] of those with [[property]], compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.&lt;ref name=msop/&gt;

Weber also noted that life chances are to certain extent [[Subjectivity|subjective]]: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of [[society]], that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction.&lt;ref name=hewett&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607123432/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/weber/wclass.htm Weber and Class].&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to [[learned helplessness]] and its long-term effects.

In terms of [[agency and structure]], life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's [[life conduct]] - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, [[free will]]ed choices about one's [[behavior]] - represent the factors one has control over.&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating [[poverty]], ensuring [[Freedom (political)|personal freedom]] or ensuring equality at birth.

==Ascriptive qualities==
The life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely [[Achieved status|achieved]], but is, to some extent, [[Ascribed status|ascribed]]. Overall, in societies emphasizing [[ascription]], opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.
This means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"&gt;Yeates, Nicola. "Sociology Factsheet&amp;nbsp;– Life Chances."www.curriculum-press.co.uk. Bank House, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascriptive qualities such as [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[Social class|class]] of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"&gt;Beeghley, Leonard. "Sociology and Stratification." The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. 5th ed. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2008. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect [[educational attainment]], the people they socialize with, and ultimately their [[class identification]]. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"/&gt;

If born into a [[wealthy]] family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a [[working class]] poor family. One of these resources includes a family's [[social ties]] and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. [[Status attainment]] refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"/&gt;

An additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.&lt;ref&gt;Gugushvili, Alexi. Ascriptive Inequality and Life Chances in Georgia. www.css.ge. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/Researchers/AlexiGugushvili/sept._2012_ENG.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming bad life chances==
[[Max Weber]] discussed the effects of [[social stratification]] on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: [[income]], [[social class]], and [[occupational prestige]]. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kevin. "life chances." The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Ed. Bryan S. Turner. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 338. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances.&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"&gt;Ultee, Wout. "Life Chances and Resources." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 15 November 2013 [http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433118_ss1-43]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead."&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"/&gt; The higher the education, the higher income and [[occupational prestige]] one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.

Early [[Health intervention|intervention]] is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in [[underdeveloped]] countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that "No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth."&lt;ref&gt;"Early Intervention Review." Save the Children. Save the Children, Nov. 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was made to ensure that [[Educational inequality|inequalities]] in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.

==Class identification and lifestyle effects==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Weber noted that life chances are partially determined by [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one [[perceives]] their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their [[social class]] to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both [[reinforce]] each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the [[tangible]] outcomes of life chances is explained by [[Robert K. Merton]]'s theory of "self fulfilling prophecy" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, "I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.

If you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but [[working class]] jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.

A '''lynchet''' is an earth terrace found on the side of a hill. Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the [[British Isles]]. They are commonly found in vertical rows and more commonly referred to as 'strip lynchets'. Lynchets appear predominantly in Southern Britain and many are in areas close to [[Hillfort|Iron Age forts]] and other earthworks, including later Roman earthworks and earlier [[Tumulus|barrows]] from the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] periods. The size, location, spacing and number of rows of many strip lynchets indicates that many were man-made. It is most likely that lynchets were dug to maximise the use of land for agriculture, although they may have had other, ceremonial uses. 

In the village of [[Loders]], Dorset, lynchets form a terraced band structure similar to an amphitheatre overlooking the village. [[File:Loders Lynchet theatre.jpg|thumb|Lynchets are arranged in a semi-circular giant amphitheatre above the village of Loders in Dorset.]] Lynchets form part of the Conservation area of neighbouring village [[Uploders]] and where they apparently form old hillside field systems in close proximity to an iron age fort and hill-top barrows. Maps from the 1800 indicate that cider orchards were planted on some lynchets in that area. 


The traditional theory on the formation of lynchets is that they may form naturally on the downslope of a field [[plough]]ed over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|title=National Monuments Record Thesauri|author=|date=|work=|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=14 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172401/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68626|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The disturbed [[soil]] slips down the hillside to create a positive lynchet while the area reduced in level becomes a negative lynchet{{clarify|date=September 2014}}. 

The word is the diminutive form of ''lynch'', now rarely appearing in the [[English language]], indicating an [[Terrace (agriculture)|agricultural terrace]].

[[File:Materialism-and-Empirio-Criticism.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front cover of the first edition of Lenin's ''Materialism and Empirio-criticism,'' published in Moscow in 1909 under the pseudonym "Vl. Ilyin."]]
'''''Materialism and Empirio-criticism''''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Материализм и эмпириокритицизм, Materializm i empiriokrititsizm'') is a philosophical work by [[Vladimir Lenin]], published in 1909. It was an obligatory subject of study in all institutions of higher education in the [[Soviet Union]], as a seminal work of [[dialectical materialism]], a part of the curriculum called "Marxist–Leninist Philosophy". Lenin argued that human perceptions correctly and accurately reflect the objective external world.

Lenin formulates the fundamental philosophical contradiction between idealism and materialism as follows:
"Materialism is the recognition of 'objects in themselves' or objects outside the mind; the ideas and sensations are copies or images of these objects. The opposite doctrine (idealism) says: the objects do not exist, outside the mind '; they are 'connections of sensations'."&lt;ref&gt;W. I. Lenin: '' Materialism and empirio-criticism. Critical remarks about a reactionary philosophy ''. Publisher for foreign language literature, Moscow 1947. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The book, whose full title is ''Materialism and Empirio-criticism. Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy'', was written by Lenin from February through October 1908 while he was exiled in [[Geneva]] and [[London]] and was published in [[Moscow]] in May 1909 by Zveno Publishers. The original [[manuscript]] and preparatory materials have been lost.

Most of the book was written when Lenin was in Geneva, apart from the one month spent in London, where he visited the library of the [[British Museum]] to access modern philosophical and natural science material. The index lists in excess of 200 sources for the book.

In December 1908, Lenin moved from Geneva to [[Paris]], where he worked until April 1909 on correcting the proofs. Some passages were edited to avoid tsarist censorship. It was published in [[Imperial Russia]] with great difficulty. Lenin insisted on the rapid distribution of the book and stressed that "not only literary but also serious political obligations" were involved in its publication.

The book was written as a reaction and criticism to the three-volume work ''Empiriomonism'' (1904–1906) by [[Alexander Bogdanov]], his political opponent within the [[Bolsheviks|Party]]. In June 1909, Bogdanov was defeated at a Bolshevik mini-conference in Paris and expelled from the Central Committee, but he still retained a relevant role in the Party's left wing. He participated in the [[Russian Revolution]] and after 1917, he was appointed director of the Socialist Academy of Social Sciences.

''Materialism and Empirio-criticism'' was republished in Russian in 1920 with an introduction attacking Bogdanov by [[Vladimir Nevsky]]. It subsequently appeared in over 20 languages and acquired canonical status in Marxist–Leninist philosophy.

== Chapters summary ==

In Chapter I: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism I, Lenin then discusses the "solipsism" of Mach and Avenarius.

In Chapter II: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism II, Lenin, Tschernow and Basarov confront the views of Ludwig Feuerbach, Joseph Dietzgen and Friedrich Engels and comment on the criterion of practice in epistemology.

In Chapter III: The Epistemology of Empiriocriticism and Dialectical Materialism III, Lenin seeks to define "matter" and "experience" and addresses the questions of causality and necessity in nature as well as "freedom and necessity" and the "principle of the economy of thought".

In Chapter IV: The philosophical idealists as collaborators and successors of empirio-criticism, Lenin deals with left and right Kant criticism, with the philosophy of immanence, Bogdanov's empiri-monism, and the critique of Hermann von Helmholtz on the "theory of symbols."

In chapter V: The latest revolution in science and philosophical idealism, Lenin deals with the thesis that "the crisis of physics" "has disappeared matter". In this context he speaks of a "physical idealism" and notes (on p. 260): "For the only" property "of matter to whose acknowledgment philosophical materialism is bound is the property of being objective reality, outside of our consciousness." 

In Chapter VI: Empiriocriticism and Historical Materialism, Lenin discusses authors such as Bogdanov, Suvorov, Ernst Haeckel and Ernst Mach.

In an addition to Chapter IV, Lenin addresses the question: "From what side did N. G. Chernyshevsky criticize Kantianism?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1613">The '''Modified Triadan System''' is a scheme of [[tooth|dental]] nomenculature that can be used widely across different animal [[species]]. It has now gained wide acceptance and is used worldwide among [[veterinary surgeon]]s.

Each [[tooth]] is given a three digit number.

The first number relates to the quadrant of the mouth in which the tooth lies. 

:Upper Right: 1
:Upper Left: 2
:Lower Left: 3
:Lower Right: 4

If it is a deciduous tooth that is being referred to then a different number is used as below.

:Upper Right: 5
:Upper Left: 6
:Lower Left: 7
:Lower Right: 8

The second and third numbers refer to the location of the tooth from front to back (or [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] to [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]]).

This starts at 01 and goes up to 11 for many species depending on the total number of teeth.

Mononuclear cell infiltrates are characteristic of [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] lesions, where white blood cells, mainly [[macrophages]] and [[lymphocytes]], collect at the site of injury to help clear away the debris. It is the sign of onset of [[graft rejection]].

'''Natural computing''',&lt;ref name="handbook_NC"&gt;G.Rozenberg, T.Back, J.Kok, Editors, Handbook of Natural Computing, Springer Verlag, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCA_book"&gt;A.Brabazon, M.O'Neill, S.McGarraghy. [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662436301 Natural Computing Algorithms], Springer Verlag, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''natural computation''', is a terminology introduced to encompass three classes of methods: 1) those that take inspiration from nature for the development of novel problem-solving techniques; 2) those that are based on the use of computers to synthesize natural phenomena; and 3) those that employ natural materials (e.g., molecules) to compute. The main fields of research that compose these three branches are [[artificial neural networks]], [[evolutionary algorithms]], [[swarm intelligence]], [[artificial immune systems]], fractal geometry, [[artificial life]], [[DNA computing]], and [[quantum computing]], among others.

Computational paradigms studied by natural computing are abstracted from natural phenomena as diverse as [[self-replication]], the functioning of the [[brain]], [[Darwinian evolution]], [[group behavior]], the [[immune system]], the defining properties of life forms, [[cell membranes]], and [[morphogenesis]]. 
Besides traditional [[electronic hardware]], these computational paradigms can be implemented on alternative physical media such as biomolecules (DNA, RNA), or trapped-ion [[#Quantum computing|quantum computing]] devices.

Dually, one can view  processes occurring in nature as information processing. Such processes include [[self-assembly]], 
[[developmental process]]es, [[gene regulation]] networks, [[protein–protein interaction]] networks, biological transport ([[active transport]], [[passive transport]]) networks, and [[gene assembly]] in [[unicellular organism]]s. Efforts to
understand biological systems also  include engineering of semi-synthetic organisms, and understanding the universe itself from the point of view of information processing. Indeed, the idea was even  advanced that information is more fundamental than matter or energy. 
The Zuse-Fredkin thesis, dating back to the 1960s,  states that the entire universe is a huge [[cellular automaton]] which continuously updates its rules.&lt;ref name="Fredkin90"&gt;Fredkin, F. Digital mechanics: An informational process based on reversible universal CA. Physica D 45 (1990) 254-270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuse67"&gt;Zuse, K. Rechnender Raum. Elektronische Datenverarbeitung 8 (1967) 336-344&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently it has been suggested that the whole universe is a [[quantum computer]] that computes its own behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lloyd06"&gt;Lloyd, S. Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes on the Cosmos. Knopf, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature-inspired models of computation ==
The most established "classical" nature-inspired models of computation are cellular automata, neural computation, and evolutionary computation. More recent computational systems abstracted from natural processes include swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, 
membrane computing,  and amorphous computing. Detailed reviews can be found in many books
.&lt;ref name="Olarius"&gt;Olarius S., Zomaya A. Y., Handbook of Bioinspired Algorithms and Applications, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Castro"&gt;de Castro, L. N., Fundamentals of Natural Computing: Basic Concepts, Algorithms, and Applications, CRC Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular automata ===
: ''Further information: [[Cellular automaton]]''

A cellular automaton is a [[dynamical system]] consisting of an array of cells. Space and time are discrete and each of the cells can be in a finite number of [[state (computer science)|states]]. The cellular automaton  updates the states of its cells
synchronously according to the transition rules given [[a priori probability|''a priori'']]. The  next state of a cell is computed by a transition rule and it depends only  on its current state and the states of its neighbors.

[[Conway's Game of Life]] is one of the best-known examples of cellular automata, shown to be [[Turing completeness|computationally universal]]. Cellular automata have been applied to modelling a variety of phenomena such as communication, growth, reproduction, competition, evolution and other physical and biological processes.

=== Neural computation ===
: ''Further information: [[Artificial neural network]]''

Neural computation is the field of research that emerged from the comparison between [[computer|computing machines]] and the human [[nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Neumann58"&gt;von Neumann, J. The Computer and the Brain. Yale University Press, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;
This field aims both to understand  how the '''[[brain]]''' of [[living organisms]] works  
([[brain theory]] or [[computational neuroscience]]), and to design efficient algorithms  based on the principles of how the human brain processes information (Artificial Neural Networks, ANN &lt;ref name="Arbib03"&gt;Arbib, M., editor. The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks. MIT Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;).

An [[artificial neural network]] is a network of [[artificial neurons]].&lt;ref name="Rojas96"&gt;Rojas, R. Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction. Springer, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 
An artificial neuron ''A'' is equipped with a function  &lt;math&gt;f_A&lt;/math&gt;, receives ''n'' [[real number|real-valued]] inputs &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; with respective '''[[weight function|weights]]''' &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n&lt;/math&gt;, and it  outputs &lt;math&gt;f_A(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \ldots + w_nx_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Some neurons are selected to be  the output neurons, and the network function is the vectorial function that associates to the ''n'' input values, the outputs of the ''m'' selected output neurons.
Note that different choices of weights produce different network functions for the same inputs. Back-propagation is a [[supervised learning|supervised learning method]] by which the weights of the connections in the network are repeatedly adjusted so as to minimize the difference between the vector of actual outputs and that of desired outputs. [[machine learning|Learning algorithm]]s based on [[backpropagation|backwards propagation of errors]] can be used to find optimal weights for given [[network topology|topology of the network]] and input-output pairs.

=== Evolutionary computation ===
: ''Further information: [[Evolutionary computation]]''

Evolutionary computation&lt;ref name=BFM97&gt;B&amp;auml;ck, T., Fogel, D., Michalewicz, Z., editors. Handbook of Evolutionary Computation. IOP Publishing, U.K., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is a computational paradigm inspired by [[Darwinian evolution]].

An artificial evolutionary system is a computational system  based on the notion of simulated evolution. It comprises a constant- or variable-size population of individuals, a [[fitness (biology)|fitness criterion]], and genetically inspired operators that produce the next '''[[generation]]''' from the current one. 
The initial population is typically generated randomly or heuristically, and typical operators 
are [[mutation]] and [[genetic recombination|recombination]].  At each step, the individuals are evaluated according to the given fitness function ([[survival of the fittest]]). The next generation is obtained from selected individuals (parents) by using  genetically inspired operators. The choice of parents can be guided by a  selection operator which reflects the biological principle of [[mate selection]].  This  process of simulated [[evolution]] eventually converges towards a nearly optimal population of individuals, from the point of view of the fitness function.

The study of evolutionary systems has historically evolved along three main branches: 
[[Evolution strategies]] provide a solution to [[optimization (mathematics)|parameter optimization problems]] for real-valued as well as discrete and mixed types of parameters.  
[[Evolutionary programming]] originally aimed at creating  optimal "intelligent agents" modelled, e.g., as finite state machines.
[[Genetic algorithms]]&lt;ref name="Koza92"&gt;Koza, J. [http://www.ru.lv/~peter/zinatne/ebooks/MIT%20-%20Genetic%20Programming.pdf Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection]. MIT Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; applied   the idea of evolutionary computation to the problem of finding a (nearly-)optimal solution to a given problem. Genetic algorithms initially consisted of an input population of individuals encoded as fixed-length bit strings, the genetic operators mutation (bit flips) and recombination (combination of a prefix of a parent with the suffix of the other),  and a problem-dependent fitness function.
Genetic algorithms have been used to optimize computer programs, called [[genetic programming]], and today they are also  applied to real-valued parameter optimization problems as well as to many types of [[combinatorial tasks]].

[[Estimation of Distribution Algorithm]] (EDA), on the other hand, are evolutionary algorithms that substitute traditional reproduction operators by model-guided ones. Such models are learned from the population by employing machine learning techniques and represented as Probabilistic Graphical Models, from which new solutions can be sampled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pelikan|first1=Martin|last2=Goldberg|first2=David E.|last3=Cantú-Paz|first3=Erick|title=BOA: The Bayesian Optimization Algorithm|journal=Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation - Volume 1|date=1 January 1999|pages=525–532|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2933973|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pelikan|first1=Martin|title=Hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm : toward a new generation of evolutionary algorithms|date=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin [u.a.]|isbn=978-3-540-23774-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; or generated from guided-crossover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thierens|first1=Dirk|title=The Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm|journal=Parallel Problem Solving from Nature, PPSN XI|date=11 September 2010|pages=264–273|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15844-5_27|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15844-5_27|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martins|first1=Jean P.|last2=Fonseca|first2=Carlos M.|last3=Delbem|first3=Alexandre C.

=== Swarm intelligence ===
[[Swarm intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Engelbrecht"&gt;Engelbrecht, A. Fundamentals of Computational Swarm Intelligence. Wiley and Sons, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as [[collective intelligence]], is defined as the problem solving behavior that emerges from  the interaction of [[intelligence agent|individual agents]] (e.g., [[bacteria]], [[ants]], [[termites]], [[bees]], [[spiders]], [[fish]], [[birds]]) which communicate with other agents by acting on their [[neighborhood (mathematics)|local environments]].

[[Particle swarm optimization]] applies this idea  to the problem of finding an optimal solution to a given problem
by a search through a  (multi-dimensional) [[solution space]].  The initial set-up is a swarm of ''particles'', each representing a  possible solution to the problem. Each particle has  its own  [[velocity]]  which depends  on its previous velocity (the inertia component), the tendency towards the past personal best position (the nostalgia component), and  its tendency towards  a global neighborhood  optimum or local neighborhood optimum (the social component). Particles thus move through a multidimensional space and  eventually converge towards a point between the [[maxima and minima|global best]] and their personal best. 
Particle swarm optimization algorithms have been applied to various optimization problems, and to [[unsupervised learning]], [[game learning]], and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]] applications.

In the  same vein, [[ant colony optimization|ant algorithms]] model the  foraging behaviour of ant colonies. 
To find the best path between  the nest and a source of food, ants rely on indirect communication by laying a [[pheromone]] trail on the way back to the nest if they found food, respectively  
following the concentration of pheromones if they are looking for food. Ant algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of combinatorial optimization problems over discrete search spaces.

=== Artificial immune systems ===
Artificial immune systems  (a.k.a. immunological computation or [[immunocomputing]]) are computational systems inspired by the natural immune systems of biological organisms.

Viewed as an information processing system, the [[immune system|natural immune system]] of organisms performs many complex tasks in [[parallel computation|parallel]] and [[distributed computing]] fashion.&lt;ref name="Dasgupta98"&gt;Dasgupta, D. editor. Artificial Immune Systems and Their Applications. Springer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 
These include  distinguishing  between self and [[exogenous antigen|nonself]],&lt;ref name=DeCastro&gt;de Castro, L., Timmis, J. [https://www.springer.com/computer/artificial/book/978-1-85233-594-6 Artificial Immune Systems: A New Computational Intelligence Approach]. Springer, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neutralisation (immunology)|neutralization]] of nonself [[pathogens]] ([[viruses]], bacteria, [[fungi]], and [[parasitism|parasites]]), [[learning]], [[memory]], [[associative retrieval]], [[homeostasis|self-regulation]], and [[fault-tolerance]]. 
[[Artificial immune systems]] are abstractions of the natural immune system, emphasizing these computational aspects. 
Their applications include [[antivirus software|computer virus detection]], [[anomaly detection]] in a time series of data, [[fault diagnosis]], [[pattern recognition]], machine learning, [[bioinformatics]], optimization, [[robotics]] and [[Control theory|control]].

=== Membrane computing ===
[[Membrane computing]] investigates computing models abstracted from the [[cell compartment|compartmentalized structure]] of living cells effected by [[cell membrane|membranes]].&lt;ref name="Paun02"&gt;Paun, G. Membrane Computing: An Introduction. Springer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 
A generic membrane system (P-system) consists of cell-like compartments (regions) delimited by ''membranes'', that are placed in a [[nested hierarchy|nested hierarchical]] structure.  Each membrane-enveloped region contains objects, transformation rules which modify these objects, as well as transfer rules, which specify whether the objects will be transferred outside or stay inside the region. 
Regions communicate with each other via the transfer of objects. 
The computation by a membrane system starts with an initial configuration, where the number ([[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]) of each object is set to some value for each region ([[multiset|multiset of objects]]). 
It proceeds by choosing, [[nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterministically]] and in a [[parallelism (computing)|maximally parallel manner]],
which rules are applied to which objects. The output of the computation is collected from an ''a priori'' determined output region.

Applications of membrane systems include machine learning,  modelling  of biological processes ([[photosynthesis]], certain [[signaling pathways]], [[quorum sensing]] in bacteria, cell-mediated [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]), as well as computer science applications such as  [[computer graphics]], [[public-key cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm|approximation]] and [[sorting algorithms]], as well as analysis of various [[computationally hard problems]].

=== Amorphous computing ===
In biological organisms, [[morphogenesis]] (the development of  well-defined shapes and functional structures) is achieved by the interactions between cells  guided by the genetic ''program'' encoded in the organism's DNA.

Inspired by this idea, [[amorphous computing]] aims at engineering well-defined shapes and patterns, or  coherent computational behaviours, from the local interactions of a multitude of simple unreliable,  irregularly placed, asynchronous, identically programmed computing elements (particles).&lt;ref name="AAC00"&gt;Abelson, H., Allen, D., Coore, D., Hanson, C., Homsy, G., Knight Jr., T., Nagpal, R., Rauch, E., Sussman, G., Weiss, R. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=332842 Amorphous computing]. Communications of the ACM 43, 5 (May 2000), 74-82&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a  programming paradigm, the aim is to find   new [[abstraction (computer science)|programming techniques]] that would work well for amorphous computing environments.  Amorphous computing also plays an important role as the basis for "[[#Cellular computing|cellular computing]]" (see the topics [[synthetic biology]] and [[cellular computing]], below).

== Synthesizing nature by means of computing ==
=== Artificial life ===

[[Artificial life]] (ALife) is a  research field whose ultimate goal is to understand the essential properties of life organisms &lt;ref name="Langton90"&gt;Langton, C., editor. Artificial Life. Addison-Wesley Longman, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; by building,  within electronic computers or other artificial media, ''[[ab initio]]'' systems  that exhibit properties normally associated only with living organisms. 
Early examples include [[Lindenmayer systems]] (L-systems), that have been  used to model plant growth and development. An L-system  is a parallel rewriting system that starts with an initial word, and applies its rewriting rules in parallel to all letters of the word.&lt;ref name="RoSa80"&gt;Rozenberg, G. and Salomaa, A. The Mathematical Theory of L Systems. Academic Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneering experiments in artificial life included the design of evolving "virtual  block creatures"  acting in simulated environments with realistic features such as [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[gravity]], [[collision]], and [[friction]].&lt;ref name="Brooks00"&gt;Brooks. R. [http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35023200 Artificial life: from robot dreams to reality]. ''Nature'' 406 (2000), 945-947&lt;/ref&gt; 
These artificial creatures were selected for their abilities endowed  to swim, or walk, or jump, and they competed for a common limited resource (controlling a cube). The simulation resulted in the evolution of creatures  exhibiting surprising behaviour: some developed hands to grab the cube, others developed  legs to move towards the cube. This computational  approach was further  combined with rapid manufacturing technology to actually build the physical robots that virtually evolved.&lt;ref name="LiPo00"&gt;Lipson, P., Pollack, J. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v406/n6799/full/406974a0.html Automatic design and manufacture of robotic lifeforms]. ''Nature'' 406 (2000), 974-978&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the emergence of the field of '''mechanical artificial life'''.

The field of [[#Synthetic biology|synthetic biology]] explores a biological implementation of similar ideas. 
Other  research directions within the field of artificial life include [[artificial chemistry]] as well as traditionally biological phenomena explored  in artificial systems, ranging from  computational processes such as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]] adaptation and development, to physical processes such as growth, [[self-replication]], and [[self-repair mechanisms|self-repair]].

== Nature-inspired novel hardware ==
All of the computational techniques mentioned above, while inspired by nature,  have been implemented until now mostly on traditional [[electronic hardware]]. In contrast, the two paradigms introduced here, [[#Molecular computing|molecular computing]] and [[#Quantum computing|quantum computing]], employ radically different types of hardware.

=== Molecular computing ===
[[Molecular computer|Molecular computing]] (a.k.a. biomolecular computing, biocomputing, biochemical computing, [[DNA computing]]) is a computational paradigm in which data is encoded as [[biomolecules]] such as [[DNA sequence|DNA strands]], and molecular biology tools act  on the data to perform various operations (e.g., [[arithmetic]] or [[logical operations]]).

The first experimental realization of special-purpose molecular computer was the 1994 breakthrough experiment by [[Leonard Adleman]] who solved a
7-node  instance of the [[Hamiltonian Path Problem]] solely by manipulating DNA strands in test tubes.&lt;ref name="Adleman94"&gt;Adleman, L. [http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf Molecular computation of solutions to combinatorial problems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206144827/http://www.usc.edu/dept/molecular-science/papers/fp-sci94.pdf |date=6 February 2005 }}. ''Science'' 266 (1994), 1021-1024&lt;/ref&gt; 
DNA computations start  from an initial input  encoded as a DNA sequence (essentially a sequence over the four-letter alphabet {A, C, G, T}),
and proceed by a succession of  bio-operations such as cut-and-paste (by [[restriction enzymes]] and [[ligases]]), 
extraction of strands containing a certain subsequence (by using Watson-Crick complementarity), copy (by  using [[polymerase chain reaction]] that employs the polymerase enzyme), and read-out.&lt;ref name="Kari97"&gt;Kari, L. [http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~lila/intelh.pdf DNA computing - the arrival of biological mathematics]. The Mathematical Intelligencer 19, 2 (1997) 9-22&lt;/ref&gt; 
Recent experimental research succeeded in solving more complex instances of [[NP-complete]] problems such as a 20-variable instance of  [[3SAT]], and wet DNA implementations of finite state machines with potential applications to the design of [[Targeted drug delivery|smart drugs]].

[[File:Selfassemble Sierpinski.jpg|thumb|400px|right|DNA tile self-assembly of a  Sierpinski triangle, starting from a '''seed''' obtained by the

''Nano Letters'' 8(7) (2007) 1791-1797.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the most notable contributions of research in this field is to the understanding of [[self-assembly]].&lt;ref name="ReLa07"&gt;Reif, J. and LaBean, T.

Self-assembly is the [[:wikt:bottom-up|bottom-up]] process by which objects autonomously come together to form complex structures. Instances in nature abound, and include  [[atoms]] binding  by chemical bonds to form [[molecules]], and molecules forming [[crystals]] or [[macromolecules]]. Examples of  self-assembly research  topics include self-assembled DNA nanostructures&lt;ref name="Seeman07"&gt;Seeman, N.

Theoretical research in molecular computing has yielded several novel models of DNA computing (e.g. [[splicing systems]] introduced by Tom Head already in 1987) and their computational power has been investigated.&lt;ref name="PRS98"&gt;Paun, G., Rozenberg, G., Salomaa, A.

Springer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Various subsets of bio-operations are now known to be able to achieve the computational power of [[Turing machines]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

=== Quantum computing ===
: ''Further information: [[Quantum computing]]''

A quantum computer&lt;ref name="Hirvensalo04"&gt;Hirvensalo, M. Quantum Computing, 2nd Ed. Springer, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; processes data stored as quantum bits ([[qubits]]), and uses  quantum mechanical phenomena such as [[quantum superposition|superposition]] and [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]] to perform computations.
A qubit can hold a "0", a "1", or a quantum superposition of these. 
A quantum computer  operates on qubits with [[quantum gate|quantum logic gates]]. 
Through [[Shor's algorithm|Shor's polynomial algorithm]] for factoring integers, and [[Grover's algorithm]] for quantum database search that has a quadratic time advantage, quantum computers were shown to potentially possess a significant benefit relative to electronic computers.

[[Quantum cryptography]] is not based on the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of the computation]], but  on the special properties of [[quantum information]], such as the fact that  quantum information cannot be measured reliably and any attempt at measuring it results in an unavoidable and irreversible disturbance. 
A successful  open air experiment in quantum cryptography was reported in 2007, where data was transmitted  securely over a distance of 144&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Ursin07"&gt;Ursin, R. et al. [http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v3/n7/abs/nphys629.html Entanglemen-based quantum communication over 144km]. Nature Physics 3 (2007) 481-486&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Quantum teleportation]] is another promising application, in which a quantum state (not matter or energy) is transferred to an arbitrary distant location. Implementations of practical quantum computers are based on  various substrates such as  [[ion trap|ion-traps]], 
[[superconductors]], [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], etc. 
As of 2006, the largest  quantum computing experiment  used  liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processors, and could operate on up to 12 qubits.&lt;ref name="Negrevergne06"&gt;Negrevergne, C. et al. [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PRLTAO000096000017170501000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes Benchmarking quantum control methods on a 12-qubit system].

== Nature as information processing ==
The dual aspect of natural computation is  that it aims to understand nature by regarding natural phenomena as information processing. 
The two main directions  of research in this area are [[#Systems biology|systems biology]] and [[#Synthetic biology|synthetic biology]].

=== Systems biology ===
''Further information: [[systems biology]]''

Computational systems biology (or simply systems biology) is an integrative and qualitative approach that investigates the complex communications and interactions taking place in biological systems. 
Thus, in systems biology, the focus of the study is the [[interaction network]]s themselves and the properties of biological systems that arise due to these networks, rather than the individual components of functional processes in an organism. 
This type of  research  on organic components has focused strongly on four different interdependent interaction networks:&lt;ref name="Car07"&gt;Cardelli, L. [http://lucacardelli.name/Bibliography.htm Abstract machines of systems biology] 
Bulletin of the EATCS 93 (2007), 176-204&lt;/ref&gt; gene-regulatory networks, biochemical networks, transport networks, and carbohydrate networks.

[[Gene regulatory networks]] comprise gene-gene interactions, as well as interactions between genes and other substances in the cell.
[[Gene]]s are transcribed into [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), and then translated into [[protein]]s according to the [[genetic code]]. 
Each gene is associated with other DNA segments ([[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s, [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]]s, or [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]]s) that act as [[binding site]]s for [[activator (genetics)|activators]] or [[repressor]]s for [[gene transcription]]. 
Genes  interact with each other either through their gene products (mRNA, proteins) which can regulate gene transcription, or through  small [[RNA species]] that can directly regulate genes.
These [[gene-gene interactions]], together with genes' interactions with other substances in the cell, form the most basic interaction
network: the [[gene regulatory network]]s. They perform information processing tasks within the cell, including the assembly and maintenance of other networks. Models of gene regulatory networks include random and probabilistic [[Boolean network]]s, [[asynchronous automata]], and [[network motif]]s.

Another viewpoint is that the entire genomic regulatory system is a computational system,  a ''genomic computer''. This interpretation allows  one to compare human-made electronic computation with computation as it occurs in nature.&lt;ref name="IDD07"&gt;Istrail, S., De-Leon, B-T., Davidson, E. [http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/pdfs/2007/Istrail-2007-RGC.pdf The regulatory genome and the computer]. Developmental Biology 310 (2007), 187-195&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, unlike a conventional computer, robustness  in a genomic computer is achieved by various [[feedback mechanism]]s  by which   poorly functional processes are rapidly degraded,  poorly functional cells are killed by [[apoptosis]], and poorly functional organisms are out-competed by more fit species.

[[Biochemical networks]] refer to  the interactions between proteins, and they perform various mechanical and metabolic tasks inside a cell.  Two or more proteins may bind to each other via binding of their interactions sites,  and form  a dynamic protein complex  ([[complexation]]). These protein complexes may act as [[catalysts]] for other chemical reactions, or may chemically modify each other. 
Such modifications cause changes to available binding sites of proteins.  There are tens of thousands of proteins in a cell, and they interact with each other. To describe such a massive scale interactions, [[Kohn maps]]&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, K. [http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/content/full/10/8/2703 Molecular interaction map of the mammalian cell cycle control and DNA repair systems]. Molecular Biology of the Cell 10(8) (1999) 2703-2734.&lt;/ref&gt; were  introduced
as a graphical notation to depict molecular interactions in succinct pictures.  Other approaches  to describing accurately and succinctly protein–protein interactions include the use of [[textual bio-calculus]]&lt;ref name="Nagasaki"&gt;Nagasaki, M., Onami, S., Miyano, S., Kitano, H. [http://recomb2000.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/Posters/pdf/15.pdf Bio-calculus: its concept and molecular interaction]. Genome Informatics 10 (1999) 133-143.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pi-calculus]] enriched with stochastic features.&lt;ref name="ReSh02"&gt;Regev, A., Shapiro, E. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v419/n6905/full/419343a.html Cellular abstractions: Cells as computation]. ''Nature'' 419 (2002) 343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transport network (biology)|Transport network]]s refer to the separation and transport of substances mediated by lipid membranes.
Some lipids can self-assemble into biological membranes. A lipid membrane  consists of a [[lipid bilayer]] in which  proteins and other molecules are embedded, being able to travel along this layer. Through lipid bilayers, substances are transported between the inside and outside of membranes to interact with other molecules. 
Formalisms depicting  transport networks  include membrane systems and  [[brane calculi]].&lt;ref name=Cardelli&gt;Cardelli, L. [http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/Brane%20Calculi.pdf Brane calculi: Interactions of biological membranes]. In LNCS 3082, pages 257-280. Springer, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthetic biology ===
: ''Further information: [[synthetic biology]]''

Synthetic biology aims at engineering synthetic biological components, with the ultimate goal of assembling whole biological systems from their constituent components.  The history of synthetic biology can be traced back to the 1960s, when [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] discovered the  mathematical logic in gene regulation. Genetic engineering techniques, based on  [[recombinant DNA]] technology,  are  a precursor of today's synthetic biology which  extends these techniques to entire systems of genes and gene products.

Along with the possibility of synthesizing longer and longer DNA strands, the prospect  of creating synthetic genomes with the purpose of building entirely artificial [[synthetic organism]]s became a reality. 
Indeed, rapid assembly of chemically synthesized short DNA strands made it possible to generate a 5386bp synthetic genome of a virus.&lt;ref name="Smith03"&gt;Smith, H., Hutchison III, C., Pfannkoch, C., and Venter, C. [http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15440.full Generating a synthetic genome by whole genome assembly: {phi}X174 bacteriophage from synthetic oligonucleotides]. ''PNAS 100'', 26 (2003), 15440-15445.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Smith et al. found about 100 genes that can be removed individually from the genome of ''[[Mycoplasma Genitalium]]''. 
This discovery  paves the way to the assembly of a minimal but still viable artificial genome consisting of the essential genes only.

A third approach to engineering  semi-synthetic cells is the construction of a single type of RNA-like molecule with the ability of self-replication.&lt;ref name="SLS04"&gt;Sazani, P., Larralde, R., Szostak, J. [http://genetics.mgh.harvard.edu/szostakweb/publications/Szostak_pdfs/Sazani_et_al_2004_JACS_SI.pdf A small aptamer with strong and specific recognition of the triphosphate of ATP]. ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'', 126(27) (2004) 8370-8371&lt;/ref&gt; Such a molecule could be obtained by guiding the rapid evolution  of an initial population of RNA-like molecules, by selection for the desired traits.

Another effort in this field is towards engineering multi-cellular systems by designing, e.g., [[cell signaling|cell-to-cell communication modules]] used to coordinate living bacterial cell populations.&lt;ref name="WeKn01"&gt;Weiss, R., Knight, Jr., T. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tavjkk4hymen6glj/ Engineered communications for microbial robotics]. In LNCS 2054, pages 1-16, Springer, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellular computing ===
Computation in living cells (a.k.a. [[cellular computing]], or [[in-vivo computing]]) is another approach to understand nature as computation. 
One particular study in this area is that of the computational nature of gene assembly  in unicellular organisms called [[ciliate]]s. 
Ciliates store a copy of their DNA  containing functional genes in the [[macronucleus]], and another "encrypted" copy in the [[micronucleus]]. Conjugation of two ciliates consists of the exchange of their micronuclear genetic information, leading to the formation of two new micronuclei, followed by each ciliate re-assembling the information from its new micronucleus to construct a new  functional macronucleus. 
The latter process is called [[gene assembly]], or gene re-arrangement. It involves re-ordering some fragments of DNA ([[permutation]]s and possibly [[Chromosomal inversion|inversion]]) and deleting other fragments from the micronuclear copy. 
From the computational point of view, the study of this gene assembly process led to many challenging research themes and results, such as the Turing universality of various models of this process.&lt;ref&gt;Landweber, L. and Kari, L. [http://scholarsportal.info/pdflinks/08110515452920340.pdf The evolution of cellular computing: Nature's solution to a computational problem]. ''Biosystems'', 52, 1/3 (1999) 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
From the biological point of view, a plausible hypothesis about the "bioware" that implements the gene-assembly process was proposed, based on [[template guided recombination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Angeleska | first1 = A. | last2 = Jonoska | first2 = N. | last3 = Saito | first3 = M. | last4 = Landweber | first4 = L. | year = 2007 | title = RNA-guided DNA assembly | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WMD-4NYD8XF-3&amp;_user=940030&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000048763&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=940030&amp;md5=41a35e4629fee3fde72940f1b0775cce | journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] | volume = 248 | issue = | pages = 706–720 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.06.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prescott, D., Ehrenfeucht, A., and Rozenberg, G.

''J. Theoretical Biology'' 222, 3 (2003), 323-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches to cellular computing include developing an ''[[in vivo]]'' programmable and autonomous finite-state automaton with ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'',&lt;ref name="NSS06"&gt;Nakagawa, H., Sakamoto, K., Sakakibara, Y.

An '''oak woodland''' is a [[plant community]] with a tree [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] dominated by [[oak]]s (''Quercus spp.''). In terms of [[Crown closure|canopy closure]], oak woodlands are intermediate between [[oak savanna]], which is more open, and [[oak forest]], which is more closed.&lt;ref name="widnr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Oak Woodland - Wisconsin DNR |url=https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/endangeredresources/communities.asp?mode=detail&amp;Code=CTFOR010WI |website=dnr.wi.gov |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the community is named for the dominance of oak trees, the [[understory]] vegetation is often diverse and includes many species of grasses, sedges, forbs, ferns, shrubs, and other plants. 

==Examples==
* Upper [[Midwestern United States]] oak woodlands dominated by white oak (''[[Quercus alba]]''), burr oak (''[[Quercus macrocarpa|Q. macrocarpa]]''), and black oak (''[[Quercus velutina|Q. velutina]]''), with subdominant canopy species red oak (''[[Quercus rubra|Q. rubra]]'') and shagbark hickory (''[[Carya ovata]]''), with a diverse understory. The community is fire-dependent, shaped by annual, low-intensity fires.&lt;ref name="widnr"/&gt;

The '''Orlando Science Center''' ('''OSC''') is a private science museum located in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Its purposes are to provide experience-based opportunities for learning about science and technology and to promote public understanding of science.

The Orlando Science Center is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) and is a member of the [[Association of Science-Technology Centers]] (ASTC). The Orlando Science Center is member supported and sponsored in part by United Arts of Central Florida, Inc., the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs and the Florida Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission statement ==
Inspire science learning for life.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1955, the Central Florida Museum (CFM) opened in Orlando Loch Haven Park in 1960. For its first decade, it was an anthropology museum with collections of artifacts relating to [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean Basin]].

In the early 1970s, the CFM's board of directors voted to change directions and to become a "hands-on" science and technology center. In 1973 the institution was renamed to honor a famous native son and astronaut, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]].

In 1984, as part of an expansion and change of philosophy, the institution's name was changed to Orlando Science Center. In 1985 another major expansion created a permanent physical sciences hall, a traveling exhibit hall, and Curiosity Corner, a hands-on exhibit area dedicated to pre-school and early primary age children. Its new facility was the setting for the Orlando Children's Museum scenes in ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2014/06/20/location-matters-various-points-from-ernest-saves-christmas|title= Location Matters: various points from 'Ernest Saves Christmas'|date= June 10, 2014|work=Orlando Weekly|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final expansion to the original facility in 1990, NatureWorks, a prototype for OSC's centerpiece natural science exhibit was created.

In May 1992, the Board and staff developed a comprehensive master plan for the Orlando Science Center, including a blueprint for construction of an entirely new science center. Construction of the new science center began in early 1995.

The new {{convert|207000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Orlando Science Center celebrated its grand opening on February 1, 1997. It is six times larger than the original facility, which closed December 31, 1996. The current president and CEO of the science center is JoAnn Newman.

== Exhibits ==
These are the current exhibits within the Orlando Science Center 
*'''NatureWorks'''  - 1st Floor - Exhibit hall that describes the richness of the natural world, with a focus on the diverse ecosystems of Central Florida. Such as, plants and animals of coral reefs, cypress swamps, mangrove, and other Florida environments. You can learn how living and non-living things interact with each other and their environment.
*'''KidsTown''' - 2nd Floor - Miniature town that introduces science concepts through whole-body experiences, hands-on interactives and  imaginative role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/os-orlando-science-center-kids-town-20160909-story.html|title=Orlando Science Center hopes Kids Town can be boom town|date= September 9, 2016|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Kinetic Zone''' - 2nd Floor - An eclectic array of hands-on, interactive exhibits, Kinetic Zone lets visitors explore the fundamentals of forces, such as electricity, gravity, Newton's Laws and much more. Visitors can engage in a series of hands-on challenges that invite them to design, build and test their own.
*'''The Hive: A Makerspace''' - 3rd Floor - A collaborative work space for making, learning, exploring, and sharing. The Hive is a space that cultivates community and emphasizes learning opportunities in every failure and success. 
*'''Fusion: A STEAM Gallery''' – 3rd Floor Mezzanine - The Orlando Science Center's art gallery which integrates art into the STEM curriculum. All art displayed has a fusion of art and technology. While the Gallery will remain as a permanent part of the Science Center, the exhibition is updated intermittently
*'''DinoDigs''' - 4th Floor - Exhibit consisting of fossil replicas of dinosaurs and prehistoric sea creatures. Uncover fossils in the giant dig pit "Jurassic Ridge"; examine real, fossilized dino eggs; explore displays that feature ancient land and marine reptiles; compare reptiles and dinosaurs to see similarities and differences; and discover denizens of the ancient oceans such as Elasmosaurus and Tylosaurus.
*'''Our Planet''' - 4th Floor - This exhibit is geared to exploring the strange, curious and odd peculiarities of the universe and our place within it. Discover the dynamic forces and systems that shape Earth and uncover the mysteries of the solar system. Experiences include computer-based interactives and visuals, such as images direct from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, and hands-on stations that explore some strange and familiar phenomena. There is also a Virtusphere: a 10-foot hollow sphere that rotate freely in any direction based to the user's steps. 
*'''Crosby Observatory''' - 6th Floor - Florida's largest public refractor telescope as well as an array of smaller yet still powerful telescopes strategically placed for star gazing. The Crosby Observatory is open from 3-5pm for SunWatch on the first Saturday of each month, weather permitting, and from 5-9 on the first and third Saturday of the month, weather permitting (exhibit halls are closed during this time).

== Traveling Exhibits ==
The Science Center has a history of hosting traveling exhibits that are displayed for a few months at a time in different galleries.

== Theaters ==
The Science Center has two movie theaters that show both educational and Hollywood films as well as laser light shows. Check the Orlando Science Center website for a current list of movie show times.
*'''Dr. Phillips Cinedome''' - Featuring a giant screen measuring 8,000 square feet, the 300-seat Dr. Phillips CineDome projects films through a fisheye lens, creating an image that surrounds the audience and extends well beyond their peripheral vision. It uses the largest film format in the world, 10 times larger than a conventional film theater. It's commonly called 15/70, meaning 15 perforations (horizontally) on a 70&amp;nbsp;mm print.
*'''Digital Adventure Theater''' - One of the first museums to join a national effort with National Geographic,  the Science Center has special access to one of the world's largest giant-screen film libraries that includes award-winning films in 2D and 3D digital formats. In addition, this theater also shows select Hollywood movies and Science Live! programs such as Kaboom! and High Voltage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Phonetotopy''' is the concept that articulatory features as well as perceptual features of speech sounds are ordered in the brain in a similar way as tone ([[tonotopy]]), articulation and its somatosensory feedback ([[somatotopy]]), or visual location of an object ([[retinotopy]]). It is assumed that a phonetotopic ordering of speech sounds as well as of syllables can be found at a ''supramodal'' speech processing level (i.e. at a ''phonetic'' speech processing level) within the brain.

The concept of '''phonetotopy''' was introduced in Kröger et al. (2009) on the basis of modeling speech production, speech perception, as well as speech acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Kannampuzha J, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2009) Phonetotopy within a neurocomputational model of speech production and speech acquisition. In: Fuchs S, Loevenbruck H, Pape D, Perrier P (eds.) Some aspects of speech and the brain. (Peter Lang, Berlin) pp. 59-90&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[fMRI]] measurements on ordering of vowels with respect to phonetic features&lt;ref&gt;Obleser J, Boecker H, Drzezga A, Haslinger B, Hennenlotter A, Roettinger M, Eulitz C, Rauschecker JP (2006) Vowel sound extraction in anterior superior temporal cortex. Human Brain Mapping 27, 562–571&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[EEG|EEG-array]] measurements on vowel and syllable articulation&lt;ref&gt;Kristofer E. Bouchard KE, Mesgarani N, Johnson K, Chang EF (2013) Functional organization of human sensorimotor cortex for speech articulation. Nature 495, 327–332&lt;/ref&gt; support this concept.

The concept of '''phonetotopy''' at least underpins the concept of [[distinctive features]], which are phonetically based features of speech sounds (i.e. based in perceptual as well as in articulatory domain), but which as well are linguistically (or [[Phonology|phonologically]]) relevant, and thus are realized in a language specific way in humans.

'''Place-based education''', sometimes called '''pedagogy of place''', '''place-based learning''', '''[[experiential education]]''', '''community-based education''', '''[[education for sustainability]]''', '''[[environmental education]]''' or more rarely, '''[[service learning]]''', is an educational philosophy.  The term was [https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/elfer_charles_j_201108_phd.pdf coined in the early 1990s] by Laurie Lane-Zucker of The [[Orion Society]] and Dr. John Elder of Middlebury College. Orion's early work in the area of place-based education was funded by the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1996/05/29/36grant.h15.html?tkn=WVMFMa8sjs6Lnl2YCsgfSoxYe6eRxGRfaTlz|title=Grants - Education Week|date=1996-05-29|work=Education Week|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although educators have used its principles for some time, the approach was developed initially by The Orion Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |title=The Nature Literacy Series |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2011-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918062932/http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/education/item/3539/ |archivedate=2011-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a Massachusetts-based nonprofit organization, as well as Professor [[David Sobel]], Project Director at [[Antioch University New England]].

In his introduction to the first book specifically focused on the pedagogy, [http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/256984.Place_Based_Education Place-Based Education: Connecting Classrooms and Communities] ({{ISBN|978-0913098547}}), Lane-Zucker [http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/ describes the context within which place-based education was developed],

{{quote|In an increasingly globalized world, there are often pressures for communities and regions to subordinate themselves to the dominant economic models and to devalue their local cultural identity, traditions and history in preference to a flashily marketed homogeneity. Furthermore, at a time when industrial pollution, biodiversity/habitat loss, and aquifer depletion are becoming widespread and acute, such pressures often exacerbate the problems by encouraging unsustainable patterns of consumption and land use, and by weakening familial and community relationships that are deeply tied to the local environment. A process of disintegration occurs as basic connections to the land fray and communities become less resilient and less able to deal with the dislocations that globalization and ecological deterioration bring about. A community's health—human and more-than-human—suffers.

The path to a sustainable existence must start with a fundamental reimagining of the ethical, economic, political and spiritual foundations upon which society is based, and that this process needs to occur within the context of a deep local knowledge of place. The solutions to many of our ecological problems lie in an approach that celebrates, empowers and nurtures the cultural, artistic, historical and spiritual resources of each local community and region, and champions their ability to bring those resources to bear on the healing of nature and community.

Schools and other educational institutions can and should play a central role in this process, but for the most part they do not. Indeed, they have often contributed to the problem by educating young people to be, in David Orr's words, 'mobile, rootless and autistic toward their places.' A significant transformation of education might begin with the effort to learn how events and processes close to home relate to regional, national, and global forces and events, leading to a new understanding of ecological stewardship and community. This, I believe, supports the propagation of an enlightened localism—a local/global dialectic that is sensitive to broader ecological and social relationships at the same time as it strengthens and deepens peoples sense of community and land.

Place-based education might be characterized as the pedagogy of community, the reintegration of the individual into her homeground and the restoration of the essential links between a person and her place. Place-based education challenges the meaning of education by asking seemingly simple questions: Where am I? What is the nature of this place? What sustains this community? It often employs a process of re-storying, whereby students are asked to respond creatively to stories of their homeground so that, in time, they are able to position themselves, imaginatively and actually, within the continuum of nature and culture in that place. They become a part of the community, rather than a passive observer of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yourmarkontheworld.com/place-based-education-entrepreneurship-investing-impact-economy/|title=Place-based Education, Entrepreneurship and Investing for an "Impact Economy" {{!}} Your Mark On The World|date=2016-08-01|work=Your Mark On The World|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Place-based education seeks to help communities through employing students and school staff in solving community problems. Place-based education differs from conventional text and classroom-based education in that it understands students' local community as one of the primary resources for learning. Thus, place-based education promotes learning that is rooted in what is local—the unique history, environment, culture, economy, literature, and art of a particular place&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm Rural Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929161138/http://www.ruraledu.org/site/c.beJMIZOCIrH/b.1073935/k.EBFA/Placebased_Learning.htm |date=September 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;—that is, in students' own "[[Location (geography)|place]]" or immediate schoolyard, neighborhood, town or community. According to this pedagogy, grade school students often lose what place-based educators call their "[[sense of place]]" through focusing too quickly or exclusively on national or global issues. This is not to say that international and domestic issues are peripheral to place-based education, but that students should first have a grounding in the history, culture and [[ecology]] of their surrounding environment before moving on to broader subjects.

Place-based education often involves [[hands-on learning]], [[project-based learning]], and is always related to something in the real world. Thus students embarking upon a unit about the [[Vietnam War]] might interview veterans of that war, collecting their stories for a radio-spot, newspaper article or educational brochure. In this case, the use of local people to support students' learning would not only lead to greater comprehension of the Vietnam War, but also to understanding more about the history of their community and the people in it.

Byron Fellowship is a place-based learning experience built around sustainable community development.

[[Wintergreen Studios]] is a year-round wilderness education and retreat centre in Southeastern Ontario offering workshops and meeting facilities. Wintergreen's environment and architecture have been designed to enable people to engage in mindful living and return to their homes and workplaces inspired and refreshed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47754">'''Selective exposure''' is a theory within the practice of [[psychology]], often used in media and [[communication]] research, that historically refers to individuals' tendency to favor information which reinforces their pre-existing views while avoiding [[contradictory]] information. Selective exposure has also been known and defined as "congeniality bias" or "[[confirmation bias]]" in various texts throughout the years.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=4|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historical use of the term, people tend to select specific aspects of exposed information which they incorporate into their mindset. These selections are made based on their perspectives, beliefs, attitudes and decisions.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Sullivan|editor-first=Larry E.|title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YE3C4HMnsoC|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5143-2|page=465|chapter=Selective Exposure}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can mentally dissect the information they are exposed to and select favorable evidence, while ignoring the unfavorable. The foundation of this theory is rooted in the [[cognitive dissonance theory]], which asserts that when individuals are confronted with contrasting ideas, certain mental [[defense mechanism]]s are activated to produce harmony between new ideas and pre-existing beliefs, which results in cognitive equilibrium. Cognitive equilibrium, which is defined as a state of balance between a person's mental representation of the world and his or her environment, is crucial to understanding selective exposure theory. According to [[Jean Piaget]], when a mismatch occurs, people find it to be  "inherently dissatisfying".&lt;ref name="Beauchamp2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Anne S.|chapter=Cognitive equilibrium|editor-last=Salkind|editor-first=Neil J.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPxyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6539-1|pages=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective exposure relies on the assumption that one will continue to seek out information on an issue even after an individual has taken a stance on it. The position that a person has taken will be colored by various factors of that issue that are reinforced during the [[decision-making process]].

Selective exposure has been displayed in various contexts such as self-serving situations and situations in which people hold [[prejudice]]s regarding [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]], particular opinions, and personal and group-related issues.&lt;ref name="KastenmullerGreitemeyer2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Jonas|first3=Eva|last4=Fischer|first4=Peter|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|title=Selective exposure: The impact of collectivism and individualism|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|year=2010|pages=745–763|doi=10.1348/014466609X478988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived usefulness of information, perceived norm of fairness, and curiosity of valuable information are three factors that can counteract selective exposure.

== Effect on decision-making ==

=== Individual versus group decision-making ===
[[File:My Wife and My Mother-in-Law.jpg|thumbnail|left|This image, which can be seen as a young woman or an older woman, serves as an example of how individuals can choose to perceive the same image differently. According to Selective Exposure Theory, people tend to seek out the version of a stimulant that they want to be exposed to, such as a form of the stimulant that they are already familiar with.]]
Selective exposure can affect the decisions people make as individuals or as groups because they may be unwilling to change their views and beliefs either collectively or on their own. A historical example of the disastrous effects of selective exposure and its effects on group dynamics is the series of events leading up to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961. [[President John F. Kennedy]] was given the go ahead by his advisers to authorize the invasion of Cuba by poorly trained expatriates despite overwhelming evidence that it was a foolish and ill-conceived tactical maneuver. The advisers were so eager to please the President that they confirmed their cognitive bias for the invasion rather than challenging the faulty plan.&lt;ref name="Kastenmuller2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Zehl|first3=Stefanie|last4=Tattersall|first4=Andrew J.|last5=George|first5=Helen|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|last7=Fischer|first7=Peter|title=Leadership and Information Processing: The influence of transformational and transactional leadership on selective information search, evaluation, and conveying.|journal=Social Psychology|date=2014|volume=45|issue=5|pages=357–370|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing beliefs about one's self, other people, and the world are three variables as to why people fear new information.&lt;ref name=Sweeny2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeny|first1=Kate|last2=Melnyk|first2=Darya|last3=Miller|first3=Wendi|last4=Shepperd|first4=James A.|title=Information avoidance: Who, what, when, and why.|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=14|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–353|doi=10.1037/a0021288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of studies has shown that selective exposure effects can occur in the context of both individual and group decision making.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=Eva|last2=Schulz-Hardt|first2=Stefan|last3=Frey|first3=Dieter|last4=Thelen|first4=Norman|title=Confirmation bias in sequential information search after preliminary decisions: An expansion of dissonance theoretical research on selective exposure to information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80|issue=4|year=2001|pages=557–571|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous situational variables have been identified that increase the tendency toward selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Fischer|first2=Julia K.|last3=Aydin|first3=Nilüfer|last4=Frey|first4=Dieter|title=Physically Attractive Social Information Sources Lead to Increased Selective Exposure to Information|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–347|doi=10.1080/01973533.2010.519208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]], specifically, includes research with a variety of situational factors and related psychological processes that eventually persuade a person to make a quality decision. Additionally, from a psychological perspective, the effects of selective exposure can both stem from motivational and cognitive accounts.

=== Effect of information quantity===

According to research study by Fischer, Schulz-Hardt, et al. (2008), the quantity of decision-relevant information that the participants were exposed to had a significant effect on their levels of selective exposure. A group for which only two pieces of decision-relevant information were given had experienced lower levels of selective exposure than the other group who had ten pieces of information to evaluate. This research brought more attention to the cognitive processes of individuals when they are presented with a very small amount of decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information. The study showed that in situations such as this, an individual becomes more doubtful of their initial decision due to the unavailability of resources. They begin to think that there is not enough data or evidence in this particular field in which they are told to make a decision about. Because of this, the subject becomes more critical of their initial thought process and focuses on both decision-consistent and inconsistent sources, thus decreasing his level of selective exposure. For the group who had plentiful pieces of information, this factor made them confident in their initial decision because they felt comfort from the fact that their decision topic was well-supported by a large number of resources.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"&gt;Krueger, J. I. (Ed.). (2012). ''Social judgment and decision making.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the availability of decision-relevant and irrelevant information surrounding individuals can influence the level of selective exposure experienced during the process of decision-making.

Selective exposure is prevalent within singular individuals and groups of people and can influence either to reject new ideas or information that is not commensurate with the original ideal.  In Jonas et al. (2001) empirical studies were done on four different experiments investigating individuals' and groups' decision making. This article suggests that [[confirmation bias]] is prevalent in decision making. Those who find new information often draw their attention towards areas where they hold personal attachment. Thus, people are driven toward pieces of information that are coherent with their own expectations or beliefs as a result of this selective exposure theory occurring in action. Throughout the process of the four experiments, generalization is always considered valid and confirmation bias is always present when seeking new information and making decisions.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001 /&gt;

=== Accuracy motivation and defense motivation ===

Fischer and Greitemeyer (2010) explored individuals' decision making in terms of selective exposure to confirmatory information.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Kastenmüller|first2=Andreas| last3=Greitemeyer|first3=Tobias|last4=Fischer|first4=Julia|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|last6=Crelley|first6=David|title=Threat and selective exposure: The moderating role of threat and decision context on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=140|issue=1|year=2011|pages=51–62|doi=10.1037/a0021595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective exposure posed that individuals make their decisions based on information that is consistent with their decision rather than information that is inconsistent.  Recent research has shown that "Confirmatory Information Search" was responsible for the 2008 bankruptcy of the [[Lehman Brothers]] Investment Bank which then triggered the [[Global Financial Crisis]].  In the zeal for profit and economic gain, politicians, investors and financial advisors ignored the mathematical evidence that foretold the housing market crash in favor of flimsy justifications for upholding the status quo.&lt;ref name="FischerKastenmuller2011" /&gt; Researchers explain that subjects have the tendency to seek and select information using their integrative model. There are two primary motivations for selective exposure: Accuracy Motivation and Defense Motivation. Accuracy Motivation explains that an individual is motivated to be accurate in their decision making and Defense Motivation explains that one seeks confirmatory information to support their beliefs and justify their decisions. Accuracy motivation is not always beneficial within the context of selective exposure and can instead be counterintuitive, increasing the amount of selective exposure. Defense motivation can lead to reduced levels of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt;

=== Personal attributes ===
Selective exposure avoids information inconsistent with one's beliefs and attitudes. For example, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] would only enter a hotel room after the television was turned on and tuned to a conservative television channel.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"/&gt; When analyzing a person's [[decision-making]] skills, his or her unique process of gathering relevant information is not the only factor taken into account. Fischer et al. (2010) found it important to consider the information source itself, otherwise explained as the physical being that provided the source of information.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Selective exposure research generally neglects the influence of indirect decision-related attributes, such as physical appearance. In Fischer et al. (2010) two studies hypothesized that physically attractive information sources resulted in decision makers to be more selective in searching and reviewing decision-relevant information. Researchers explored the impact of social information and its level of physical attractiveness. The data was then analyzed and used to support the idea that selective exposure existed for those who needed to make a decision.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Therefore, the more attractive an information source was, the more positive and detailed the subject was with making the decision. Physical attractiveness affects an individual's decision because the [[perception]] of quality improves. Physically attractive information sources increased the quality of consistent information needed to make decisions and further increased the selective exposure in decision-relevant information, supporting the researchers' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt; Both studies concluded that attractiveness is driven by a different selection and evaluation of decision-consistent information. Decision makers allow factors such as physical attractiveness to affect everyday decisions due to the works of selective exposure.
In another study, selective exposure was defined by the amount of individual confidence. Individuals can control the amount of selective exposure depending on whether they have a low self-esteem or high self-esteem. Individuals who maintain higher confidence levels reduce the amount of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albarracin|first1=D.|title=The Role of Defensive Confidence in Preference for Proattitudinal Information: How Believing That One Is Strong Can Sometimes Be a Defensive Weakness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=30|issue=12|year=2004|pages=1565–1584|doi=10.1177/0146167204271180|pmc=4803283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albarracín and Mitchell (2004) hypothesized that those who displayed higher confidence levels were more willing to seek out information both consistent and inconsistent with their views. The phrase "decision-consistent information" explains the tendency to actively seek decision-relevant information. Selective exposure occurs when individuals search for information and show systematic preferences towards ideas that are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their beliefs.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; On the contrary, those who exhibited low levels of confidence were more inclined to examine information that did not agree with their views. The researchers found that in three out of five studies participants showed more confidence and scored higher on the ''Defensive Confidence Scale'',&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004 /&gt; which serves as evidence that their hypothesis was correct.

Bozo et al. (2009) investigated the anxiety of fearing death and compared it to various age groups in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Researchers analyzed the data by using the [[terror management theory]] and found that age had no direct effect on specific behaviors. The researchers thought that a fear of death would yield health-promoting behaviors in young adults. When individuals are reminded of their own death, it causes stress and anxiety, but eventually leads to positive changes in their health behaviors. Their conclusions showed that older adults were consistently better at promoting and practicing good health behaviors, without thinking about death, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bozo|first1=Özlem|last2=Tunca| first2=Ayča|last3=Šimšek|first3=Yeliz|title=The Effect of Death Anxiety and Age on Health-Promoting Behaviors: A Terror-Management Theory Perspective|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=143|issue=4|year=2009|pages=377–389|doi=10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young adults were less motivated to change and practice health-promoting behaviors because they used the selective exposure to confirm their prior beliefs. Selective exposure thus creates barriers between the behaviors in different ages, but there is no specific age at which people change their behaviors.

Though physical appearance will impact one's personal decision regarding an idea presented, a study conducted by Van Dillen, Papies, and Hofmann (2013) suggests a way to decrease the influence of personal attributes and selective exposure on [[decision-making]]. The results from this study showed that people do pay more attention to physically attractive or tempting stimuli; however, this phenomenon can be decreased through increasing the "cognitive load." In this study, increasing cognitive activity led to a decreased impact of physical appearance and selective exposure on the individual's impression of the idea presented. This is explained by acknowledging that we are instinctively drawn to certain physical attributes, but if the required resources for this attraction are otherwise engaged at the time, then we might not notice these attributes to an equal extent. For example, if a person is simultaneously engaging in a mentally challenging activity during the time of exposure, then it is likely that less attention will be paid to appearance, which leads to a decreased impact of selective exposure on [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="VanDillen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Dillen|first1=Lotte F.|last2=Papies|first2=Esther K.|last3=Hofmann|first3=Wilhelm|title=Turning a blind eye to temptation: How cognitive load can facilitate self-regulation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2013|volume=104|issue=3|pages=427–443|doi=10.1037/a0031262|url=http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|pmid=23276276|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150238/http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories accounting for selective exposure ==

[[File:Festinger cover.png|thumbnail|Festinger's groundbreaking study on cognitive dissonance is the foundation for Modern Selective Exposure Theory.]]

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Festinger.jpg|thumbnail|left|Eminent 1960s psychological theorist Leon Festinger]] --&gt;
[[Leon Festinger]] is widely considered as the father of modern social psychology and as an important figure to that field of practice as Freud was to clinical psychology and Piaget was to developmental psychology.&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajonc|first1=R. B.|title=Obituary: Leon Festinger (1919–1989)|journal=American Psychologist|date=1990|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661–662|doi=10.1037/h0091620}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered to be one of the most significant social psychologists of the 20th century. His work demonstrated that it is possible to use the scientific method to investigate complex and significant social phenomena without reducing them to the mechanistic connections between stimulus and response that were the basis of [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990" /&gt; Festinger proposed the groundbreaking theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] that has become the foundation of  selective exposure theory today despite the fact that Festinger was considered as an "avant-garde" psychologist when he had first proposed it in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ironic twist, Festinger realized that he himself was a victim of the effects of selective exposure.  He was a heavy smoker his entire life and when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1989, he was said to have joked, "Make sure that everyone knows that it wasn't lung cancer!"&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"/&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory explains that when a person either consciously or unconsciously realizes conflicting attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs, they experience mental discomfort. Because of this, an individual will avoid such conflicting information in the future since it produces this discomfort, and they will gravitate towards messages sympathetic to their own previously held conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision makers are unable to evaluate information quality independently on their own (Fischer, Jonas, Dieter &amp; Kastenmüller, 2008).&lt;ref name="FischerJonas2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Jonas|first2=Eva|last3=Frey |first3=Dieter|last4=Kastenmüller|first4=Andreas|title=Selective exposure and decision framing: The impact of gain and loss framing on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|year=2008|pages=312–320|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a conflict between pre-existing views and information encountered, individuals will experience an unpleasant and self-threatening state of aversive-arousal which will motivate them to reduce it through selective exposure. They will begin to prefer information that supports their original decision and neglect conflicting information. Individuals will then exhibit confirmatory information to defend their positions and reach the goal of dissonance reduction.&lt;ref name="FischerLea2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Lea|first2=Stephen|last3=Kastenmüller|first3=Andreas|last4=Greitemeyer|first4=Tobias|last5=Fischer|first5=Julia|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|title=The process of selective exposure: Why confirmatory information search weakens over time|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=114|issue=1|year=2011|pages=37–48|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory insists that dissonance is a psychological state of tension that people are motivated to reduce {{harv|Festinger|1957}}. Dissonance causes feelings of unhappiness, discomfort, or distress. {{harvtxt|Festinger|1957|p=13}} asserted the following: "These two elements are in a dissonant relation if, considering these two alone, the obverse of one element would follow from the other." To reduce dissonance, people add consonant cognition or change evaluations for one or both conditions in order to make them more consistent mentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsumoto|first1=Takao|title=Connectionist interpretation of the association between cognitive dissonance and attention switching|journal=Neural Networks|date=2014|volume=60|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Festinger's theory, there are two basic hypotheses:

1) The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance.

2) When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|p=3}}.

The theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] was developed in the mid-1950s to explain why people of strong convictions are so resistant in changing their beliefs even in the face of undeniable contradictory evidence. It occurs when people feel an attachment to and responsibility for a decision, position or behavior. It increases the motivation to justify their positions through selective exposure to confirmatory information (Fischer, 2011). Fischer suggested that people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviors are consistent. In an experiment that employed commitment manipulations, it impacts perceived decision certainty. Participants were free to choose attitude-consistent and inconsistent information to write an essay. Those who wrote an attitude-consistent essay showed higher levels of confirmatory information search (Fischer, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fischer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|title=Selective Exposure, Decision Uncertainty, and Cognitive Economy: A New Theoretical Perspective on Confirmatory Information Search|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=5|issue=10|year=2011|pages=751–762|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels and magnitude of dissonance also play a role. Selective exposure to consistent information is likely under certain levels of dissonance. At high levels, a person is expected to seek out information that increases dissonance because the best strategy to reduce dissonance would be to alter one's attitude or decision (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Steven M.|last2=Fabrigar|first2=Leandre R.|last3=Norris|first3=Meghan E.|title=Reflecting on Six Decades of Selective Exposure Research: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=2|issue=1|year=2008|pages=464–493|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00060.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research on selective exposure within the dissonance theory produced weak empirical support until the dissonance theory was revised and new methods, more conducive to measuring selective exposure, were implemented.&lt;ref name="Frey1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=D|title=Recent research on selective exposure to information|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=19|pages=41–80|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, scholars still argue that empirical results supporting the selective exposure hypothesis are still mixed. This is possibly due to the problems with the methods of the experimental studies conducted.&lt;ref name="TaberLodge2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taber|first1=Charles S.|last2=Lodge|first2=Milton|title=Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=50|issue=3|year=2006|pages=755–769|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for the mixed results may be the failure to simulate an authentic media environment in the experiments.&lt;ref name=Knobloch-Westerwick2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knobloch-Westerwick|first1=S.|first2=Jingbo|last2= Meng|title=Looking the Other Way: Selective Exposure to Attitude-Consistent and Counterattitudinal Political Information|journal=Communication Research|date=16 March 2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=426–448|doi=10.1177/0093650209333030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Festinger, the motivation to seek or avoid information depends on the magnitude of dissonance experienced (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008" /&gt; It is observed that there is a tendency for people to seek new information or select information that supports their beliefs in order to reduce dissonance.
There exist three possibilities which will affect extent of dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}:

* Relative absence of dissonance.

When little or no dissonance exists, there is little or no motivation to seek new information. For example, when there is an absence of dissonance, the lack of motivation to attend or avoid a lecture on 'The Advantages of Automobiles with Very High Horsepower Engines' will be independent of whether the car a new owner has recently purchased has a high or low horsepower engine. However, it is important to note the difference between a situation when there is no dissonance and when the information has no relevance to the present or future behavior. For the latter, accidental exposure, which the new car owner does not avoid, will not introduce any dissonance; while for the former individual, who also does not avoid information, dissonance may be accidentally introduced.

* The presence of moderate amounts of dissonance.

The existence of dissonance and consequent pressure to reduce it will lead to an active search of information, which will then lead people to avoid information that will increase dissonance. However, when faced with a potential source of information, there will be an ambiguous cognition to which a subject will react in terms of individual expectations about it. If the subject expects the cognition to increase dissonance, they will avoid it. In the event that one's expectations are proven wrong, the attempt at dissonance reduction may result in increasing it instead. It may in turn lead to a situation of active avoidance.

* The presence of extremely large amounts of dissonance.

If two cognitive elements exist in a dissonant relationship, the magnitude of dissonance matches the resistance to change. If the dissonance becomes greater than the resistance to change, then the least resistant elements of cognition will be changed, reducing dissonance. When dissonance is close to the maximum limit, one may actively seek out and expose oneself to dissonance-increasing information. If an individual can increase dissonance to the point where it is greater than the resistance to change, he will change the cognitive elements involved, reducing or even eliminating dissonance. Once dissonance is increased sufficiently, an individual may bring himself to change, hence eliminating all dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}.

The reduction in [[cognitive dissonance]] following a decision can be achieved by selectively looking for decision-consonant information and avoiding contradictory information. The objective is to reduce the discrepancy between the cognitions, but the specification of which strategy will be chosen is not explicitly addressed by the dissonance theory. It will be dependent on the quantity and quality of the information available inside and outside the cognitive system.&lt;ref name=Frey1986 /&gt;

=== Klapper's selective exposure ===
In the early 1960s, Columbia University researcher Joseph T. Klapper asserted in his book ''The Effects Of Mass Communication'' that audiences were not passive targets of political and commercial propaganda from mass media but that mass media reinforces previously held convictions. Throughout the book, he argued that the media has a small amount of power to influence people and, most of the time, it just reinforces our preexisting attitudes and beliefs. He argued that the media effects of relaying or spreading new public messages or ideas were minimal because there is a wide variety of ways in which individuals filter such content. Due to this tendency, Klapper argued that media content must be able to ignite some type of cognitive activity in an individual in order to communicate its message.&lt;ref name="Heath2004" /&gt; Prior to Klapper's research, the prevailing opinion was that mass media had a substantial power to sway individual opinion and that audiences were passive consumers of prevailing media [[propaganda]].  However, by the time of the release of ''The Effects of Mass Communication'', many studies led to a conclusion that many specifically targeted messages were completely ineffective.  Klapper's research showed that individuals gravitated towards media messages that bolstered previously held convictions that were set by peer groups, societal influences, and family structures and that the accession of these messages over time did not change when presented with more recent media influence.  Klapper noted from the review of research in the social science that given the abundance of content within the mass media, audiences were selective to the types of programming that they consumed.  Adults would patronize media that was appropriate for their demographics and children would eschew media that was boring to them.  So individuals would either accept or reject a mass media message based upon internal filters that were innate to that person.&lt;ref name="Heath2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Robert L.|title=Encyclopedia of Public Relations|editor-last=Heath|editor-first=Robert L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVF2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT798|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6545-2|pages=738–740|chapter=Reinforcement Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are Klapper's five mediating factors and conditions to affect people:&lt;ref name="Klapper1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klapper|first=Joseph T.|title=The effects of mass communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzcGAQAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Free Press|page=19|lccn=60014402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Predispositions and the related processes of selective exposure, [[selective perception]], and [[selective retention]].
*The groups, and the norms of groups, to which the audience members belong.
*Interpersonal dissemination of the content of communication
*The exercise of [[opinion leadership]]
*The nature of mass media in a free enterprise society.
Three basic concepts:
*Selective exposure – people keep away from communication of opposite hue.
*[[Selective perception]] – If people are confronting unsympathetic material, they do not perceive it, or make it fit for their existing opinion.
*[[Selective retention]] –  refers to the process of categorizing and interpreting information in a way that favors one category or interpretation over another. Furthermore, they just simply forget the unsympathetic material.

Groups and group norms work as mediators. For example, one can be strongly disinclined to change to the Democratic Party if their family has voted Republican for a long time. In this case, the person's predisposition to the political party is already set, so they don't perceive information about Democratic Party or change voting behavior because of [[mass communication]]. Klapper's third assumption is inter-personal dissemination of mass communication. If someone is already exposed by close friends, which creates predisposition toward something, it will lead to an increase in exposure to mass communication and eventually reinforce the existing opinion. An [[opinion leader]] is also a crucial factor to form one's predisposition and can lead someone to be exposed by mass communication. The nature of commercial mass media also leads people to select certain types of media contents.

=== Cognitive economy model ===

This new model combines the motivational and cognitive processes of selective exposure. In the past, selective exposure had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind the existence of selective exposure was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new cognitive economy model not only takes into account the motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of selective exposure experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that selective exposure does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"/&gt;

=== Media ===
[[File:ThreeWiseCryptoPartyMonkeys.jpg|thumb|Individuals tailor their media choices to avoid cognitive dissonance and avoid mental incongruity.]]
Recent studies have shown relevant empirical evidence for the pervasive influence of selective exposure on the greater population at large due to [[mass media]]. Researchers have found that individual media consumers will seek out programs to suit their individual emotional and cognitive needs. Individuals will seek out palliative forms of media during the recent times of economic crisis to fulfill a "strong surveillance need" and to decrease chronic dissatisfaction with life circumstances as well as fulfill needs for companionship.&lt;ref name="Kim2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jinhee|last2=Kim|first2=Jung-Hyun|last3=Seo|first3=Mihye|title=Toward a Person × Situation Model of Selective Exposure: Repressors, Sensitizers, and Choice of Online News on Financial Crisis|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2014|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–69|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers tend to select media content that exposes and confirms their own ideas while avoiding information that argues against their opinion. A study conducted in 2012 has shown that this type of selective exposure affects pornography consumption as well. Individuals with low levels of [[life satisfaction]] are more likely to have casual sex after consumption of pornography that is congruent with their attitudes while disregarding content that challenges their inherently permissive 'no strings attached' attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wright2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Paul J.|title=A Longitudinal Analysis of US Adults' Pornography Exposure|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2012|volume=24|issue=2|pages=67–76|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music selection is also affected by selective exposure. A 2014 study conducted by Christa L. Taylor and Ronald S. Friedman at the SUNY University at Albany, found that mood congruence was effected by self-regulation of music mood choices.  Subjects in the study chose happy music when feeling angry or neutral but listened to sad music when they themselves were sad. The choice of sad music given a sad mood was due less to mood-mirroring but as a result of subjects having an aversion to listening to happy music that was cognitively dissonant with their mood.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Christa L.|last2=Friedman|first2=Ronald S.|title=Differential influence of sadness and disgust on music preference.|journal=Psychology of Popular Media Culture|date=2014|volume=3|issue=4|pages=195–205|doi=10.1037/ppm0000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics are more likely to inspire selective exposure among consumers as opposed to single exposure decisions. For example, in their 2009 meta-analysis of Selective Exposure Theory, Hart et al. reported that "A 2004 survey by The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press (2006) found that Republicans are about 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[Fox News]] regularly than are Democrats (34% for Republicans and 20% of Democrats). In contrast, Democrats are 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[CNN]] regularly than Republicans (28% of Democrats vs. 19% of Republicans). Even more striking, Republicans are approximately five times more likely than Democrats to report watching "[[The O'Reilly Factor]]" regularly and are seven times more likely to report listening to "[[Rush Limbaugh]]" regularly."&lt;ref name="HartAlbarracin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|issue=4|year=2009|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/austen/hart2009.pdf|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when the opinions of Republicans who only tune into conservative media outlets were compared to those of their fellow conservatives in a study by Stroud (2010), their beliefs were considered to be more polarized. The same result was retrieved from the study of liberals as well.&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"&gt;Perloff, R. M. (2013). Political persuasion. In James Price Dillard and Lijiang Shen (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice.'' Retrieved from the Gale Virtual Reference Library database.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our greater tendency toward selective exposure, current political campaigns have been characterized as being extremely partisan and polarized. As Bennett and Iyengar (2008) commented, "The new, more diversified information environment makes it not only more feasible for consumers to seek out news they might find agreeable but also provides a strong economic incentive for news organizations to cater to their viewers' political preferences."&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"/&gt; Selective exposure thus plays a role in shaping and reinforcing individuals' political attitudes. 
[[File:Televison Hungarian ORION 1957.jpg|thumb|210px|Television is the most pervasive conduit of selective exposure in modern society.]]
In early research, selective exposure originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The "limited effects" model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of [[opinion leaders]]. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref name="LazarsfeldBerelson1948"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul Felix|last2=Berelson|first2=Bernard|last3=Gaudet|first3=Hazel|title=The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-lnIFR02FIC&amp;q=selective+exposure|edition=2nd|year=1948|publisher=Columbia University Press|lccn=48008605|oclc=2168461|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 [[National Annenberg Election Survey]], analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization.&lt;ref name="Stroud2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroud|first1=Natalie Jomini|title=Polarization and Partisan Selective Exposure|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=60|issue=3|year=2010|pages=556–576|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s&lt;ref name="Lawrence2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eric|last2=Sides|first2=John|last3=Farrell|first3=Henry|title=Self-Segregation or Deliberation? Blog Readership, Participation, and Polarization in American Politics|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=2010|volume=8|issue=1|pages=141|doi=10.1017/S1537592709992714|url=http://themonkeycage.org/blogpaper.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304174524/http://themonkeycage.org/blogpaper.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on blog readership that people tend to read blogs that reinforce rather than challenge their political beliefs. According to Cass Sunstein's book, ''Republic.com'', the presence of selective exposure on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are " likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Stavrositu, Carmen (2014). "Selective Exposure". In Harvey, Kerric (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics''. SAGE Publications. pp. 1117–1119. {{ISBN|978-1-4522-9026-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates how selective exposure can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.

One of the major academic debates on the concept of selective exposure is whether selective exposure contributes to people's exposure to diverse viewpoints or polarization. Scheufele and Nisbet (2012)&lt;ref name=Scheufele2012&gt;{{cite book

Ideally, true civil deliberation among citizens would be the rational exchange of non-like-minded views (or disagreement). However, many of us tend to avoid disagreement on a regular basis because we do not like to confront with others who hold views that are strongly opposed to our own. In this sense, the authors question about whether exposure to non-like-minded information brings either positive or negative effects on democratic citizenship. While there are mixed findings of peoples' willingness to participate in the political processes when they encounter disagreement, the authors argue that the issue of selectivity needs to be further examined in order to understand whether there is a truly deliberative discourse in online media environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15008">The '''side effects of penicillin ''' are bodily responses to [[penicillin]] and closely related [[antibiotic]]s that do not relate directly to its effect on bacteria. A side effect is an effect that is not intended with normal dosaging.&lt;ref name = WHO2017&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/safety_efficacy/trainingcourses/definitions.pdf |title = Definitions | publisher= The World health organization | accessdate = May 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these reactions are visible and some occur in the body's organs or blood. [[Penicillin]]s are a widely used group of medications that are effective for the treatment of a wide variety of [[bacterial infection]]s in human adults and children as well as other species. Some [[side effects]] are predictable, of which some are common but not serious, some are uncommon and serious and others are rare.{{sfn|Valerand|pages=3-4}} The route of administration of penicillin can have an effect on the development of side effects. An example of this is irritation and inflammation that develops at a peripheral infusion site when penicillin is administered intravenously. In addition, penicillin is available in different forms. There are different penicillin medications ([[penicillin G benzathine]], [[penicillin G potassium]], [[Penicillin G sodium]], [[penicillin G procaine]], and [[penicillin V]]){{sfn|Karch|page=115}} as well as a number of [[β-lactam antibiotic]]s derived from penicillin (e.g. [[amoxicillin]]) generally also referred to as "penicillin".

Side effects may only last for a short time and then go away. Side effects can be relieved in some cases with non pharmacological treatment.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; Some side effects require treatment to correct potentially serious and sometimes fatal reactions to penicillin. Penicillin has not been found to cause birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imt.ie/clinical/infections-immunology/penicillin-use-during-pregnancy-not-linked-to-birth-defects-16-12-2009/|title=Penicillin use during pregnancy not linked to birth defects|date=16 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allergies and cross sensitivities==
Many people have indicated that they have a side effect related to an allergic reaction to penicillin. It has been proposed that as many as 90% of those claiming to have an allergy to penicillin are able to take it. Identifying an allergy to penicillin requires a hypersensitivity skin test which diagnoses IgE-mediated immune responses caused by penicillin. This test is typically performed by an allergist who uses a  skin-prick and intradermal injection of penicilloyl-polylysine, a negative control (normal saline), and a positive control (histamine).&lt;ref name="Gonz2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez-Estrada|first1=A.|last2=Radojicic|first2=C.|title=Penicillin allergy: A practical guide for clinicians|journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine|volume=82|issue=5|year=2015|pages=295–300|issn=0891-1150|doi=10.3949/ccjm.82a.14111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common side effect that can develop when other medications are used. This is  the development of cross sensitivities to other antibiotics. If someone has developed side effects when taking penicillin, these side effects may develop with a new medication even though the person has not taken the new medication before. Those medications that may cause a cross sensitivity reaction are: [[carbapenems]], [[ampicillin]], [[cefazolin]], [[cephalosporins]] and [[cloxacillin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher =Vancouver Acute Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vancouver Hospital &amp; Health Sciences Centre | date = 2016 |access-date = May 19, 2017 | url = http://www.vhpharmsci.com/vhformulary/Tools/ANTIBIOTIC%20CROSS-SENSITIVITY%20CHART.pdf|title=Pharmaceutical Sciences CSU Parenteral Antibiotic Allergy cross-sensitivity chart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gonz2015"/&gt;{{sfn|Vallerand|pages = 989-994}}

==High doses==
When penicillin is used at high doses [[hypokalemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[hyperkalemia]] can occur.{{sfn|Potter|page=897}} Developing hypernatremia after administering high doses of penicillin can be a serious side effect.{{sfn|Vallerand|pages = 989-994}}

==Side effects from other medications==
The side effects of penicillin can be altered by taking other medications at the same time. Taking oral contraceptives along with penicillin may lower the effects of the contraceptive. When [[probenecid]] is used concurrently with penicillin, kidney excretion of probenecid is decreased resulting in higher blood levels of penicillin in the circulation. In some instances, this would be an intended therapeutic effect. In other instances, this is an unintended side effect. Neomycin can lower the absorption of penicillin from the gastrointestinal tract resulting in lower than expected levels of penicillin in the circulation. This side effect may result in an ineffective therapeutic effect of penicillin. When methotrexate is administered with penicillin, toxicity may occur related to methotrexate.{{sfn|Vallerand|pages =989-994 }}

The '''Socialist Unity Network''' was a small network of the [[far-left]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was not affiliated with any single [[political party]]. It grew out of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non-aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004.

Members of the network were supporters of [[Respect - The Unity Coalition]] and other left electoral initiatives including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist  perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity.

==History==
The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] some members of the network stood as "Socialist Unity" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the [[Socialist Green Unity Coalition]], a coalition with the Socialist Party.

Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine.

Leading members included Jim Jepps (later a Green Party activist), Declan O'Neill, Andy Newman (later a Labour Party member),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman &amp;#124; The Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420115503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Caygill, John Nicholson, Martin Wicks (of Swindon Trades Council), Pete Green, Nick Bird, Salman Shaheen (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog), Reuben Rosenberg (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog) and Tawfiq Chahboune.

== Core beliefs ==
The "who we are" section on the socialist unity network webpage stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Socialist Unity Network originated in the Socialist Alliance. It is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist. It is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the Blair government.

In England the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the "far left" for so long. Such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the Blair government.

The Socialist Unity Network therefore believes that, in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to New Labour can emerge, it is necessary to strive to develop [[collaborative method]]s of working as widely as possible. This is similar to the process that led to the formation of the SSP in Scotland, which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Sociology}}
'''Sociology of religion''' is the study of the [[belief]]s, practices and organizational forms of [[religion]] using the tools and methods of the discipline of [[sociology]]. This objective investigation may include the use of both [[Quantitative research|quantitative methods]] (surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis) and [[Qualitative research|qualitative approaches]] such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical and documentary materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|title=The Sociological Study of Religion|author=|date=|website=hirr.hartsem.edu|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302152641/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/sociology/about_the_field.html|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern academic sociology began with the analysis of religion in [[Émile Durkheim]]'s 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates among [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] populations, a foundational work of [[social research]] which served to distinguish sociology from other disciplines, such as [[psychology]]. The works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Max Weber]] emphasized the relationship between religion and the economic or social structure of society. Contemporary debates have centered on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]]. The contemporary sociology of religion may also encompass the sociology of [[irreligion]] (for instance, in the analysis of [[secular humanist]] belief systems).

Sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs. The process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from [[theology]] in assuming indifference to the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[reification (fallacy)|reification]] of [[Cult (religious practice)|religious practice]].

==View of religion in classical sociology==
Classical, seminal sociological theorists of the late 19th and early 20th century such as [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], and [[Karl Marx]] were greatly interested in [[religion]] and its effects on society. Like those of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] from ancient Greece, and Enlightenment philosophers from the 17th through 19th centuries, the ideas posited by these sociologists continue to be examined today.
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber had very complex and developed theories about the nature and effects of religion. Of these, Durkheim and Weber are often more difficult to understand, especially in light of the lack of context and examples in their primary texts. Religion was considered to be an extremely important social variable in the work of all three.

===Karl Marx===
{{Main|Marxism and religion}}
According to Kevin J. Christiano et al., "Marx was the product of the Enlightenment, embracing its call to replace faith by reason and religion by science." But he "did not believe in science for science's sake … he believed that he was also advancing a theory that would … be a useful tool … [in] effecting a revolutionary upheaval of the capitalist system in favor of [[socialism]]."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the crux of his arguments was that humans are best guided by reason. Religion, Marx held, was a significant hindrance to [[reason]], inherently masking the [[truth]] and misguiding followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Settimba|first=Henry|title=Testing times : globalisation and investing theology in East Africa|year=2009|publisher=Author House|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=1-4389-4798-4|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; As we will later see, [[Marx's theory of alienation|Marx viewed alienation]] as the heart of [[social inequality]]. The antithesis to this [[Social alienation|alienation]] is [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]]. Thus, to propagate freedom means to present individuals with the truth and give them a choice to accept or deny it. In this, "Marx never suggested that religion ought to be prohibited."&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Marx's theories was the oppressive economic situation in which he dwelt. With the rise of [[Industrial Revolution|European industrialism]], Marx and his colleague [[Friedrich Engels]] witnessed and responded to the growth of what he called "[[surplus value]]". Marx's view of capitalism saw rich capitalists getting richer and their workers getting poorer (the gap, the exploitation, was the "surplus value"). Not only were workers getting exploited, but in the process they were being further detached from the products they helped create. By simply selling their work for [[wage]]s, "workers simultaneously lose connection with the object of labor and become objects themselves. Workers are devalued to the level of a commodity{{spaced ndash}}a thing …"&lt;ref&gt;Christiano 2008, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; From this [[objectification]] comes alienation. The common worker is led to believe that he or she is a replaceable tool, and is alienated to the point of extreme discontent. Here, in Marx's eyes, religion enters. Capitalism utilizes our tendency towards religion as a tool or [[ideological state apparatus]] to justify this alienation. Christianity teaches that those who gather up riches and power in this life will almost certainly not be rewarded in the next ("it is harder for a rich man to enter the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] than it is for a camel to pass through the [[eye of a needle]] …") while those who suffer [[oppression]] and poverty in this life, while cultivating their spiritual wealth, will be rewarded in the Kingdom of God. Hence Marx's famous line – "[[Opium of the people|religion is the opium of the people]]", as it soothes them and dulls their senses to the pain of oppression. Some scholars have recently noted that this is a contradictory (or dialectical) metaphor, referring to religion as both an expression of suffering and a protest against suffering.&lt;ref&gt;McKinnon, AM. (2005). 'Reading ‘Opium of the People’: Expression, Protest and the Dialectics of Religion'. Critical Sociology, vol 31, no. 1-2, pp. 15–38. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818030414/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3074/1/marx_religion_and_opium_final_author_version.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Émile Durkheim===
Émile Durkheim placed himself in the [[positivism|positivist]] tradition, meaning that he thought of his study of society as dispassionate and scientific. He was deeply interested in the problem of what held complex modern societies together. Religion, he argued, was an expression of social cohesion.

In the fieldwork that led to his famous ''[[Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'', Durkheim, a [[secularism|secular]] Frenchman, looked at anthropological data of [[Indigenous Australians]]. His underlying interest was to understand the basic forms of religious life for all societies. In ''Elementary Forms'', Durkheim argues that the [[totem]]s the Aborigines venerate are actually expressions of their own conceptions of society itself. This is true not only for the Aborigines, he argues, but for all societies.

Religion, for Durkheim, is not "imaginary", although he does deprive it of what many believers find essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bellah |first=Robert Nelly |date=1973 |title=Emile Durkheim: on morality and society |url= |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |page=191 |isbn= 9780226173368 |author-link=Robert Neelly Bellah }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is very real; it is an expression of society itself, and indeed, there is no society that does not have religion. We perceive as individuals a force greater than ourselves, which is our social life, and give that perception a [[supernatural]] face. We then express ourselves religiously in groups, which for Durkheim makes the [[symbolic power]] greater. Religion is an expression of our collective consciousness, which is the fusion of all of our individual consciousnesses, which then creates a reality of its own.

It follows, then, that less complex societies, such as the Australian Aborigines, have less complex religious systems, involving totems associated with particular [[clan]]s. The more complex a particular society, the more complex the religious system is. As societies come in contact with other societies, there is a tendency for religious systems to emphasize [[universalism]] to a greater and greater extent. However, as the [[division of labour]] makes the individual seem more important (a subject that Durkheim treats extensively in his famous ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]''), religious systems increasingly focus on individual [[salvation]] and [[conscience]].

Durkheim's [[definition of religion]], from ''Elementary Forms'', is as follows: "A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden – beliefs and practices which unite into one single [[moral community]] called a Church, all those who adhere to them."&lt;ref name="Swain"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/elementaryformso00durk ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1915)'']: Translated by Joseph Ward Swain, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; This is a functional definition of religion, meaning that it explains what religion ''does'' in social life: essentially, it unites societies. Durkheim defined religion as a clear distinction between the [[sacred–profane dichotomy|sacred and the profane]], in effect this can be paralleled with the distinction between [[God]] and humans.

This definition also does not stipulate what exactly may be considered [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]]. Thus later sociologists of religion (notably [[Robert Neelly Bellah]]) have extended Durkheimian insights to talk about notions of [[civil religion]], or the religion of a state. [[American civil religion]], for example, might be said to have its own set of sacred "things": the [[flag of the United States]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], etc. Other sociologists have taken Durkheim's concept of what religion is in the direction of the religion of professional sports, the military, or of rock music.

===Max Weber===
Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and his rationalization thesis: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920).

In his sociology, Weber uses the German term "[[Verstehen]]" to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action. Weber is not a [[positivism|positivist]]; he does not believe we can find out "facts" in sociology that can be causally linked. Although he believes some generalized statements about social life can be made, he is not interested in hard positivist claims, but instead in linkages and sequences, in historical narratives and particular cases.

Weber argues for making sense of religious action on its own terms. A religious group or individual is influenced by all kinds of things, he says, but if they claim to be acting in the name of religion, we should attempt to understand their [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] on religious grounds first. Weber gives religion credit for shaping a person's image of the world, and this image of the world can affect their view of their interests, and ultimately how they decide to take action.

For Weber, religion is best understood as it responds to the human need for [[theodicy]] and [[soteriology]]. Human beings are troubled, he says, with the question of theodicy – the question of how the extraordinary power of a [[divinity|divine]] god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over. People need to know, for example, why there is undeserved good fortune and suffering in the world. Religion offers people soteriological answers, or answers that provide opportunities for [[salvation]] – relief from suffering, and reassuring meaning. The pursuit of salvation, like the pursuit of wealth, becomes a part of human [[motivation]].

Because religion helps to define motivation, Weber believed that religion (and specifically [[Calvinism]]) actually helped to give rise to modern capitalism, as he asserted in his most famous and controversial work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''.

In ''The Protestant Ethic'', Weber argues that capitalism arose in Europe in part because of how the [[belief]] in [[predestination]] was interpreted by everyday English [[Puritan]]s. Puritan theology was based on the Calvinist notion that not everyone would be saved; there was only a specific number of the elect who would avoid [[damnation]], and this was based sheerly on God's predetermined will and not on any action you could perform in this life. Official doctrine held that one could not ever really know whether one was among the elect.

Practically, Weber noted, this was difficult psychologically: people were (understandably) anxious to know whether they would be eternally damned or not. Thus Puritan leaders began assuring members that if they began doing well financially in their businesses, this would be one unofficial sign they had God's approval and were among the saved – but only if they used the fruits of their labour well. This along with the [[rationalism]] implied by [[monotheism]] led to the development of rational bookkeeping and the calculated pursuit of financial success beyond what one needed simply to live – and this is the "spirit of capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McKinnon (2010) "Elective Affinities of the Protestant Ethic: Weber and the Chemistry of Capitalism" Sociological Theory vol 28 no. 1. pages 108–126. {{cite web |url=http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818023547/http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the habits associated with the spirit of capitalism lost their religious significance, and the rational pursuit of [[Profit (economics)|profit]] became an aim in its own right.

''The Protestant Ethic'' thesis has been much critiqued, refined, and disputed, but is still a lively source of theoretical debate in sociology of religion. Weber also did considerable work on world religions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

In his ''magnum opus'' ''[[Economy and Society]]'' Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of religious attitudes:&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zaleski "Ideal Types in Max Weber's Sociology of Religion: Some Theoretical Inspirations for a Study of the Religious Field", ''Polish Sociological Review'' No. 3(171)/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
# world-flying mysticism
# world-rejecting asceticism
# inner-worldly asceticism.

He also separated [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] as pre-religious activity.

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Symbolic anthropology and phenomenology===
[[Symbolic anthropology]] and some versions of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] argue that all humans require reassurance that the world is safe and ordered place – that is, they have a need for [[ontological security]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1991). Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age, Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all societies have forms of knowledge that perform this psychological task. The inability of science to offer psychological and emotional comfort explains the presence and influence of non-scientific knowledge in human lives, even in rational world.

===Functionalism===
Unlike [[symbolic anthropology]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] points to the benefits for social organization which non-scientific belief systems provide and which scientific knowledge fails to deliver. Belief systems are seen as encouraging social order and social stability in ways that rationally based knowledge cannot. From this perspective, the existence of non-rational accounts of reality can be explained by the benefits they offer to society.

According to functionalists, "religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control. … One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and social networking, offering a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://opentextbc.ca/introductiontosociology/chapter/chapter-15-religion/ |title=Religion |last=McGivern |first=Ron |date= |website=Introduction to Sociology – 1st Canadian Edition |publisher=BC Open Textbooks |access-date=2018-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
Rationalists object to the phenomenological and functionalist approaches, arguing that they fail to understand why believers in systems of non-scientific knowledge do think they tell the truth and that their ideas are right, even when science has shown them to be wrong. We cannot explain forms of knowledge in terms of the beneficial psychological or societal effects that an outside observer may see them as producing. We have to look at the point of view of those who believe in them. People do not believe in God, practice magic, or think that witches cause misfortune because they think they are providing themselves with psychological reassurance, or to achieve greater cohesion for their social groups. They do so because they think their beliefs are correct – that they tell them the truth about the way the world is.

Nineteenth-century rationalist writers, reflecting the evolutionist spirits of their times, tended to explain the lack of rationality and the dominance of false beliefs in pre-modern worlds in terms of the deficient mental equipment of their inhabitants. Such people were seen as possessing pre-logical, or non-rational, mentality. Twentieth-century rationalist thinking generally rejected such a view, reasoning that pre-modern people didn't possess inferior minds, but lacked the social and cultural conditions needed to promote rationalism. Rationalists see the history of modern societies as the rise of scientific knowledge and the subsequent decline of non-rational belief. Some of these beliefs, such as magic and [[witchcraft]], had disappeared, while others, such as religion, had become marginalized. This rationalist perspective has led to [[secularization]] theories of various kinds.&lt;ref name="Wilson1982" /&gt;

==Typology of religious groups==
{{Main|Sociological classifications of religious movements}}
One common typology among sociologists, religious groups are classified as [[ecclesia (sociology of religion)|ecclesias]], [[religious denomination|denominations]], [[sect]]s, or [[cult]]s (now more commonly referred to in scholarship as [[new religious movement]]s). Note that sociologists give these words precise definitions which differ from how they are commonly used. In particular, sociologists use the words 'cult' and 'sect' without negative connotations, even though the popular use of these words is often pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
Some sociologists of religion explore the theoretical analysis of the sociological dimensions of [[religiosity]]. For example, [[Charles Y. Glock]] is best known for his five-dimensional scheme of the nature of religious commitment. His list consist of the following variables: [[religious belief|belief]], [[religious education|knowledge]], [[religious experience|experience]], [[practice (social theory)|practice]] (sometimes subdivided into private and public [[ritual]]) and [[consequences of religiosity|consequences]]. Glock's first four dimensions have proved widely useful in research, because generally, they are simple to measure survey research.&lt;ref name="hartsem.edu"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |chapter=Glock, Charles Young |title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society |publisher=Hartford Institute for Religion Research |first=Armand L. |last=Mauss |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011221304/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/glock.htm |archivedate=2013-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glock, C. Y. (1972) ‘On the Study of Religious Commitment’ in J. E. Faulkner (ed.) Religion’s Influence in Contemporary Society, Readings in the Sociology of Religion, Ohio: Charles E. Merril: 38–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Mervin F. Verbit]]'s contribution was a twenty four-dimensional religiosity measure which includes measuring religiosity through six different "components" of religiosity: [[ritual]], [[doctrine]], [[emotion]], [[knowledge]], [[ethics]], [[community]], and along four dimensions: content, frequency, intensity, centrality.&lt;ref&gt;Verbit, M.

==Secularization and civil religion==
{{Main|Secularization|Civil religion}}

In relation to the processes of rationalization associated with the development of [[modernity]], it was predicted in the works of many classical sociologists that religion would decline.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davie|first=Grace|title=Predicting religion: Christian, Peculiar &amp; alternative Future|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-3010-4|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists immediately after [[World War II]], many contemporary theorists have critiqued secularization thesis, arguing that religion has continued to play a vital role in the lives of individuals worldwide. In the United States, in particular, [[church attendance]] has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years. In Africa, the emergence of [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]] has occurred at a high rate. While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cragun|first=Ryan|title=Introduction To Sociology|year=2008|publisher=Seven Treasures Publications|isbn=978-0-9800707-7-4|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rise of [[Islam]] as a major world religion, especially its new-found influence in the [[Western world|West]], is another significant development. {{citation needed span|text=Furthermore, arguments may be presented regarding the concept of civil religion and new world belief systems.|date=June 2018}} In short, presupposed secularization as a decline in religiosity might seem to be a myth, depending on its definition and the definition of its scope. For instance, some sociologists have argued that steady church attendance and personal religious belief may coexist with a decline in the influence of religious authorities on social or political issues. Additionally, regular attendance or affiliation do not necessarily translate into a behaviour according to their doctrinal teachings.

In other words, numbers of members might still be growing, but this does not mean that all members are faithfully following the rules of pious behaviours expected. In that sense, religion may be seen as declining because of its waning ability to influence behaviour.

===Religious economy===
According to [[Rodney Stark]], [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] was the first contemporary sociologist to reject the secularization theory outright. Martin even proposed that the concept of secularization be eliminated from social scientific discourse, on the grounds that it had only served ideological purposes and because there was no evidence of any general shift from a religious period in human affairs to a secular period.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney. "Secularization, R.I.P." ''Sociology of religion 60'', no. 3 (1999): 249–273.&lt;/ref&gt;
Stark is well known for pioneering, with [[William Sims Bainbridge]], a [[theory of religious economy]], according to which societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed [[state religion|state religious monopoly]] or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more [[religion]]s a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious.&lt;ref name="Stark 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stark |first= Rodney |authorlink= Rodney Stark |title= Sociology |edition= 10th |year= 2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth |isbn= 0-495-09344-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the older view of secularization which states that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then the population is less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context, leading to a reduction in religious observance.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruce|first=Steve|title=Choice and Religion: A Critique of Rational Choice|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-829584-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peter Berger===
[[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] observed that while researchers supporting the secularization theory have long maintained that religion must inevitably decline in the modern world, today, much of the world is as religious as ever. This points to the falsity of the secularization theory. On the other hand, Berger also notes that secularization may be indeed have taken hold in Europe, while the United States and other regions have continued to remain religious despite the increased modernity. Dr. Berger suggested that the reason for this may have to do with the education system; in Europe, teachers are sent by the educational authorities and European parents would have to put up with secular teaching, while in the United States, schools were for much of the time under local authorities, and American parents, however unenlightened, could fire their teachers. Berger also notes that unlike Europe, America has seen the rise of Evangelical Protestantism, or "born-again Christians".&lt;ref name=dawson11&gt;Dawson, Andrew. ''Sociology of Religion''. Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78}}&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Reflections on the sociology of religion today." ''Sociology of Religion 62'', no. 4 (2001): 443–454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. "Secularization and de-secularization." ''Religions in the modern world: Traditions and transformations 336'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bryan Wilson===
[[Bryan R. Wilson]] is a writer on secularization who is interested in the nature of life in a society dominated by scientific knowledge. His work is in the tradition of Max Weber, who saw modern societies as places in which rationality dominates life and thought. Weber saw rationality as concerned with identifying causes and working out technical efficiency, with a focus on how things work and with calculating how they can be made to work more effectively, rather than why they are as they are. According to Weber, such rational worlds are disenchanted. Existential questions about the mysteries of human existence, about who we are and why we are here, have become less and less significant.

Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson1982"&gt;Wilson, Bryan (1982). Religion in Sociological Perspective, Oxford, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; insists that non-scientific systems – and religious ones in particular – have experienced an irreversible decline in influence. He has engaged in a long debate with those who dispute the secularization thesis, some of which argue that the traditional religions, such as church-centered ones, have become displaced by an abundance of non-traditional ones, such as cults and sects of various kinds. Others argue that religion has become an individual, rather than a collective, organized affair. Still others suggest that functional alternatives to traditional religion, such as nationalism and patriotism, have emerged to promote social solidarity. Wilson does accept the presence of a large variety of non-scientific forms of meaning and knowledge, but he argues that this is actually evidence of the decline of religion. The increase in the number and diversity of such systems is proof of the removal of religion from the central structural location that it occupied in pre-modern times.

===Ernest Gellner===
Unlike Wilson and Weber, [[Ernest Gellner]]&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest (1974). Legitimation of Belief, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; (1974) acknowledges that there are drawbacks to living in a world whose main form of knowledge is confined to facts we can do nothing about and that provide us with no guidelines on how to live and how to organize ourselves. In this regard, we are worse off than pre-modern people, whose knowledge, while incorrect, at least provided them with prescriptions for living. However, Gellner insists that these disadvantages are far outweighed by the huge technological advances modern societies have experienced as a result of the application of scientific knowledge.

Gellner doesn't claim that non-scientific knowledge is in the process of dying out. For example, he accepts that religions in various forms continue to attract adherents. He also acknowledges that other forms of belief and meaning, such as those provided by art, music, literature, popular culture (a specifically modern phenomenon), drug taking, political protest, and so on are important for many people. Nevertheless, he rejects the relativist interpretation of this situation – that in modernity, scientific knowledge is just one of many accounts of existence, all of which have equal validity. This is because, for Gellner, such alternatives to science are profoundly insignificant since they are technically impotent, as opposed to science. He sees that modern preoccupations with meaning and being as a self-indulgence that is only possible because scientific knowledge has enabled our world to advance so far. Unlike those in pre-modern times, whose overriding priority is to get hold of scientific knowledge in order to begin to develop, we can afford to sit back in the luxury of our well-appointed world and ponder upon such questions because we can take for granted the kind of world science has constructed for us.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]] was a [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] who saw human existence as being dependent on forms of knowledge – discourses – that work like languages. Languages/discourses define reality for us. In order to think at all, we are obliged to use these definitions. The knowledge we have about the world is provided for us by the languages and discourses we encounter in the times and places in which we live our lives. Thus, who we are, what we know to be true, and what we think are discursively constructed.

Foucault defined history as the rise and fall of discourses. Social change is about changes in prevailing forms of knowledge. The job of the historian is to chart these changes and identify the reasons for them. Unlike rationalists, however, Foucault saw no element of progress in this process. To Foucault, what is distinctive about modernity is the emergence of discourses concerned with the control and regulation of the body. According to Foucault, the rise of body-centered discourses necessarily involved a process of secularization. Pre-modern discourses were dominated by religion, where things were defined as good and evil, and social life was centered around these concepts. With the emergence of modern urban societies, scientific discourses took over, and medical science was a crucial element of this new knowledge. Modern life became increasingly subject to medical control – the [[medical gaze]], as Foucault called it.

The rise to power of science, and of medicine in particular, coincided with a progressive reduction of the power of religious forms of knowledge. For example, normality and deviance became more of a matter of health and illness than of good and evil, and the physician took over from the priest the role of defining, promoting, and healing deviance.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1977). The Birth of the Clinic: an archaeology of medical perception, London, Tavistock&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other perspectives===

[[BBC News]] reported on a study by physicists and mathematicians that attempted to use mathematical modelling ([[nonlinear dynamics]]) to predict future religious orientations of populations. The study suggests that religion is headed towards "extinction" in various nations where it has been on the decline: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland. The model considers not only the changing number of people with certain beliefs, but also attempts to assign utility values of a belief in each nation.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|title='Extinction threat' to religion|first=Jason|last=Palmer|date=22 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422050308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12811197|archivedate=22 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1012.1375|title=A mathematical model of social group competition with application to the growth of religious non-affiliation|first1=Daniel M.|last1=Abrams|first2=Haley A.|last2=Yaple|first3=Richard J.|last3=Wiener|date=16 August 2011|publisher=|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=107|issue=8|accessdate=|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.088701|bibcode=2011PhRvL.107h8701A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Luckmann]] maintains that the sociology of religion should cease preoccupations with the traditional and institutionalized forms of religion. Luckmann points instead to the "religious problem" which is the "problem of individual existence." This is the case as with the advent of modernity, religious meaning making has shifted more into the individual domain.&lt;ref name=dawson11/&gt;{{rp|82}}

==Globalization==

The sociology of religion continues to grow throughout the world, attempting to understand the relationship between religion and [[globalization]]. Two older approaches to globalization include [[modernization theory]], a functionalist derivative, and [[world-systems theory]], a Marxist approach. One of the differences between these theories is whether they view [[capitalism]] as positive or problematic. However, both assumed that [[modernization]] and capitalism would diminish the hold of religion.

To the contrary, as globalization intensified many different cultures started to look into different religions and incorporate different beliefs into society.&lt;ref name="Davie 2003 19"/&gt; New interpretations emerged that recognize the tensions. For example, according to [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and [[Peter Mandaville]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion and globalization have been intertwined with each other since the early empires attempted to extend their reach across what they perceived to be world-space. Processes of globalization carried religious cosmologies – including traditional conceptions of universalism – to the corners of the world, while these cosmologies legitimated processes of globalization. This dynamic of inter-relation has continued to the present, but with changing and sometimes new and intensifying contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2010 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Mandaville | first2= Peter | title= Globalization and Culture, Vol. 2: Globalizing Religions | url= https://www.academia.edu/4416072/Globalization_and_Culture_Vol._2_Globalizing_Religions_editor_with_Peter_Mandaville_Sage_Publications_London_2010 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:North Fork Mountain - Nelson Sods.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Nelson Sods''' on [[North Fork Mountain]], West Virginia]]

'''Sods''' is a term used in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] of eastern [[West Virginia]] for a mountain top [[meadow]] or [[bog]], in an area that is otherwise generally forested. The term is similar (perhaps identical) to that of a "[[grass bald]]", a more widespread designation applied throughout the central and southern [[Appalachia|Appalachian region]].

The best known example of a sods is [[Dolly Sods]], a federally designated [[National Wilderness Preservation System|wilderness area]] in [[Tucker County, West Virginia]] and popular destination for recreationalists. Other examples include [[North Fork Mountain|Nelson Sods]] ([[Pendleton County, West Virginia|Pendleton County]]) and Baker Sods ([[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]]).

==Ecology==
[[West Virginia University]] botanist [[Earl L. Core]] addressed the origin of the "sods" in 1973:
&lt;blockquote&gt;How did it happen that these grassy tracts were originally [prior to white settlement] treeless, when all the surrounding areas were covered with trees? No one really knows. Although the "sods" and "balds" have been the subject of much speculation, discussion, and research, no generally-accepted explanation has yet been proposed for their existence. Perhaps there is not really any one cause; the treelessness may be the result of a complex situation which may vary from place to place. Factors suggested may be classified as natural or artificial. Among the natural have been listed climatic, edaphic (soil), topographic, biotic and pyric (fire).&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1973), "Allegheny Flyback at Dahle Sods", ''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]]'', 29 July; Reprinted in the same author's 1975 book ''The Wondrous Year: West Virginia Through the Seasons'', [[Grantsville, West Virginia]]: [[Seneca Books]], pp 87-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominant grass is [[Danthonia compressa|Allegheny flyback]] (''Danthonia compressa''), a grass so light in weight that it would "fly back" against the scythe of the mower.&lt;ref&gt;Core, Earl L. (1974), ''The Monongalia Story: A Bicentennial History, Vol. I: Prelude'', [[Parsons, W.Va.]]: [[McClain Printing Co.]], pp 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In line citation|date=April 2017}}[[Image:Solfege Ireland.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Solfège table in an Irish classroom]]

'''Tonic sol-fa''' (or '''tonic sol-fah''') is a pedagogical technique for teaching sight-singing, invented by [[Sarah Ann Glover]] (1785–1867) of Norwich, England and popularised by [[John Curwen]] who adapted it from a number of earlier musical systems. It uses a system of musical notation based on movable do [[solfège]], whereby every tone is given a name according to its relationship with other tones in the key: the usual staff notation is replaced with anglicized solfège syllables (e.g. ''do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do'') or their abbreviations (''d, r, m, f, s, l, t, d''). "''Do''" is chosen to be the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of whatever key is being used (thus the terminology ''moveable Do''). The original solfège sequence started with "Ut" which later became "Do".

==Overview==
Glover developed her method in Norwich from 1812 resulting in the "Norwich Sol-fa Ladder" which she used to teach children to sing. She published her work in the ''Manual of the Norwich Sol-fa System'' (1845) and ''Tetrachordal System'' (1850) &lt;ref&gt;Harris, Clement Antrobus. "The War between the Fixed and Movable Doh." The Musical Quarterly 4, no. 2 (1918): 184-95. https://www.jstor.org/stable/738052.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curwen was commissioned by a conference of [[Sunday school]] teachers in 1841 to find and promote a 
way of teaching music for Sunday school singing. He took elements of the Norwich Sol-fa and other techniques later adding hand signals. It was intended that his method could teach singing initially from the Sol-fa and then a transition to [[staff notation]].

Curwen brought out his ''Grammar of Vocal Music'' in 1843, and in 1853 started the Tonic Sol-Fa Association. The ''Standard Course of Lessons on the Tonic Sol-fa Method of Teaching to Sing'' was published in 1858.

In 1872, Curwen changed his former course of using the Sol-fa system as an aid to sight reading, when that edition of his ''Standard Course of Lessons'' excluded the staff and relied solely on Tonic Sol-fa.

In 1879 the Tonic Sol-Fa College was opened. Curwen also began publishing, and brought out a periodical called the ''Tonic Sol-fa Reporter and Magazine of Vocal Music for the People'', and in his later life was occupied in directing the spreading organisation of his system. The Sol-fa system was widely adopted for use in education, as an easily teachable method in the reading of music at sight, but its more ambitious aims for providing a superior method of musical notation have not been generally adopted.

By the end of the nineteenth century, this notation was very widespread in Britain, and it became standard practice to sell sheet music (for popular songs) with the tonic sol-fa notation included.

Some of the roots of ''tonic sol-fa'' may be found in items such as
* the use of syllables in the 11th century by the monk [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido de Arezzo]]
* the cipher notation proposed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in France in 1746,
* its further development by [[Pierre Galin]] and popularization by [[Aimé Paris]] and [[Emile Chevé]], and
* the ''Norwich sol-fa'' of [[Sarah Ann Glover]] of England. Reverend [[John Curwen]] (1816–1880) was instrumental in the development of tonic sol-fa in England, and was chiefly responsible for its popularity. [[Image:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfege hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]

When John Windet printed the 1594 edition of the ''Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter'', he added the initials of the six syllables of Guido (''U, R, M, F, S, L'') underneath the note. Windet explained, "...I have caused a new print of note to be made with letter to be joined to every note: whereby thou mayest know how to call every note by his right name, so that with a very little diligence thou mayest more easilie by the viewing of these letters, come to the knowledge of perfect solfeying..." Rousseau, Curwen and others would have been aware of this popular [[psalter]].

[[Benjamin Carl Unseld|B. C. Unseld]] and [[Theodore F. Seward]], with Biglow and Main publishers, imported Curwen's ''tonic sol-fa'' to the United States, though the method was never widely received. Before this, the 9th edition of the ''[[Bay Psalm Book]]'' (Boston, USA) had appeared with the initials of four-note syllables (''fa, sol, la, me'') underneath the staff. Reverend [[John Tufts (music educator)|John Tufts]], in his ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes in a Plaine &amp; Easy Method'', moved the initials of the four-note syllables onto the staff in place of "regular notes", and indicated rhythm by punctuation marks to the right of the letters. These may be considered American forerunners of Curwen's system, though he may not have been aware of them. Tufts' ''Introduction'' was popular, going through several editions. Nevertheless, his work probably did more to pave the way for [[shape note]]s. When Unseld and Steward introduced tonic sol-fa in the late 1800s, it was considered "something new".

In 1972 [[Roberto Goitre]] printed one of the most important modern versions of the method in ''Cantar Leggendo'' with the ''moveable Do''.

[[Solmization]] that represents the functions of pitches (such as tonic sol-fa) is called "functional" solmization.  All musicians that use functional solmization use "do" to represent the tonic (also known as the "keynote") in the major mode.  However, approaches to the minor mode fall into two camps.  Some musicians use "do" to represent the tonic in minor (a parallel approach), whereas others prefer to label the tonic in minor as "la" (a relative approach)  Both systems have their advantages: The former system more directly represents the scale-degree functions of the pitches in a key; the latter more directly represents the intervals between pitches in any given key signature.

==Notation==
In Curwen's system, the notes of the major scale (of any [[key (music)|key]]) are notated with the single letters d, r, m, f, s, l, and t. For notes above the principal octave, an [[apostrophe]] follows the letter; notes below the principal octave have a subscript mark. [[Chromaticism|Chromatic]] alterations are marked by the following vowel, "e" for [[sharp (music)|sharp]] (pronounced "ee") and "a" for [[flat (music)|flat]] (pronounced "aw").&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Tonic sol-fa|author=Bernarr Rainbow and Charles Edward McGuire|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ascending and descending [[chromatic scale]] is notated:
 d de r re m f fe s se l le t d'
 d' t ta l la s sa f m ma r ra d

Such chromatic notes appear only as [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] or as preparation for a [[modulation (music)|modulation]]; once the music has modulated, then the names for the new key are used. The modulation itself is marked by [[superscript]] of the old note name preceding its new name; for example, in modulation to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the new tonic is notated as &lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;d. The music then proceeds in the new key until another modulation is notated.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Minor keys use l (la) as the tonic. The ascending sixth scale degree in [[melodic minor]] is noted as ba (pronounced "bay") instead of fe, which is reserved for the sharp f of the major scale.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Rhythms are notated with [[bar line]]s (used as in [[staff notation]]) and colons designating beats within the measure. [[Time signature]]s and [[rest (music)|rests]] are not used.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

== Examples ==
* The beginning of the "Conversation" towards the end of the [[Steven Spielberg]] motion picture ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' uses both verbal and hand signals.

The '''Wyss&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced {{IPAc-en|v|iː|s}} "veese".&lt;/ref&gt; Center''' is a not-for-profit [[neurotechnology]] research foundation in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Frédéric Lelièvre and Dejan Nikolic, "Doté de 100 millions, le Centre Wyss de Genève recevra d'autres fonds en fonction de ses résultats", ''[[Le Temps]]'', 15 June 2013, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center is part of the [[Campus Biotech]] (in the former [[Merck Serono]] building) located in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The Director of the Wyss Center, neuroscientist Professor [[John Donoghue (neuroscientist)|John P. Donoghue]], is best known for his work on human brain computer interfaces and brain function and plasticity.

The institute was founded by [[Hansjörg Wyss]], who previously created the [[Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering]] in the [[United States]].

The mission &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|URL=http://www.wysscenter.ch/en/about-us/}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Wyss Center is to accelerate the development of neurotechnology for human benefit.

The Wyss Center provides neurotechnology specialists, technical facilities and financial resources to develop clinical solutions from neuroscience research.

A second generation brain computer interface (BCI), that can read the minds of people with paralysis to directly trigger movement in paralyzed limbs through thought, is under development at the Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3543797/People-paralysed-neck-able-walk-20-years-time-thanks-mind-power-wi-fi-expert-based-Switzerland-claims.html|title=People paralysed from neck down will be able to walk in 20 years' time|website=Mail Online|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
