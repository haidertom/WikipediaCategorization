'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes action as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. my wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Active redundancy''' is a design concept that increases [[operational availability]] and that reduces [[operating cost]] by automating most critical maintenance actions.

This concept is related to [[condition-based maintenance]] and [[fault reporting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|title=Opnav Instruction 4790.16: Condition Based Maintenance|publisher=US Navy Operations|access-date=2012-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215134909/http://doni.daps.dla.mil/OPNAV.aspx|archive-date=2013-02-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The initial requirement began with military combat systems during World War I. The approach used for survivability was to install thick armor plate to resist gun fire and install multiple guns.

This became unaffordable and impractical during the Cold War when aircraft and missile systems became common.

The new approach was to build distributed systems that continue to work when components are damaged. This depends upon very crude forms of artificial intelligence that perform reconfiguration by obeying specific rules. An example of this approach is the [[AN/UYK-43]] computer.

Formal design philosophies involving active redundancy are required for critical systems where corrective labor is undesirable or impractical to correct failure during normal operation.

Commercial aircraft are required to have multiple redundant computing systems, hydraulic systems, and propulsion systems so that a single in-flight equipment failure will not cause loss of life.

A more recent outcome of this work is the Internet, which relies on a backbone of routers that provide the ability to automatically re-routre communication without human intervention when failures occur.

Satellites placed into orbit around the earth must include massive active redundancy to ensure operation will continue for a decade or longer despite failures induced by normal failure, radiation-induced failure, and thermal shock.

This strategy now dominates space systems, aircraft, and missile systems.

== Principle ==

Maintenance requires three actions, which usually involve down time and high priority labor costs:
* Automatic fault detection
* Automatic fault isolation
* Automatic reconfiguration

Active redundancy eliminates down time and reduces manpower requirements by automating all three actions. This requires some amount of automated [[artificial intelligence]].

''N'' stands for needed equipment. The amount of excess capacity affects overall system reliability by limiting the effects of failure.

For example, if it takes two generators to power a city, then "N+1" would be three generators to allow a single failure. Similarly, "N+2" would be four generators, which would allow one generator to fail while a second generator has already failed.

Active redundancy improves [[operational availability]] as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N} = 0.99 \ Up \ Time&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 90 \ hour/year&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N+1} = 1 - \left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \right) = 0.9999  \ Up \ Time &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 50 \ minutes/year&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{o}^{N+2} = 1 - \left( (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} )  \times (1 - A_{o}^{N} ) \right) = 0.999999  \ Up \ Time &lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt;\approx failed \ 30 \ seconds/year &lt;/math&gt;

===Passive components===

Active redundancy in passive components requires redundant components that share the burden when failure occurs, like in cabling and piping. 

This allows forces to be redistributed across a bridge to prevent failure if a vehicle ruptures a cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=2716|title=Bridge System Safety and Redundancy|publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This allows water flow to be redistributed through pipes when a limited number of valves are shut or pumps shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/water/PresentDay_water.asp|title=Water Systems|publisher=Boston Water and Sewer Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active components===

Active redundancy in active components requires reconfiguration when failure occurs. Computer programming must recognize the failure and automatically reconfigure to restore operation. 

All modern computers provide the following when an existing feature is enabled via [[fault reporting]].
* Automatic fault detection
* Automatic fault isolation

Mechanical devices must reconfigure, such as transmission settings on hybrid vehicles that have redundant propulsion systems. The petroleum engine will start up when battery power fails.

Electrical power systems must perform two actions to prevent total system failure when smaller failures occur, such as when a tree falls across a power line. Power systems incorporate communication, switching, and automatic scheduling that allows these actions to be automated.
* Shut down the damaged power line to isolate the failure
* Adjust generator settings to prevent voltage and frequency excursions

== Benefits ==

This is the only known strategy that can achieve high availability.

== Detriments ==

This maintenance philosophy requires custom development with extra components.

It is a bacterial process occurring in the presence of oxygen. Bacteria rapidly consume organic matter and convert it into [[carbon dioxide]], water and a range of lower molecular weight organic compounds. As there is no new supply of organic material from sewage, the [[activated sludge]] biota begin to die and are used as food by [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria. This stage of the process is known as ''endogenous respiration'' and it is process that reduces the solid concentration in the sludge.

==Process==
Aerobic digestion is typically used in an activated sludge treatment plant. Waste activated sludge and primary sludge are combined, where appropriate, and passed to a thickener where the solids content is increased. This substantially reduces the volume that is required to be treated in the digester.The process is usually run as a batch process with more than one digester tank in operation at any one time.&lt;ref name="creek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/solids-treatment/aerobic-digestion-of-sludge|title=Aerobic digestion of sludge|publisher=Johns Creek Environmental Campus|access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Air is pumped through the tank and the contents are stirred to keep the contents fully mixed. Carbon dioxide, waste air and small quantities of other gases including [[hydrogen sulfide]] are given off. These waste gases require treatment to reduce odours in works close to housing or capable of generating public nuisance.&lt;ref name="creek"/&gt; The digestion is continued until the percentage of degradable solids is reduced to between 20% and 10% depending on local conditions&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt; 
Where non sewage waste is being processed, organic waste such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste can be significantly reduced in volume leaving an output that can be used as soil improver or biomass fuel.

==Advantages==
Because the aerobic digestion occurs much faster than [[anaerobic digestion]], the capital costs of aerobic digestion are lower.

The process is usually run at ambient temperature and the process is much less complex than anaerobic digestion and is easier to manage.

==Disadvantages==
The operating costs are typically much greater for aerobic digestion than for anaerobic digestion because of energy used by the blowers, pumps and motors needed to add oxygen to the process. However, recent technological advances include non-electrically aerated filter systems that use natural air currents for the aeration instead of electrically operated machinery.

The digested sludge is relatively low in residual energy and although it can be dried and incinerated to produce heat, the energy yield is very much lower than that produced by anaerobic digestion

==ATADs==
Autothermal Thermophilic Aerobic Digestion (ATAD) is a [[Sewage sludge treatment|faecal sludge treatment]] design concept that uses the nutrients in the sludge and the metabolic heat of the bacteria to create high temperatures in the aerobic digester. This gradually shifts the microbial community towards [[Thermophile|termophilic]] at temperatures typically at 55 degree Celsius or above. While the higher aeration requirements of ATADs further increase energy use and potential smell nuisance, the increased temperature makes the resulting [[biosolids]] much safer for re-use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layden|first1=Noreen M.|title=Autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) — Part I: Review of origins, design, and process operation|journal=Journal of Environmental Engineering and Science|date=November 2007|volume= 6|issue= 6|doi=10.1139/S07-015|url=http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/10.1139/S07-015|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}
An '''assault''' is the act of inflicting physical harm or unwanted physical contact upon a person or, in some specific legal definitions, a threat or attempt to commit such an action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/assault-and-battery-overview.html|title=Assault and Battery Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=criminal.findlaw.com|publisher=|access-date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is both a [[crime]] and a [[tort]] and, therefore, may result in either criminal and/or civil liability. Generally, the common law definition is the same in criminal and [[Assault (tort)|tort law]]. 

Traditionally, [[common law]] legal systems had separate definitions for assault and '''[[Battery (crime)|battery]]'''. When this distinction is observed, battery refers to the actual bodily contact, whereas assault refers to a credible threat or attempt to cause battery. Some jurisdictions combined the two offences into '''assault and battery''', which then became widely referred to as "assault". The result is that in many of these jurisdictions, assault has taken on a definition that is more in line with the traditional definition of battery. The legal systems of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Scots law]] have never distinguished assault from battery.

Legal systems generally acknowledge that assaults can vary greatly in severity. In the [[United States]], an assault can be charged as either a [[misdemeanor]] or a [[felony]]. In [[England and Wales]] and [[Australia]], it can be charged as either [[common assault]], [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) or [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH). [[Canada]] also has a three-tier system: assault, [[assault causing bodily harm]] and [[aggravated assault]]. Separate charges typically exist for [[sexual assault]]s, [[affray]] and [[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty|assaulting a police officer]]. Assault may overlap with an [[attempt]]ed crime; for example an assault may be charged as an [[attempted murder]] if it was done with intent to kill.

==Related definitions==

===Battery===
In jurisdictions that make a distinction between the two, assault usually accompanies [[Battery (crime)|battery]] if the assailant both threatens to make unwanted contact and then carries through with this threat. See [[common assault]]. The elements of battery are (1) a volitional act&lt;ref&gt;An act is volitional if it is purposeful and deliberate as opposed to reflexive or involuntary (see Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams, ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2012) at p 901. For example. a person who has restless leg syndrome kicks his wife while asleep. The contact, although, harmful, would not constitute battery because the act was not wilful.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) done for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact with another person or under circumstances that make such contact substantially certain to occur and (3) which causes such contact.&lt;ref&gt;A criminal battery may also be committed if the harmful or offensive contact is due to the criminal negligence of the defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus throwing a rock at someone for the purpose of hitting them is a battery if the rock in fact strikes the person, and is an assault if the rock misses.

===Aggravated assault===
[[Aggravation (legal concept)|Aggravated]] assault is, in some jurisdictions, a stronger form of assault, usually using a [[deadly weapon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime in the United States 2010: Aggravated Assault |work=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/aggravatedassaultmain}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person has committed an aggravated assault when that person attempts to:
* cause serious bodily injury to another person with a deadly weapon&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Dennis|last2=William|first2=Glanville|title=Textbook of Criminal Law|publisher=London, Sweet &amp; Maxwell|chapter=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have sexual relations with a person who is under the age of consent
* cause bodily harm by recklessly operating a [[motor vehicle]] during [[road rage]]; often referred to as either '''vehicular assault''' or '''aggravated assault with a motor vehicle.'''

Aggravated assault can also be charged in cases of attempted harm against police officers or other public servants.

==Defenses==
Although the range and precise application of defenses varies between jurisdictions, the following represents a list of the defenses that may apply to all levels of assault:

===Consent===
Exceptions exist to cover unsolicited physical contact which amount to normal social behavior known as [[de minimis]] harm. Assault can also be considered in cases involving the spitting on, or unwanted exposure of bodily fluids to others.

[[consent (criminal law)|Consent]] may be a complete or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, it is not a defense where the degree of injury is severe, as long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault.&lt;ref&gt;(RvG ref 6. 1980): see{{cite web|url=http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non+Fatal+Assaults/Consent+R+v+Brown.htm |title=R v Brown (1993) 2 All ER 75 |accessdate=2009-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016125514/http://lawteacher.net/Criminal/Non%20Fatal%20Assaults/Consent%20R%20v%20Brown.htm |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic sexual activity]], the most notable case being the [[Operation Spanner]] case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game ([[mixed martial arts]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], or [[contact sports]]), bodily adornment (''R v Wilson'' [1996] Crim LR 573), or horseplay (''R v Jones'' [1987] Crim LR 123). However, any activity outside the rules of the game is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish law, consent is not a defense for assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotHC/1975/1975_JC_30.html|title=''Smart v. H. M. Advocate'', [1975&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ScotHC HCJ_1, 1975 SLT 65, 1975 JC 30.|author=|date=|website=bailii.org|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and other official acts===
[[Police officers]] and court officials have a general power to use force for the purpose of performing an [[arrest]] or generally carrying out their official duties. Thus, a court officer taking possession of goods under a court order may use force if reasonably necessary.

===Punishment===
In some jurisdictions such as [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[judicial corporal punishment]] is part of the [[legal system]]. The officers who administer the punishment have [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]] from prosecution for assault.

In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, [[Corporal punishment in the home#Where corporal punishment in the home is lawful|corporal punishment administered to children by their parent or legal guardian]] is not legally considered to be assault unless it is deemed to be excessive or unreasonable. What constitutes "reasonable" varies in both statutory law and [[case law]]. Unreasonable physical punishment may be charged as assault or under a separate statute for [[child abuse]].

Many countries, including some US states, also permit the use of corporal punishment for [[School corporal punishment|children in school]]. In [[English law]], s.&amp;nbsp;58 [[Children Act 2004]] limits the availability of the lawful correction defense to common assault under s.&amp;nbsp;39 [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

===Prevention of crime===
This may or may not involve self-defense in that, using a reasonable degree of force to prevent another from committing a crime could involve preventing an assault, but it could be preventing a crime not involving the use of personal violence.

===Defense of property===
Some jurisdictions allow force to be used in [[Defence of property|defense of property]], to prevent damage either in its own right, or under one or both of the preceding classes of defense in that a threat or attempt to damage property might be considered a crime (in English law, under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] it may be argued that the defendant has a ''lawful excuse'' to damaging property during the defense and a defense under s3 [[Criminal Law Act 1967]]) subject to the need to deter [[vigilante]]s and excessive self-help. Furthermore, some jurisdictions, such as Ohio, allow residents in their homes to use force when ejecting an intruder. The resident merely needs to assert to the court that they felt threatened by the intruder's presence.

This defense is not universal: in New Zealand (for example) homeowners have been convicted of assault for attacking burglars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Regional details==

===Canada===
Assault is an offence under s. 265 of the  Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=1985-46&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |title=CanLII - Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 |publisher= |accessdate=10 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430001252/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html |archivedate=30 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide range of the types of assault that can occur. Generally, an assault occurs when a person directly or indirectly applies force intentionally to another person without their consent. It can also occur when a person attempts to apply such force, or threatens to do so, without the consent of the other person. An injury need not occur for an assault to be committed, but the force used in the assault must be offensive in nature with an intention to apply force. It can be an assault to "tap", "pinch", "push", or direct another such minor action toward another, but an accidental application of force is not an assault.

The potential punishment for an assault in Canada varies depending on the manner in which the charge proceeds through the court system and the type of assault that is committed. The Criminal Code defines assault as a dual offence (indictable or summary offence). Police officers can arrest someone without a warrant for an assault if it is in the public's interest to do so notwithstanding S.495(2)(d) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt; This public interest is usually satisfied by preventing a continuation or repetition of the offence on the same victim.

Some variations on the ordinary crime of assault include:

* Assault: The offence is defined by section 265 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault with a weapon: Section 267(a) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assault causing bodily harm: See [[assault causing bodily harm]] Section 267(b) of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated assault: Section 268 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Assaulting a peace officer, etc.: Section 270 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault: Section 271 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Sexual assault with a weapon or threats or causing bodily harm: Section 272 of the Code.&lt;ref name=1985-46/&gt;
* Aggravated sexual assault: See [[aggravated sexual assault]].

An individual cannot consent to an assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, or any sexual assault. Consent will also be vitiated if two people consent to fight but serious bodily harm is intended and caused (R v Paice; R v Jobidon). A person cannot consent to serious bodily harm.

===India===
The Indian Penal Code covers the punishments and types of assault in Chapter 16,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/ipc/chapter_16.php#s351|title=Indian Penal Code Chapter XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; sections 351 through 358.
{{Quotation|Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault.|s.351 of the Indian Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|title=Vakil No1.com - "Indian Penal Code"|accessdate=2 Mar 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205035155/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S351.htm|archive-date=5 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Code further explains that "mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give to their gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault". Assault is in Indian criminal law an attempt to use criminal force (with criminal force being described in s.350). The attempt itself has been made an offence in India, as in other states.

===Nigeria===
The Criminal Code Act (chapter 29 of Part V; sections 351 to 365) creates a number of offences of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2029|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault is defined by section 252 of that Act. Assault is a misdemeanor punishable by one year imprisonment; assault with "intent to have carnal knowledge of him or her" or who indecently assaults another, or who commits other more-serious variants of assault (as defined in the Act) are guilty of a felony, and longer prison terms are provided for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/Criminal%20Code%20Act-PartV.htm#Chapter%2025|title=Criminal Code Act-PartV|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Islands===
'''Marshall Islands'''

The offence of assault is created by section 113 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ Criminal Code [31 MIRC Ch 1&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413025838/http://www.paclii.org/mh/legis/consol_act/cc94/ |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person is guilty of this offence if they unlawfully offer or attempt, with force or violence, to strike, beat, wound, or do bodily harm to, another.

===Republic of Ireland===
Section 2 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]] creates the offence of assault, and section 3 of that Act creates the offence of [[assault causing harm]].

===South Africa===
[[South African law]] does not draw the distinction between assault and battery. ''Assault'' is a [[common law crime]] defined as "unlawfully and intentionally applying force to the person of another, or inspiring a belief in that other that force is immediately to be applied to him". The law also recognises the crime of ''assault with intent to cause [[grievous bodily harm]]'', where grievous bodily harm is defined as "harm which in itself is such as seriously to interfere with health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Milton |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Co |year=1996 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=405–437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common law crime of ''[[indecent assault]]'' was repealed by the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]], and replaced by a statutory crime of ''[[sexual assault]]''.

It related to officers of the [[Serious Organized Crime Agency]] and was repealed when that agency was abolished.

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Battery (crime)#England and Wales}}

English law provides for two offences of assault: [[common assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]]. Assault (or common assault) is committed if one intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful personal violence. ''Violence'' in this context means any unlawful touching, though there is some debate over whether the touching must also be hostile. Confusingly, the terms "assault" and "common assault" often encompass the separate offence of [[battery (crime)|battery]], even in statutory settings such as s 40(3)(a) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].

A [[common assault]] is an assault that lacks any of the aggravating features which Parliament has deemed serious enough to deserve a higher penalty. Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that common assault, like battery, is triable only in the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in England and Wales (unless it is linked to a more serious offence, which is triable in the [[Crown Court]]). Additionally, if a Defendant has been charged on an indictment with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH), or racially/religiously aggravated assault, then a jury in the Crown Court may acquit the Defendant of the more serious offence, but still convict of common assault if it finds common assault has been committed.

=====Aggravated assaults=====
An assault which is aggravated by the scale of the injuries inflicted may be charged as offences causing "actual bodily harm" (ABH) or, in the severest cases, "[[grievous bodily harm]]" (GBH).
;[[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]]: The offence of is created by section 47 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Inflicting [[grievous bodily harm]]: Also referred to as "malicious wounding" or "unlawful wounding". This offence is created by section 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.
;Causing grievous bodily harm with intent: Also referred to as "wounding with intent". This offence is created by section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861.

Other aggravated assault charges refer to assaults carried out against a specific target or with a specific intent:
;Assault with intent to rob: The penalty for [[assault with intent to rob]], a common law offence, is provided by section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated common assault: This offence is created by section 29(1)(c) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Racially or religiously aggravated assault occasioning actual bodily harm: This offence is created by section 29(1)(b) of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]].
;Assault with intent to resist arrest: The offence of [[assault with intent to resist arrest]] is created by section 38 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;[[Assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]: Section 89(1) of the [[Police Act 1996]] provides that it is an offence for a person to assault either:
:*a [[constable]] acting in the execution of his duty; or
:*a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.
;Assaulting a traffic officer: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/18/section/10 section 10(1)] of the [[Traffic Management Act 2004]].
;Assaulting a person designated or accredited under sections 38 or 39 or 41 or 41A of the Police Reform Act 2002: This offence is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/30/section/46 section 46(1)] of the [[Police Reform Act 2002]]. Those sections relate respectively to persons given police powers by a chief police officer, detention contractors retained by police, accredited contractors under a community safety accreditation scheme, and weights and measures inspectors.
;Assault on a prison custody officer: This offence is created by section 90(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]] (c.53).
;Assault on a secure training centre custody officer: This offence is created by section 13(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] (c.33).
;Assault on officer saving wreck: This offence is created by section 37 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].
;Assaulting an officer of the court: This offence is created by section 14(1)(b) of the [[County Courts Act 1984]].
;Cruelty to persons under sixteen: Section 1(1) of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] provides that it is an offence for a person who has attained the age of sixteen years, and who has responsibility for a child or young person under that age, to, amongst other things, wilfully assault that child or young person, or to cause or procure that child or young person to be assaulted, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.
;Sexual assault: The offence of [[Sexual assault#England and Wales|sexual assault]] created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. It is not defined in terms of the offences of common assault or battery. It instead requires intentional touching and the absence of a reasonable belief in consent.

====Scotland====
In [[Scots Law]], assault is defined as an "attack upon the person of another".&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, ''Criminal Law'' (5th edn, 1948) p.155&lt;/ref&gt; There is no distinction made in Scotland between assault and battery (which is not a term used in Scots law), although, as in England and Wales, assault can be occasioned without a ''physical'' attack on another's person, as demonstrated in ''Atkinson v. [[Lord Advocate|HM Advocate]]''&lt;ref&gt;1987 SCCR 534&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the accused was found guilty of assaulting a shop assistant by simply jumping over a counter wearing a [[ski mask]]. The court said:

{{quote|[A]n assault may be constituted by threatening gestures sufficient to produce alarm|Atkinson v. HM Advocate (1987)}}

Scottish law also provides for a more serious charge of aggravated assault on the basis of such factors as severity of injury, the use of a weapon, or ''Hamesuken'' (to assault a person in their own home). The ''[[mens rea]]'' for assault is simply "evil intent",&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, op. cit, p.155; Smart v. HM Advocate 1975 JC 30&lt;/ref&gt; although this has been held to mean no more than that assault "cannot be committed accidentally or recklessly or negligently" as upheld in ''[[Lord Advocate's Reference]] No 2 of 1992'' where it was found that a "hold-up" in a shop justified as a joke would still constitute an offence.

It is a separate offence to assault on a constable in the execution of their duty, under  Section 90, Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (previously Section 41 of the [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]]) which provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of their duty or a person assisting a constable in the execution of their duty.

====Northern Ireland====
Several offences of assault exist in Northern Ireland. The [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]] creates the offences of:
* Common assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 42;
* Aggravated assault and battery: a summary offence, under section 43
* Common assault: under section 47
* Assault occasioning actual bodily harm: under section 47
The [[Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968]] creates the offences of:
* Assault with intent to resist arrest: under section 7(1)(b); this offence was formerly created by s.38 of the OAPA 1861.

That Act formerly created the offence of 'Assault on a constable in the execution of his duty'. under section 7(1)(a), but that section has been superseded by section 66(1) of the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998]] (c.32) which now provides that it is an offence for a person to, amongst other things, assault a constable in the execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the execution of his duty.

=== Australia ===
The term 'assault', when used in legislation, commonly refers to both common assault and battery, even though the two offences remain distinct. Common assault involves intentionally or recklessly causing a person to apprehend the imminent infliction of unlawful force, whilst battery refers to the actual infliction of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|431|2004|litigants=Darby v DPP |parallelcite=(2004) 61 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 558 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each state has legislation relating to the act of assault, and offences against the act that constitute assault are heard in the Magistrates Court of that state or indictable offences are heard in a District or Supreme Court of that State. The legislation that defines assault of each state outline what the elements are that make up the assault, where the assault is sectioned in legislation or criminal codes, and the penalties that apply for the offence of assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.findlaw.com.au/articles/4274/assault-laws-in-australia-definitions-and-defences.aspx|title=Assault Laws in Australia: Definitions and Defences|website=www.findlaw.com.au|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, the Crimes Act 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defines a range of assault offences deemed more serious than common assault and which attract heavier penalties. These include:

====Assault with further specific intent====
* Acts done to the person with intent to murder&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wounding or grievous bodily harm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use or possession of a weapon to resist arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|33B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States,{{where|date=September 2018}}&lt;!-- federal? some states? all states and territories? including Louisiana which did not incorporate English common law? --&gt; assault may be defined as an attempt to commit a [[battery (crime)|battery]]. However, the crime of assault can encompass acts in which no battery is intended, but the defendant's act nonetheless creates reasonable fear in others that a battery will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What are the Crimes of Assault and Battery|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/assault-and-battery|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault is typically treated as a [[misdemeanor]] and not as a [[felony]] (unless the victim is a [[Police|law enforcement]] officer){{fact|date=September 2018}}, or in New York State for example if the offender is a repeat offender. As a misdemeanor, however, it can still result in incarceration and in a criminal record. The more serious crime of aggravated assault is treated as a felony.

Four elements were required at [[common law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atoki|first1=Morayo|title=Assault and S 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861|journal=The Journal of Criminal Law|date=1995|volume=59|issue=3|page=301|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002201839505900307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The apparent, present ability to carry out;
# An unlawful attempt;
# To commit a violent injury; 
# Upon another.

Simple assault can be distinguished without the intent of injury upon another person. The violation of one's personal space or touching in a way the victim deemed inappropriate can be simple assault. In common law states an assault is not committed by merely, for example, swearing at another; without threat of battery, there can be no assault.

As the criminal law evolved, element one was weakened in most jurisdictions so that a reasonable fear of bodily injury would suffice. These four elements were eventually codified in most states.

Laws on assault vary by state. Since each state has its own criminal laws, there is no universal assault law. Acts classified as assault in one state may be classified as [[Battery (crime)|battery]], [[menacing]], [[intimidation]], [[reckless endangerment]], etc. in another state. Modern American statutes may define assault as including:
* an attempt to cause or purposely, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury to another 
* [[negligently]] causing bodily injury to another with a dangerous weapon (assault with a deadly weapon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legis.state.sd.us/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&amp;Statute=22-18-1|title=South Dakota Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws on assault differ significantly from state to state as demonstrated below.

In [[Kansas]] the law on assault states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |title=KS Statutes: Ch 21 Article 34: Crimes Against Persons |date=2007-11-14 |access-date=2016-09-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114225316/http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_21/Article_34/ |archivedate=14 November 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Assault is intentionally placing another person in reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.}}

In [[New York State]], assault (as defined in the New York State Penal Code Article 120)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/120.05|title=Article 120 - NY Penal Law - Assault Menacing Stalking - Law|publisher=New York State Senate|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires an actual injury. Other states define this as battery; there is no crime of battery in New York. However, in New York if a person threatens another person with imminent injury without engaging in physical contact, that is called "menacing". A person who engages in that behavior is guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree (a [[misdemeanor|Class A misdemeanor]]; punishable with up to one year [[incarceration]], [[probation]] for an extended time, and a permanent [[criminal record]]) when they threaten to cause physical harm to another person, and guilty of aggravated harassment in the first degree (a [[Class E felony]]) if they have a previous conviction for the same offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-30.html|title=New York Consolidated Laws, Penal Law - PEN § 240.30 - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-harassment-laws.html|title=New York Harassment Laws - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=findlaw.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/06/opinion/when-is-a-threat-a-criminal-act.html|title=Opinion - When Is a Threat a Criminal Act?|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.new-york-lawyers.org/second-degree-aggravated-harassment.html|title=Second Degree Aggravated Harassment|author=|date=|website=The Law Office of Crotty &amp; Saland|accessdate=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York also has specific laws against [[hazing]], when such threats are made as requirement to join an organization.

[[North Dakota]] law states:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t12-1c17.pdf?20130902151232|title=North Dakota Century Code t12.1c17|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tennessee]] assault is defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/|title=LexisNexis® Custom Solution: Tennessee Code Research Tool|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States vary on whether it is possible to commit an "attempted assault" since it can be considered a double [[inchoate offense]].

In some states, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a complete defense to assault. In other jurisdictions, mutual consent is an incomplete defense, with the result that the misdemeanor is treated as a ''petty misdemeanor''.

Furthermore, the crime of assault generally requires that both the perpetrator and the victim of an assault be human. Thus, there is no assault if an ox gores a man. However, the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act|Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2004]] treats the [[fetus]] as a separate person for the purposes of assault and other violent crimes, under certain limited circumstances. See [http://www.nrlc.org/uploads/unbornvictims/UVVAEnrolled.pdf H.R. 1997 / P.L. 108-212].

Some possible examples of defenses, mitigating circumstances, or failures of proof are:
* A defendant could argue that since they were drunk, they could not form the [[specific intent]] to commit assault. This defense would most likely fail, however, since only involuntary [[intoxication defense|intoxication]] is accepted as a defense in most American jurisdictions.
* A defendant could also argue that they were engaged in mutually consensual behavior.

===Ancient Greece===
Assault in Ancient Greece was normally termed [[hubris]]. Contrary to modern usage, the term did not have the extended connotation of overweening [[pride]], self-confidence or arrogance, often resulting in fatal retribution. In Ancient Greece, "hubris" referred to actions which, intentionally or not, shamed and humiliated the victim, and frequently the perpetrator as well. It was most evident in the public and private actions of the powerful and rich.

Violations of the law against hubris included, what would today be termed, assault and battery; sexual crimes ranging from forcible rape of women or children to consensual but improper activities; or the theft of public or sacred property.&lt;ref&gt;MacDowell (1976) p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Two well-known cases are found in the speeches of [[Demosthenes]], a prominent statesman and orator in ancient [[Greece]]. These two examples occurred when first, Meidias punched Demosthenes in the face in the theater (Against Meidias), and second when (in Against Konon) a defendant allegedly assaulted a man and crowed over the victim.

Hubris, though not specifically defined, was a legal term and was considered a crime in classical Athens. It was also considered the greatest sin of the ancient Greek world. That was so because it not only was proof of excessive pride, but also resulted in violent acts by or to those involved. The category of acts constituting hubris for the ancient Greeks apparently broadened from the original specific reference to mutilation of a corpse, or a humiliation of a defeated foe, or irreverent, "outrageous treatment", in general.

The meaning was eventually further generalized in its modern English usage to apply to any outrageous act or exhibition of pride or disregard for basic moral laws. Such an act may be referred to as an "act of hubris", or the person committing the act may be said to be hubristic. [[Atë]], Greek for 'ruin, folly, delusion', is the action performed by the hero, usually because of their hubris, or great pride, that leads to their death or downfall.

Crucial to this definition are the ancient Greek concepts of honor (timē) and shame. The concept of timē included not only the exaltation of the one receiving honor, but also the shaming of the one overcome by the act of hubris. This concept of honor is akin to a [[zero-sum]] game. [[Rush Rehm]] simplifies this definition to the contemporary concept of "insolence, contempt, and excessive violence".

In [[linear algebra]], the '''characteristic polynomial''' of a [[square matrix]] is a [[polynomial]] which is invariant under [[matrix similarity]] and has the [[eigenvalues]] as [[root of a polynomial|roots]]. It has the [[determinant]] and the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix as coefficients. The '''characteristic polynomial''' of an [[endomorphism]] of [[vector space]]s of finite dimension is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of the endomorphism over any base; it does not depend on the choice of a basis. The '''characteristic equation''' is the equation obtained by equating to zero the characteristic polynomial.

The '''characteristic polynomial of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is the characteristic polynomial of its [[adjacency matrix]]. It is a [[graph invariant]], though it is not complete: the smallest pair of non-isomorphic graphs with the same characteristic polynomial have five [[Vertex (graph theory)|nodes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = Characteristic Polynomial of a Graph – Wolfram MathWorld
|accessdate = August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

Given a square matrix ''A'', we want to find a polynomial whose zeros are the eigenvalues of ''A''.  For a [[diagonal matrix]] ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is easy to define: if the diagonal entries are ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc. then the characteristic polynomial will be:

:&lt;math&gt;(t-a_1)(t-a_2)(t-a_3)\cdots.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This works because the diagonal entries are also the eigenvalues of this matrix.

For a general matrix ''A'', one can proceed as follows. A scalar  ''λ''  is an eigenvalue of ''A'' if and only if there is an [[eigenvector]] '''v'''  ≠  0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v},\,&lt;/math&gt;
or 
:&lt;math&gt;(\lambda I - A)\mathbf{v} = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where '''''I'''''  is the [[identity matrix]]). Since '''v''' is non-zero, this means that the matrix ''λ'' '''''I'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'' is [[singular matrix|singular]] (non-invertible), which in turn means that its [[determinant]] is 0.  Thus the roots of the function det(''λ''&amp;nbsp;'''''I'''''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'') are the eigenvalues of ''A'', and it is clear that this determinant is a polynomial in ''λ''.

==Formal definition==

We consider  an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix ''A''. The characteristic polynomial of ''A'', denoted by ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''), is the polynomial defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced linear algebra |author=Steven Roman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWUPAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA137 |isbn=3540978372 |edition=2 |year=1992 |publisher=Springer |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_A(t) = \det \left(tI - A\right)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' denotes the ''n''-by-''n'' [[identity matrix]].

Some authors define the characteristic polynomial to be det(''A''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;''I''). That polynomial differs from the one defined here by a sign (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so it makes no difference for properties like having as roots the eigenvalues of ''A''; however the current definition always gives a [[monic polynomial]], whereas the alternative definition is monic only when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even.

==Examples==
Suppose we want to compute the characteristic polynomial of the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}
2 &amp; 1\\
-1&amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We now compute the [[determinant]] of
:&lt;math&gt;t I-A = \begin{pmatrix}
t-2&amp;-1\\
1&amp;t-0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; 
which is &lt;math&gt;(t-2)t - 1(-1) = t^2-2t+1 \,\!,&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.

Another example uses [[hyperbolic function]]s of a [[hyperbolic angle]] &amp;phi;.
For the matrix take
:&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} \cosh(\varphi) &amp; \sinh(\varphi)\\ \sinh(\varphi)&amp; \cosh(\varphi) \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
Its characteristic polynomial is
:&lt;math&gt;\det (tI - A) = (t - \cosh(\varphi))^2 - \sinh^2(\varphi) = t^2 - 2 t \ \cosh(\varphi) + 1 = (t - e^\varphi) (t - e^{-\varphi}).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

The polynomial ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is monic (its leading coefficient is 1) and its degree is ''n''.  The most important fact about the characteristic polynomial was already mentioned in the motivational paragraph: the eigenvalues of ''A'' are precisely the [[root of a function|root]]s of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') (this also holds for the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'', but its degree may be less than ''n'').  The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are all [[polynomial expression]]s in the entries of the matrix. In particular its constant coefficient ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(0)&amp;nbsp; is det(&amp;minus;''A'') = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; det(''A''), the coefficient of {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}  is one, and the coefficient of {{math|''t''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is tr(&amp;minus;''A'') = &amp;minus;tr(''A''), where {{math|tr(''A'')}} is the matrix [[trace (matrix)|trace]] of&amp;nbsp;''A''. (The signs given here correspond to the formal definition given in the previous section;&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 28 in these [http://users.math.yale.edu/~tl292/teaching/math225/notes/week10.pdf lecture notes]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the alternative definition these would instead be det(''A'') and (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 &lt;/sup&gt;tr(''A'') respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 4 in these [http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/resource/general/115a.3.02f/week8.pdf lecture notes]&lt;/ref&gt;)

For a 2&amp;times;2 matrix ''A'', the characteristic polynomial is thus given by
: &lt;math&gt; t^2 - \operatorname{tr}(A) t + \det(A). &lt;/math&gt;

Using the language of [[exterior algebra]], one may compactly express the characteristic polynomial of an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix ''A'' as 
: &lt;math&gt; p_A (t) = \sum_{k=0}^n t^{n-k} (-1)^k \operatorname{tr}(\Lambda^k A) &lt;/math&gt;
where tr(Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;A) is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Exterior algebra#Functoriality|exterior power]] of ''A'', which has dimension &lt;math&gt;\tbinom nk&lt;/math&gt;. This trace may be computed as the sum of all [[principal minor]]s of ''A'' of size ''k''. The recursive [[Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm]] computes these  coefficients  more efficiently.

When the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is 0 it may alternatively be computed as a single determinant, that of the {{math|''k''×''k''}} matrix,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{k!}  
\begin{vmatrix}  \operatorname{tr}A  &amp;   k-1 &amp;0&amp;\cdots &amp; \\
\operatorname{tr}A^2  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A&amp;  k-2 &amp;\cdots &amp; \\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots    \\
\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1} &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{k-2}&amp; &amp; \cdots &amp; 1    \\ 
\operatorname{tr}A^k  &amp;\operatorname{tr}A^{k-1}&amp; &amp; \cdots &amp; \operatorname{tr}A
\end{vmatrix}         ~.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] states that replacing ''t''  by ''A'' in the characteristic polynomial (interpreting the resulting powers as matrix powers, and the constant term ''c'' as ''c'' times the identity matrix) yields the zero matrix. Informally speaking, every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. This statement is equivalent to saying that the [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] of ''A'' divides the characteristic polynomial of ''A''.

Two [[similar matrices]] have the same characteristic polynomial.  The converse however is not true in general: two matrices with the same characteristic polynomial need not be similar.

The matrix ''A'' and its [[transpose]] have the same characteristic polynomial. ''A'' is similar to a [[triangular matrix]] [[if and only if]] its characteristic polynomial can be completely factored into linear factors over ''K'' (the same is true with the minimal polynomial instead of the characteristic polynomial). In this case ''A'' is similar to a matrix in [[Jordan normal form]].

==Characteristic polynomial of a product of two matrices==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are two square ''n×n'' matrices then characteristic polynomials of ''AB'' and ''BA'' coincide: 
:&lt;math&gt;p_{AB}(t)=p_{BA}(t).\,&lt;/math&gt;

When ''A'' is [[Non-singular matrix|non-singular]] this result follows from the fact that ''AB'' and ''BA'' are [[similar matrices|similar]]:
:&lt;math&gt;BA = A^{-1} (AB) A.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case where both ''A'' and ''B'' are singular, one may remark that the desired identity is an equality between polynomials in ''t'' and the coefficients of the matrices. Thus, to prove this equality, it suffices to prove that it is verified on a non-empty [[open subset]] (for the usual [[topological space|topology]], or, more generally, for the [[Zariski topology]]) of the space of all the coefficients. As the non-singular matrices form such an open subset of the space of all matrices, this proves the result.

More generally, if ''A'' is a matrix of order ''m&amp;times;n'' and ''B'' is a matrix of order ''n&amp;times;m'', then ''AB'' is ''m&amp;times;m'' and ''BA'' is ''n&amp;times;n'' matrix, and one has
: &lt;math&gt; p_{BA}(t) = t^{n-m} p_{AB}(t).\,&lt;/math&gt;

To prove this, one may suppose ''n'' &gt; ''m'', by exchanging, if needed, ''A'' and ''B''. Then, by bordering ''A'' on the bottom by ''n'' – ''m'' rows of zeros, and ''B'' on the right, by,  ''n'' – ''m'' columns of zeros, one gets two ''n&amp;times;n'' matrices ''A' ''and ''B' '' such that ''B'A' ''= ''BA'', and ''A'B' '' is equal to ''AB'' bordered by ''n'' – ''m'' rows and columns of zeros. The result follows from the case of square matrices, by comparing the characteristic polynomials of ''A'B' '' and ''AB''.

==Secular function and secular equation==

===Secular function===
The term '''secular function''' has been used for what is now called ''characteristic polynomial'' (in some literature the term secular function is still used). The term comes from the fact that the characteristic polynomial was used to calculate [[secular phenomena|secular perturbations]] (on a time scale of a century, i.e. slow compared to annual motion) of planetary orbits, according to [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s theory of oscillations.

===Secular equation===
''Secular equation'' may have several meanings.

*In [[linear algebra]] it is sometimes used in place of characteristic equation.
*In [[astronomy]] it is the algebraic or numerical expression of the magnitude of the inequalities in a planet's motion that remain after the inequalities of a short period have been allowed for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://dict.die.net/secular%20equation/
| title = secular equation
|accessdate = January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[molecular orbital]] calculations relating to the energy of the electron and its wave function it is also used instead of the characteristic equation.

==Girl child==
Conditions that increases the risk of girl-child sexual assault in Nigeria can be found in schools, [[Child harvesting|baby factories]] and the practice of child labour. Studies conducted in Nigeria disclose that young girls are victims in majority of reported assault cases in hospitals. A four-year review of sexual assault cases at [[Lagos University Teaching Hospital|LASUTH]] that began in 2008 and ended in December 2012, showed that out of a total 287 reported cases of sexual assault, 83% of the victims were below the age of 19.&lt;ref&gt;Akinlusi FM, Rabiu KA, Olawepo TA, Adewunmi AA, Ottun TA, Akinola OI.

===Child labour===
One of the traditional means of [[socialization]] of children is through trading.{{sfn|Ebigbo|2003|p=97}} However, the introduction of young girls into street trading increases the vulnerabilities of the girls to sexual harassment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">'''Colon classification''' ('''CC''') is a system of [[library classification]] developed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]]. It was the first ever [[Faceted classification|faceted]] (or analytico-synthetic) [[Taxonomic classification|classification]]. The first edition was published in 1933. Since then six more editions have been published. It is especially used in [[library|libraries]] in [[India]].

Its name "colon classification" comes from the use of [[Colon (punctuation)|colons]] to separate facets in class numbers. However, many other classification schemes, some of which are completely unrelated, also use colons and other [[punctuation]] in various functions.

In CC, facets describe "personality" (the most specific subject), matter, energy, space, and time (PMEST).  These facets are generally associated with every item in a library, and so form a reasonably universal sorting system.&lt;ref&gt;GOPINATH (M A). Colon classification: Its theory and practice.

As an example, the subject "research in the cure of tuberculosis of lungs by x-ray conducted in India in 1950" would be categorized as:

:Medicine,Lungs;Tuberculosis:Treatment;X-ray:Research.India'1950

This is summarized in a specific call number:

:L,45;421:6;253:f.44'N5

== Organization ==

The colon classification uses 42 main classes that are combined with other letters, numbers and marks in a manner resembling the [[Library of Congress Classification]] to sort a publication.

=== Facets ===

CC uses five primary categories, or facets, to further specify the sorting of a publication. Collectively, they are called ''PMEST'':

:&lt;nowiki&gt;,&lt;/nowiki&gt; Personality, the most specific or focal subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Matter or property, the substance, properties or materials of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; Energy, including the processes, operations and activities.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;.&lt;/nowiki&gt; Space, which relates to the geographic location of the subject.
:&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; Time, which refers to the dates or seasons of the subject.

=== Classes ===

The following are the main classes of CC, with some subclasses, the main method used to sort the subclass using the PMEST scheme and examples showing application of PMEST.

{{Complex systems}}
A '''complex system''' is a [[system]] composed of many components which may interact with each other. Examples of complex systems are Earth's global [[climate]], [[organisms]], the [[human brain]], infrastructure such as power grid, transportation or communication systems, social and economic organizations (like [[cities]]), an [[ecosystem]], a living [[Cell (biology)|cell]], and ultimately the entire [[universe]].

Complex systems are [[system]]s whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are "[[Complexity|complex]]" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearity]], [[emergence]], [[spontaneous order]], [[Complex adaptive system|adaptation]], and [[Feedback|feedback loops]], among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their own independent area of research. In many cases it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and the links their interactions.

== Overview ==
The term ''complex systems'' often refers to the study of complex systems, which is an approach to science that investigates how relationships between a system's parts give rise to its collective behaviors and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bar-Yam|first=Yaneer|date=2002|title=General Features of Complex Systems|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c15/E1-29-01-00.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems|EOLSS]] [[UNESCO]] Publishers, Oxford, UK|doi=|pmid=|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of complex systems regards collective, or system-wide, behaviors as the fundamental object of study; for this reason, complex systems can be understood as an alternative paradigm to [[reductionism]], which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.

As an interdisciplinary domain, complex systems draws contributions from many different fields, such as the study of [[self-organization]] from physics, that of [[spontaneous order]] from the social sciences, [[Chaos theory|chaos]] from mathematics, [[Complex adaptive system|adaptation]] from biology, and many others. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines, including [[statistical physics]], [[information theory]], [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear dynamics]], [[anthropology]], [[computer science]], [[meteorology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[biology]].

== Key concepts ==

=== Systems ===
[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|''Open systems'' have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.]]
Complex systems is chiefly concerned with the behaviors and properties of ''[[system]]s''. A system, broadly defined, is a set of entities that, through their interactions, relationships, or dependencies, form a unified whole. It is always defined in terms of its ''boundary'', which determines the entities that are or are not part of the system. Entities lying outside the system then become part of the system's ''environment''.

A system can exhibit ''properties'' that produce ''behaviors'' which are distinct from the properties and behaviors of its parts; these system-wide or ''global'' properties and behaviors are characteristics of how the system interacts with or appears to its environment, or of how its parts behave (say, in response to external stimuli) by virtue of being within the system. The notion of ''behavior'' implies that the study of systems is also concerned with processes that take place over time (or, in [[mathematics]], some other [[phase space]] [[Parametrization|parameterization]]). Because of their broad, interdisciplinary applicability, systems concepts play a central role in complex systems.

As a field of study, complex systems is a subset of [[systems theory]]. General systems theory focuses similarly on the collective behaviors of interacting entities, but it studies a much broader class of systems, including non-complex systems where traditional reductionist approaches may remain viable. Indeed, systems theory seeks to explore and describe ''all'' classes of systems, and the invention of categories that are useful to researchers across widely varying fields is one of systems theory's main objectives.

As it relates to complex systems, systems theory contributes an emphasis on the way relationships and dependencies between a system's parts can determine system-wide properties. It also contributes the interdisciplinary perspective of the study of complex systems: the notion that shared properties link systems across disciplines, justifying the pursuit of modeling approaches applicable to complex systems wherever they appear. Specific concepts important to complex systems, such as emergence, feedback loops, and adaptation, also originate in systems theory.

=== Complexity ===
Systems exhibit complexity means that their behaviors cannot be easily implied from the very properties that make them difficult to model, and the complex behaviors are governed entirely, or almost entirely, by the behaviors those properties produce. Any modeling approach that ignores such difficulties or characterizes them as noise, then, will necessarily produce models that are neither accurate nor useful. As yet no fully general theory of complex systems has emerged for addressing these problems, so researchers must solve them in domain-specific contexts. Researchers in complex systems address these problems by viewing the chief task of modeling to be capturing, rather than reducing, the complexity of their respective systems of interest.

While no generally accepted exact definition of complexity exists yet, there are many archetypal examples of complexity. Systems can be complex if, for instance, they have [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior (behavior that exhibits extreme sensitivity to initial conditions), or if they have [[Emergence|emergent]] properties (properties that are not apparent from their components in isolation but which result from the relationships and dependencies they form when placed together in a system), or if they are computationally intractable to model (if they depend on a number of parameters that grows too rapidly with respect to the size of the system).

=== Networks ===
The interacting components of a complex system form a [[Network theory|network]], which is a collection of discrete objects and relationships between them, usually depicted as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of vertices connected by edges. Networks can describe the relationships between individuals within an organization, between [[logic gate]]s in a [[Circuit (computer science)|circuit]], between [[gene]]s in [[gene regulatory network]]s, or between any other set of related entities.

Networks often describe the sources of complexity in complex systems. Studying complex systems as networks therefore enables many useful applications of [[graph theory]] and [[network science]]. Some complex systems, for example, are also [[complex network]]s, which have properties such as phase transitions and power-law degree distributions that readily lend themselves to emergent or chaotic behavior. The fact that the number of edges in a [[complete graph]] grows [[Quadratic growth|quadratically]] in the number of vertices sheds additional light on the source of complexity in large networks: as a network grows, the number of relationships between entities quickly dwarfs the number of entities in the network.

=== Nonlinearity ===
[[File:A Trajectory Through Phase Space in a Lorenz Attractor.gif|frame|border|right|A sample solution in the Lorenz attractor when ρ = 28, σ = 10, and β = 8/3]]
Complex systems often have nonlinear behavior, meaning they may respond in different ways to the same input depending on their state or context. In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], nonlinearity describes systems in which a change in the size of the input does not produce a proportional change in the size of the output. For a given change in input, such systems may yield significantly greater than or less than proportional changes in output, or even no output at all, depending on the current state of the system or its parameter values.

Of particular interest to complex systems are [[nonlinear dynamical systems]], which are systems of [[differential equation]]s that have one or more nonlinear terms. Some nonlinear dynamical systems, such as the [[Lorenz system]], can produce a mathematical phenomenon known as [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Chaos as it applies to complex systems refers to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions, or "[[butterfly effect]]," that a complex system can exhibit. In such a system, small changes to initial conditions can lead to dramatically different outcomes. Chaotic behavior can therefore be extremely hard to model numerically, because small rounding errors at an intermediate stage of computation can cause the model to generate completely inaccurate output. Furthermore, if a complex system returns to a state similar to one it held previously, it may behave completely differently in response to exactly the same stimuli, so chaos also poses challenges for extrapolating from past experience.

=== Emergence ===
[[File:Gospers glider gun.gif|frame|right|[[Bill Gosper|Gosper's]] [[Gun (cellular automaton)|Glider Gun]] creating "[[Glider (Conway's Life)|gliders]]" in the cellular automaton [[Conway's Game of Life]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dennett]] (1995), ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', Penguin Books, London, {{ISBN|978-0-14-016734-4}}, {{ISBN|0-14-016734-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another common feature of complex systems is the presence of emergent behaviors and properties: these are traits of a system which are not apparent from its components in isolation but which result from the interactions, dependencies, or relationships they form when placed together in a system. [[Emergence]] broadly describes the appearance of such behaviors and properties, and has applications to systems studied in both the social and physical sciences. While emergence is often used to refer only to the appearance of unplanned organized behavior in a complex system, emergence can also refer to the breakdown of organization; it describes any phenomena which are difficult or even impossible to predict from the smaller entities that make up the system.

One example of complex system whose emergent properties have been studied extensively is [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]]. In a cellular automaton, a grid of cells, each having one of finitely many states, evolves over time according to a simple set of rules. These rules guide the "interactions" of each cell with its neighbors. Although the rules are only defined locally, they have been shown capable of producing globally interesting behavior, for example in [[Conway's Game of Life]].

==== Spontaneous order and self-organization ====
When emergence describes the appearance of unplanned order, it is [[spontaneous order]] (in the social sciences) or [[self-organization]] (in physical sciences). Spontaneous order can be seen in [[herd behavior]], whereby a group of individuals coordinates their actions without centralized planning. Self-organization can be seen in the global symmetry of certain [[crystal]]s, for instance the apparent radial [[symmetry]] of [[snowflake]]s, which arises from purely local [[Intermolecular force|attractive and repulsive forces]] both between water molecules and between water molecules and their surrounding environment.

=== Adaptation ===
[[Complex adaptive system]]s are special cases of complex systems that are [[adaptive]] in that they have the capacity to change and learn from experience. Examples of complex adaptive systems include the [[stock market]], social insect and [[ant]] colonies, the [[biosphere]] and the [[ecosystem]], the [[Human brain|brain]] and the [[immune system]], the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and the developing [[embryo]], the cities, [[Manufacturing|manufacturing businesses]] and any human social group-based endeavor in a cultural and [[social system]] such as [[Political party|political parties]] or [[Community|communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1473095218780515 On the ‘complexity turn’ in planning: An adaptive rationale to navigate spaces and times of uncertainty]&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural complex systems often exhibit such topologies. In the human [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] for example, we see dense local connectivity and a few very long [[axonal|axon]] projections between regions inside the cortex and to other brain regions.

;May produce emergent phenomena
:Complex systems may exhibit behaviors that are [[emergence|emergent]], which is to say that while the results may be sufficiently determined by the activity of the systems' basic constituents, they may have properties that can only be studied at a higher level.  For example, the [[termites]] in a mound have physiology, biochemistry and biological development that are at one level of analysis, but their [[social behavior]] and mound building is a property that emerges from the collection of termites and needs to be analysed at a different level.

;Relationships are non-linear
:In practical terms, this means a small perturbation may cause a large effect (see [[butterfly effect]]), a proportional effect, or even no effect at all. In linear systems, effect is ''always'' directly proportional to cause. See [[nonlinearity]].

;Relationships contain feedback loops
:Both negative ([[damping]]) and positive (amplifying) [[feedback]] are always found in complex systems. The effects of an element's behaviour are fed back to in such a way that the element itself is altered.

== History ==
[[File:2018 Map of the Complexity Sciences.jpg|thumb|360px|A perspective on the development of complexity science: http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html|alt= http://www.art-sciencefactory.com/complexity-map_feb09.html]]

Although it is arguable that humans have been studying complex systems for thousands of years, the modern scientific study of complex systems is relatively young in comparison to established fields of science such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. The history of the scientific study of these systems follows several different research trends.

In the area of [[mathematics]], arguably the largest contribution to the study of complex systems was the discovery of [[chaos theory|chaos]] in [[deterministic]] systems, a feature of certain [[dynamical systems]] that is strongly related to [[nonlinearity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irit.fr/COSI/training/complexity-tutorial/history-of-complex-systems.htm History of Complex Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123171158/http://www.irit.fr/COSI/training/complexity-tutorial/history-of-complex-systems.htm |date=2007-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of [[neural networks]] was also integral in advancing the mathematics needed to study complex systems.

The notion of [[self-organizing]] systems is tied with work in [[nonequilibrium thermodynamics]], including that pioneered by [[chemist]] and [[Nobel laureate]] [[Ilya Prigogine]] in his study of [[dissipative structures]]. Even older is the work by [[Hartree-Fock]] c.s. on the [[quantum-chemistry]] equations and later calculations of the structure of molecules which can be regarded as one of the earliest examples of emergence and emergent wholes in science.

One complex system containing humans is the classical political economy of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], later developed by the [[Austrian school of economics]], which argues that order in market systems is spontaneous (or [[Emergence|emergent]]) in that it is the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Ferguson |coauthors= |title=An Essay on the History of Civil Society |publisher=T. Cadell |year=1767 |location=London |pages=Part the Third, Section II, p. 205 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1428&amp;Itemid=28 |doi= |id= |isbn= |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Hayek, "The Results of Human Action but Not of Human Design" in ''New Studies in Philosophy, Politics, Economics'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978, pp. 96–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon this the Austrian school developed from the 19th to the early 20th century the [[economic calculation problem]], along with the concept of [[dispersed knowledge]], which were to fuel debates against the then-dominant [[Keynesian economics]]. This debate would notably lead economists, politicians and other parties to explore the question of [[Economic calculation problem#Computational complexity|computational complexity]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

A pioneer in the field, and inspired by [[Karl Popper]]'s and [[Warren Weaver]]'s works, Nobel prize economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek]] dedicated much of his work, from early to the late 20th century, to the study of complex phenomena,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Caldwell, Popper and Hayek: [http://www.unites.uqam.ca/philo/pdf/Caldwell_2003-01.pdf Who influenced whom?], Karl Popper 2002 Centenary Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; not constraining his work to human economies but venturing into other fields such as [[psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich von Hayek, ''The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology'', The University of Chicago Press, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; [[biology]] and [[cybernetics]].  [[Gregory Bateson]] played a key role in establishing the connection between anthropology and systems theory; he recognized that the interactive parts of cultures function much like ecosystems.

While the explicit study of complex systems dates at least to the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vemuri |first=V. |date=1978 |title=Modeling of Complex Systems: An Introduction |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0127165509}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first research institute focused on complex systems, the [[Santa Fe Institute]], was founded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ledford | first1 = H | year = 2015 | title = How to solve the world's biggest problems | url = http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-solve-the-world-s-biggest-problems-1.18367 | journal = Nature | volume = 525 | issue = 7569| pages = 308–311 | doi=10.1038/525308a| bibcode = 2015Natur.525..308L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.santafe.edu/about/history|title=History {{!}} Santa Fe Institute|website=www.santafe.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Santa Fe Institute participants included physics Nobel laureates [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]], economics Nobel laureate [[Kenneth Arrow]], and Manhattan Project scientists [[George Cowan]] and [[Herbert L.

== Applications ==

===Complexity in practice===
The traditional approach to dealing with complexity is to reduce or constrain it. Typically, this involves compartmentalisation: dividing a large system into separate parts. Organizations, for instance, divide their work into departments that each deal with separate issues. Engineering systems are often designed using modular components. However, modular designs become susceptible to failure when issues arise that bridge the divisions.

===Complexity management===
As projects and [[acquisitions]] become increasingly complex, companies and governments are challenged to find effective ways to manage mega-acquisitions such as the Army [[Future Combat Systems]].  Acquisitions such as the [[Future Combat Systems|FCS]] rely on a web of interrelated parts which interact unpredictably.  As acquisitions become more network-centric and complex, businesses will be forced to find ways to manage complexity while governments will be challenged to provide effective governance to ensure flexibility and resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csis.org/files/publication/090410_Organizing_for_a_Complex_World_The_Way_Ahead_0.pdf CSIS paper: "Organizing for a Complex World: The Way Ahead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity economics===
Over the last decades, within the emerging field of [[complexity economics]] new predictive tools have been developed to explain economic growth. Such is the case with the models built by the [[Santa Fe Institute]] in 1989 and the more recent [[economic complexity index]] (ECI), introduced by the [[MIT]] physicist [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and the [[Harvard]] economist [[Ricardo Hausmann]]. Based on the ECI, Hausmann, Hidalgo and their team of [[The Observatory of Economic Complexity]] have [[List of countries by future GDP (based on ECI) estimates|produced GDP forecasts for the year 2020]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Complexity and education ===
Focusing on issues of student persistence with their studies, Forsman, Moll and Linder explore the "viability of using complexity science as a frame to extend methodological applications for physics education research", finding that "framing a social network analysis within a complexity science perspective offers a new and powerful applicability across a broad range of PER topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forsman|first=Jonas|last2=Moll|first2=Rachel|last3=Linder|first3=Cedric|date=2014|title=Extending the theoretical framing for physics education research: An illustrative application of complexity science|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020122|journal=Physical Review Special Topics: Physics Education Research|volume=10|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.10.020122|id=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/2583|bibcode=2014PRPER..10b0122F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and modeling===
One of Friedrich Hayek's main contributions to early complexity theory is his distinction between the human capacity to predict the behaviour of simple systems and its capacity to predict the behaviour of complex systems through [[Scientific modelling|modeling]]. He believed that economics and the sciences of complex phenomena in general, which in his view included biology, psychology, and so on, could not be modeled after the sciences that deal with essentially simple phenomena like physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/33304.html Reason Magazine - The Road from Serfdom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hayek would notably explain that complex phenomena, through modeling, can only allow pattern predictions, compared with the precise predictions that can be made out of non-complex phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1974/hayek-lecture.html Friedrich August von Hayek - Prize Lecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity and chaos theory===
Complexity theory is rooted in [[chaos theory]], which in turn has its origins more than a century ago in the work of the French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. Chaos is sometimes viewed as extremely complicated information, rather than as an absence of order.&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. K. (1991). ''Chaos Bound: Orderly Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science''. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic systems remain deterministic, though their long-term behavior can be difficult to predict with any accuracy. With perfect knowledge of the initial conditions and of the relevant equations describing the chaotic system's behavior, one can theoretically make perfectly accurate predictions about the future of the system, though in practice this is impossible to do with arbitrary accuracy. [[Ilya Prigogine]] argued&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. (1997). ''The End of Certainty'', The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; that complexity is non-deterministic, and gives no way whatsoever to precisely predict the future.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal |author=D. Carfì |year=2008 |title=Superpositions in Prigogine approach to irreversibility |journal=AAPP: Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |url=http://cab.unime.it/journals/index.php/AAPP/article/view/384/0 |format= |accessdate=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of complexity theory shows a domain between deterministic order and randomness which is complex.&lt;ref name="PC98"&gt;[[Paul Cilliers|Cilliers, P.]] (1998). ''Complexity and Postmodernism: Understanding Complex Systems'', Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred as the "[[edge of chaos]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Per Bak]] (1996). ''How Nature Works: The Science of Self-Organized Criticality'', Copernicus, New York, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|left|200px|A plot of the [[Lorenz attractor]].]]

When one analyzes complex systems, sensitivity to initial conditions, for example, is not an issue as important as it is within chaos theory, in which it prevails. As stated by Colander,&lt;ref&gt;Colander, D. (2000). ''The Complexity Vision and the Teaching of Economics'', E. Elgar, Northampton, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; the study of complexity is the opposite of the study of chaos. Complexity is about how a huge number of extremely complicated and dynamic sets of relationships can generate some simple behavioral patterns, whereas chaotic behavior, in the sense of deterministic chaos, is the result of a relatively small number of non-linear interactions.&lt;ref name="PC98"/&gt;

Therefore, the main difference between chaotic systems and complex systems is their history.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, M. (2000). ''Ubiquity : Why catastrophes happen'', three river press, New-York.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaotic systems do not rely on their history as complex ones do. Chaotic behaviour pushes a system in equilibrium into chaotic order, which means, in other words, out of what we traditionally define as 'order'.{{clarify|date=September 2011}} On the other hand, complex systems evolve far from equilibrium at the edge of chaos. They evolve at a critical state built up by a history of irreversible and unexpected events, which physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]] called "an accumulation of frozen accidents".&lt;ref&gt;Gell-Mann, M. (1995). What is Complexity?  Complexity 1/1, 16-19&lt;/ref&gt; In a sense chaotic systems can be regarded as a subset of complex systems distinguished precisely by this absence of historical dependence. Many real complex systems are, in practice and over long but finite time periods, robust. However, they do possess the potential for radical qualitative change of kind whilst retaining systemic integrity. Metamorphosis serves as perhaps more than a metaphor for such transformations.

===General form of complexity computation===

The computational law of reachable optimality&lt;ref&gt;Wenliang Wang (2015). Pooling Game Theory and Public Pension Plan. {{ISBN|978-1507658246}}. Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; is established as a general form of computation for ordered systems and it reveals complexity computation is a compound computation of optimal choice and optimality driven reaching pattern over time underlying a specific and any experience path of ordered system within the general limitation of system integrity.

The computational law of reachable optimality has four key components as described below.

1. '''Reachability of Optimality''': Any intended optimality shall be reachable. Unreachable optimality has no meaning for a member in the ordered system and even for the ordered system itself.

2. '''Prevailing and Consistency''': Maximizing reachability to explore best available optimality is the prevailing computation logic for all members in the ordered system and is accommodated by the ordered system.

3. '''Conditionality''': Realizable tradeoff between reachability and optimality depends primarily upon the initial bet capacity and how the bet capacity evolves along with the payoff table update path triggered by bet behavior and empowered by the underlying law of reward and punishment. Precisely, it is a sequence of conditional events where the next event happens upon reached status quo from experience path.

4. '''Robustness''': The more challenge a reachable optimality can accommodate, the more robust it is in term of path integrity.

There are also four computation features in the law of reachable optimality.

1. '''Optimal Choice''': Computation in realizing Optimal Choice can be very simple or very complex. A simple rule in Optimal Choice is to accept whatever is reached, Reward As You Go (RAYG). A Reachable Optimality computation reduces into optimizing reachability when RAYG is adopted. The Optimal Choice computation can be more complex when multiple NE strategies present in a reached game.

2. '''Initial Status''': Computation is assumed to start at an interested beginning even the absolute beginning of an ordered system in nature may not and need not present. An assumed neutral Initial Status facilitates an artificial or a simulating computation and is not expected to change the prevalence of any findings.

3. '''Territory''': An ordered system shall have a territory where the universal computation sponsored by the system will produce an optimal solution still within the territory.

4. '''Reaching Pattern''': The forms of Reaching Pattern in the computation space, or the Optimality Driven Reaching Pattern in the computation space, primarily depend upon the nature and dimensions of measure space underlying a computation space and the law of punishment and reward underlying the realized experience path of reaching. There are five basic forms of experience path we are interested in, persistently positive reinforcement experience path, persistently [[negative reinforcement]] experience path, mixed persistent pattern experience path, decaying scale experience path and selection experience path.

The compound computation in selection experience path includes current and lagging interaction, dynamic topological transformation and implies  both invariance and variance characteristics in an ordered system's experience path.

In addition, the computation law of reachable optimality gives out the boundary between complexity model, chaotic model and determination model. When RAYG is the Optimal Choice computation, and the reaching pattern is a persistently positive experience path, persistently negative experience path, or mixed persistent pattern experience path, the underlying computation shall be a simple system computation adopting determination rules. If the reaching pattern has no persistent pattern experienced in RAYG regime, the underlying computation hints there is a chaotic system. When the optimal choice computation involves non-RAYG computation, it's a complexity computation driving the compound effect.

In a 2005 article in the ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence'', Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling listed the CTS amongst the most important advances in the field of IPV research, stating it "was revolutionary because it allowed researchers to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] study events that had often been ignored culturally and typically took place in private."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling | first1=Jennifer | date=January 2005 | title=Top 10 Greatest "Hits": Important Findings and Future Directions for Intimate Partner Violence Research | url=http://rzukausk.home.mruni.eu/wp-content/uploads/Intimate-Partner-Violence-Research.pdf | journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume=20 | issue=1 | page=108 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/0886260504268602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the CTS is one of the most widely criticized domestic violence measurement instruments due to its exclusion of context variables and motivational factors in understanding acts of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R.

==Structure==
The scales are based on the premise that [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] is an inevitable aspect of all human association, but that the use of [[coercion]] (including force and violence) as a conflict-resolution tactic is harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=February 1979 | title=Measuring intra family conflict and violence: The Conflict Tactics (CT) Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS41%20(CTS2x-Abridged).pdf | journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume=41 | issue=1 | page=75 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.2307/351733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus190&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=190 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS focuses on "conflict tactics" – the method used to advance one's own interest within a conflict – as a behavior, and measures the conflict tactic behaviors of both the respondent and their partner/primary caregiver. However, the CTS "deliberately excludes attitudes, emotions, and cognitive appraisal of the behaviors" measured. This is because many victims of IPV do not see themselves as suffering abuse, and as such, their cognitive appraisal of their situation can affect the measurements of the CTS. Straus explains that the "discrepancy between the behavior and the cognitive appraisal of the behavior is important for understanding family violence and for designing programs of prevention and treatment. However, it is possible to identify the discrepancy only if there is an instrument such as the CTS which obtains the behavioral data."&lt;ref name=Straus191&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor1-first=Nicky Ali | editor1-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=191 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CTS-based study would ideally include data from respondents and their partners/primary caregivers in order to investigate the degree of symmetry or asymmetry between their responses. The CTS can be administered through an in-person interview, telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire, and/or computer-administered questionnaire.

===Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2)===
The revised CTS2 measures a total of 39 behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.musc.edu/vawprevention/research/screening.shtml | title=Screening Measures for Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and Physical Assault | last=Acierno | first=Ron | publisher=National Violence Against Women Prevention Research Center, [[Medical University of South Carolina]] | date= 2000 | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these behaviors, or "items", is divided into five categories: "Negotiation", "Psychological Aggression", "Physical Assault", "Sexual Coercion" and "Injury." Each of the five categories is then further subdivided into two subscales: "Negotiation" is subdivided into "Cognitive" and "Emotional", while the other four categories are subdivided into "Minor" and "Severe." There are six items in "Negotiation", eight in "Psychological Aggression," twelve in "Physical Assault," seven in "Sexual Coercion," and six in "Injury."&lt;ref name=CTS2&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Hamby | first2=Sherry L. | last3=Boney-McCoy | first3=Susan | last4=Sugarman | first4=David B. | date=May 1996 | title=The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2): Development and Preliminary Psychometric Data | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS15.pdf | journal=Journal of Family Issues | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=308–309 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1177/019251396017003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples from each category include:

* ''Negotiation:'' "I showed I cared about my partner even though we disagreed" (emotional); "Suggested a compromise to a disagreement" (cognitive).
* ''Psychological Aggression:'' "Shouted or yelled at my partner" (minor); "Threatened to hit or throw something at my partner" (severe).
* ''Physical Assault:'' "Slapped my partner" (minor); "Kicked my partner" (severe)
* ''Sexual Coercion:'' "Insisted on sex when my partner did not want to (but did not use physical force)" (minor); "Used force (like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon) to make my partner have sex" (severe)
* ''Injury:'' "Had a sprain, bruise, or small cut because of a fight with my partner" (minor); "Needed to see a doctor because of a fight with my partner, but I didn't" (severe).&lt;ref name=CTS2/&gt;

CTS2 questions are presented in pairs. The first question in the pair asks respondents to indicate how often they carried out each item, in a range from "never" to "more than 20 times," in the referent period. The second asks how often the partner carried out each item within the same referent period. Default referent periods are usually 12 months, but other spans of time can be used.&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; Subscales measuring the degree of severity of "less severe" and "more severe" behaviors are included for all CTS scales, "based on the presumed greater harm resulting from acts in the severe subscale."&lt;ref name=Straus191/&gt; The severity of behaviors can also be measured by analyzing the frequency of the acts and by whether an injury was reported by the respondent.

===CTSPC===
The CTSPC (parent-child relationships) has scales to measure:
* physical assault (with subscales for [[corporal punishment]] and physical abuse),
* psychological aggression,
* non-violent [[discipline]] techniques.
The CTSPC also includes supplementary questions on instances of neglect, sexual abuse, and discipline in the past week.&lt;ref name=Straus1998 /&gt;

===Scoring===
There are many ways to score the CTS.&lt;ref name=Douglas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Straus | first=Murray A. | date=July 23, 2004 | title=Scoring the CTS2 and CTSPC | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS28a3.pdf | journal=Family Research Laboratory, University of New Hampshire | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common scoring methods include:

* ''Prevalence'': Results in the percentage of respondents who reported being a victim of or perpetrating an item (or items) one or more times.&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Frequency'': Results in the number of times an item occurred in the past year. A limitation of this score is that, for general population samples, "the distribution is so skewed that the [[mean]] is not an appropriate measure of central tendency." However, a sample of known offenders or victims will have a much higher frequency score "that can be very useful for measuring the chronicity of maltreatment."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;
* ''Severity level and mutuality types'': The severity level classifies each case into three categories: "none", "minor only", or "severe". The mutuality types classify each case as "respondent only", "partner only", or "both". Straus writes "the mutuality types may be particularly useful in couples therapy because over a hundred studies have found that when there is violence, 50 percent or more of the time it is by both partners."&lt;ref name=Straus195/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Archer | first1=John | date=September 2000 | title=Sex Differences in Aggression between Heterosexual Partners: A Meta-Analytic Review | url=http://www.batteredmen.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | volume=126 | issue=5 | pages=651–680 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 | pmid=10989615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | last2=Ramirez | first2=Ignacio | date=July 2007 | title=Gender symmetry in prevalence, severity, and chronicity of physical aggression against dating partners by university students in Mexico and USA. | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID12F.pdf | journal=Aggressive Behavior | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=281–290 | accessdate=May 20, 2014 | doi=10.1002/ab.20199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the CTS argue it is an ineffective tool with which to measure IPV rate because, although it counts the number of acts of violence, it does not provide information about the context in which such acts occur (including the initiation, intention, history, or pattern of violence). Critics say such contexts cannot be divorced from the act itself, and therefore the CTS misrepresents the characteristics of violence between partners. Straus responds to this criticism by stating "the idea that the CTS physical assault scale is defective because it does not take into account the context, meaning, causes, and consequences of the violent acts is analogous to declaring a reading ability test invalid because it does not provide data on why a child reads poorly (such as limited exposure to books at home or test anxiety), or for not measuring the harmful effects of reading difficulty (such as low self-esteem or dropping out of school)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=Nicky Ali | editor-last=Jackson | title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence | publisher=Routledge | location=New York | year=2007 | page=194 | chapter=Conflict Tactics Scales | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/CTS44G.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Straus | first1=Murray A. | editor-first=M.R. | editor-last=Walsh | title=Women, Men and Gender: Ongoing Debates | publisher=Yale University Press | location=New Haven | year=1997 | page=218 | chapter=Physical Assaults by Women Partners: A Major Social Problem | url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB33.pdf | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael S. Kimmel|Michael Kimmel]] says of this argument, "such an analogy is utterly inadequate. It is more akin to a teacher who doesn't look at how far off the spelling mistakes are or whether there is a pattern in the mistakes that might point to a physiological problem like dyslexia or some other learning disability, as compared to academic laziness, and thus leaving the learning problems untouched and misdirecting funds away from towards punitive after-school programs for lazy students."&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kimmel | first = Michael S. | author-link = Michael Kimmel | title = 'Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review | journal = [[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1332–1363 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/107780102237407 | date = November 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107780102237407 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common criticism is that the CTS carries ideological assumptions about domestic violence, such as the notion that partner violence is the result of an "argument" rather than an attempt to control one's partner.&lt;ref name="kimmel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/AR_ctscrit.pdf | title=Measuring the extent of woman abuse in intimate heterosexual relationships: a critique of the Conflict Tactics Scales | last1=DeKeseredy | first1= Walter S. | last2=Schwartz | first2=Martin D. | date=February 1998 | publisher=VAWnet.org | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the CTS asks about frequency only in the past twelve months and fails to detect ongoing systematic patterns of abuse.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt; It also excludes incidents of violence that occur after separation and divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Flood | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Flood |title= Claims about 'husband battering' |journal= DVIRC Newsletter | pages = 3–8 |publisher= Domestic Violence and Incest Resource Centre, Melbourne |date= Summer 1999  |url= http://www.xyonline.net/content/claims-about-husband-battering | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Flood,%20Husband%20Battering.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The CTS also does not measure economic abuse, manipulation involving children, isolation, or intimidation – all common measures of violence from a victim-advocacy perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |title=Power and Control Wheel |publisher=National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence |accessdate=May 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another methodological problem is that [[Inter-rater reliability|interobserver reliability]] (the likelihood that the two members of the measured [[Dyad (sociology)|dyad]] respond similarly) is near zero for tested husband and wife couples. That is, the chances of a given couple reporting similar answers about events they both experienced is no greater than chance.&lt;ref name="dobash"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobash | first1=Russel P. | last2=Dobash | first2=R.

The idea of the '''daimonic''' typically means quite a few things: from befitting a [[demon]] and fiendish, to be motivated by a [[spirit|spiritual force]] or [[Genius (mythology)|genius]] and inspired.  As a psychological term, it has come to represent an elemental force which contains an irrepressible drive towards [[individuation]]. As a literary term, it can also mean the dynamic unrest that exists in us all that forces us into the unknown, leading to self-destruction and/or self-discovery.

==Etymology==
The term is derived from Greek  "δαίμων" (daimon, gen. daimonos): "lesser god, guiding spirit, tutelary deity",&lt;ref&gt;D Harper - Etymology Online. http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=demon&lt;/ref&gt; by way of Latin—dæmon: "spirit". "Daimon" itself is thought to be derived from ''daiomai'', with the meaning of ''to divide'' or ''to lacerate''.&lt;ref name="[[Giorgio Agamben|G Agamben]], D Heller-Roazen"/&gt;
[[Marie-Louise von Franz]] delineated the term  ''daiomai'' (see ref.), and indicates that its usage is specifically when someone perceived an occurrence which they attributed to the influence of a divine presence, amongst the examples provided by Franz, are from attributing to a daimon the occurrence of a horse becoming or being startled.&lt;ref name="SA Diamond (ed. DA. Leeming, K Madden, S Marlan)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g0QQtlJSyOEC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=daiomai+greek+word#v=onepage&amp;q=daiomai%20greek%20word&amp;f=false|author=SA Diamond |editor=DA. Leeming |editor2=K Madden |editor3=S Marlan |title=Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion: L-Z (p.197)|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 26 Oct 2009 |isbn= 038771801X| accessdate=2015-04-24|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of usage==
For the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] (3000-1100 BC) and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (1500-1100 BC), "daimons" were seen as attendants or servants to the deities, possessing spiritual power.  Later, the term "daimon" was used by writers such as [[Homer]] (8th century BC), [[Hesiod]], and [[Plato]] as a synonym for ''theos'', or god. Some scholars, like [[van der Leeuw]], suggest a distinction between the terms: whereas ''theos'' was the personification of a god (e.g. [[Zeus]]), ''daimon'' referred to something indeterminate, invisible, incorporeal, and unknown.&lt;ref name="Diamond"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Stephen | title = Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: the Psychological Genesis of Violence, Evil, and Creativity | publisher = State University of New York Press | location = Albany | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7914-3076-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period in which [[Homer]] was alive, people believed ailments were both caused and cured by daimons.&lt;ref name="SA Diamond (ed. DA. Leeming, K Madden, S Marlan)"/&gt;

The pre-Socratic Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] (5th century BC) later employed the term in describing the psyche or soul.  Similarly, those such as [[Plutarch]] (1st century AD) suggested a view of the daimon as being an amorphous mental phenomenon, an occasion of mortals to come in contact with a great spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; Plutarch wrote ''[[De genio Socratis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/De_genio_Socratis*/Introduction.html De Genio Socratis  by  Plutarch] the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1959 ([[University of Chicago]])[Retrieved 2015-04-24](verification)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, (DA Russell - translator) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u6zl7g43cCIC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=Socrates+daimon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_OY5VcLdC5HsaKiBgbgM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Socrates%20daimon&amp;f=false On the Daimonion of Socrates: Human Liberation, Divine Guidance and Philosophy] Volume 16 of SAPERE.

The earliest pre-Christian conception of daimons or ''daimones'' also considered them ambiguous—not exclusively evil.  But while daimons may have initially been seen as potentially good and evil, constructive and destructive, left to each man to relate to—the term eventually came to embody a purely evil connotation, with [[Xenocrates]] perhaps being one of the first to popularize this colloquial use.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

==Psychology==

In psychology, the daimonic refers to a natural human impulse within everyone to affirm, assert, perpetuate, and increase the self to its complete totality. If each [[Self (Jung)|Self]] undergoes a process of [[individuation]], an involuntary and natural development towards individual maturity and harmony with collective human nature, then its driver is the daimonic, the force which seeks to overcome the obstacles to development, whatever the cost—both guide and guardian. [[Rollo May]] writes that the daimonic is "any natural function which has the power to take over the whole person... The daimonic can be either creative or destructive, but it is normally both... The daimonic is obviously not an entity but refers to a fundamental, archetypal function of human experience -- an existential reality".&lt;ref name="May"/&gt; The daimonic is seen as an essentially undifferentiated, impersonal, primal force of nature&lt;ref name="Zweig"/&gt; which arises from the ground of being rather than the self as such.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;Rollo May, Love and Will, {{ISBN|0-393-01080-5}}. p. 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demands of the daimonic force upon the individual can be unorthodox, frightening, and overwhelming. With its obligation to protect the complete maturation of the individual and the unification of opposing forces within the Self, the inner urge can come in the form of a sudden journey (either intentional or serendipitous), a psychological illness, or simply neurotic and off-center behavior. [[Carl Jung|Jung]] writes, "The daimon throws us down, makes us traitors to our ideals and cherished convictions — traitors to the selves we thought we were."&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation (New York: Pantheon, 1956), p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it is the will of man to achieve his humanity, but since parts of his humanity may be deemed unacceptable and disowned, its demands are too often resisted. It is no wonder [[Yeats]] described it as that "other Will". Confrontation with the daimonic can be considered similar to "[[shadow-work]]".

[[File:DaimonicCircle.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Common threads of the daimonic concept]]

The psychologist [[Rollo May]] conceives of the daimonic as a primal force of nature which contains both constructive and destructive potentialities, but ultimately seeks to promote totality of the self.&lt;ref name="Zweig"&gt;Zweig, C. &amp; Abrams, J. (1991). Meeting the Shadow. Tarcher: Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; May introduced the daimonic to psychology&lt;ref name="Zweig"/&gt; as a concept designed to rival the terms 'devil' and 'demonic'. He believed the term demonic to be unsatisfactory because of our tendency, rooted in Judeo-Christian mythology, to project power outside of the self and onto devils and demons. The daimonic is also similar to [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow]], but is viewed as less differentiated. A pitfall of the Jungian doctrine of the shadow is the temptation to project evil onto this relatively autonomous 'splinter personality' and thus unnecessarily fragment the individual and obviate freedom and responsibility. Finally, by comparison to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[death instinct]] ([[Thanatos (psychoanalysis)|Thanatos]]), the daimonic is seen as less one-sided.

While similar to several other psychological terms, noteworthy differences exist. The daimonic is often improperly confused with the term demonic.

==In literature==
The journey from innocence to experience is not an idea that originated with this term; rather the Hero's Journey is a topic older than literature itself.  But the daimonic subsequently became a focus of the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In the diagram, the common threads of the daimonic concept are identified. Typically, the daimonic tale centers around the Solitary, the central character of the story, who usually is introduced in innocence, wealth, and often arrogance. However, under the masks of control and order lies a corruption and unconscious desire towards disintegration. Some event, either external or internal, leads the character towards some type of isolation where he is forced to confront his daimons.

The fall or descent (from [[hubris]]) into the [[Liminality|liminal]] world where light and dark meet is usually very dramatic and often torturing for the hero and the audience alike, and comes in myriad forms. In the depths, in hitting bottom, he ultimately discovers his own fate and tragedy ([[catharsis]]), and in a final climax is either broken or driven towards rebirth and self-knowledge. The glory of the daimonic is in humble resurrection, though it claims more than it sets free as many foolish men are drawn into its vacuum never to return. As [[Stefan Zweig]] writes, the hero is unique for "he becomes the daimon's master instead of the daimon's thrall". The daimonic has been, and continues to be, a great source of creativity, inspiration, and fascination in all forms of art.

==Origins==
The DBSU was previously known as the Andhra Pradesh Dalit Bahujan Vyavasaya Vruthidharula Union (APDBVVU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianaidconnect.org/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_73530 Attack on Dalits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928171238/http://www.christianaidconnect.org/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_73530 |date=September 28, 2007 }} at ChristianAidConnect.org Retrieved April 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a conglomeration of various Dalit-Bahujan owned and managed community-based organisations across [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is dedicated to Damodaram Sanjeevaiah (former Chief Minister of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and President of [[All India Congress Committee|AICC]]) and Shyam Sundar. Its vision is "equal opportunities for all to identity, security, livelihoods and future."

{{Redirect-distinguish2|Deontology|the opposite of [[Ontology]]}} 

In [[moral philosophy]], '''deontological ethics''' or '''deontology''' (from Greek [[:wikt:δέον|δέον]], ''deon'', "obligation, duty"&lt;ref&gt;from the verb [[:wikt:δέω|δέω]] "bind, tie, fetter", via the present participle stem ''deont-'' + the suffix ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/deontology | title=Deontology dictionary definition &amp;#124; deontology defined}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes described as "[[duty]]-" or "obligation-" or "rule-" based ethics, because rules "bind one to one's duty".&lt;ref name="Waller, Bruce N 2005"&gt;Waller, Bruce N. 2005. ''Consider Ethics: Theory, Readings, and Contemporary Issues''. New York: Pearson Longman: 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Deontological ethics is commonly contrasted to [[consequentialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Antony. 1979. "Consequentialism". In ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd Ed.). New York: St Martins: 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[virtue ethics]], and [[pragmatic ethics]]. In this [[terminology]], action is more important than the consequences.

It is an ethical framework that depends on the predefined sets of rules and policies for the proper functioning of a system in the environment. The deontology is simply based on the checklist which includes certain rules to be followed while performing a particular task. According to this framework, the work is considered virtuous only if this checklist is completed.
This procedure is very simple to implement and understand. Minimum time is consumed to decide between right and wrong However, its simplicity ignores the consequences of the decision taken under this approach.

The term ''deontological'' was first used to describe the current, specialised definition by [[C. D. Broad]] in his book, ''Five Types of Ethical Theory'', which was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Tom L. 1991 ''Philosophical Ethics: An Introduction to Moral Philosophy'', 2nd Ed. New York: McGraw Hill: 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Older usage of the term goes back to [[Jeremy Bentham]], who coined it before 1816 as a synonym of ''Dicastic'' or ''Censorial Ethics'' (i.e. ethics based on judgement).&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Bentham, ''Chrestomathia'' (1816), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rqIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA213  p. 213]:
"For a synonym, ''Dicastic Ethics'' may have the single-worded appellative ''Deontology''. [''Deontology''.] From two Greek words, the first of which signifies ''fit, fitting, right, becoming, proper''. Deontology&amp;mdash;an account or indication of that which, on the occasion in question, whatsoever it be, is&amp;mdash;(i.e. by him who speaks or writes, is regarded as being)&amp;mdash;''fit, fitting, becoming, proper''. It is in  ''sound'' only, and not in ''signification'', that it has any connexion with the word ''ontology'',&lt;!--misprinted as outology  --&gt; employed above. Applied to every branch of Ethics, taken in the largest sense of the word ''Ethics'', the use of such a word as ''Deontology'' affords a promise of being attended with considerable convenience. It will accord equally well with every system which ever has been, or ever can be, devised, in relation to the foundation of moral obligation :&amp;mdash;in the use of it, no such incongruity and presumption is involved, as that which is called ''petitio principii''&amp;mdash;i.e. a begging of the question&amp;mdash;an assumption of the matter in dispute."

Also explained as "the knowledge of what is right and proper": 
"Deontology is derived from the Greek words, το  δεον  (that which is proper) and  Λογια, knowledge &amp;mdash; meaning the knowledge of what is right and proper; and it is here specially applied to the subject of morals, or that part of the field of action which is not the object of public legislation. As an art, it is the doing what is fit to be done; as a science, the knowing what is fit to be done on every occasion." 
''Deontology or, The science of morality : in which the harmony and co-incidence of duty and self-interest, virtue and felicity, prudence and benevolence, are explained and exemplified : from the MSS. of Jeremy Bentham'' ed. Bowring (1834), p. [https://archive.org/stream/deontologyorthes01bentuoft#page/21/mode/2up 21].&lt;/ref&gt;
The more general sense of the word is retained in French, especially in the term ''code de déontologie'' ([[ethical code]]), in the context of [[professional ethics]].

Depending on the system of deontological ethics under consideration, a '''moral obligation''' may arise from an [[Externality|external]] or internal source, such as a set of rules inherent to the universe ([[ethical naturalism]]), [[religious law]], or a set of personal or cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] (any of which may be in conflict with personal desires).
 
==Deontological philosophies==
There are numerous formulations of deontological ethics.

===Kantianism===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]|right]]
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Immanuel Kant]]'s theory of ethics is considered deontological for several different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Orend, Brian. 2000. ''War and International Justice: A Kantian Perspective''. West Waterloo, Ontario: [[Wilfrid Laurier University Press]]: 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Eugene. 2006. ''The Basics of Western Philosophy''. Greenwood Press: 160.&lt;/ref&gt; First, Kant argues that to act in the morally right way, people must act from duty (''Pflicht'').&lt;ref&gt;
Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (trans.), [https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kant/immanuel/k16e/#nr1 Immanuel Kant, ''The Metaphysical Elements of Ethics''], 1889 [Preface and Introduction to  [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Kant,+Immanuel/Die+Metaphysik+der+Sitten/Zweiter+Teil.+Metaphysische+Anfangsgr%C3%BCnde+der+Tugendlehre ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Tugendlehre''], 1797]. Abbott's ''deontology'' translates Kant's {{lang|de|Pflichtenlehre}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, Kant argued that it was not the consequences of actions that make them right or wrong but the motives of the person who carries out the action.

Kant's argument that to act in the morally right way one must act purely from duty begins with an argument that the highest good must be both good in itself and good without qualification.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt; Something is "good in itself" when it is [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsically good]], and "good without qualification", when the addition of that thing never makes a situation ethically worse. Kant then argues that those things that are usually thought to be good, such as [[intelligence]], [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]] and [[pleasure]], fail to be either intrinsically good or good without qualification. Pleasure, for example, appears not to be good without qualification, because when people take pleasure in watching someone suffer, this seems to make the situation ethically worse. He concludes that there is only one thing that is truly good:
{{quote|Nothing in the world—indeed nothing even beyond the world—can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a ''good will''.&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1785. "First Section: Transition from the Common Rational Knowledge of Morals to the Philosophical", [[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}Kant then argues that the consequences of an act of willing cannot be used to determine that the person has a good will; good consequences could arise by accident from an action that was motivated by a desire to cause harm to an innocent person, and bad consequences could arise from an action that was well-motivated. Instead, he claims, a person has a good will when he 'acts out of respect for the moral law'.&lt;ref name="transition" /&gt; People 'act out of respect for the moral law' when they act in some way ''because'' they have a duty to do so. So, the only thing that is truly good in itself is a good will, and a good will is only good when the willer chooses to do something because it is that person's duty, i.e. out of "respect" for the law. He defines respect as "the concept of a worth which thwarts my self-love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|title=Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals|year=1785|publisher=Project Gutenberg|page=23|edition=10|editor=Thomas Kingsmill Abbott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's three significant formulations of the [[categorical imperative]] are:
* Act only according to that [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] by which you can also will that it would become a universal law.
* Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.
* Every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in a universal kingdom of ends.

Kant argued that the only [[moral absolutism|absolutely good]] thing is a good will, and so the single determining factor of whether an action is morally right is the will, or motive of the person doing it. If they are acting on a bad maxim, e.g. "I will lie", then their action is wrong, even if some good consequences come of it.
In his essay, ''On a Supposed Right to Lie Because of Philanthropic Concerns'', arguing against the position of 
[[Benjamin Constant]], ''Des réactions politiques'', Kant states that "Hence a lie defined merely as an intentionally untruthful declaration to another man does not require the additional condition that it must do harm to another, as jurists require in their definition (''mendacium est falsiloquium in praeiudicium alterius''). For a lie always harms another; if not some human being, then it nevertheless does harm to humanity in general, inasmuch as it vitiates the very source of right [''Rechtsquelle''] ... All practical principles of right must contain rigorous truth ... This is because such exceptions would destroy the universality on account of which alone they bear the name of principles."&lt;ref&gt;"Über ein vermeintes Recht aus Menschenliebe zu lügen", ''Berlinische Blätter'' 1 (1797), 301-314; edited in: ''Werke in zwölf Bänden'', vol. 8, Frankfurt am Main (1977), [http://www.zeno.org/nid/20009192123 zeno.org/nid/20009192123]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine command theory===
{{Main|Divine command theory}}
[[Right of revolution|Although]] not all deontologists are religious, some believe in the 'divine command theory', which is actually a cluster of related theories which essentially state that an action is right if God has decreed that it is right.&lt;ref&gt;Wierenga, Edward. 1983. "A Defensible Divine Command Theory". ''Noûs'', Vol. 17, No. 3: 387–407.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Ralph Cudworth]], an English philosopher, [[William of Ockham]], [[René Descartes]], and eighteenth-century [[Calvinists]] all accepted various versions of this moral theory, as they all held that moral obligations arise from God's commands.&lt;ref&gt;Cudworth, Ralph. 1731. ''A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality''. Reprinted in 1996. Sarah Hutton (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Divine Command Theory is a form of deontology because, according to it, the rightness of any action depends upon that action being performed because it is a duty, not because of any good consequences arising from that action. If God commands people not to work on [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], then people act rightly if they do not work on Sabbath ''because God has commanded that they do not do so''. If they do not work on Sabbath because they are lazy, then their action is not truly speaking "right", even though the actual physical action performed is the same. If God commands not to covet a neighbour's goods, this theory holds that it would be immoral to do so, even if coveting provides the beneficial outcome of a drive to succeed or do well.

One thing that clearly distinguishes Kantian deontologism from divine command deontology is that Kantianism maintains that man, as a rational being, makes the moral law universal, whereas divine command maintains that God makes the moral law universal.

*{http://www.Wikipedia.com/Wikipedia's Edit Page}*

===Contemporary deontology===
[[Contemporary philosophy|Contemporary]] deontologists (scholars born in the first half of the 20th century) include [[Józef Maria Bocheński]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[T. M. Scanlon|Thomas Scanlon]], and [[Roger Scruton]].

Bocheński (1965) makes a distinction between deontic and [[epistemology|epistemic]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Bocheński (1965), Analysis of authority, in ''The Logic of Religion,'' New York: New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814700501}}, pages 162–173&lt;/ref&gt; 
A typical example of epistemic authority in Bocheński's usage would be "the relation of a teacher to his students" or "the relation between an employer and his employee".&lt;ref name=annabrozek115/&gt; A teacher has epistemic authority when making declarative sentences that the student presumes is reliable knowledge and appropriate but feels no obligation to accept or obey; in contrast, an employer has deontic authority in the act of issuing an order that the employee is obliged to accept and obey regardless of its reliability or appropriateness.&lt;ref name=annabrozek115&gt;[[Anna Brożek]] (2013), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11212-013-9175-9 Bocheński on authority], Studies in East European Thought, Volume 65, Issue 1, pages 115–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deontology and consequentialism===
{{see|Trolley problem|Consequentialism|Utilitarianism|Effective altruism}}
[[Frances Kamm]]'s "Principle of Permissible Harm" (1996) is an effort to derive a deontological constraint which coheres with our considered case judgments while also relying heavily on Kant's [[categorical imperative]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 1996. ''Morality, Mortality Vol. II: Rights, Duties, and Status''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Principle states that one may harm in order to save more if and only if the harm is an effect or an aspect of the greater good itself. This principle is meant to address what Kamm feels are most people's considered case judgments, many of which involve deontological intuitions. 
For instance, Kamm argues that we believe it would be impermissible to kill one person to harvest his organs in order to save the lives of five others. Yet, we think it is morally permissible to divert a [[trolley problem|runaway trolley]] that would otherwise kill five [[innocent]] and immobile [[people]] onto a side track where one innocent and immobile person will be killed. 
Kamm believes the Principle of Permissible Harm explains the moral difference between these and other cases, and more importantly expresses a constraint telling us exactly when we may not act to bring about good ends—such as in the organ harvesting case. 
In 2007, Kamm published a book that presents new theory that incorporates aspects of her "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity".&lt;ref&gt;Kamm, F. M. 2007. 'Chapter 5: Toward the Essence of Nonconsequentialist Constraints on Harming.'. In ''Intricate Ethics: Rights, Responsibilities, and Permissible Harm''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-518969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the "Principle of Permissible Harm", the "Doctrine of Productive Purity" is an attempt to provide a deontological prescription for determining the circumstances in which people are permitted to act in a way that harms others.

Attempts have been made to reconcile deontology with virtue-based ethics and [[consequentialism]]. 
[[Iain King]]'s 2008 book ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'' uses [[quasi-realism]] and a modified form of [[utilitarianism]] to develop deontological principles which are compatible with ethics based on [[Virtue ethics|virtues]] and consequences. King develops a hierarchy of principles to link his meta-ethics, which are more inclined towards consequentialism, with the deontological conclusions he presents in his book.&lt;ref name="King2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = King| first = Iain| title = How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;pg=PA220| date = 2008| publisher = Continuum| isbn = 978-1-84706-347-2| page = 245 }} Page 220 of this book lists fourteen deontological principles, which it describes as "The first fourteen principles of right and wrong".&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly, '''digital theatre''' is a hybrid art form, gaining strength from [[theatre]]’s ability to facilitate the imagination and create human connections and [[Digital data|digital]] technology’s ability to extend the reach of communication and visualization. (However, the phrase is also used in a more generic sense by companies such as [[Evans and Sutherland]] to refer to their [[fulldome]] projection technology products.)

==Description== 
Digital theatre is primarily identified by the coexistence of “live” performers and digital [[Electronic media|media]] in the same unbroken(1) space with a co-present audience. In addition to the necessity that its performance must be simultaneously “live” and digital, the event’s secondary characteristics are that its content should retain some recognizable theatre roles (through limiting the level of [[interactivity]]) and a narrative element of spoken language or text. The four conditions of digital theatre are:

#It is a “live” performance placing at least some performers in the same shared physical space with an audience.(2)
#The performance must use digital technology as an essential part of the primary artistic event.(3)
#The performance contains only limited levels of [[interactivity]],(4) in that its content is shaped primarily by the artist(s) for an audience.(5)
#The performance’s content should contain either spoken language or text which might constitute a [[narrative]] or story, differentiating it from other events which are distinctly [[dance]], [[art]], or [[music]].

==”Live,” digital media, interactivity, and narrative==
A brief clarification of these terms in relation to digital theatre is in order. The significance of the terms “live” or “liveness” as they occur in [[theatre]] can not be over-emphasized, as it is set in opposition to [[Digital data|digital]] in order to indicate the presence of both types of communication, human and computer-created. Rather than considering the real-time or temporality of events, digital theatre concerns the interactions of people (audience and actors) sharing the same physical space (in at least one location, if multiple audiences exist). In the case of mass broadcast, it is essential that this sharing of public space occurs at the site of the primary artistic event.(6) The next necessary condition for creating digital theatre is the presence of digital media in the performance. [[Digital media]] is not defined through the presence of one type of technology hardware or software configuration, but by its characteristics of being flexible, mutable, easily adapted, and able to be processed in real-time. It is the ability to change not only sound and light, but also images, [[video]], [[animation]], and other content into triggered, manipulated, and reconstituted data which is relayed or transmitted in relation to other impulses which defines the essential nature of the digital format.  Digital information has the quality of pure computational potential, which can be seen as parallel to the potential of human imagination.

The remaining characteristics of limited interactivity and narrative or spoken word are secondary and less distinct parameters.  While [[interactivity]] can apply to both the interaction between humans and machines and between humans, digital theatre is primarily concerned with the levels of interactivity occurring between audience and performers (as it is facilitated through technology).(7)  It is in this type of interactivity, similar to other types of heightened audience participation,(8) that the roles of message sender and receiver can dissolve to that of equal conversers, causing theatre to dissipate into conversation.  The term “[[interactive]]” refers to any mutually or reciprocally active communication, whether it be a human-human or a human-machine communication.

The criteria of having [[narrative]] content through spoken language or text as part of the theatrical event is meant not to limit the range of what is already considered standard theatre (as there are examples in the works of [[Samuel Beckett]] in which the limits of verbal expression are tested), but to differentiate between that which is digital theatre and the currently more developed fields of digital dance9 and Art Technology.(10)  This is necessary because of the mutability between art forms utilizing technology.  It is also meant to suggest a wide range of works including dance theatre involving technology and spoken words such as [[Troika Ranch]]’s [[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]] (Troika Ranch, 2000), to the creation of original text-based works online by performers like the Plain Text Players or collaborations such as Art Grid’s Interplay: Hallucinations, to pre-scripted works such as the classics (''[[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]])'' staged with technology at the [[University of Kansas]] and the [[University of Georgia]].

The Participatory Virtual Theatre efforts at the Rochester Institute of Technology take a different approach by have live actors use motion capture to control avatars on a virtual stage.  Audience responses are designed into the software that supports the performance.  In the 2004 production, "What's the Buzz?" (17), a single node motion capture device controlled the performance of a swarm of bees. Later performances use two motion capture systems located in different buildings controlling the performance on a single virtual stage (18).

These criteria or limiting parameters are flexible enough to allow for a wide range of theatrical activities while refining the scope of events to those which most resemble the hybrid “live”/mediated form of theatre described as digital theatre.  digital theatre is separated from the larger category of digital performance (as expressed in the overabundance of a variety of items including installations, dance concerts, [[Compact disc]]s, robot fights and other events found in the Digital Performance Archive).

==History==
In the early 1980s, video, satellites, fax machines, and other communications equipment began to be used as methods of creating art and performance. The groups [[Fluxus]] and [[John Cage]] were among the early leaders in expanding what was considered art, technology, and performance.  With the adaptation of personal computers in the 1980s, new possibilities for creating performance communications was born.  Artists like Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway began to transition from earlier, more costly experiments with satellite transmission to experiments with the developing internet.  Online communities such as [[WELL (virtual community)|The Well]] and [[interactive writing]] offered new models for artistic creativity.  With the ‘Dot Com’ boom of the 1990s, telematic artists including [[Roy Ascott]] began to develop greater significance as theatre groups like [[George Coates|George Coates Performance Works]] and Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre established partnerships with software and hardware companies encouraged by the technology boom.In Australia in the early 1990s Julie Martin's Virtual Reality Theatre presented works at the Sydney Opera House, featuring the first hybrid human digital avatars, in 1996 "A Midsummer Nights Dream featured Augmented Reality Stage sets designed and produced by her company.  Researchers such as Claudio Pinanhez at [[MIT]], David Saltz of The Interactive Performance Laboratory at the University of Georgia, and Mark Reaney head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the [[University of Kansas]], as well as significant [[dance technology]] partnerships (including Riverbed and Riverbed’s work with [[Merce Cunningham]]) led to an unprecedented expansion in the use of digital technology in creating media-rich performances (including the use of [[motion capture]], 3D stereoscopic animation, and [[virtual reality]] as in The Virtual Theatricality Lab‘s production of ''The Skriker'' at [[Henry Ford Community College]] under the direction of Dr. George Popovich. Another example is the [http://www.stenslie.net/?page_id=69 sense:less] project by [[Stahl Stenslie|Stenslie]]/Mork/Watz/Pendry using virtual actors that users would engage with inside a VR environment. The project was shown at ELECTRA, Henie Onstad Art Center, Norway,  [http://www.v2.nl/archive/works/sense-less DEAF 1996] in Rotterdam and the Fifth Istanbul Biennial (1997).

Early use of mechanical and projection devices for theatrical entertainments have a long history tracing back to mechanicals of [[ancient Greece]] and medieval [[magic lantern]]s.  But the most significant precursors of digital theatre can be seen in the works of the early 20th century.  It is in the ideas of artists including [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Erwin Piscator]] (and to a limited degree [[Bertolt Brecht]] in their joint work on [[Epic Theatre]]), [[Josef Svoboda]], and the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Futurists]] movements that we can see the strongest connections between today’s use of digital media and live actors, and earlier, experimental theatrical use of non-human actors, broadcast technology, and filmic projections.

The presence of these theatrical progenitors using analog media, such as filmic projection, provides a bridge between [[Theatre]] and many of today’s vast array of computer-art-performance-communication experiments.  These past examples of theatre artists integrating their modern technology with theatre strengthens the argument that theatrical entertainment does not have to be either purist involving only “live” actors on stage, or be consumed by the dominant televisual [[mass media]], but can gain from the strengths of both types of communication.

==Other terminology==
Digital theatre does not exist in a vacuum but in relation to other terminology.  It is a type of [[Digital Performance]] and may accommodate many types of “live”/mediated theatre including “VR Theatre”(11) and “Computer Theatre,”(12) both of which involve specific types of computer media, “live” performers, story/words, and limited levels of interactivity.  However, terms such as “Desktop Theatre,”(13) using animated computer avatars in online chat-rooms without co-present audiences falls outside digital theatre into the larger category of digital performance.  Likewise, digital dance may fall outside the parameters of digital theatre, if it does not contain elements of story or spoken words.

"[[Cyberformance]]" can be included within this definition of Digital theatre, where it includes a proximal audience: "Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers."

==Notes==

#Space not divided by visible solid interfaces such as walls, glass screens, or other visible barriers which perceptually divide the audience from the playing space making two (or more) rooms rather than a continuous place including both stage and audience.
#It is suggested that a minimal audience of two or more is needed to keep a performance from being a conversation or art piece.  If additional online or mediated audiences exist, only one site need have a co-present audience/performer situation.
#Digital technology may be used to create, manipulate or influence content. However, the use of technology for transmission or archiving does not constitute a performance of digital theatre.
#Interactivity is more than choices on a navigation menu, low levels of participation or getting a desired response to a request.  [[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defines it as existing in the relay of a message, in which the third or subsequent message refers back to the first.   “Formally stated, interactivity is an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions” (Sheizaf Rafaeli, “[https://www.academia.edu/download/44162252/Rafaeli_interactivity.pdf Interactivity, From New Media to Communication]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},” pages 110-34 in ''Advanced Communicational Science:  Merging Mass and Interpersonal Processes'', ed. Robert P. Hawkins, John M. Wiemann, and Suzanne Pingree [Newbury Park:  Sage Publications, 1988] 111).
#Though some of the content may be formed or manipulated by both groups, the flow of information is primarily from message creator or sender to receiver, thus maintaining the roles of author/performer and audience (rather than dissolving those roles into equal participants in a conversation). This also excludes gaming or VR environments in which the (usually isolated) participant is the director of the action which his actions drive.
#While TV studio audiences may feel that they are at a public “live” performance, these performances are often edited and remixed for the benefit of their intended primary audience, the home audiences which are viewing the mass broadcast in private.  Broadcasts of “Great Performances” by PBS and other theatrical events broadcast into private homes, give the TV viewers the sense that they are secondary viewers of a primary “live” event.  In addition, archival or real-time web-casts which do not generate feedback influencing the “live” performances are not within the range of digital theatre.  In each case, a visible interface such as TV or monitor screen, like a camera frames and interprets the original event for the viewers.
#An example of this is the case of internet chat which becomes the main text of be read or physically interpreted by performers on stage.  Online input including content and directions can also have an effect of influencing “live” performance beyond the ability of “live” co-present audiences.
#E.g. [[happenings]].
#Such as the stunning visual media dance concerts like ''Ghostcatching'', by Merce Cunningham and Riverbed, accessible online via the revamped/migrated Digital Performance Archive ''[http://www.ahds.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/dpa/authorsearch.do?string=D&amp;searchbox=merce]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050323232028/http://merce.org/home.html Merce Cunningham Dance]''; cf. Isabel C. Valverde, “Catching Ghosts in ''Ghostcatching'':  Choreographing Gender and Race in Riverbed/Bill T. Jones’ Virtual Dance,” accessible in a pdf version from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051102005319/http://www.wac.ucla.edu/extensionsjournal/v2/pdf/valverde.pdf Extensions: The Online Journal of Embodied Teaching]''.
#Such as ''Telematic Dreaming'', by Paul Sermon, in which distant participants shared a bed through mixing projected video streams; see [http://www.hgb-leipzig.de/~sermon/dream/ "Telematic Dreaming - Statement."]
#Mark Reaney, head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, investigates the use of virtual reality (“and related technologies”) in theatre.  “VR Theatre” is one form or subset of digital theatre focusing on utilizing virtual reality immersion in mutual concession with traditional theatre practices (actors, directors, plays, a theatre environment).  The group uses image projection and stereoscopic sets as their primary area of digital investigation.
#Another example of digital theatre is Computer Theatre, as defined by Claudio S. Pinhanez in his work '''Computer Theatre'' (in which he also gives the definition of “hyper-actor” as an actor whose expressive capabilities are extended through the use of technologies).  “Computer Theatre, in my view, is about providing means to enhance the artistic possibilities and experiences of professional and amateur actors, or of audiences clearly engaged in a representational role in a performance”  (''Computer Theater'' [Cambridge:  Perceptual Computing Group -- MIT Media Laboratory, 1996] (forthcoming in a revised ed.); Pinhanez also sees this technology being explored more through dance than theatre.  His writing and his productions of ''I/IT'' suggest that ''Computer Theatre'' is digital theatre.
#On the far end of the spectrum, outside of the parameters of digital theatre, are what are called Desktop Theater and Virtual Theatre.  These are digital performances or media events which are created and presented on computers utilizing intelligent agents or synthetic characters, called avatars.  Often these are interactive computer programs or online conversations.  Without human actors, or group audiences, these works are computer multimedia interfaces allowing a user to play at the roles of theatre rather than being theatre.  Virtual Theatre is defined by the Virtual Theatre Project at Stanford on their website as a project which “aims to provide a multimedia environment in which user can play all of the creative roles associated with producing and performing plays and stories in an improvisational theatre company.”
#For more information, see ''Multimedia:  From Wagner to Virtual Reality'', ed. Randall Packer and Ken Jordan; ''Telepresence and Bio Art'', by Eduardo Kac; and ''Virtual Theatres:  An Introduction'', by Gabriella Giannachi (London and New York: Routledge, 2004).
#Media, in this sense, indicates the broadcast and projection of film, video, images and other content which can, but need not be digitized.  These elements are often seen as additions to traditional forms of theatre even before the use of computers to process them.  The addition of computers to process visual, aural and other data allows for greater flexibility in translating visual and other information into impulses which can interact with each other and their environments in real-time.  Media is also distinguished from mass media, by which primarily means TV broadcast, Film, and other communications resources owned by multi-national media corporations.  Mass media is that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the majority of the population of a nation state).  It refers primarily to television, film, internet, and various news/entertainment corporations and their subsidiaries.
#Here the use of quotations signals a familiarity with the issues of mediation vs. real-time events as expressed by Phillip Auslander, yet choosing to use the term in its earlier meaning, indicating co-present human audience and actors in the same shared breathing space unrestrained by a physical barrier or perceived interface.  This earlier meaning is still in standard use by digital media performers to signify the simultaneous presence of the human and the technological other.  It is possible also to use the term (a)live to indicate co-presence.

{{Medical anthropology}}
A '''double bind''' is an emotionally distressing [[dilemma]] in [[communication]] in which an individual (or group) receives two or more conflicting messages, with one negating the other. This creates a situation in which a successful response to one message results in a failed response to the other (and vice versa), so that the person will automatically be wrong regardless of response.  The double bind occurs when the person cannot confront the inherent dilemma, and therefore can neither resolve it nor opt out of the situation.

Double bind theory was first described by [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"&gt;Bateson, G., Jackson, D. D., Haley, J. &amp; Weakland, J., 1956, Toward a theory of schizophrenia.''Behavioral Science'', Vol. 1, 251–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Double binds are often utilized as a form of control without open coercion—the use of confusion makes them both difficult to respond to as well as to resist.&lt;ref name="ecology"&gt;{{cite book
 | author=Bateson, Gregory
 | title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology
 | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 271-278.

A double bind generally includes different levels of abstraction in the order of messages and these messages can either be stated explicitly or implicitly within the context of the situation, or they can be conveyed by tone of voice or body language. Further complications arise when frequent double binds are part of an ongoing relationship to which the person or group is committed.&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecology"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
The double bind is often misunderstood to be a simple contradictory situation, where the subject is trapped by two conflicting demands. While it's true that the core of the double bind is two conflicting demands, the difference lies in how they are imposed upon the subject, what the subject's understanding of the situation is, and who (or what) imposes these demands upon the subject. Unlike the usual [[no-win situation]], the subject has difficulty in defining the exact nature of the [[paradox]]ical situation in which he or she is caught. The [[contradiction]] may be unexpressed in its immediate context and therefore invisible to external observers, only becoming evident when a prior communication is considered. Typically, a demand is imposed upon the subject by someone whom he or she respects (such as a parent, teacher, or doctor) but the demand itself is inherently impossible to fulfill because some broader context forbids it. For example, this situation arises when a person in a position of [[authority]] imposes two contradictory conditions but there exists an unspoken rule that one must never question authority.

Gregory Bateson and his colleagues defined the double bind as follows&lt;ref name="schizophrenia"/&gt; (paraphrased):
{{ordered list|start=1
| The situation involves two or more people, one of whom (for the purpose of the definition), is designated as the "subject". The others are people who are considered the subject's superiors: figures of authority (such as parents), whom the subject respects.
| Repeated experience: the double bind is a recurrent theme in the experience of the subject, and as such, cannot be resolved as a single traumatic experience.
| A ‘primary [[injunction]]’ is imposed on the subject by the others generally in one of two forms:
*(a) “Do ''X'', or I will punish you”;
*(b) “Do not do ''X'', or I will punish you.”
The punishment may include the withdrawing of love, the expression of hate and anger, or abandonment resulting from the authority figure's expression of helplessness.
|4= A ‘secondary injunction’ is imposed on the subject, conflicting with the first at a higher and more abstract level. For example: “You must do ''X'', but only do it because you want to.” It is unnecessary for this injunction to be expressed verbally.
|5= If necessary, a ‘tertiary injunction’ is imposed on the subject to prevent them from escaping the dilemma. See phrase examples below for clarification.
|6= Finally, Bateson states that the complete list of the previous requirements may be unnecessary, in the event that the subject is already viewing their world in double bind patterns. Bateson goes on to give the general characteristics of such a relationship:
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
|1= ''When the subject is involved in an intense relationship; that is, a relationship in which he feels it is vitally important that he discriminate accurately what sort of message is being communicated so that he may respond appropriately;''
|2= ''And, the subject is caught in a situation in which the other person in the relationship is expressing two orders of message and one of these denies the other;''
|3= ''And, the subject is unable to comment on the messages being expressed to correct his discrimination of what order of message to respond to: i.e., he cannot make a [[Metacommunicative competence|metacommunicative]] statement.''
}}}}

Thus, the essence of a double bind is two conflicting demands, ''each on a different logical level'', neither of which can be ignored or escaped. This leaves the subject torn both ways, so that whichever demand they try to meet, the other demand cannot be met. "I must do it, but I can't do it" is a typical description of the double-bind experience.

For a double bind to be effective, the subject must be unable to confront or resolve the conflict between the demand placed by the primary injunction and that of the secondary injunction. In this sense, the double bind differentiates itself from a simple contradiction to a more inexpressible internal conflict, where the subject really ''wants'' to meet the demands of the primary injunction, but fails each time through an inability to address the situation's incompatibility with the demands of the secondary injunction. Thus, subjects may express feelings of extreme [[anxiety]] in such a situation, as they attempt to fulfil the demands of the primary injunction albeit with obvious contradictions in their actions.

This was a problem in United States legal circles prior to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] being [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|applied to state action]]. A person could be subpoenaed to testify in a federal case and given Fifth Amendment immunity for testimony in that case. However, since the immunity did not apply to a state prosecution, the person could refuse to testify at the Federal level despite being given immunity, thus subjecting the person to imprisonment for contempt of court, or the person could testify, and the information he or she was forced to give in the Federal proceeding could then be used to convict the person in a state proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/378/52/case.html Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n], 378 U.S. 52 (1964) ("One jurisdiction in our federal system may not, absent an immunity provision, compel a witness to give testimony which might incriminate him under the laws of another jurisdiction.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term ''double bind'' was first used by the [[anthropologist]] [[Gregory Bateson]] and his colleagues (including [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Don D. Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]] and [[John Weakland|John H. Weakland]]) in the mid-1950s in their discussions on complexity of communication in relation to [[schizophrenia]]. Bateson made clear that such complexities are common in normal circumstances, especially in "play, humour, poetry, ritual and fiction" (see [[#Theory of logical types|Logical Types]] below). Their findings indicated that the tangles in communication often diagnosed as schizophrenia are not necessarily the result of an organic brain dysfunction. Instead, they found that destructive double binds were a frequent pattern of communication among families of patients, and they proposed that growing up amidst perpetual double binds could lead to learned patterns of confusion in thinking and communication.

==Complexity in communication==
Human communication is complex, and context is an essential part of it. Communication consists of the words said, tone of voice, and body language. It also includes how these relate to what has been said in the past; what is not said, but is implied; how these are modified by other nonverbal cues, such as the environment in which it is said, and so forth. For example, if someone says "I love you", one takes into account who is saying it, their [[tone of voice]] and [[body language]], and the context in which it is said. It may be a declaration of passion or a serene reaffirmation, insincere and/or manipulative, an implied demand for a response, a joke, its public or private context may affect its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], and so forth.

Conflicts in communication are common and often we ask "What do you mean?" or seek clarification in other ways. This is called ''[[meta-communication]]:'' communication about the communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/meta-communication-what-i-said-isnt-what-i-meant/|title=Meta-communication: What I Said Isn’t What I Meant {{!}} Psych Central|date=2016-05-17|newspaper=Psych Central|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, asking for clarification is impossible. Communication difficulties in ordinary life often occur when meta-communication and feedback systems are lacking or inadequate or there isn't enough time for clarification.
 
Double binds can be extremely stressful and become destructive when one is trapped in a dilemma and punished for finding a way out.  But making the effort to find the way out of the trap can lead to emotional growth.

==Examples==
The classic example given of a negative double bind is of a mother telling her child that she loves him or her, while at the same time turning away in disgust, or inflicting [[corporal punishment]] as discipline:&lt;ref&gt;Koopmans, Mathijs. [http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1997/Koopmans.html] ''Schizophrenia and the Family: Double Bind Theory Revisited'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; the words are socially acceptable; the body language is in conflict with it. The child does not know how to respond to the conflict between the words and the body language and, because the child is dependent on the mother for basic needs, they are in a quandary. Small children have difficulty articulating contradictions verbally and can neither ignore them nor leave the relationship.

Another example is when one is commanded to "be spontaneous". The very command contradicts spontaneity, but it only becomes a double bind when one can neither ignore the command nor comment on the contradiction. 
Often, the contradiction in communication is not apparent to bystanders unfamiliar with previous communications.

===Phrase examples===
* Mother telling her child: "You must love me".
: The primary injunction here is the command itself: "you must"; the secondary injunction is the unspoken reality that love is spontaneous, that for the child to love the mother genuinely, it can only be of his or her own accord.
* Child-abuser to child: "You should have escaped from me earlier, now it's too late—because now, nobody will believe that you didn't want what I have done", while at the same time blocking all of the child's attempts to escape.

: Child-abusers often start the double-bind relationship by "[[Child grooming|grooming]]" the child, giving little concessions, or gifts or privileges to them, thus the primary injunction is: "You should like what you are getting from me!"

: When the child begins to go along (i.e. begins to like what she or he is receiving from the person), then the interaction goes to the next level and small [[victimization]] occurs, with the secondary injunction being: "I am punishing you! (for whatever reason the child-abuser is coming up with, e.g. "because you were bad/naughty/messy", or "because you deserve it", or "because you made me do it", etc.).

: If child shows any resistance (or tries to escape) from the abuser, then the words: "You should have escaped from me earlier (...)" serve as the third level or tertiary injunction.

: Then the loop starts to feed on itself, allowing for ever worse victimization to occur.

* Mother to son: "Leave your sister alone!", while the son knows his sister will approach and antagonize him to get him into trouble.

: The primary injunction is the command, which he will be punished for breaking. The secondary injunction is the knowledge that his sister will get into conflict with him, but his mother will not know the difference and will default to punishing him. He may be under the impression that if he argues with his mother, he may be punished. One possibility for the son to escape this double bind is to realize that his sister only antagonizes him to make him feel anxious (if indeed it is the reason behind his sister's behavior).

: If he were not bothered about punishment, his sister might not bother him. He could also leave the situation entirely, avoiding both the mother and the sister. The sister can't claim to be bothered by a non-present brother, and the mother can't punish (nor scapegoat) a non-present son. Other solutions exist too, which are based on the creative application of logic and reasoning.
: An apt reply would be: "Please tell sis the same". If mother wants to 'scapegoat' him, her response will be negative. The command has a negative undertone towards the son.

== Positive double binds ==

Bateson also described positive double binds, both in relation to [[Zen Buddhism]] with its path of spiritual growth, and the use of therapeutic double binds by psychiatrists to confront their patients with the contradictions in their life in such a way that would help them heal. One of Bateson's consultants, [[Milton H. Erickson]] (5 volumes, edited by Rossi) eloquently demonstrated the productive possibilities of double binds through his own life, showing the technique in a brighter light.

== Science ==

One of the causes of double binds is the loss of [[feedback]] systems.  Gregory Bateson and Lawrence S. Bale describe double binds that have arisen in science that have caused decades-long delays of progress in science because the scientific community had defined something as outside of its scope (or as "not science")—see Bateson in his ''Introduction'' to Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972, 2000), pp. xv–xxvi; and Bale in his article, ''Gregory Bateson, Cybernetics and the Social/Behavioral Sciences'' (esp. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–8) on the paradigm of classical science vs. that of systems theory/cybernetics. (See also Bateson's description in his ''Forward'' of how the double bind hypothesis fell into place).

==  Work by Bateson  ==

=== Schizophrenia ===
The Double Bind Theory was first articulated in relationship to schizophrenia, but Bateson and his colleagues hypothesized that schizophrenic thinking was not necessarily an inborn mental disorder but a learned confusion in thinking.
It is helpful to remember the context in which these ideas were developed. Bateson and his colleagues were working in the Veteran's Administration Hospital (1949–1962) with World War II veterans. As soldiers they'd been able to function well in combat, but the effects of life-threatening stress had affected them.  At that time, 18 years before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was officially recognized, the veterans had been saddled with the catch-all diagnosis of schizophrenia.  Bateson didn't challenge the diagnosis but he did maintain that the seeming nonsense the patients said at times did make sense within context, and he gives numerous examples in section III of ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind'', "Pathology in Relationship". For example, a patient misses an appointment, and when Bateson finds him later the patient says 'the judge disapproves'; Bateson responds, "You need a defense lawyer" see following (pp.&amp;nbsp;195–6) Bateson also surmised that people habitually caught in double binds in childhood would have greater problems—that in the case of the schizophrenic, the double bind is presented continually and habitually within the family context from infancy on. By the time the child is old enough to have identified the double bind situation, it has already been internalized, and the child is unable to confront it. The solution then is to create an escape from the conflicting logical demands of the double bind, in the world of the [[delusion]]al system (see in ''Towards a Theory of Schizophrenia&amp;nbsp;– Illustrations from Clinical Data'').

One solution to a double bind is to place the problem in a larger context, a state Bateson identified as Learning III, a step up from Learning II (which requires only learned responses to reward/consequence situations). In Learning III, the double bind is contextualized and understood as an impossible no-win scenario so that ways around it can be found.

Bateson's double bind theory was never followed up by research into whether family systems imposing systematic double binds might be a cause of schizophrenia.  This complex theory has been only partly tested, and there are gaps in the current [[Psychology|psychological]] and experimental evidence required to establish [[wikt:causation|causation]] [citation?]. The current understanding of [[schizophrenia]] emphasizes the robust scientific evidence for a genetic predisposition to the disorder, with psychosocial stressors, including dysfunctional family interaction patterns, as secondary causative factors in some instances.

=== Evolution ===

After many years of research into schizophrenia, Bateson continued to explore problems of communication and learning, first with dolphins, and then with the more abstract processes of [[evolution]]. Bateson emphasised that any communicative system characterized by different logical levels might be subject to double bind problems. Especially including the communication of characteristics from one generation to another (genetics and evolution).

"...evolution always followed the pathways of viability. As Lewis Carroll has pointed out, the theory [of natural selection] explains quite satisfactorily why there are no bread-and-butter-flies today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title=Cybernetic Explanation|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=April 1967|volume=10|issue=8|pages=29–32|doi=10.1177/0002764201000808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson used the fictional Bread and Butter Fly (from ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'') to illustrate the double bind in terms of natural selection. The gnat points out that the insect would be doomed if he found his food (which would dissolve his own head), and starve if he did not. Alice suggests that this must happen quite often, to which the gnat replies "it always happens".

The pressures that drive evolution therefore represent a genuine double bind. And there is truly no escape: "It always happens." No species can escape natural selection, including our own.

Bateson suggested that all evolution is driven by the double bind, whenever circumstances change: If any environment becomes toxic to any species, that species will die out unless it transforms into another species, in which case, the species becomes extinct anyway.

Most significant here is Bateson's exploration of what he later came to call 'the pattern that connects'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson|first=Gregory|title=Mind and Nature|year=1979|isbn=978-1-57273-434-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;that problems of communication which span more than one level (e.g., the relationship between the individual and the family) should also be expected to be found spanning other pairs of levels in the hierarchy (e.g. the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype):

"We are very far, then, from being able to pose specific questions for the geneticist; but I believe that the wider implications of what I have been saying modify somewhat the philosophy of genetics. Our approach to the problems of schizophrenia by way of a theory of levels or logical types has disclosed first that the problems of adaptation and learning and their pathologies must be considered in terms of a hierarchic system in which stochastic change occurs at the boundary points between the segments of the hierarchy. We have considered three such regions of stochastic change&amp;mdash;the level of genetic mutation, the level of learning, and the level of change in family organization. We have disclosed the possibility of a relationship of these levels which orthodox genetics would deny, and we have disclosed that at least in human societies the evolutionary system consists not merely in the selective survival of those persons who happen to select appropriate environments but also in the modification of family environment in a direction which might enhance the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the individual members."

{{quote|Far from being restricted to a limited number of pathological cases, as American theoreticians suggest, the double bind—a contradictory double imperative, or rather a whole network of contradictory imperatives—is an extremely common phenomenon. In fact, it is so common that it might be said to form the basis of all human relationships.

Bateson is undoubtedly correct in believing that the effects of the double bind on the child are particularly devastating. All the grown-up voices around him, beginning with those of the father and mother (voices which, in our society at least, speak for the culture with the force of established authority) exclaim in a variety of accents, "Imitate us!" "Imitate me!" "I bear the secret of life, of true being!" The more attentive the child is to these seductive words, and the more earnestly he responds to the suggestions emanating from all sides, the more devastating will be the eventual conflicts. The child possesses no perspective that will allow him to see things as they are. He has no basis for reasoned judgements, no means of foreseeing the metamorphosis of his model into a rival. This model's opposition reverberates in his mind like a terrible condemnation; he can only regard it as an act of excommunication. The future orientation of his desires—that is, the choice of his future models—will be significantly affected by the dichotomies of his childhood. In fact, these models will determine the shape of his personality.

If desire is allowed its own bent, its mimetic nature will almost always lead it into a double bind. The unchanneled mimetic impulse hurls itself blindly against the obstacle of a conflicting desire. It invites its own rebuffs and these rebuffs will in turn strengthen the mimetic inclination. We have, then, a self-perpetuating process, constantly increasing in simplicity and fervor. Whenever the disciple borrows from his model what he believes to be the "true" object, he tries to possess that truth by desiring precisely what this model desires. Whenever he sees himself closest to the supreme goal, he comes into violent conflict with a rival. By a mental shortcut that is both eminently logical and self-defeating, he convinces himself that the violence itself is the most distinctive attribute of this supreme goal! Ever afterward, violence will invariably awaken desire...|[[René Girard]]|''Violence and the Sacred'': "From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double", pp.156–157}}

==Neuro-linguistic programming==
The field of [[neuro-linguistic programming]] also makes use of the expression "double bind". [[John Grinder|Grinder]] and [[Richard Bandler|Bandler]] (both of whom had personal contact with Bateson and Erickson) asserted that a message could be constructed with multiple messages, whereby the recipient of the message is given the impression of choice—although both options have the same outcome at a higher level of intention. This is called a "double bind" in NLP terminology,&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1981"&gt;Bandler, R., Grinder, J. (1981) Reframing: Neuro-Linguistic Programming and the Transformation of Meaning Real People Press. {{ISBN|0-911226-25-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has applications in both sales and therapy. In therapy, the practitioner may seek to challenge destructive double binds that limit the client in some way and may also construct double binds in which both options have therapeutic consequences. In a sales context, the speaker may give the respondent the illusion of choice between two possibilities. For example, a salesperson might ask: "Would you like to pay cash or by credit card?", with both outcomes presupposing that the person will make the purchase; whereas the third option (that of not buying) is intentionally excluded from the spoken choices.

Note that in the NLP context, the use of the phrase "double bind" does not carry the primary definition of two conflicting messages; it is about creating a false sense of choice which ultimately binds to the intended outcome. In the "cash or credit card?" example, this is not a "Bateson double bind" since there is no contradiction, although it still is an "NLP double bind". Similarly if a salesman were selling a [[Steal This Book|book about the evils of commerce]], it could perhaps be a "Bateson double bind" if the buyer happened to believe that commerce was evil, yet felt compelled or obliged to buy the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11439">A '''Dynamic Global Vegetation Model''' (DGVM) is a computer program that [[computer simulation|simulates]] shifts in potential vegetation and its associated [[biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical]] and [[hydrological cycle]]s as a response to shifts in climate. DGVMs use [[time series]] of [[climate]] data and, given constraints of latitude, topography, and soil characteristics, simulate monthly or daily dynamics of ecosystem processes.  DGVMs are used most often to simulate the effects of future [[climate change]] on natural [[vegetation]] and its [[carbon cycle|carbon]] and water cycles.

DGVMs generally combine [[biogeochemistry]], [[biogeography]], and disturbance submodels.  Disturbance is often limited to [[wildfire]]s, but in principle could include any of: forest/land management decisions, [[windthrow]], insect damage, ozone damage etc.  DGVMs usually "spin up" their simulations from bare ground to equilibrium vegetation (e.g. [[climax community]]) to establish realistic initial values for their various "pools": carbon and nitrogen in live and dead vegetation, [[soil organic matter]], etc. corresponding to a documented historical vegetation cover.

DGVMs are usually run in a spatially distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of "cells", geographic points which are assumed to have homogeneous conditions within each cell.  Simulations are carried out across a range of spatial scales, from global to landscape.  Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc-seconds.  Simulations of the conterminous United States in the first DGVM comparison exercise (LPJ and MC1) called the VEMAP&lt;ref&gt;VEMAP Members. 1995. Vegetation/ecosystem modeling and analysis project: comparing biogeography and biogeochemistry models in a continental-scale study of terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate change and CO2 doubling. Global Biogeochemical Cycles. 9(4):407–437&lt;/ref&gt; project in the 1990s used a lattice grain of one-half degree. Global simulations by the PIK group and collaborators &lt;ref&gt;Cramer, W., A. Bondeau, F.I. Woodward, I.C. Prentice, R. Betts, V. Brovkin, P.M. Cox, V. Fischer, J.A. Foley, A.D. Friend, C. Kucharik, M.R. Lomas, N. Ramankutty, S. Sitch, B. Smith, A. White, and C. Young-Molling. 2001. Global response of terrestrial ecosystem structure and function to CO2 and climate change: results from six dynamic global vegetation models. Global Change Biology 7:357–373&lt;/ref&gt; using 6 different DGVMs (HYBRID, IBIS, LPJ, SDGVM, TRIFFID, and VECODE) used the same resolution as the [[general circulation model]] (GCM) that provided the climate data, 3.75 deg longitude x 2.5 deg latitude, a total of 1631 land grid cells.  Sometimes lattice distances are specified in kilometers rather than angular measure, especially for finer grains, so a project like VEMAP &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/vemap/&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as 50&amp;nbsp;km grain.

Several DGVMs appeared in the middle 1990s.  The first was apparently IBIS (Foley et al., 1996), VECODE (Brovkin et al., 1997), followed by several others described below:

Several DGVMs have been developed by various research groups around the world:

The next generation of models – earth system models (ex. CCSM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; ORCHIDEE,&lt;ref&gt;http://orchidee.ipsl.jussieu.fr/&lt;/ref&gt; JULES,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jchmr.org/jules&lt;/ref&gt; CTEM&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cccma.bc.ec.gc.ca/ctem/&lt;/ref&gt; ) – now includes the important feedbacks from the biosphere to the atmosphere so that vegetation shifts and changes in the carbon and hydrological cycles affect the climate.

DGVMs commonly simulate a variety of plant and soil physiological processes. The processes simulated by various DGVMs are summarized in the table below.  
Abbreviations are: NPP, net [[primary production]]; PFT, plant functional type; SAW, [[soil water|soil available water]]; LAI, [[leaf area index]]; I, [[solar radiation]]; T, [[air temperature]]; Wr, root zone water supply; PET, potential [[evapotranspiration]]; vegc, total live vegetation carbon.

'''Flood Brothers Disposal''' is a family-owned waste management and recycling service based in [[Oakbrook Terrace, IL]] with offices in [[Chicago, IL]]. Flood Brothers Disposal's service area extends to 150 or more communities in the Chicago area. The business is a member of the National Solid Waste Management Association, the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solid Waste/Recycling Haulers|url=http://swancc.org/swancc-solid-waste-recycling-hauler-contracts|work=SWANCC Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Recycling Coalition, the Illinois Food Scrap Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFSC Members List|url=http://illinoiscomposts.org/ifsc-members/member-list|work=IFSC Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Waste &amp; Recycling Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NWRA Official Website|url=https://wasterecycling.org/|publisher=National Waste &amp; Recycling Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Illinois Recycling Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Brothers Disposal|url=http://www.illinoisrecycles.org/2014/11/flood-brothers-disposal-co/|work=Illinois Recycling Association Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Flood Brothers Disposal started operations with one truck and one employee, at 139 N. Clark St. in Chicago, Illinois. In 1963, the main center of operations moved to 5435 W. Chicago Ave. From 1970 to 1977, the company continued expansion and moved to several additional locations, eventually settling at 4827 W. Harrison St. in Chicago, where the company is presently based.

In 1988, the company expanded to include a fully automated recycling center, and in 1990, became the first licensed special waste hauler in the Chicago community. In 1996, Flood Brothers Disposal opened an additional facility in Carol Stream, Illinois. As of today, Flood Brothers Disposal services more than 150 communities in the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Brothers History|url=http://floodbrothersdisposal.com/about-us/history/|work=Flood Brothers Disposal Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of Operation==

Flood Brothers Disposal provides service in 150 communities in the Chicago area as of present day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communities We Serve|url=http://floodbrothersdisposal.com/about-us/communities-served/|work=Flood Brothers Disposal Website }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

In 2015, Flood Brothers Disposal was named "2015 Illinois Medium Family Business of the Year" by [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]]'s [[Quinlan School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illinois Family Business of the Year Awards|url=http://www.luc.edu/quinlan/fbc/fboy.shtml|work=Quinlan School of Business Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20572">The '''Greenhouse Effect''' is a theory of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justices' behavior, first proposed by [[Hoover Institution]] economist [[Thomas Sowell]] and popularized by [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Court of Appeals]] Senior Judge [[Laurence Silberman]] in a speech to [[The Federalist Society]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Martin Tolchin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/15/us/press-is-condemned-by-a-federal-judge-for-court-coverage.html Press Is Condemned By a Federal Judge For Court Coverage] ''The New York Times'', 6/15/1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tushnet, Mark. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Pr0YbpKnwgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+court+divided&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=87KMT6LZO8SjiQK0gf2ICA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A Court Divided"]. Norton, 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the word "Greenhouse" refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning reporter who covered the Supreme Court for the ''[[New York Times]]'' for 40 years. Silberman used the term to postulate a tendency of conservative [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justices to vote with the liberals more often as their careers progress due to a desire for favorable press coverage. He said "It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The existence of the Greenhouse Effect has been challenged by some commentators, who note it presumes a "vast, hegemonic liberal control over the media and academia"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=The Souter Factor |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2005/08/the_souter_factor.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and question whether professional decision makers who have "come to their views despite years of elite education and exposure to elite opinion" are really so malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Jon|title=The Drifters: Why The Supreme Court Makes Justices More Liberal|url=http://bostonreview.net/BR31.1/hansonbenforado.php|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=17 April 2012|author2=Adam Benforado}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence below suggests that conservative justices become liberal more often than liberals become conservative. Further, the existence of a more general version of the Greenhouse Effect, one not restricted to the media but rather "elites" in general or legal elites, is less controversial. Though this does not show causation, 75% of law professors who began their careers after 1986 identify as liberal, while only 10% identify as conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum |first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence suggests more "elite" journalists identify as liberal than conservative.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences"/&gt;

==Origins of the theory==

The Greenhouse Effect refers to [[Linda Greenhouse]], a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning ''[[New York Times]]'' Supreme Court reporter for over three decades, currently a Senior Fellow at [[Yale Law School]]. Greenhouse came under fire from conservatives for publicly espousing liberal viewpoints by participating in a 1989 pro-choice march and in remarks at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study|Radcliffe Institute]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shafer|first=jack|title=The Gas Over Linda Greenhouse |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/08/the_gas_over_linda_greenhouse.html|publisher=Slate|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aronoff|first=Roger|title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://www.aim.org/media-monitor/the-greenhouse-effect/|publisher=Accuracy In Media|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calame|first=Byron|title=Hazarding Personal Opinions in Public Can Be Hazardous for Journalists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/opinion/08pubed.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenhouse herself commented on the origins of the theory in an interview with NPR:

{{quote|Ms. Wertheimer: In a 1992 speech to the Federalist Society, Lawrence Silberman, who is an appeals court judge, referred to the greenhouse effect. By which he partly meant you, and he partly meant activist heat, he said, that the Times legal reporters put on recently appointed justices to try to influence their opinions. It certainly did kind of single you out as being an influential player in the world of the court.

Ms. Greenhouse: Well, Judge Silberman is giving credit for coming up with that snarky phrase, but actually, he swiped it off from Tom Bethell, the economist, who had put it in a column shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wertheimer|first=Linda|title=Supreme Court Reporter Linda Greenhouse Retires|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92489115|publisher=NPR|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is unclear whether Ms. Greenhouse meant to refer to Mr. Bethell or Mr. Sowell. Mr. Bethell, an editor at the ''[[American Spectator]]'' and another [[Hoover Institution]] fellow, started the "Strange New Respect Awards", which are given to conservatives who have become more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleszczynski|first=Wlady|title=Strange New Respect|url=http://spectator.org/blog/2007/03/05/strange-new-respect|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ms. Greenhouse is said by some to have inspired the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Scott|title=An Exceedingly Strange New Respect|url=http://www.looktruenorth.com/limited-government/49-conservatism/5837-an-exceedingly-strange-new-respect.html|publisher=Look True North}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Sowell is more often cited as the origin of the name of the theory.

==Example commentary incorporating the theory==

[[Pat Buchanan]], a conservative political commentator, wrote the passage below, after quoting Linda Greenhouse in reference to Justice [[John Paul Stevens]]' advocating for a reconsideration of the death penalty in ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'':

{{quote|For his defection to the abolitionist camp, the 88-year-old justice was rewarded with her patented deep massage by Linda Greenhouse, the veteran — and after 30 years retiring — Supreme Court reporter of The New York Times: "When Justice John Paul Stevens intervened in a Supreme Court argument on Wednesday to score a few points off the lawyer who was defending the death penalty for the rape of a child, the courtroom audience saw a master strategist at work, fully in command of the flow of the argument and the smallest details of the case. For those accustomed to watching Justice Stevens, it was a familiar sight." ... But had Stevens moved from left to right, rather than the reverse, one imagines Greenhouse's enthusiasm for the "master strategist" would have been well contained. What we see here is a textbook example of what U.S. Judge Laurence Silberman calls "The Greenhouse Effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Patrick |title=The Greenhouse Effect|url=http://buchanan.org/blog/pjb-the-greenhouse-effect-982|publisher=Patrick Buchanan|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==The Supreme Court and the media==

Supreme Court author, Larry Berkson, holds that the Supreme Court has two audiences: the highly attentive legal profession and the less engaged general public.&lt;ref name=Berkson&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkson|first=Larry|title=The Supreme Court and Its Publics|year=1978 |publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lexington, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If the Supreme Court is without the general public's backing, its authority may be eroded. However, the Court must remain independent of the ongoing political process. Richard Davis discusses this relationship with the Court and the public as, "the paradox of imagemaking – to engage in imagemaking while denying its existence to maintain the image."&lt;ref name=Davis9&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press |year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the majority of the general public does not have the time, interest or expertise to read the opinions for themselves, they must depend on newspapers, periodicals, radio and TV for its information.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite news|last=Warren|first=Earl |title=Statement on Special committee of Supreme Court Decisions|date=September 12, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justices have also been known to survey reporters to determine if they were interpreting their opinions as intended.  In these ways and more the Court also tried to shape the way the media covers the justices and their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|title=The Problem of Journalism: a political economic contribution to an explanation of the crisis in contemporary US journalism|year=2003 |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=229–329 |url=http://www.studiogaijin.org/iserlohn/wien/klasse/fernsehen/p299_s.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court also receives news of the public's reactions to its decisions through the press. Some scholars have postulated that swing justices, who have disproportionate influence over the court, may be more attuned to public opinion since their own policy preferences are weaker than their colleagues.&lt;ref name=Davis17-18&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard|title=Decisions and Images: The Supreme Court and the Press|year=1994 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-034505-9|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States|demographics of the Supreme Court]] reveal that Justices tend to be more highly educated and wealthy relative to the rest of the nation. In 2007, 7 of the 9 justices had a net worth of over a million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Bernie|title=Justices List Their Assets; Wide Range of Wealth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/washington/07scotus.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and all of the justices attended an [[Ivy League]] law school.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Social psychology|Social psychological theory]] holds that we seek approval from those similar to us, and those we interact with more often. In the court's case, this means Justices may be more influenced by elites than by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1515–1581|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical evidence of the effect's existence==

Regardless of the cause, it is well established that many Supreme Court Justices exhibit sizable shifts in voting patterns over their careers, much more so than would be expected for experienced jurists who are chosen for life service on the nation's highest court.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=Ideological Drift Among Supreme Court Justices: Who, When and How Important?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|pages=1483–1542|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence Baum found some evidence that supports the effect's existence. However, the research is not definitive at this point in time, as it is hampered by the small sample size of Supreme Court justices in the modern era. Furthermore, it is important to note that much of Baum's research focuses on the influence of "elite" opinion, not just the media. However, the evidence for the influence of "elite" opinion is more robust than the evidence for media specifically.

''[[Amicus curiae]]'' briefs and law review articles can influence the court by providing precedents or reasoning to support a position. In ''[[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]]'' the court overturned the precedent relating to school prayer that it had established in ''[[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]'' just three years earlier, ruling that students did not have to salute the flag, which was applauded by liberals. Notably, 31 out of the 39 law review articles commenting on Gobitis condemned the decision. Justice [[Hugo Black]] was said by Justice [[William O. Douglas]] to have changed his mind because "he had been reading the papers".&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences c"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', an affirmative action case, 83 out of the 102 ''amicus'' briefs supported affirmative action, and briefs filed by "elites" such as Fortune 500 companies, colleges, and states displayed even higher levels for support for affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People |journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010|volume=98|pages=1567|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Gannett Co. v. Depasquale]]'' the court held that the 6th Amendment didn't guarantee public access to trials. The media erupted in a firestorm of criticism, prompting four Justices to make public statements about the meaning of the case. However, one year later, the court reversed itself in ''[[Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia]]''.&lt;ref name="Judges and Their Audiences b"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the modern era and in a variety of cases, Supreme Court decisions better reflect the opinions of the highly educated than general public opinion. For example, in 1964, 41.4% of those with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court's position on school prayer compared to only 14.9% of those with lower levels of education.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Lawrence |author2=Neal Devins|title=Why the Supreme Court Cares About Elites, Not the American People|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|year=2010 |volume=98|pages=1571|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1116|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an equivalent gulf for ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', the 1990 decision concerning flag burning.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt; In 2003, in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', which legalized homosexual intercourse in states that had anti-sodomy laws, 75% of people with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court, whereas 51% of those with lower levels of education agreed.&lt;ref name="Baum 2010 1571"/&gt;

Some of the strongest empirical evidence concerns the difference between conservative Justices who lived in [[Washington, D.C.]] before they were nominated and those who did not. The evidence from the modern era is summarized in the table below. The table displays the change in pro-civil liberties votes from Justice's early terms and later terms. A higher percentage of pro-civil liberties votes is generally regarded as more liberal.

==Notable affected justices==

Only four of the twenty-six Justices serving since 1937 remained relatively stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Lee |author2=Andrew D. Martin |author3=Kevin M. Quinn |author4=Jeffrey A. Segal|title=IDEOLOGICAL DRIFT AMONG SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: WHO, WHEN, AND HOW IMPORTANT?|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=2007|volume=101|issue=4|url=http://epstein.usc.edu/research/ideodrift.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] was famously said to have "evolved" over his career, becoming much more liberal in later decades; Linda Greenhouse herself wrote an article about Blackmun called "The Evolution of A Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenhouse|first=Linda|title=The Evolution of a Justice|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/magazine/10BLACKMUN.html|accessdate=17 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, he wrote the opinion in favor of legalizing abortion in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. This is despite the fact that President [[Richard Nixon]] asked Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] if "he could resist the Washington cocktail party circuit" before his nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=Lawrence|title=Judges and Their Audiences: A Perspective on Judicial Behavior|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691138275|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other Republican presidents' nominees shifted to the left, such as Brennan, O'Connor, Souter and Stevens.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Some justices have shifted to the right, such as [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Byron White]], but on the whole in the modern era there have been more shifts to the left than the right. Frankfurter began his career in the 1938 term as a slightly left-of-center Justice, closer to the term's likely median. Virtually from the start of his second term, however, Frankfurter appears to have drifted right. By the conclusion of his tenure, Frankfurter was second only to John M. Harlan II as the Court's most extreme conservative voter; he actually ended his service more firmly planted on the right than Chief Justice Rehnquist.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;  Justice Black's movement to the right was not missed by some commentators. As James F. Simon once wrote, Black's "increasingly brittle, unmistakably conservative tilt" actually proved embarrassing to many of his admirers.&lt;ref name="Epstein 2007 1483–1542"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=James|title=Judging the Justices|year=1994|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|jstor=1229375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of sitting justices as of 2012, Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] is noted for having become much more liberal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trapp|first=Mark|title=Kennedy's Benchmarks|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2004/07/14/kennedys-benchmarks|publisher=American Spectator|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had been expected to be the swing vote overturning ''Roe v. Wade'' in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', but instead voted to uphold it, with the evidence suggesting he changed his mind between conference and the final vote.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eastland|first=Terry|title=The Tempting of Justice Kennedy|journal=The American Spectator|date=February 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy had previously changed his mind in ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'', concerning school prayer. Kennedy has been observed to be concerned with how he will go down in history. In an interview given just minutes before Casey was handed down, he said "Sometimes you don't know if you're Caesar about to cross the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line." Kennedy displays the concern with his historical image that would lend credence to the Greenhouse Effect, for example by having his clerks clip all news stories about him.&lt;ref name="Eastland 1993 32"/&gt;

In 1917 the '''Hosic Report''' on the Reorganization of English in ([[United States]]) Secondary Schools placed courteous letter writing as a number one priority. This might provide rationale for why Pennell and Cusack (1924), writers of a manual for [[teacher]]s of reading activities, included letter writing in suggested instructional activities. Other important activities suggested in the Hosic report were expository writing, analysis of writing pieces, reports, literary composition, and debate.

In 1917, the Hosic Report on the Reorganization of English in the Secondary Schools the first report to cite the relationship between speaking and writing, reported that the purpose of teaching composition was to enable the student to speak and write correctly to convince and interest the reader (Burrows, 1977). The first step was to cultivate sincerity through language; next to develop accuracy; and last to arouse artistic and individual expression. The goals focused on developing effective content and correct form including handwriting, spelling, grammar, capitals, and punctuation. Beyond these goals, importance was placed on enlarging vocabulary through reading. Reading authors with "concise and vigorous style" was encouraged so that the students could imitate "fine writing" (Burrows, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;28).

From the 1917 Hosic Report, the teacher was urged to focus on developing the individual writer rather than certain forms and rules. The teacher was to observe and respond to the maturing of each student’s growth in thought and expression. This sounds very much like teachers were being instructed to teach in response to the individual learner rather than just deliver a scripted program. Teachers were told to offer many opportunities for students to write and speak on topics that were familiar and of interest to them so that they could give attention to correctness and present thoughts to convince and interest others. The belief was that composition should grow out of the experiences of the child.

The experiences included recent field trips and outside interests such as home activities and sports. Purpose and audience were stressed. In teaching composition, interesting content came first followed in importance by organization and then mechanics (punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and word choice).

The Hosic report stated that fact writing and imaginative writing came from two types of minds. It went on to say that short story writing should not be a passing standard for students but that they should be given opportunities to see if they had a talent for it. For those that did show talent and interest, special training should be provided. The same was advocated for debating. Teachers were encouraged to use pictures to stimulate writing development using newspaper editorial cartoons as examples. Authentic purposes for letter writing with students’ interest as content were promoted. Letters by Stevenson, Dickens, Carroll, and Lincoln served as models for informal letter writing. Whose letters today would be excellent exemplars? The report mentioned that students who were clever at writing conversations which was a sign of character should have special training in dramatization and material for dramatizations could be used from local history. Smith (2002) reported that in 1920 (soon after this report) that suggestions for dramatizations followed longer stories in readers to support comprehension. Repeatedly, the Hosic Report stressed that the work should spring from the students' interests. It was after this report in the 1920s that Language Experience Charts based on children’s experiences were initiated. Reading material was developed by using students’ own compositions about their firsthand experiences (Smith, 2002). It was also at this time that ability grouping, flexible promotions, differentiated assignments, and promoting individual progression were reported (Smith, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;183). The emphasis in writing and reading instruction at this time seemed to be giving birth to differentiated instruction and responding to student interest. The 1917 Hosic Report proposed that composition activities should come from the life of the student and "develop in him the power to express his individual experiences" (Burrows, 1977, p.&amp;nbsp;32). Developing the skill of oral composition was also a strong emphasis in order to develop the power to think in front of an audience and find language for personal expression.

James Hosic, author of this report, was an Emeritus professor at Teachers College, [[Columbia University]] as well as being the first Secretary (now Executive Director) of the [[National Council of Teachers of English]] from 1911 through 1920.

'''Legislative violence''' broadly refers to any [[violence|violent]] clashes between members of a [[legislature]], often physically, inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.

Although the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anger]]. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions.&lt;ref name="bbc 2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560977.stm "When politicians attack..."], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Morte de Césare'' (Death of Caesar) by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]]]]
Roman general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] was famously [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC during a meeting of the [[Roman Senate]]. The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

In January 1988, there was a riot in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for [[Janaki Ramachandran]], who was serving as [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] following the death in December 1987 of her husband [[MGR]]. The [[ADMK]] party had split, with most [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]] supporting her and some supporting [[Jayalalithaa]]'s bid to become Chief Minister instead. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party with its 60 MLAs was able to play "kingmaker".&lt;ref name="businessline"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/rasheeda-bhagat/pepper-spray-pales-against-past-tn-assembly-events/article5690057.ece Both riots]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons.&lt;ref name="businessline" /&gt; The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under [[Article 356]] of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under [[President's rule]] for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.

[[File:Lyon-griswold-brawl.jpg|thumb|''Congressional Pugilists'', a 1798 political cartoon depicting the fight between Griswold and Lyon.]]
Federalist Congressman [[Roger Griswold]] of [[Connecticut]] attacked [[Vermont]] Representative [[Matthew Lyon]] with a [[hickory]] walking stick in the chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.

The two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.

Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of [[South Carolina]] famously assaulted [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle [[Andrew Butler]] took "a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, "Let them be!"&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1960, pp.293-96&lt;/ref&gt; Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000054 KEITT, Laurence Massillon, (1824–1864)]&lt;/ref&gt; For several decades following, Senators often carried walking [[Walking stick|canes]] and even [[revolver]]s in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== 5 February 1858 ===
Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a "black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would "choke him for that". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

=== 5 April 1860 ===
During an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican [[Owen Lovejoy]] on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22The+principle+of+enslaving+human+beings+because+they+are+inferior%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA6W9JoaPr&amp;sig=aO15r4OJEVD8bQUIjM34u42GjXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM9vuXwsrLAhWJeD4KHWvpAUcQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20principle%20of%20enslaving%20human%20beings%20because%20they%20are%20inferior%22&amp;f=false|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838–64|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, April 5, 1860|pages=191–200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24 February 1887 ===
The [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].

=== 20 February 1902 ===
During a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of "treachery" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.

=== 4 March 1985 ===
On the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a "[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered "I did and you are." The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with "bodily harm." Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, "I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know." Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to "get out of my face." After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters "until Dornan apologizes." His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, "Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself." Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, "I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, "You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor." He also told reporters that "discipline" would ensue if "anything like that" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, "Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology." Dornan responded, "Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''MAC address anonymization''' performs a [[one-way function]] on a [[MAC address]] so that the result may be used in [[tracking system]]s for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like [[Google]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://junkee.com/google-maps-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-and-theres-a-website-to-prove-it/39639|title=Google Maps Has Been Tracking Your Every Move, And There's A Website To Prove It|website=Junkee|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/09/28/how-your-iphone-has-been-tracking-your-every-move-in-secret-4884687/ |title=How your iPhone has been tracking your every move in secret &amp;#124; Metro News |website=Metro.co.uk |date=2014-09-28 |accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iInside]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-03-10|title=iInside retail brochure: Leading the market in indoor location techno…|url=http://www.slideshare.net/KelliePeterson/iinside-retail-brochure}}&lt;/ref&gt; - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.

==Examples==
An example of MAC address anonymization would be to use a simple hash algorithm. Given an address of &lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:66&lt;/code&gt;, the [[MD5]] hash algorithm produces &lt;code&gt;eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/code&gt; (32 hexadecimal digits).&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445566"|md5sum = eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1&lt;/ref&gt;

An address only one character different (&lt;code&gt;11:22:33:44:55:67&lt;/code&gt;) produces &lt;code&gt;391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;echo -n "112233445567"|md5sum = 391907146439938c9821856fa181052e&lt;/ref&gt; an entirely different hash due to the [[avalanche effect]].

==Why this does not work in practice==
Tracking companies rely on the assumption that address anonymization is akin to [[encryption]]. Given a message, and an encryption method that is well known to both the encoder and potential decryptor, modern encryption methods (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) or [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]]) will yield a result that is unbreakable in practice.

The problem lies in the fact that there are only 2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; (281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. Given the encoding algorithm, an index can easily be created for each possible address.

Several years ago, the building of such an index would have been difficult due to the compute time involved. With modern, [[parallel computing|parallel]], [[cloud computing]], the index generation can be easily divided among the number of processors desired.

On a 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz processor, a [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] program was able to produce the following results:{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!CPU Count
!Iterations
!Time (seconds)
|-
|1
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;
|3.0489 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|1,000,000
|2.814 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;
|304.89
|}
Thus, a million processors could create the entire index in just over five minutes, and 100,000 processors in less than 85 hours. Once the [[rainbow table]] is complete, conversions of "anonymized" addresses to their actual addresses is almost instantaneous.

==Salting==
{{main|Salt (cryptography)}}
One common way of mitigating such brute force attacks is to append a random [[salt (cryptography)|salt]] into the MAC address before hashing. A salt is a secret string of characters that makes the search space for attackers larger. The effect is that the brute force attack can no longer target the valid range of MAC addresses. Lists of salted and hashed MAC addresses would be impossible to translate, given that the salt is long enough and created in a way that is difficult to guess.

The entity holding the secret salt can still perform deanonymization by attacking the hashed MAC using the technique in the previous chapter. Attackers could also obtain the secret salt through social engineering, phishing or other means.

==Truncating==
Where data protection law requires anonymization, the method used should exclude any possibility of the original MAC address to be identified. Some companies truncate [[IPv4]] addresses by removing the final [[octet (computing)|octet]], thus in effect retaining information about the user's [[ISP]] or [[subnet]], but not directly identifying the individual. The activity could then originate from any of 254 [[IP addresses]]. This may not always be enough to guarantee anonymization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2008/wp148_en.pdf|publisher=ARTICLE 29 DATA PROTECTION WORKING PARTY|accessdate=20 October 2017|title=Opinion 1/2008 on data protection issues related to search engines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''March on Washington Movement''' (MOWM), 1941–1946, organized by activists [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[Bayard Rustin]]{{Sfn|Simkin|1997}} as a tool to produce a mass march on [[Washington, D.C.]], was designed to pressure the U.S. government into desegregating the armed forces and providing fair working opportunities for African Americans. When President Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] in 1941, prohibiting discrimination in the defense industry under contract to federal agencies, Randolph and collaborators called off the march.

Randolph continued to promote non-violent actions to advance goals for African Americans. Future civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and other younger men were strongly influenced by Randolph and his ideals and methods.

==Background==

===State of the nation===
In the lead-up to the United States' entry into [[World War II]], African Americans resented calls to "defend democracy" against Nazi racism while having to deal with discrimination in all sectors of life and business in the United States, especially the South, where they had been [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century and oppressed by [[Jim Crow laws]].{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969}}

By the fall of 1940, the American economy was emerging from the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. The defense boom benefited whites, but black workers were denied opportunities because of widespread racial discrimination in employment. Some government training programs excluded blacks based on their being refused entry to defense industries, and many skilled black workers with proper training were unable to gain employment.{{sfn|Pfeffer|1990|p=46}} In 1940 the president of the North American Aviation Co. was quoted as saying, "While we are in complete sympathy with the Negro, it is against company policy to employ them as aircraft workers or mechanics ... regardless of their training.... There will be some jobs as janitors for Negroes."{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=17}} It was in this climate that activists began to develop the March on Washington Movement.

===Purpose of the march===
The March on Washington Movement was an attempt to pressure the United States government and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into establishing policy and protections against employment discrimination as the nation prepared for war. A. Philip Randolph was the driving force behind the movement, with allies from the NAACP and other civil rights organizations. He had formed and led the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]] beginning in 1925. His leadership in the March on Washington Movement, in which organizing middle and lower class members would be so important, was based on his strong experience in grassroots and union organizing.{{sfn|Miller|2005|p=63}} Randolph's independence from white sources of power was shown when he said of the movement, "If it costs money to finance a march on Washington, let Negroes pay for it. If any sacrifices are made for Negro rights in national defense, let Negroes make them...."{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=5}}

==Leadership==
Randolph's leadership and strategy defined the nature of the March on Washington Movement. His reliance on grassroots activism and African-American media and organizations was influenced by his childhood. His father was an [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal]] (AME) preacher, and Randolph heard numerous parishioners complain about the state of race relations and discrimination. He and his brother were privately tutored, and raised to believe that they were "as intellectually competent as any white".{{sfn|Pfeffer|1990|p=7}} On September 26, 1942, after the MOWM had succeeded in gaining an Executive Order against discrimination in industry, Randolph reiterated that the fight would continue despite these gains. He said, "Unless this war sound the death knell to the old Anglo-American empire systems, the hapless story of which is one of exploitation for the profit and power of a monopoly-capitalist economy, it will have been fought in vain."{{Sfn|Randolph|1942}}

===Women in the movement===
The Women's Auxiliary was a group of mostly wives and relatives of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. They were active within the MOWM primarily in fundraising and community efforts, as well as working broadly to promote ideas of "concepts of black manhood, female respectability, and class consciousness."{{Sfn|Chateauvert|1998}}

==Chronology==
Early lobbying efforts to desegregate the military previous to 1941 did not persuade President Roosevelt to take action. On September 27, 1940, the first delegation composed of A. Philip Randolph, [[Walter Francis White|Walter White]] (NAACP), and T. Arnold Hill (National Urban League), met with President Roosevelt and his top officials. The delegation presented a memorandum demanding immediate integration of all blacks in the armed services. The White House issued a statement saying, "The policy of the War Department is not to intermingle colored and white enlisted personnel in the same regimental organizations."{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=34}} The armed forces were not integrated until 1948, under President [[Harry S. Truman]].

Concerned that traditional meetings were not effective, on January 25, 1941, A. Philip Randolph officially proposed a March on Washington to "highlight the issue."{{sfn|Kindig}} In the following months, chapters of the MOWM began to organize for a mass march scheduled for July first of that year. During the spring, organizers estimated they could attract 100,000 marchers for the event.

A week before the march was to take place, Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] of [[New York City]] met with MOWM leadership to inform them of the president's intentions to issue an executive order establishing the first [[Fair Employment Practices Committee]] (FEPC) that would prohibit discrimination in federal vocational and training programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Before the order was signed, the MOWM demanded also that it included a provision for desegregation of war industries. Roosevelt agreed and issued [[Executive Order 8802]], which prohibited discrimination in federal vocational and training programs, and in employment in defense industries contracting with the government. Given this major victory, Randolph agreed to cancel the march. He continued the March on Washington Movement as a way to maintain an organization that could track and lobby for progress, and hold the FEPC to its mission.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=61}}

The MOWM continued rallies throughout the summer on these issues, but the high water mark had passed. The movement's continued call for nonviolent civil disobedience alienated some black organizations, such as the [[NAACP]], whose leaders withdrew some support. Although organized to bring about the 1941 march on Washington, the MOWM operated until 1947; its representatives collaborated with other groups to continue pressure on the federal government.{{sfn|Kindig}} In 1943 Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9346, which expanded coverage of the FEPC to federal agencies beyond those in defense.

Randolph continued to promote non-violent actions to advance goals for African Americans. Future civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and other younger men were strongly influenced by his methods.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Media effect==
While mainstream media had a role in reporting on the movement, African-American media outlets covered it most thoroughly. Early in the spring of 1941, black newspapers expressed skepticism of the movement's ambitious goals to attract tens of thousands of marchers. The ''[[Chicago Defender]]'' worried whether even "2,000 Negroes would march".{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|pp=57-58}}

Their tone changed, however, as the date of the march approached. By May, black newspapers reported on growing support for the march; ''[[The Amsterdam News]]'' of New York City ran the front page headline: "100,000 in March to Capitol."{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|pp=57-58}} If it was simply a tactic of bluffing, the same tactic was shared by black press as a whole. ''The Chicago Defender'' by that time reported "50,000 preparing for a March for jobs and justice".{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|pp=57-58}}

==Communist appeal==
The MOWM had an uneasy relationship with communist organizations in the U.S. Communists supported the idea of a proletariat uprising but "they constantly drew a line between the 'job-march' and its 'war-mongering leadership.'"{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=48}} Randolph used various tactics to avoid having communists be part of the March on Washington Movement, as he knew it caused difficulties in gaining support for the larger goals of African Americans. He restricted membership to African Americans; although black Communists might participate, only a small percentage of the disciplined Communist party members were black.{{sfn|Garfinkel|1969|p=48}}

Past "suicide attempts" include:
*[[Methane poisoning]], 3.5 billion years ago
*The [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen catastrophe]], 2.45 billion years ago
*[[Snowball earth]], twice, [[Huronian glaciation|2.4-2.1 billion years ago]] and 790–630 million years ago
*At least five putative [[hydrogen sulfide]]-induced mass extinctions, such as the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]], {{Ma|252.28}}

The list does not include the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], since this was, at least partially, externally induced by a [[meteor impact]].

[[Multilinear subspace learning#Algorithms|Multilinear subspace learning algorithms]] are higher-order generalizations of [[linear subspace]] learning methods such as [[principal component analysis]] (PCA), [[independent component analysis]] (ICA), [[linear discriminant analysis]] (LDA) and [[canonical correlation|canonical correlation analysis]] (CCA).

== Background ==
With the advances in [[data acquisition]] and [[Computer data storage|storage technology]], [[big data]] (or massive data sets) are being generated on a daily basis in a wide range of emerging applications. Most of these big data are multidimensional. Moreover, they are usually very-[[high-dimensional]], with a large amount of redundancy, and only occupying a part of the input space. Therefore, [[Dimension reduction|dimensionality reduction]] is frequently employed to map [[high-dimensional data]] to a low-dimensional space while retaining as much information as possible.

[[Linear subspace]] learning algorithms are traditional dimensionality reduction techniques that represent input data as [[Coordinate vector|vector]]s and solve for an optimal [[linear mapping]] to a lower-dimensional space. Unfortunately, they often become inadequate when dealing with massive multidimensional data. They result in very-high-dimensional vectors, lead to the estimation of a large number of parameters.&lt;ref name="Vasilescu2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"&gt;H. Lu, K. N. Plataniotis, and A. N. Venetsanopoulos, "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2007.901277 MPCA: Multilinear principal component analysis of tensor objects]," IEEE Trans.

Multilinear Subspace Learning employ different types of data tensor analysis tools for dimensionality reduction.  Multilinear Subspace learning can be applied to observations whose measurements were vectorized and organized into a data tensor,&lt;ref name="Vasilescu2003"/&gt; or whose measurements are treated as a matrix and concatenated into a tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Directions in Tensor-Based Computation and Modeling |date=May 2009|url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/cv/tenwork/finalreport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multilinear principal component analysis ===
Historically, [[multilinear principal component analysis]] has been referred to as "M-mode PCA", a terminology which was coined by Peter Kroonenberg.&lt;ref name="Kroonenberg1980"&gt;P. M.

Alex O. Vasilescu|Vasilescu]] and [[Demetri Terzopoulos|Terzopoulos]] introduced the Multilinear PCA&lt;ref name="MPCA-MICA2005"&gt;M. A. O. Vasilescu, D.

*A TVP is a direct projection of a high-dimensional tensor to a low-dimensional vector, which is also referred to as the rank-one projections. As TVP projects a tensor to a vector, it can be viewed as multiple projections from a tensor to a scalar. Thus, the TVP of a tensor to a ''P''-dimensional vector consists of ''P'' projections from the tensor to a scalar. The projection from a tensor to a scalar is an elementary multilinear projection (EMP). In EMP, a tensor is projected to a point through ''N'' unit projection vectors. It is the projection of a tensor on a single line (resulting a scalar), with one projection vector in each mode. Thus, the TVP of a tensor object to a vector in a ''P''-dimensional vector space consists of ''P'' EMPs. This projection is an extension of the [[CP decomposition|canonical decomposition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Typical approach in MSL ===
There are ''N'' sets of parameters to be solved, one in each mode. The solution to one set often depends on the other sets (except when ''N=1'', the linear case). Therefore, the suboptimal iterative procedure in&lt;ref&gt;L.  D.  Lathauwer,  B.  D.  Moor,  J.  Vandewalle,  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=354405 On  the  best  rank-1  and rank-(R1, R2, ..., RN ) approximation of higher-order tensors], SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis and Applications 21 (4) (2000) 1324–1342.&lt;/ref&gt; is followed.

#Initialization of the projections in each mode
#For each mode, fixing the projection in all the other mode, and solve for the projection in the current mode.
#Do the mode-wise optimization for a few iterations or until convergence.

This is originated from the alternating least square method for multi-way data analysis.&lt;ref name="Kroonenberg1980"/&gt;

=== Pros and cons ===
[[File:Compactness Comparison of Linear and Multilinear Projections.png|right|thumb|360px|This figure compares the number of parameters to be estimated for the same amount of [[dimension reduction]] by vector-to-vector projection (VVP), (i.e., linear projection,) tensor-to-vector projection (TVP), and tensor-to-tensor projection (TTP).  Multilinear projections require much fewer parameters and the representations obtained are more compact. (This figure is produced based on Table 3 of the survey paper&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;)]]
The advantages of MSL over traditional linear subspace modeling, in common domains where the representation is naturally somewhat tensorial, are:&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DATER"/&gt;

*MSL preserves the structure and correlation that the original data had before projection, by operating on a natural tensorial representation of the multidimensional data.
*MSL can learn more compact representations than its linear counterpart; in other words, it needs to estimate a much smaller number of parameters. Thus, MSL can handle big tensor data more efficiently, by performing computations on a representation with many fewer dimensions. This leads to lower demand on computational resources.

However, MSL algorithms are iterative and are not guaranteed to converge; where an MSL algorithm does converge, it may do so at a [[local optimum]]. (In contrast, traditional linear subspace modeling techniques often produce an exact closed-form solution.) MSL convergence problems can often be mitigated by choosing an appropriate subspace dimensionality, and by appropriate strategies for initialization, for termination, and for choosing the order in which projections are solved.&lt;ref name="MSLsurvey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TSAnips"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MPCA-Lu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DATER"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5199">'''Negative staining''' is an established method, often used in diagnostic [[microscopy]], for contrasting a thin specimen with an optically opaque fluid. In this technique, the background is stained, leaving the actual specimen untouched, and thus visible. This contrasts with 'positive staining', in which the actual specimen is stained.

For [[bright field microscopy]], negative staining is typically performed using a black ink fluid such as nigrosin and India ink. The specimen, such as a wet [[bacteria]]l culture spread on a glass slide, is mixed with the negative stain and allowed to dry. When viewed with the [[microscope]] the bacterial cells, and perhaps their [[spore]]s, appear light against the dark surrounding background. An alternative method has been developed using an ordinary waterproof marking pen to deliver the negative stain.&lt;ref&gt;S. Woeste and P. Demchick (1991). Appl Environ Microbiol. 57(6): 1858-1859 http://aem.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/57/6/1858&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[transmission electron microscopy]], opaqueness to [[electron]]s is related to the [[atomic number]], i.e., the number of protons. Some suitable negative stains include [[ammonium molybdate]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl formate]], [[phosphotungstic acid]], [[osmium tetroxide]], osmium ferricyanide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in smooth muscle| author = D. Chadwick| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| year = 2002| isbn = 0-470-84479-5| pages =259–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[auroglucothionate]]. These have been chosen because they scatter electrons strongly and also adsorb to biological matter well. The structures which can be negatively stained are much smaller than those studied with the light microscope. Here, the method is used to view [[virus]]es, bacteria, bacterial [[flagella]], [[biological membrane]] structures and [[protein]]s or protein aggregates, which all have a low electron-scattering power.  Some stains, such as osmium tetroxide and osmium ferricyanide, are very chemically active. As strong oxidants, they cross-link lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, and thereby both fix biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stain them.&lt;ref name="Bozzola"&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-7637-0192-5|chapter = Specimen Preparation for Transmission Electron Microscopy|pages = 21&amp;ndash;31|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RqSMzR-IXk0C&amp;pg=PA21|first = John J.|last = Bozzola|author2=Russell, Lonnie D.| year = 1999|publisher = Jones and Bartlett|location = Sudbury, Mass.|title = Electron microscopy : principles and techniques for biologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 45–61| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nfsVMH8it1kC| title = Principles and techniques of electron microscopy: biological applications| author = M. A. Hayat

The choice of negative stain in [[electron microscopy]] can be very important. An early study of plant viruses using negatively stained leaf dips from a diseased plant showed only spherical viruses with one stain and only rod-shaped viruses with another. The verified conclusion was that this plant suffered from a mixed infection by two separate viruses. 
Negative staining at both light microscope and electron microscope level should never be performed with [[infection|infectious]] organisms unless stringent safety precautions are followed. Negative staining is usually a very mild preparation method and thus does not reduce the possibility of operator infection.

'''Otis Taylor''' (born August 11, 1942) is a former American [[college football|college]] and professional [[American football]] player, for [[Prairie View A&amp;M University]] and the [[American Football League]]'s [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 215 pounds, Taylor possessed sure hands during his career and served as a devastating downfield blocker, springing Chiefs running backs for many long runs.

==Professional career==
Taylor was selected in the [[1965 American Football League draft|1965 AFL draft]] (Chiefs) and the [[1965 NFL draft|NFL draft]], by the [[1965 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]].  After a famous "baby-sitting" incident, in which Taylor "escaped" from NFL scouts, he was signed for the Chiefs by their legendary scout [[Lloyd C.A. Wells|Lloyd Wells]].&lt;ref name=mkbthot&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BeshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7181%2C3825005 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |agency=NEA |last=Olderman |first=Murray |title=Mama knows best, thinks Otis Taylor |date=December 18, 1966 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bdwrstep&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nZscAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0mUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6489%2C5963371 |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |location=Florida |agency=Associated Press |title='Back door' was right step for Chiefs' Otis Taylor |date=November 24, 1966 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor caught five touchdown passes during his rookie year, and followed that up in [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]] by leading the [[American Football League|AFL]] with a 22.4 yd/catch average and finishing second in receiving yards (1,297).  At season's end, he was voted First-team All-AFL and was selected for the [[1966 AFL season|1966]] [[American Football League All-Star games|AFL All-Star]] team.  Taylor led the AFL in receiving touchdowns in 1967 with 11 and led the NFL in receiving yards in 1971 with 1,110. He made the AFC-NFC Pro Bowl twice and in 1971 was named Consensus [[1971 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA), the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] (PFWA) and [[Pro Football Weekly]]. The PFWA also named him First-team [[1972 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] for the 1972 season. Taylor ranks second on the  Chiefs' all-time list in receptions (410), receiving yards (7,306), receiving touchdowns (57) and 100-yard games (20).

Taylor combined with running back [[Robert Holmes (American football player)|Robert Holmes]] for what was at the time the longest reception in Chiefs history in [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]] when he caught a pass from quarterback Mike Livingston for 79 yards, then lateraled to Holmes, who carried it another 14 yards for a touchdown. However, Taylor's most memorable highlight from that season came in the fourth and final [[Professional American football championship games|AFL-NFL World Championship Game]] on January 11, 1970, when he caught a short pass, turned downfield and stiff-armed his way to a 46-yard touchdown in the Chiefs 23-7 upset victory over the NFL's  champion, the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], who, before [[Super Bowl IV]], had been dubbed by some as "the greatest team in pro football history".

"Otis made my job easy," former Chiefs quarterback and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Len Dawson]] said. "If you got the pass to Otis, you knew he'd catch it."

The [[Professional  Football Researchers Association]] named Taylor to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2006 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2006.htm |title=Hall of Very Good Class of 2006 | accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ben Davidson incident===
On November 1, [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]], the Chiefs led the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, and a long run for a first-down run by Dawson apparently sealed victory for the Chiefs in the final minute when Dawson, as he lay on the ground, was speared by Raiders' cheap-shot artist defensive end [[Ben Davidson]], who dove into Dawson with his helmet, provoking Taylor to attack Davidson.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j1gyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b-YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7172%2C97394 |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |location=Kansas |agency=Associated Press |title=Raiders knot KC in bizarre ending |date=November 2, 1970 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GQBYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3409%2C5652917 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=UPI |title=Blanda boots field goal to give Raiders tie with Chiefs |date=November 2, 1970 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a bench-clearing brawl, offsetting penalties were called, nullifying the first down under the rules in effect at that time. The Chiefs were obliged to punt, and the Raiders tied the game on a [[George Blanda]] field goal with eight seconds to play.&lt;ref name=rkkcibe/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbfgtg/&gt; Davidson's hit against Dawson not only cost the Chiefs a win, but helped Oakland win the [[AFC West]]  with a season record of 8–4–2, while defending world champion Kansas City finished 7–5–2 and out of the [[1970–71 NFL playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ KC Chiefs website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609052751/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/70s/ |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The very next season, the rule for offsetting personal foul penalties was changed to separate penalties during the play, and penalties after the play. The rule change was largely due to this play.

===Jack Del Rio incident===
After his time as a player had come to a close, Taylor became a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs. During the 1987 NFL Player's strike, Taylor was arriving at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] and was assaulted by [[Jack Del Rio]], who was a new player to the organization in 1987 and was striking with his teammates. Del Rio mistook Taylor for a replacement player and was told Taylor was actually a Chief's legend and retired player by fans who had come upon the assault. He later pressed charges against Del Rio and the two settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| URL=http://fox4kc.com/2017/09/27/30-years-ago-this-week-kansas-city-chiefs-players-were-center-stage-for-nfl-drama/| accessdate=November 15, 2017| website=fox4kc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pursuit predation''' is a form of [[predation]] in which predators give chase to fleeing prey. The chase can be initiated either by the predator or by the prey, should the prey be alerted to a predator's presence and attempt to flee before the predator gives chase. The chase ends when either the predator captures and consumes the prey, or the prey escapes. Pursuit predation is typically observed in carnivorous species within the kingdom [[Animalia Kingdom|Animalia]], with some iconic examples being [[cheetah]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[Gray wolf|wolves]].

Pursuit predation is an alternate predation strategy to [[ambush predation]]. While pursuit predators use a detection and pursuit phase in order to obtain prey, ambush predators use stealth to capture prey. Strength and speed are important to pursuit predators, whereas ambush predators ignore these in favor of surprise from a typically concealed location. While the two patterns of predation are not mutually exclusive, morphological differences in body plan can create a bias in an organism towards each type of predation.

== Strategy ==
There is still uncertainty as to whether predators behave with a general tactic or strategy while preying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combes | first1 = SA | last2 = Salcedo | first2 = MK | last3 = Pandit | first3 = MM | last4 = Iwasaki | first4 = JM | year = 2013 | title = Capture Success and Efficiency of Dragonflies Pursuing Different Types of Prey | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume =  53| issue = 5| pages = 787–798 | doi=10.1093/icb/ict072 | pmid=23784698}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, among pursuit predators, there are several common behaviors. Often, predators will scout potential prey, assessing prey quantity and density prior to engaging in a pursuit. Certain predators choose to pursue prey primarily in a group of conspecifics; such animals are known as [[pack hunter]]s or group pursuers. Other species choose to hunt alone. These two behaviors are typically due to differences in hunting success, where some groups are very successful in groups and others are more successful alone. Pursuit predators may also choose to either exhaust their metabolic resources rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = CR | last2 = Rowntree | first2 = VJ | year = 1973 | title = Temperature regulation and heat balance in running cheetahs: A strategy for sprinters? | url = | journal = Am J Physiol | volume = 224 | issue = | pages = 848–851 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or pace themselves during a chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creel | first1 = S. | last2 = Creel | first2 = N. M. | year = 1995 | title = Communal hunting and pack size in African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus [Electronic version] | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 1325–1339 | doi = 10.1016/0003-3472(95)80048-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This choice can be influenced by prey species, seasonal settings, or temporal settings. Predators that rapidly exhaust their metabolic resources during a chase tend to first stalk their prey, slowly approaching their prey to decrease chase distance and time. When the predator is at a closer distance (one that would lead to easier prey capture), it finally gives chase.&lt;ref&gt;Mech, D. (1970). The Wolf: The Ecology and Behaviour of an Endangered Species. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Pacing pursuit is more commonly seen in group pursuit, as individual animals do not need to exert as much energy to capture prey. However, this type of pursuit requires group coordination, which may have varying degrees of success. Since groups can engage in longer chases, they often focus on separating a weaker or slower prey item during pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Kruuk, H. (1972) ''The Spotted Hyena''. University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL''''&lt;/ref&gt; Morphologically speaking, while ambush predation requires stealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeVries | first1 = M.S. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = E.A.K. | last3 = Patek | first3 = S.N. | year = 2012 | title = Strike mechanics of an ambush predator: the spearing mantis shrimp | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 215 | issue = | pages = 4374–4384 | doi=10.1242/jeb.075317 | pmid=23175528}}&lt;/ref&gt; pursuit predation requires speed; pursuit predators are proportionally long-limbed and equipped with cursorial adaptations.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Current theories suggest that this proportionally long-limbed approach to body plan was an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation.&lt;ref name = "Janis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janis | first1 = C.

==Group pursuers==

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Three dolphins.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A small pod of dolphins]]
Group pursuers hunt with a collection of conspecifics. Group pursuit is usually seen in species of relatively high [[sociality]]; in vertebrates, individuals often seem to have defined roles in pursuit.

==== Mammals ====
[[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') packs have been known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey's escape path. The group of chase initiators coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey's escape path will be effectively cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Natural World Safaris. (2015, October 16). In 10 interesting facts about African wild dogs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops'') have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins leap out and catch the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gazda | first1=S. K. | last2=Connor | first2=R. C. | last3=Edgar | first3=R. K. | last4=Cox | first4=F. | year=2005 | title=A division of labour with role specialization in group-hunting bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) off Cedar Key, Florida | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society | volume=272 | issue=1559| pages=135–140 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2937 | pmid=15695203 | pmc=1634948}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'') pack hunting, each member of the hunting group is assigned a position, from left wing to right wing, in order to better obtain prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Stander | first1=P.E. | year=1992 | title=Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume=29 | issue=| pages=445–454 | doi=10.1007/bf00170175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such specializations in roles within the group are thought to increase sophistication in technique; lion wing members are faster, and will drive prey toward the center where the larger, stronger, killing members of the pride will take down the prey. Many observations of group pursuers note an optimal hunting size in which certain currencies (mass of prey killed or number of prey killed) are maximized with respect to costs (kilometers covered or injuries sustained).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Holekamp | first1=K.

==== Birds ====
While birds are generally believed to be individual hunters, there are a few examples of birds that cooperate during pursuits. [[Harris's hawk]]s (''Parabuteo unicinctus'') have two cooperative strategies for hunting. One strategy involves a group of hawks surrounding prey hidden under some form of cover, while another hawk attempts to penetrate the prey's cover. The penetration attempt flushes the prey out from its cover where it is swiftly killed by one of the surrounding hawks. The second strategy is less commonly used. It involves a "relay attack" in which a group of hawks, led by a "lead" hawk, engage in a long chase for prey. The "lead" hawk will dive in order to kill the prey. If the dive is unsuccessful, the role of the "lead" shifts to another hawk who will then dive in another attempt to kill the prey. During one observed relay attack, 20 dives and hence 20 lead switches were exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bednarz | first1=J. C. | year=1988 | title=Cooperative Hunting in Harris' Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) | journal=Science | volume=239 | issue=4847| pages=1525–1527 | doi=10.1126/science.239.4847.1525 | pmid=17772751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Asian Giant Hornet (Vespa mandarinia) (6027759338).jpg|thumb|Asian Giant Hornet (''Vespa mandarinia'')|170x170px]]

As in vertebrates, there are many species of invertebrates which actively pursue prey in groups and exhibit task specialization, but while the vertebrates change their behavior based on their role in hunting, invertebrate task delegation is usually based on actual morphological differences. The vast majority of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s have castes within a population which tend to differ in size and have specialized structures for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ecology and Evolution of Social Organization: Insights from Fire Ants and Other Highly Eusocial Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=1995-01-01|pages=631–656|volume=26|first=Kenneth G.|last=Ross|first2=Laurent|last2=Keller|jstor=2097222|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.26.1.631}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation is taken to the extreme in the groups [[Termite|isoptera]] and [[hymenoptera]], or termites and [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s respectively.

[[File:Matabele Ants (Pachycondyla sp.) carrying dead termites (13848808434).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Matabele Ants (''Pachycondyla sp.'') carrying dead [[termite]]s]]

[[Termite]]-hunting ants of the genus ''[[Pachycondyla]]'', also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Behavioral ecology of the neotropical termite-hunting ant Pachycondyla (= Termitopone) marginata: colony founding, group-raiding and migratory patterns|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00170584|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1995-12-01|issn=0340-5443|pages=373–383|volume=37|issue=6|doi=10.1007/BF00170584|first=Inara R.|last=Leal|first2=Paulo S.|last2=Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust [[exoskeleton]]s, and so they make up the front lines of raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have a steady stream of prey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Asian giant hornet]]s, ''Vespa mandarinia'', form similar raiding parties to hunt their prey, which usually consists of [[Honey bee|honeybees.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Heat and carbon dioxide generated by honeybees jointly act to kill hornets|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00114-009-0575-0|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=2009-06-24|issn=0028-1042|pages=1133–1136|volume=96|issue=9|doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0575-0|first=Michio|last=Sugahara|first2=Fumio|last2=Sakamoto|pmid=19551367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The giant hornets group together and as a team can decimate an entire honeybee colony, especially those of non-native European honeybees. Alone, the hornets are subject to attack by the smaller bees, who swarm the hornet and vibrate their abdomens to generate heat, collectively cooking the hornet until it dies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By hunting in groups, the hornets avoid this problem.

==Individual pursuers==

[[File:Cheetah chasing Thompsons gazelle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75&lt;!--fmt for low img--&gt;|Cheetah chasing Thomson's gazelle]]

While most big cat species are individual, ambush predators, [[Cheetahs]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'') are pursuit predators. Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal, with speeds reaching 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases.&lt;ref&gt;"10 Fastest Animals On Earth - Fastest Animals In The World." Conservation Institute. N.p., 06 Apr. 2014. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sharp | first1=N. C. | year=2009 | title=Timed running speed of a cheetah | url=| journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=241 | issue=3| pages=493–494 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1997.tb04840.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for a distance of approximately 500 yards.&lt;ref&gt;"How Fast Can Cheetah Run | Cheetah Built For Speed | Cheetah Serengeti." Barking Zebra Tours. N.p., 27 Sept. 2013. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims that the key to cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilson | first1=A.

==== Birds ====
The [[Painted redstart]] (''Myioborus pictus'') is one of the most well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies' escape path intersects with the redstart's central field of vision. When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey capture rate is at it maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment.&lt;ref name="Jablonski, P. G 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jablonski | first1=P. G. | year=2001 | title=Sensory Exploitation of Prey: Manipulation of the Initial Direction of Prey Escapes by a Conspicuous 'rare Enemy' | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume=268 | issue=1471| pages=1017–022 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1623| pmc=1088703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of this pursuit can also be explained by "rare enemy effect", an evolutionary consequence of multi-species predator-prey interactions.&lt;ref name="Jablonski, P. G 2001"/&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Gomphus vulgatissimus with a prey 002.jpg|thumb|[[Dragonfly]] with prey]]

[[Dragonflies]] are skilled aerial pursuers; they have a 97% success rate for prey capture.&lt;ref&gt;Olberg RM, Worthington AH, Venator KR J Comp Physiol A. 2000 Feb; 186(2):155-62.&lt;/ref&gt; This success rate is a consequence of the "decision" oon which prey to pursue, based on initial conditions. Observations of several species of perching dragonflies show more pursuit initiations at larger starting distances for larger size prey species than for much smaller prey. Further evidence points to a potential bias towards larger prey, due to more substantial metabolic rewards. This bias is in spite of the fact that larger prey are typically faster and choosing them results in less successful pursuits. Dragonflies high success rate for prey capture may also be due to their interception foraging method.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike [[classical pursuit]], in which the predator aims for the current position of their prey, dragonflies predict the prey's direction of motion,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-Bellido Peng Yang Georgopoulos pp. 696–701"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gonzalez-Bellido | first=P. T. | last2=Peng | first2=H. | last3=Yang | first3=J. | last4=Georgopoulos | first4=A. P. | last5=Olberg | first5=R. M. | title=Cozzarelli Prize Winner: Eight pairs of descending visual neurons in the dragonfly give wing motor centers accurate population vector of prey direction | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=110 | issue=2 | date=2012 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1210489109 | pages=696–701}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[parallel navigation]]. Perching dragonflies ([[Libellulidae]] family), have been observed "staking out" high density prey spots prior to pursuit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There are no noticeable distinctions in prey capture efficiency between males and females. Further, percher dragonflies are bound by their visual range. They are more likely to engage in pursuit when prey come within a subtended angle of around 1-2 degrees. Angles greater than this are outside of a dragonflies visual range.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Evolutionary basis of the behavior ==

=== Evolution as a countermeasure ===
Current theory on the evolution of pursuit predation suggests that the behavior is an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation. Prey animals vary in their likelihood to avoid predation, and it is predation failure that drives evolution of both prey and predator.&lt;ref name = "Vermeij"&gt;Geerat Vermeij, The American Naturalist
Vol. 120, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp. 701-720&lt;/ref&gt; Predation failure rates vary wildly across the animal kingdom; raptorial birds can fail anywhere from 20% to 80% of the time in predation, while predatory mammals usually fail more than half the time.&lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; Prey adaptation drives these low rates in three phases: the detection phase, the pursuit phase, and the resistance phase.&lt;ref name = "Holling"&gt;Holling, C. S. (1966). The functional response of invertebrate predators to prey density. Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Canada, 98(S48), 5-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit phase drove the evolution of distinct behaviors for pursuit predation.

As selective pressure on prey is higher than on predators &lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; adaptation usually occurs in prey long before the reciprocal adaptations in predators. Evidence in the fossil record supports this, with no evidence of modern pursuit predators until the late Tertiary period.&lt;ref name="Janis"/&gt; Certain adaptations, like long limbs in ungulates, that were thought to be adaptive for speed against predatory behavior have been found to predate predatory animals by over 20 million years. Because of this, modern pursuit predation is an adaptation that may have evolved separately and much later as a need for more energy in colder and more arid climates.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Longer limbs in predators, the key morphological adaptation required for lengthy pursuit of prey, is tied in the fossil record to the late Tertiary. It is now believed that modern pursuit predators like the wolf and lion evolved this behavior around this time period as a response to ungulates increasing feeding range.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; As ungulate prey moved into a wider feeding range to discover food in response to changing climate, predators evolved the longer limbs and behavior necessary to pursue prey across larger ranges. In this respect, pursuit predation is not co-evolutionary with prey adaptation, but a direct response to prey. Prey's adaptation to climate is the key formative reason for evolving the behavior and morphological necessities of pursuit predation.

In addition to serving as a countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging. For example, [[polar bear]]s typically act as specialized predators of [[Pinniped|seal]] pups and operate in a manner closely predicted by the [[optimal foraging theory]]. However, they have been seen to occasionally employ more energy-inefficient pursuit predation tactics on flightless geese. This alternative predatory strategy may serve as a back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may even be a function of filling dietary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iles | first1 = D.

=== Evolution from an ecological basis ===
Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density,&lt;ref name = "Krebs"&gt;Krebs, J. R. (1978). Optimal foraging: decision rules for predators. Behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach, 23-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and prey should therefore avoid these areas.&lt;ref name = "Sih"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sih | first1 = Andrew | year = 1984 | title = The Behavioral Response Race Between Predator and Prey | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 123 | issue = 1| pages = 143–150 | doi=10.1086/284193}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations.&lt;ref name = "Li"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Z. Z. | last2 = Gao | first2 = M. | last3 = Hui | first3 = C. | last4 = Han | first4 = X. Z. | last5 = Shi | first5 = H. | year = 2005 | title = Impact of predator pursuit and prey evasion on synchrony and spatial patterns in metapopulation | url = | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 185 | issue = 2| pages = 245–254 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships can be used as support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out.&lt;ref name = "Leggett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Leggett | first2 = W. C. | year = 1990 | title = The importance of scale to predator-prey spatial correlations: an example of Atlantic fishes | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 71| issue = | pages = 33–43 | doi=10.2307/1940245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also [[metapopulation]] persistence.

==Anti-predator adaptation to pursuit predation==

===Anti-predator adaptation===
{{further|Anti-predator adaptation}}

Just as the [[evolutionary arms race]] has led to the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. Alarm displays such as eastern swamphen's tail flicking, white-tailed deer's tail flagging, and  Thomson's gazelles' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasson | first1 = Oren | year = 1991 | title = Pursuit-deterrent Signals: Communication between Prey and Predator | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 325–29 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tactic are believed to signal that a predator's presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. Alarm displays are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson's gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = A. P. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = J. T. | last3 = Erritzoe | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Losing the Last Feather: Feather Loss as an Antipredator Adaptation in Birds | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 1046–056 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The confusion effect ===
[[File:Wilderbeest.jpg|thumb|Wildebeest in a herd, showing little differentiation between individuals (low oddity)]]

In many species that fall prey to pursuit predation, gregariousness on a massive scale has evolved as a protective behavior. Such herds can be conspecific (all individuals are of one species) or heterospecific. This is primarily due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation#Predator confusion|confusion effect]], which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Oddity and the ‘Confusion Effect’ in Predation.|last = Landeau|first = Laurie|date = 1986|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/s0003-3472(86)80208-1 |last2 = Terborgh|first2 = John |volume=34 |pages=1372–1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Groups Confuse Predators by Exploiting Perceptual Bottlenecks: a Connectionist Model of the Confusion Effect.|last = Krakauer|first = David C.|date = 1995|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/bf00177338|pmid = |access-date =|volume=36|pages=421–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially true in open habitats, such as [[grassland]]s or [[Pelagic zone|open ocean]] ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or [[reef]]. Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being [[starling]]s and [[sardine]]s. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In one study, [[wildebeest]] on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population; researchers found that the wildebeest with white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Spotted Hyena. A Study Of Predation and Social Behavior.|last = Kruuk|first = Hans|date = 1973|journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology|doi = 10.2307/3145|pmid = |access-date =|volume=42|pages=822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no [[sexual dimorphism]], and why many species in heterospecific schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">'''Retention and protention''' ({{lang-de|Retention und Protention}}) are key aspects of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[temporality]]. 

==Overview==
Our experience of the world is not of a series of unconnected moments. Indeed, it would be impossible to have an experience of the world if we did not have a sense of [[temporality]]. That our perception brings an impression to our minds depends upon retention and protention. 

'''Retention''' is the process whereby a phase of a perceptual act is retained in our consciousness. It is a presentation of that which is no longer before us and is distinct from immediate experience. A simple example might be that of watching a ball being thrown. We retain where the ball was in our minds to understand the momentum of the ball as we perceive it in the immediate present. Retention is not a representation or memory but a presentation of a temporally extended present. That is, a present that extends beyond the few short milliseconds that are registered in a moment of sense perception. 

'''Protention''' is our anticipation of the next moment. The moment that has yet to be perceived. Again, using the example of a ball, our focus shifts along the expected path the ball will take. 

According to Husserl, perception has three temporal aspects, retention, the immediate present and protention and a flow through which each moment of protention becomes the retention of the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Francisco| last=Varela| author-link=Francisco Varela | title=The Specious Present : A Neurophenomenology of Time Consciousness | publisher=Stanford University Press | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] describes the temporal phenomenology of perception in the [[Phenomenology of Perception]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Husserl uses the terms protentions and retentions for the intentionalities which anchor me to an environment. They do not run from a central I, but from my perceptual field itself, so to speak, which draws along in its wake its own horizon of retentions, and bites into the future with its protentions. I do not pass through a series of instances of now, the images of which I preserve and which, placed end to end, make a line. With the arrival of every moment, its predecessor undergoes a change: I still have it in hand and it is still there, but already it is sinking away below the level of presents; in order to retain it, I need to reach through a thin layer of time. It is still the preceding moment, and I have the power to rejoin it as it was just now; I am not cut off from it, but still it would not belong to the past unless something had altered, unless it were beginning to outline itself against, or project itself upon, my present, whereas a moment ago it was my present. When a third moment arrives, the second undergoes a new modification; from being a retention it becomes the retention of a retention, and the layer of time between it and me thickens."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first=Maurice| last=Merleau-Ponty| author-link=Maurice Merleau-Ponty | title=Phenomenology of Perception | publisher=Routledge | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Interesting links with this theory come from current neuroscience which shows that present, past and future are always intertwined, also in memory. Accordingly, “memory is not only about the past, but is also about the future. Indeed, while memory serves as the ability to recall previous experiences, recall itself is not solely directed toward the past, but is guided by the present for the service of the future”.&lt;ref&gt;Ofengenden, Tzofit (2014).

The '''Ring of Gyges''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|ˌ|dʒ|iː|z}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Γύγου Δακτύλιος}}) is a [[mythology|mythical]] [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] artifact mentioned by the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] in Book 2 of his ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'' (2:359a–2:360d).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/631825| jstor = 631825| title = Ringing the Changes on Gyges: Philosophy and the Formation of Fiction in Plato's Republic| journal = [[Journal of Hellenic Studies]]| volume = 121| pages = 12–29| year = 2001| last1 = Laird | first1 = A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grants its owner the power to become [[invisibility|invisible]] at will. Through the story of the ring, ''Republic'' considers whether an intelligent person would be moral if they did not have to fear being caught and punished for doing injustices.

==The legends==
[[Gyges of Lydia]] was a historical king, the founder of the [[Mermnad dynasty]] of [[Lydia]]n kings. Various ancient works—the most well-known being ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 1.7–13&lt;/ref&gt;—gave different accounts of the circumstances of his rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Kirby Flower | last2 = | first2 =  | year = 1902 | title = The Tale of Gyges and the King of Lydia | journal = [[American Journal of Philology]] | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 361–387 | publisher =  | jstor = 288700 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All, however, agree in asserting that he was originally a subordinate of King [[Candaules]] of [[Lydia]], that he killed Candaules and seized the throne, and that he had either seduced Candaules' Queen before killing him, married her afterwards, or both.

In [[Glaucon]]'s recounting of the myth, an unnamed ancestor of Gyges&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeplato|Republic|359d|gr}}: "τῷ [Γύγου] τοῦ Λυδοῦ προγόνῳ". In ''Republic'', Book 10 ({{Citeplato|Republic|612b}}), Socrates refers to the ring as "the ring of Gyges" ({{lang|grc|τὸν Γύγου [[wikt:δακτύλιος|δακτύλιον]]}}). For this reason, the story is simply called "The Ring of Gyges".&lt;/ref&gt; was a shepherd in the service of the ruler of Lydia. After an earthquake, a cave was revealed in a mountainside where he was feeding his flock. Entering the cave, he discovered that it was in fact a tomb with a bronze horse containing a [[cadaver|corpse]], larger than that of a man, who wore a [[gold]]en [[finger ring|ring]], which he pocketed. He discovered that the ring gave him the power to become invisible by adjusting it. He then arranged to be chosen as one of the messengers who reported to the king as to the status of the flocks. Arriving at the palace, he used his new power of invisibility to seduce the queen, and with her help he murdered the king, and became king of Lydia himself.

==The role of the legend in ''Republic''==
In ''Republic'', the tale of the ring of Gyges is described by the character of Glaucon who is the brother of Plato. Glaucon asks whether any man can be so [[virtue|virtuous]] that he could resist the temptation of being able to perform any act without being known or discovered. Glaucon suggests that [[morality]] is only a [[social construction]], the source of which is the desire to maintain one's reputation for virtue and justice. Hence, if that sanction were removed, one's moral character would evaporate.

Glaucon posits:

{{quote|Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men.

Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.

For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
|Plato|''Republic'', 360b–d ([[Benjamin Jowett|Jowett]] trans.)}}

Though his answer to Glaucon's challenge is delayed, Socrates ultimately argues that justice does not derive from this social construct: the man who abused the power of the Ring of Gyges has in fact enslaved himself to his appetites, while the man who chose not to use it remains rationally in control of himself and is therefore happy. (Republic 10:612b)

==Cultural influences&lt;!--linked from 'Cultural influence of Plato's Republic'--&gt;==
*[[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' has as its basis a retelling of the tale of the Ring of Gyges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/57/holt57art.htm|title=H.G.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Tolkien was influenced by Plato's story, a search on "Gyges" and "Plato" in his letters and biography provides no evidence for this.  Unlike Plato's ring, Tolkien's exerts an active malevolent force that necessarily destroys the morality of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''The Lord of the Ring'', Book I, Chapter 2, "The Shadow of the Past".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cicero retells the story of Gyges in ''[[De Officiis]]'' to illustrate his thesis that a wise or good individual bases decisions on a fear of moral degradation as opposed to punishment or negative consequences.  Cicero follows with a discussion of the role of [[thought experiment]]s in philosophy.  The hypothetical situation in question is complete immunity from punishment of the kind afforded to Gyges by his ring.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Officiis]]'' 3.38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "SHEEP" is pun on the [[Lisp Algebraic Manipulator]] or ''LAM'' on which SHEEP is based.  The package was written by Inge Frick, using earlier work by Ian Cohen and [[Ray d'Inverno]], who had written '''ALAM''' - Atlas LISP Algebraic Manipulation in earlier (designed in 1970).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=487 Entry at hopl.murdoch.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311191322/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=487 |date=2011-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=487 Description at hopl.murdoch.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819232418/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=487 |date=2008-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''SHEEP''' was an [[interactive]] computer package&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m805pw3440280205/ Interacting with SHEEP by R.

[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'', by [[William Holman Hunt]], 1854]]

In the [[Bible]], a '''scapegoat''' is an animal which is ritually burdened with the sins of others, then driven away. The concept first appears in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert to carry away the sins of the community. 

{{Quote|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the {{Lord}}, and the other lot for Azazel.||Leviticus 16:8, Jewish Publication Society (1917)}}

Practices with some similarities to the scapegoat ritual also appears in ancient Greece and [[Ebla]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Azazel}}

The word 'scapegoat' is an English translation of the Hebrew ''‘ăzāzêl'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [[Leviticus]] 16:8. The lexicographer [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius "I have no doubt that it should be rendered 'averter'"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon&lt;ref&gt;p736&lt;/ref&gt; give ''la-azazel'' (Hebrew: לעזאזל) as a [[reduplicative]] intensive of the stem ''‘-Z-L'' "remove", hence ''la-‘ăzāzêl,'' "for entire removal". This reading is supported by the [[Septuagint|Greek Old Testament]] translation as "the sender away (of sins)".

Alternatively, broadly contemporary with the Septuagint, the pseudepigraphical [[Book of Enoch]] may preserve Azazel as the name of a [[fallen angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Archie T. Wright ''The origin of evil spirits: the reception of Genesis 6.1-4'' Page 111 2005 "However, the corresponding Aramaic fragment of / Enoch 10.4 does not use the name Azazel; instead, the name has been reconstructed by Milik to read Asa'el. Stuckenbruck suggests the presence of the biblical form Azazel in the Ethiopic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David P. "Azazel". Pages 1:536-37 in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]]. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The symbolism of the Azazel goat'' Ralph D. Levy 1998 "This is still fairly straightforward, and is translated by the majority of the versions as "for Azazel" (Targums Onkelos and Pseudo-Jonathan follow this understanding, as do the RSV, NRSV, REB, and Tanakh). KJV and NKJV have "to be the scapegoat"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colouring [[tinctures]]."&lt;ref&gt;Enoch 8:1, translation by R. H. Charles. Online [https://www.ccel.org/c/charles/otpseudepig/enoch/ENOCH_1.HTM here]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Early English [[Christian Bible]] versions follow the translation of the [[Septuagint]] and Latin [[Vulgate]] which interpret ''azazel'' as "the goat that departs" (Greek ''tragos apopompaios'', "goat sent out", Latin ''caper emissarius'', "emissary goat"). [[William Tyndale]] rendered the Latin as "(e)scape goat" in his [[Tyndale Bible|1530 Bible]]. This translation was followed by following versions up to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in 1611: "And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&amp;pg=PA412|year=1991|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|isbn=978-0-87779-603-9|pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern versions however either follow the reading as a demon, Azazel, or footnote "for Azazel." as an alternative reading.

Jewish sources in the [[Talmud]] (Yoma 6:4,67b) give the etymology of ''azazel'' as a compound of ''az'', strong or rough, and ''el'', mighty, that the goat was sent from the most rugged or strongest of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2203&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Azazel#6890 |title=AZAZEL |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Targums]] onwards the term ''azazel'' was also seen by some rabbinical commentators as the name of a Hebrew demon, angelic force, or pagan deity.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS guide to Jewish traditions - Page 224 Ronald L. Eisenberg, Jewish Publication Society - 2004 "(Leviticus 16:8–10). In talmudic times, a popular rabbinic interpretation was that Azazel referred to the place to which the goat was sent, the eretz g'zera (inaccessible region) of Leviticus (16:22). Later, Azazel became associated with another..."&lt;/ref&gt; The two readings are still disputed today.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus Nahum M. Sarna, Chaim Potok, Jewish Publication Society - 1989 " According to the first, Azazel is the name of the place in the wilderness to which the scapegoat was dispatched; ... According to the second line of interpretation, Azazel describes the goat. The word ' aza''zel is a contraction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Judaism==
{{main|Azazel}}
The scapegoat was a [[goat]] that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל ) ''la-aza'zeyl''; "[[Azazel|for absolute removal]]" (for symbolic removal of the people's sins with the literal removal of the goat), and outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [[Day of Atonement]], that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]].

Once a year, on [[Yom Kippur]], the [[Cohen Gadol]] sacrificed a bull as a [[sin offering]] to [[Atonement in Judaism|atone]] for sins he may have committed unintentionally throughout the year. Subsequently he took two goats and presented them at the door of the tabernacle. Two goats were chosen by [[cleromancy|lot]]: one to be "for [[YHWH]]", which was offered as a blood sacrifice, and the other to be the scapegoat to be sent away into the wilderness. The blood of the slain goat was taken into the Holy of Holies behind the sacred veil and sprinkled on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark of the covenant. Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest [[confession in Judaism|confessed]] the intentional sins of the Israelites to God placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who would symbolically "take them away".

== Christian perspectives ==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Agnus-Dei The Scapegoat (Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|''Agnus-Dei: The Scapegoat'' (''Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.''), by [[James Tissot]]]]
In Christianity this process prefigures the sacrifice of [[Christ]] on the cross through which God has been propitiated and sins can be expiated. Jesus Christ is seen to have fulfilled all of the biblical "types"—the High Priest who officiates at the ceremony, the Lord's goat that deals with the pollution of sin and the scapegoat that removes the "burden of sin". Christians believe that sinners who own their guilt and confess their [[sins]], exercising faith and trust in the person and sacrifice of [[Jesus]], are forgiven of their sins. 

Since the second goat was sent away to perish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Golden Bough]]'' p. 569 Sir [[James Frazer]], Worsworth Reference {{ISBN|1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "scapegoat" has developed to indicate a person who is blamed and punished for the sins of others.

== Similar practices==

===Ancient Syria===
A concept superficially similar to the biblical scapegoat is attested in two ritual texts in archives at [[Ebla]] of the 24th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatelli |first=Ida |date=April 1998 |title=The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Text |journal=[[Vetus Testamentum]] |volume=48 |issue=2 |page= |pages=254–263 |ref=href |doi=10.1163/1568533982721604}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were connected with ritual purification on the occasion of the king's wedding. In them, a she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of "Alini"; "we" in the report of the ritual involves the whole community. Such "elimination rites", in which an animal, without confession of sins, is the vehicle of evils (not sins) that are chased from the community are widely attested in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;David P. Wright, ''The Disposal of the Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press) 1987:15-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greeks practiced scapegoating rituals in exceptional times based on the belief that the repudiation of one or two individuals would save the whole community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|date=1983|title=Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/311262|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=87|pages=299–320|doi=10.2307/311262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Raymond|date=|title=Who Led the Scapegoat in Leviticus 16:21?|url=|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scapegoating was practiced with different rituals across ancient Greece for different reasons but was mainly used during extraordinary circumstances such as famine, drought or plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scapegoat would usually be an individual of lower society such as a criminal, slave or poor person and was referred to as the [[pharmakos|''pharmakos'']], ''katharma'' or ''peripsima''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a dichotomy, however, in the individuals used as scapegoats in mythical tales and the ones used in the actual rituals. In mythical tales it was stressed that someone of high importance had to be sacrificed if the whole society would benefit from the aversion of catastrophe (usually a king or the king's children).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, since no king or person of importance would be willing to sacrifice himself or his children, the scapegoat in actual rituals would be someone of lower society who would be given value through special treatment such as fine clothes and dining before the sacrificial ceremony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sacrificial ceremonies varied across Greece depending on the festival and type of catastrophe. In [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], for example, a poor man was feasted and led around the walls of the city once before being chased out with stones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Massilia a poor man was feasted for a year and then cast out of the city in order to stop a plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scholia refer to the ''pharmakos'' being killed, but many scholars reject this, and argue that the earliest evidence (the fragments of the [[Iambic poetry|iambic satirist]] [[Hipponax]]) only show the ''pharmakos'' being stoned, beaten and driven from the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5269">'''Section Nine of the [[Constitution of South Africa]]''' guarantees [[equality before the law]] and [[freedom from discrimination]] to the people of South Africa. This [[equality right]] is the first right listed in the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]]. It prohibits both discrimination by the government and discrimination by private persons; however, it also allows for [[affirmative action]] to be taken to redress past unfair discrimination.

==Text==
Under the heading "Equality", the section states:
{{Quote|9. (1) Everyone is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law.

(2) Equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights and freedoms. To promote the achievement of equality, legislative and other measures designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons, disadvantaged by unfair discrimination may be taken.

(3) The state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth.

(4) No person may unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds in terms of subsection (3). National legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination.

(5) Discrimination on one or more of the grounds listed in subsection (3) is unfair unless it is established that the discrimination is fair.}}

==Notable cases==
* ''[[Brink v Kitshoff NO]]'' (1996) — provisions of the Insurance Act which deprived married women of certain benefits of life insurance policies are unfairly discriminatory on the basis of gender and marital status.
* ''[[President of the Republic of South Africa and Another v Hugo]]'' (1997) — a presidential decision to remit the sentences of imprisoned mothers with young children is not unfair discrimination against similarly-situated fathers.
* ''[[Prinsloo v Van der Linde and Another]]'' (1997) — a law which imposes a different [[Legal burden of proof|onus of proof]] in civil cases involving forest fires does not deny equal protection of the law or amount to unfair discrimination.
* ''[[Larbi-Odam and Others v MEC for Education (North-West Province) and Another]]'' (1997) — a government policy prohibiting the employment of non-citizens as school teachers is unfair discrimination.
* ''[[City Council of Pretoria v Walker]]'' (1998) — a municipality's policy of charging a metered rate for water and electricity in formerly white areas but a flat rate per household in formerly black areas, with the effect that the residents of the white area pay higher rates on average, is not unfair discrimination, as the facilities provided to different areas are significantly different. However, the policy of suing to collect payments in arrears from residents of the white areas, but not suing similarly-situated residents of the black areas, is unfair discrimination.
* ''[[National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Another v Minister of Justice and Others]]'' (1998) — the criminalisation of male same-sex sexual relations is unfair discrimination on the grounds of gender and sexual orientation.
* ''[[National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others]]'' (1999) — an immigration law which provides benefits to married couples discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation and must be extended to provide the same benefits to same-sex life partners.
* ''[[Hoffmann v South African Airways]]'' (2000) — a government-owned airline's policy of refusing to hire [[HIV]]-positive people as flight attendants violates the right to equality.
* ''[[Satchwell v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another]]'' (2002) — pension and retirement benefits provided to the spouses of judges must be equally provided to the same-sex life partners of judges.
* ''[[S v Jordan and Others]]'' (2002) — the gender-neutral criminalisation of prostitution does not discriminate unfairly against women.
* ''[[Khosa and Others v Minister of Social Development and Others]]'' (2003) — social welfare grants provided to South African citizens must also be provided to non-citizen permanent residents; to do otherwise is unfair discrimination.
* ''[[Bhe and Others v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, and Others]]'' (2004) — the rule of [[male primogeniture]] in the [[Customary law in South Africa|African customary law]] of inheritance discriminates unfairly against women and against younger children.
* ''[[Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another]]'' (2005) — the denial of marriage to same-sex couples is unfair discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. (See [[same-sex marriage in South Africa]].)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10574">[[File:Snovit och sanningens vansinne.jpg|thumb|300px|The installation ''Snow White and The Madness of Truth''.]]

'''''Snow White and The Madness of Truth''''' ({{lang-sv|Snövit och sanningens vansinne}}) was a 2004 item of [[installation art]] by [[Sweden|Swedish]], [[Israel]]i-born composer and musician [[Dror Feiler]] and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sköld-Feiler. Feiler and Sköld-Feiler created the visuals and the music for the artwork together, which was installed in the [[Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

The installation consisted of a long pool of water coloured blood red, upon which floated a small white boat named "Snövit" ("Snow White") carrying a portrait of [[Hanadi Jaradat]], a Palestinian [[suicide bomber]], which were accompanied by text written on the nearby walls, and the sound of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut]]'' (Cantata 199). This piece begins with the words, "''My heart swims in blood / because the brood of my sins / in God's holy eyes / makes me into a monster''". According to the artists, the installation was made to "call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things".

The artwork became the centre of some controversy when the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, [[Zvi Mazel]], vandalized it after he claimed it was [[antisemitic]] in nature. Some argued that critics failed to understand the artists' central message about [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[freedom of thought]], and [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]. Reactions to the piece have been compared to reactions to [[Steve Earle]]'s song "[[John Walker Lindh|John Walker]]'s Blues", which appeared on his 2002 album ''Jerusalem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sverker Lenas |url=http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=225078 |title=Varför uppstår vantolkningarna? |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date=2004-01-21 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514214557/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=225078 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As scheduled, the artwork was removed from display on February 8, 2004. In 2011 the Feilers created a new installation called ''"Once upon a time in the middle of winter"'' based on the events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/konst-form/feilers-snovit-seglar-igen DN: Feilers ”Snövit” seglar igen]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In early 2004 the artwork briefly came to the attention of the international media after it was [[vandalism|vandalized]] on January 16 by [[Zvi Mazel]], the [[Israel]]i ambassador to Sweden. Mazel disconnected the electricity powering the installation and tipped one of its lights into the water, causing a [[short circuit]]. When Mazel was asked to leave he refused and had to be escorted out by museum security.&lt;ref name="konst" /&gt; The entire event was filmed by the museum's security cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forsare|first1=Malena|title=Den andra sagan om Snövit|trans-title=The second tale about Snow White|url=http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/bocker/bokrecensioner/den-andra-sagan-om-snovit/|website=www.sydsvenskan.se|publisher=[[Sydsvenskan]]|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mazel later gave contradicting statements about the event. To the Swedish media, he said it was done in the heat of the moment,&lt;ref name=konst&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/sthlm/ambassador-forstorde-konst-1.236382 |title=Ambassadör förstörde konst |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date=2004-01-17 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but to Israeli media he said it was premeditated and that he had planned it even before he saw the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/383944.html  |title=Haaretz – Article |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2004-01-19 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040201210331/http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/383944.html |archivedate = 2004-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, Feiler appeared in [[Nyhetsmorgon]] on Swedish [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] and explained that the white boat symbolized truth; and if an individual believed that their views were the absolute embodiment of truth, the end result could well be the pool of blood depicted in the installation.

According to Sköld-Feiler, the name [[Snow White]] was chosen simply because in her portrait, Hanadi Jaradat resembled Snow White with her black hair, pale skin and red lips.

The installation was a part of the [[Making Differences]] exhibition at the Swedish History Museum. On January 18, 2004, Thomas Nordanstad, who is responsible for the exhibition, was attacked by an unidentified man who tried to push Nordanstad down a staircase. Nordanstad had also recently received over 400 e-mails containing various threats. Both Kristian Berg, head of the museum, and the artists also received many threats. The following Sunday, a museum guard had to remove a group of people who were throwing various objects into the water.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/attack-mot-konstnarlig-ledare-1.236631|title=Attack mot konstnärlig ledare|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=January 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attack on Nordanstad the number of visitors to the museum increased to approximately 1,400 per day, up from roughly the same number per week.&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/390062.html |title=PR flurry in Stockholm over envoy's outrage – Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Swedish [[Dagens Nyheter]] journalist [[Henrik Brors]] there may have been hidden motives behind Zvi Mazel's act. He speculated that it may have been done in an effort to discredit [[Sweden]] and the [[European Union]] by depicting them as [[antisemites]], and to have the EU back down from its peace efforts in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=DN2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/analys-sharon-vill-forsvaga-sveriges-trovardighet/|title=Sharon vill försvaga Sveriges trovärdighet|publisher=Dagens Nyheter|date=January 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the analysis in Dagens Nyheter Brors further speculated that Mazel may have done it to give Israel an excuse for not attending the international anti-genocide conference [[Stockholm International Forum]] that was to be held in Stockholm January 26–28.&lt;ref name=DN2 /&gt;

The situation escalated further when [[Israel Army Radio]] incorrectly reported that a "pro Israeli" film was removed from the exhibition at the request of [[Syria]].{{citation needed|date=September 2009}} Both Thomas Nordanstad and Kristian Berg demonstrated that this allegation was false, as the documentary in question, "Map" by award-winning Israeli film maker [[Amit Goren]], remained as part of the exhibition. It is believed that the erroneous rumour probably started when the display was moved from [[Tensta Konsthall]] due to some internal problems. During the whole time, another work by Goren, the film ''119 Bullets + Three''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfct.org.il/movies/119_Bullets_Three_e.htm “119 Bullets + Three"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023232250/http://www.nfct.org.il/movies/119_Bullets_Three_e.htm |date=2005-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was also on display. The display of Goren's works is sponsored by the Israeli embassy, and the cultural attache, [[Lizzie Oved Scheja]], stated that the exhibit had their absolute support.

The [[Young Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Young Christian Democrats]], the youth organisation of the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Swedish Christian Democratic party]], reported the artwork to the police in hope that action could be taken pursuant to Sweden's strict laws against [[hate speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdu.se/article.asp?Article_Id=2355] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706021200/http://www.kdu.se/article.asp?Article_Id=2355 |date=July 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazel himself asked in an interview "If we [[Jews]] say that this offends us, why can't a government remove it?".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&amp;a=225166 Mazel skonar Persson i ny attack&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219222240/http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1042&amp;a=225166 |date=2006-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stockholms Lokaltrafik]] decided to remove advertising of the Making Differences exhibit that used a picture of Hanadi Jaradat; those posters were a part of C. M. V. Hausswolff's artwork "God made me do it" and had nothing to do with Feiler/Sköld installation "Snow White and the Madness of Truth."&lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt;

An e-mail protest organized by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] has been directed at Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]]'s office. By the morning of January 27, 2004, 13,603 emails had been received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/387653.html Portail d'informations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070717210320/http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/387653.html |date=2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristian Berg stated that "I did not hear anyone who saw the work say that it was an anti-Semitic installation, against the Jewish people or against the Israeli people, I therefore think that this work was politically hijacked – the interpretation that Ambassador Mazel gave it was very narrow and very political." &lt;ref name=Haaretz /&gt;

'''Something''' and '''anything''' are [[concept]]s of [[existence]] in [[ontology]], contrasting with the concept of [[nothing]]. Both are used to describe the understanding that what exists is not [[nothing]] without needing to address the existence of [[everything]]. The philosopher, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], has pointed out that these are necessarily vague terms, asserting that "ontological assertions of common sense are correct if the quantifiers—such words as "something" and "anything"—are restricted roughly to ordinary or familiar things."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Hirsch, ''Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology'' (2011), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that "something" is the opposite of "nothing" has existed at least since it was proposed by the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Fragments of Iamblichus' Commentary on the Timaeus'', John Myles Dillon trans. (1973), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most basic questions of both science and philosophy is: why is there something rather than nothing at all?&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Tyron Goldschmidt, ed., ''The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A question that follows from this is whether it is ever actually possible for there to be nothing at all, or whether there must always be something.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', D. M. Armstrong, ''Truth and Truthmakers'' (2004), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grammatically, "''something'' and ''anything'' are commonly classified as [[pronouns]], although they do not stand for another noun so clearly as does ''[[object (philosophy)|thing]]'' itself, a word always classified as a noun".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Eustis Morsberger, Janet Rankin Aiken, ''Commonsense Grammar and Style'' (1975), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In predicate logic==
{{Main|Existential quantification}}
In [[predicate logic]], what is described in layman's terms as "something" can more specifically be regarded as [[existential quantification]], that is, the predication of a property or relation to at least one member of the domain. It is a type of [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]], a [[logical constant]] which is [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] as "there exists," "there is at least one," or "for some." It expresses that a [[propositional function]] can be [[satisfiability|satisfied]] by at least one [[element (mathematics)|member]] of a [[domain of discourse]]. In other terms, it is the [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]] of a [[property (philosophy)|property]] or [[binary relation|relation]]  to at least one member of the domain. It [[logical assertion|asserts]] that a predicate within the [[free variables and bound variables|scope]] of an existential quantifier is true of at least one [[Valuation (logic)|value]] of a [[predicate variable]].

==Nothing and something==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Though considered to exclude one another, the concepts of something and nothing can coincide under special circumstances. One example would be when a person says "I am doing nothing"; they are really doing ''something'', because it is physically and mentally impossible to do nothing. At the specific level, nothing can be used as a label describing something. The requirement is that the nothing equates to ''not changing the outcome''. For instance, when hiking up and down a mountain, the trip can be expressed in increments of height. Climbing the mountain, the increments can be described as pluses (as in positive increases) and when descending the increments are described as minuses (negative increases). Yet walking around at the top of a mountain, one does not ascend or descend, and the increments are neither positive nor negative. Nothing in height was added or subtracted when reviewing these specific moments during the mountain climb.

This reality of nothing can only occur as a subset of somethings. In the example above, the somethings can be seen as the mountain and the person climbing the mountain. Next, the nothing can be recognized as a something, but again only as part of the subset of the exercise, since ''walking around'' can be referred to as doing something while the exercise adds nor subtracts anything in height.

To set nothing correctly apart from something, one must declare the specific level at which the something and the nothing are articulated. Both are therefore not only declared by their own definition but need to be declared within a larger reality as well. Without declaring the overall setting — and this brings us to the overall level that [[Gödel]] already explored — it becomes difficult to declare whether we're talking about a tree or about a forest, particularly where ''nothing'' is concerned.

==Anything==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Often pronounced in a way that indicates evading specifics, ''anything'' provides full freedom about the something that is supposedly covered by the word. "Anything goes" indicates maximization of freedom, just like "Do as you please" means there are no restrictions other than the restrictions put in place by oneself.

One can make the statement that ''anything'' is a specific word where ''everything'' can be seen as a general word. Still, both meanings may readily be understood by everyone, while their definitions will equally contain some aspects of murkiness as to what is included and what is not. First of all, ''anything'' does not need to be covered by an actual something, since an act of god or fate, a coincident or an unintended consequence can also be included in the list of ''anything''. Also, the question whether an ''actual'' nothing can also be used to take up the place of ''anything'' is harder to debate at the abstract level and requires actual input to declare whether this is true or false.  Examples of this position are that not the amount of money, but rather the lack of money can make us rise and shine early from bed to go to work, and that not the abundance of food, but rather hunger and the lack of food make us hunt and till the soil. See also: [[Much Ado About Nothing]].

==Singular and plural somethings==
{{unsourced-section|date=March 2017}}
Since words are abstracts and are actualized only through the action of understanding, an interesting distinction exists between singular somethings and plural somethings. When describing a single object or describing more than one object in an action of, for instance, ''breaking something'', the verb is conjugated differently. In "The glass ''was'' broken" and "The glasses ''were'' broken," the verb ''to be'' is conjugated differently according to the singular or plural reality described. However, when using a singular word describing multiple items, the verb is (correctly) conjugated as if this were a singular entity: "The collection ''was'' destroyed" and not "The collection ''were'' destroyed."

The example shows that plural somethings can be presented as singular somethings. Actual ''somethings'' can therefore as shown above be hidden under the banner of an abstract ''something''. Some claim to have evidence that a singular something does not occur in actuality at the overall level ever, and that a singular overall truth can only exist correctly at the abstract level in our minds. As such, the concept of ''something'' would then also have a direct correlation to the concept of ''everything'' just as this exists for the concept of ''nothing''.

Hofmeyr also has three other children by other women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tvsa.co.za/actors/viewactor.aspx?actorid=5487 |title=Steve Hofmeyr|publisher=TVSA|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A: Steve Hofmeyr|url=http://rollingstone.co.za/opinion/item/903-qaa-steve-hofmeyr|publisher=RollingStone Magazine|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was divorced after reports of numerous affairs dominated Hofmeyr's time in the spotlight in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'', [http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443465,00.html "Steve 'needs psychiatric help"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Hofmeyr allegedly assaulted Esmaré Weideman, editor of ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', a popular Afrikaans magazine, by pouring a cup of cold tea over her at the [[Miss South Africa]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;Philip de Bruin, ''News 24'' (South Africa),[http://www.news24.com/News24/Entertainment/Local/0,,2-1225-1242_2443046,00.html "Steve gets shir-tea with editor"], 17 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have blamed her and two other journalists for his divorce from Sutherland. Miss Weideman subsequently dropped her accusations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=20110411082345874 |title=Hofmeyr and editor end legal stand-off |publisher=Legalbrief |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2013, Hofmeyr was arrested in [[Bronkhorstspruit]] for driving at 169&amp;nbsp;km/h in an 80&amp;nbsp;km/h zone and was released on bail of [[South African rand|R]]500. He was subsequently fined R10,000 in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate's Court on 23 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/News/Local/Steve-Hofmeyr-fined-R10-000-for-speeding-20140123 |title=Steve Hofmeyr fined R10 000 for speeding|date=23 January 2014 |work=Channel24.co.za|accessdate=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr married Janine van der Vyver on 26 January 2014. In 2008, van der Vyver, a fitness instructor, revealed they had been seeing each other for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/hofmeyr-pays-up-in-time-for-wedding-1.1636171#.U6RvXk3QdaS |title=Hofmeyr pays up in time for wedding}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr's grandfather, Steve Hofmeyr Sr., was a leader in the [[Ossewabrandwag]], a South African political and guerrilla organisation which supported Germany during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Phyllis |last1=Green |date=7 March 2014|work=Sarie|title=Steve Hofmeyr gesels oor sy nuwe boek |url= http://www.sarie.com/lewe-liefdes/boeke/steve-hofmeyr-gesels-oor-sy-nuwe-boek/#/|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Piet|last1= Ebersöhn|date=25 July 2012|title=Eerste sportredakteur was Oxford Blue én owerste van Stormjaers |url=http://perskor.blogspot.de/2012/07/eerste-sportredakteur-was-oxford-blue.html|language=Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In January 2007, there were reports that one branch of the [[News Cafe]] restaurant chain would not play Hofmeyr's song ''Pampoen''. The managing director of the company that owns the franchise denies that this is company policy and points out that many Afrikaans acts, such as [[Karen Zoid]] and [[Arno Carstens]] have performed at News Cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Eagan Williamson | title = News Cafe begin 'n ander (Afrikaanse) deuntjie sing | url = http://www.news24.com/Beeld/Suid-Afrika/0,,3-975_2051223,00.html | work = Beeld | date = 4 January 2007 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | language = Afrikaans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2011, Hofmeyr released the lyrics to his new song called "Ons sal dit oorleef", which means "We will survive this". The song is controversial, because Hofmeyr threatened to include the ethnic slur "[[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]" in the lyrics of the song.&lt;ref name="Steve Hofmeyr Spits venom"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/05/13/steve-hofmeyr-spits-venom | title=Steve Hofmeyr spits venom | date=12 May 2011 | accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hofmeyr removed the offensive word in his song, citing that the word would offend his black friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sapa|title=K-word will offend my black friends, says Hofmeyr|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-05-17-kword-will-offend-my-black-friends-says-hofmeyr|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he made public that he supports the Afrikaner advocacy group "Expedition for Afrikaner Self-Determination"  ([[Onafhanklike Afrikaner Selfbeskikkingsekspedisie]], OASE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OASE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjTmH5OXGvA|title=Steve Hofmeyr Supports OASE|date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr was heavily criticised after performing the former South African national anthem, ''[[Die Stem]]'', at a cultural festival known as ''Innibos'' in [[Nelspruit]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hofmeyr-sings-die-stem-at-innibos-1.1716416#.VJgh814C8|title=Hofmeyr sings Die Stem at Innibos |date=8 July 2014 |website= |publisher=iol News |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to perform the anthem on international tours, and encouraged white South Africans to continue singing it, stating that it did not contain any form of hate speech.

In October 2014, Hofmeyr wrote and published a tweet stating that he believed that black South Africans were the "architects of apartheid" on his public Twitter account. This prompted a significant public backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hofmeyr faces Twitter backlash after Apartheid post|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Hofmeyr-faces-Twitter-backlash-after-apartheid-post-20141028}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hofmeyr's critics was puppeteer Conrad Koch through his puppet Chester Missing, who launched a campaign calling on companies to stop sponsoring Hofmeyr. On 27 November 2014, Hofmeyr failed to acquire a final protection order against Koch and his puppet in the Randburg Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/2014/11/27/steve-hofmeyr-0-chester-missing-1|title=Steve Hofmeyr 0, Chester Missing 1 |date=28 November 2014 |website= |publisher=Business Day |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hofmeyr has given statements indicative of apartheid denialism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-30-chester-missing-questions-steve-hofmeyr-sponsorship|accessdate=11 April 2015|title=Chester Missing questions sponsorship of 'apartheid denialist'|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|agency=SAPA|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading various journalists and political analysts to label him a "disgrace to South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawjee|first1=Haji Mohamed|title=Steve Hofmeyr: 7 books from his library|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-29-the-library-of-a-right-wing-afrikaner-nationalist|accessdate=3 November 2014|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cronje|first1=Frans|title=Steve Hofmeyr, you're a disgrace to South Africa|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=236445&amp;sn=Detail|website=PoliticsWeb|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gous|first1=Nico|title=Hofmeyr in onderonsie oor ‘white trash’|url=http://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Algemeen/hofmeyr-in-onderonsie-oor-white-trash-20161110|website=Netwerk24|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://mg.co.za/article/2014-07-16-die-stem-steve-hofmeyr-and-a-die-hard-sense-of-idealism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims about murders of white South Africans===
{{see|Crime in South Africa|White genocide conspiracy theory}}
Hofmeyr has made numerous claims relating to murders of white South Africans. Hofmeyr has claimed that whites, and in particular Afrikaners, are being "killed like flies", posting on [[Facebook]] that "my tribe is dying". Hofmeyr also posted a picture of a "World Cup soccer stadium" which he claimed could be filled by the number of whites murdered by blacks. However, [[Africa Check]], a [[fact-checking]] organisation has found Hofmeyr's claims to be "incorrect and grossly exaggerated" - pointing out that whites are in fact "less likely to be murdered than any other race group". Lizette Lancaster from the [[Institute for Security Studies]] told Africa Check that "Whites are far less likely to be murdered than their black or coloured counterparts." While white South Africans account for nearly 9% of the population they account for just 1.8% of murder victims.&lt;ref&gt;https://africacheck.org/reports/are-white-afrikaners-really-being-killed-like-flies/&lt;/ref&gt;
During May 2018, The minister of Police, Mr [[Bheki Cele]] released farm attack statistics &lt;ref&gt;[[South African farm attacks]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=June 2018}} for the first time in years. &lt;

Naming the font color of a printed word is an easier and quicker task if word meaning and font color are congruent. If both are printed in red, the average time to say "RED" in response to the word 'Green' is greater than the time to say "RED" in response to the word 'Mouse'.
&lt;/div&gt;

In [[psychology]], the '''Stroop effect''' is a demonstration of interference in the [[reaction time]] of a task. 

When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color which is not denoted by the name (i.e., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. 

The effect is named after [[John Ridley Stroop]], who first published the effect in English in 1935.&lt;ref name="stroop"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1935|first=John Ridley|last=Stroop|volume=18|issue=6|pages=643–662|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Stroop/|accessdate=2008-10-08|doi=10.1037/h0054651}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929 by other authors.&lt;ref name="Jaensch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaensch|first=E.R|title=Grundformen menschlichen Seins|publisher=Otto Elsner|year = 1929|location = Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5328883"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jensen AR, Rohwer WD |title=The Stroop color-word test: a review|journal=Acta psychologica|volume=25|issue=1|pages=36–93|year=1966|pmid=5328883|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(66)90004-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacLeod CM|title=Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: an integrative review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=109|issue=2|pages=163–203|date=March 1991|pmid=2034749|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.109.2.163|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/bul/109/2/163}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original paper has been one of the most cited papers in the history of [[experimental psychology]], leading to more than 700 replications.&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt; The effect has been used to create a psychological test ('''Stroop test''') that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

Examples of the three stimuli and colors used for each of the activities of the original Stroop article.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Stroop-fig1-exp2.jpg|thumb|Figure 1 from Experiment 2 of the original description of the Stroop Effect (1935). 1 is the time that it takes to name the color of the dots while 2 is the time that it takes to say the color when there is a conflict with the written word.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt;]]

The effect was named after [[John Ridley Stroop]], who published the effect in English in 1935 in an article in the ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' entitled "Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions" that includes three different experiments.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt; However, the effect was first published in 1929 in Germany by [[Erich Rudolf Jaensch]],&lt;ref name="Jaensch" /&gt; and its roots can be followed back to works of [[James McKeen Cattell]] and [[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="pmid5328883"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt;

In his experiments, Stroop administered several variations of the same test for which three different kinds of stimuli were created: Names of colors appeared in black ink: Names of colors in a different ink than the color named; and Squares of a given color.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt;

In the first experiment, words and conflict-words were used (see first figure). The task required the participants to read the written color names of the words independently of the color of the ink (for example, they would have to read "purple" no matter what the color of the font). In experiment 2, stimulus conflict-words and color patches were used, and participants were required to say the ink-color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the patches. If the word "purple" was written in red font, they would have to say "red", rather than "purple". When the squares were shown, the participant spoke the name of the color. Stroop, in the third experiment, tested his participants at different stages of practice at the tasks and stimuli used in the first and second experiments, examining learning effects.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt;

Unlike researchers now using the test for psychological evaluation,&lt;ref name="Golden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stroop Color and Word Test: A Manual for Clinical and Experimental Uses|last=Golden|first=CJ|publisher=Skoelting|year=1978|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stroop used only the three basic scores, rather than more complex derivative scoring procedures. Stroop noted that participants took significantly longer to complete the color reading in the second task than they had taken to name the colors of the squares in Experiment 2. This delay had not appeared in the first experiment. Such interference were explained by the automation of reading, where the mind automatically determines the [[semantic]] meaning of the word (it reads the word "red" and thinks of the color "red"), and then must intentionally check itself and identify instead the color of the word (the ink is a color other than red), a process that is not automated.&lt;ref name="stroop"/&gt;

== Experimental findings ==
Stimuli in Stroop paradigms can be divided into 3 groups: neutral, congruent and incongruent. Neutral stimuli are those stimuli in which only the text (similarly to stimuli 1 of Stroop's experiment), or color (similarly to stimuli 3 of Stroop's experiment) are displayed.&lt;ref name="pmid19966248"/&gt; Congruent stimuli are those in which the ink color and the word refer to the same color (for example the word "pink" written in pink). Incongruent stimuli are those in which ink color and word differ.&lt;ref name="pmid19966248"/&gt; Three experimental findings are recurrently found in Stroop experiments.&lt;ref name="pmid19966248"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Maanen L, van Rijn H, Borst JP |title=Stroop and picture-word interference are two sides of the same coin |journal=Psychon Bull Rev |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=987–99 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19966248 |doi=10.3758/PBR.16.6.987 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first finding is ''semantic interference'', which states that naming the ink color of neutral stimuli (e.g. when the ink color and word do not interfere with each other) is faster than in incongruent conditions. It is called semantic interference since it is usually accepted that the relationship in meaning between ink color and word is at the root of the interference.&lt;ref name="pmid19966248"/&gt; The second finding, ''semantic facilitation'', explains the finding that naming the ink of congruent stimuli is faster (e.g. when the ink color and the word match) than when neutral stimuli are present (e.g. stimulus 3; when only a coloured square is shown). The third finding is that both semantic interference and facilitation disappear when the task consists of reading the word instead of naming the ink. It has been sometimes called ''Stroop asynchrony'', and has been explained by a reduced automatization when naming colors compared to reading words.&lt;ref name="pmid19966248"/&gt;

In the study of [[interference theory]], the most commonly used procedure has been similar to Stroop's second experiment, in which subjects were tested on naming colors of incompatible words and of control patches.  The first experiment in Stroop's study (reading words in black versus incongruent colors) has been discussed less. In both cases, the interference score is expressed as the difference between the times needed to read each of the two types of cards.&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt; Instead of naming stimuli, subjects have also been asked to sort stimuli into categories.&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt; Different characteristics of the stimulus such as ink colors or direction of words have also been systematically varied.&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt; None of all these modifications eliminates the effect of interference.&lt;ref name="pmid2034749"/&gt;

[[Neuroimaging|Brain imaging]] techniques including [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have shown that there are two main areas in the brain that are involved in the processing of the Stroop task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pardo|first1=Jose V|last2=Pardo|first2=Patricia J|last3=Janer|first3=Kevin W|last4=Raichle|first4=Marcus E|title=The anterior cingulate cortex mediates processing selection in the Stroop attentional conflict paradigm|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA|date=1 January 1990|volume=87|pages=256–259|pmid=2296583|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/87/1/256.full.pdf|doi=10.1073/pnas.87.1.256|pmc=53241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S|title=Isolation Of Specific Interference Processing In The Stroop Task: PET Activation Studies.|journal=NeuroImage|year=1997|volume=6|issue=2|pages=81–92|doi=10.1006/nimg.1997.0285|pmid=9299382}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Milham 2003 483–493"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milham|first=M|title=Practice-related Effects Demonstrate Complementary Roles Of Anterior Cingulate And Prefrontal Cortices In Attentional Control|journal=NeuroImage|year=2003|volume=18|issue=2|pages=483–493|doi=10.1016/s1053-8119(02)00050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, while both are activated when resolving conflicts and catching errors, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex assists in memory and other executive functions, while the anterior cingulate cortex is used to select an appropriate response and allocate attentional resources.&lt;ref name="Banich 2000 988–1000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banich|first=M|title=fMRI Studies of Stroop Tasks Reveal Unique Roles of Anterior and Posterior Brain Systems in Attentional Selection|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2000|volume=12|issue=6|pages=988–1000|doi=10.1162/08989290051137521|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex creates the appropriate rules for the brain to accomplish the current goal.&lt;ref name="Banich 2000 988–1000"/&gt;  For the Stroop effect, this involves activating the areas of the brain involved in color perception, but not those involved in word encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bush|first=G|title=The Counting Stroop: An Interference Task Specialized For Functional Neuroimaging Validation Study With Functional MRI|journal=Human Brain Mapping|year=1998|volume=6|issue=4|pages=270–288|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0193(1998)6:4&lt;270::aid-hbm6&gt;3.3.co;2-h|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It counteracts biases and irrelevant information, for instance,  the fact that the semantic perception of the word is more striking than the color in which it is printed.  Next, the mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex selects the representation that will fulfil the goal. The relevant information must be separated from irrelevant information in the task; thus, the focus is placed on the ink color and not the word.&lt;ref name="Banich 2000 988–1000"/&gt; 
Furthermore, research has suggested that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation during a Stroop task is related to an individual's’ expectation regarding the conflicting nature of the upcoming trial, and not so much on the conflict itself. Conversely, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex aims to reduce the [[attention]]al conflict and is activated after the conflict is over.&lt;ref name="Milham 2003 483–493"/&gt;

Moreoever, the posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is responsible for what decision is made (i.e. whether you will say the incorrect answer [written word] or the correct answer [ink color]).&lt;ref name="Milham 2003 483–493"/&gt;   Following the response, the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is involved in response evaluation—deciding whether the answer is correct or incorrect. Activity in this region increases when the probability of an error is higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=S|title=Stroop Performance in Normal Control Subjects: An fMRI Study|journal=NeuroImage|year=2002|volume=16|pages=349–360|doi=10.1006/nimg.2002.1089|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
There are several theories used to explain the Stroop effect and are commonly known as ‘race models’. This is based on the underlying notion that both relevant and irrelevant information are processed in parallel,  but "race" to enter the single central processor during response selection.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=A|title=Attention: theory and practice|year=2004|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are:

=== Processing speed ===
This theory suggests there is a lag in the brain's ability to recognize the color of the word since the brain reads words faster than it recognizes colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=M|title=What Is the Stroop Effec|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-stroop-effect.htm|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is based on the idea that word processing is significantly faster than color processing. In a condition where there is a conflict regarding words and colors (e.g., Stroop test), if the task is to report the color, the word information arrives at the decision-making stage before the color information which presents processing confusion.  Conversely, if the task is to report the word, because color information lags after word information, a decision can be made ahead of the conflicting information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamers|first=M.J.|title=Selective Attention And Response Set In The Stroop Task|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=2010|volume=38|issue=7|pages=893–904|doi=10.3758/mc.38.7.893|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Selective attention ===
The Selective Attention Theory suggests that color recognition, as opposed to reading a word, requires more attention. The brain needs to use more attention to recognize a color than to encode a word, so it takes a little longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=M|title=What Is the Stroop Effect|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-stroop-effect.htm|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The responses lend much to the interference noted in the Stroop task. This may be a result of either an allocation of attention to the responses or to a greater inhibition of distractors that are not appropriate responses.

=== Automaticity ===

This theory is the most common theory of the Stroop effect.&lt;ref name="McMahon"&gt;{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=M|title=What Is the Stroop Effect?|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-stroop-effect.htm|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}  It suggests that since recognizing colors is not an "automatic process" there is hesitancy to respond; whereas, the brain automatically understands the meaning of words as a result of habitual reading. This idea is based on the premise that automatic reading does not need controlled attention, but still uses enough attentional resources to reduce the amount of attention accessible for color information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monahan|first=J.S|title=Coloring single Stroop elements: Reducing automaticity or slowing color processing|journal=Journal of General Psychology|year=2001|volume=128|issue=1|pages=98–112|doi=10.1080/00221300109598901}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stirling (1979) introduced the concept of response automaticity. He demonstrated that changing the responses from colored words to letters that were not part of the colored words increased reaction time while reducing Stroop interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stirling|first=N|title=Stroop interference: An input and an output phenomenon|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1979|volume=31|pages=121–132|doi=10.1080/14640747908400712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parallel distributed processing ===
This theory suggests that as the brain analyzes information, different and specific pathways are developed for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J.D.|title=On The Control Of Automatic Processes: A Parallel Distributed Processing Account Of The Stroop Effect|journal=Psychological Review|year=1990|volume=97|issue=3|pages=332–361|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.97.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some pathways, such as reading, are stronger than others, therefore, it is the strength of the pathway and not the speed of the pathway that is important.&lt;ref name="McMahon"/&gt;  In addition, automaticity is a function of the strength of each pathway, hence, when two pathways are activated simultaneously in the Stroop effect, interference occurs between the stronger (word reading) path and the weaker (color naming) path, more specifically when the pathway that leads to the response is the weaker pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J.D.|title=On The Control Of Automatic Processes: A Parallel Distributed Processing Account Of The Stroop Effect|journal=Psychological Review|year=1990|volume=97|issue=3|pages=332–361|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.97.3.332|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive development==
In the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], several variations of the Stroop task have been used to study the relations between [[speed of processing]] and [[executive functions]] with [[working memory]] and [[cognitive development]] in various domains. This research shows that reaction time to Stroop tasks decreases systematically from early childhood through early adulthood. These changes suggest that speed of processing increases with age and that cognitive control becomes increasingly efficient. Moreover, this research strongly suggests that changes in these processes with age are very closely associated with development in working memory and various aspects of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Christou, C., Spanoudis, G., &amp; Platsidou, M. (2002). The development of mental processing: Efficiency, working memory, and thinking. ''Monographs of the Society of Research in Child Development, 67'', Serial Number 268.

The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experien¬tial structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 58'', Serial Number 234.&lt;/ref&gt;
The stroop task also shows the ability to control behavior. If asked to state the color of the ink rather than the word, the participant must overcome the initial and stronger stimuli to read the word. These inhibitions show the ability for the brain to regulate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kellogg|first1=Ronald T.|title=The making of the mind : the neuroscience of human nature|date=2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1-61614-733-4|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
The Stroop effect has been widely used in psychology. Among the most important uses is the creation of validated psychological tests based on the Stroop effect permit to measure a person's selective attention capacity and skills, as well as their processing speed ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamers|first=M.J.|title=Selective Attention And Response Set In The Stroop Task|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|year=2010|volume=38|issue=7|pages=893–904|doi=10.3758/mc.38.7.893}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also used in conjunction with other neuropsychological assessments to examine a person's executive processing abilities,&lt;ref name="McMahon"/&gt; and can help in the diagnosis and characterization of different psychiatric and neurological disorders.

Researchers also use the Stroop effect during brain imaging studies to investigate regions of the brain that are involved in planning, decision-making, and managing real-world interference (e.g., texting and driving).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=R|title=Brain Aging: Models, Methods, And Mechanisms|journal=The Journal of the American Medical Association|year=2007|volume=298|issue=23|pages=2798–2799|doi=10.1001/jama.298.23.2798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stroop effect has been used to investigate a person's psychological capacities; since its discovery during the twentieth century, it has become a popular [[neuropsychological test]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Howieson, Diane Black |author2=Lezak, Muriel Deutsch |author3=Loring, David W. |chapter=Orientation and attention|title=Neuropsychological assessment |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages=3365–367 |isbn=0-19-511121-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=2009-03-06|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FroDVkVKA2EC&amp;pg=PA365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different test variants commonly used in [[Clinical neuropsychology|clinical settings]], with differences between them in the number of subtasks, type and number of stimuli, times for the task, or scoring procedures.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-515957-8"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvE1mzbqI14C&amp;pg=PA477&amp;lpg|title=A Compendium of Neuropsychological Tests: Administration, Norms, and Commentary|first=Esther|first2=Elizabeth M.S.|first3=Otfried|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-19-515957-8|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|pages=477–499|doi=|oclc=|quote=|via=|author1=Strauss|author2=Sherman|author3=Spreen|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; All versions have at least two numbers of subtasks. In the first trial, the written color name differs from the color ink it is printed in, and the participant must say the written word. In the second trial, the participant must name the ink color instead. However, there can be up to four different subtasks, adding in some cases stimuli consisting of groups of letters "X" or dots printed in a given color with the participant having to say the color of the ink; or names of colors printed in black ink that have to be read.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt; The number of stimuli varies between fewer than twenty items to more than 150, being closely related to the scoring system used. While in some test variants the score is the number of items from a subtask read in a given time, in others it is the time that it took to complete each of the trials.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt; The number of errors and different derived punctuations are also taken into account in some versions.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt;

This test is considered to measure [[attention|selective attention]], cognitive flexibility and processing speed, and it is used as a tool in the evaluation of [[executive functions]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-515957-8"/&gt; An increased interference effect is found in disorders such as [[brain damage]], [[dementia]]s and other [[neurodegenerative disease]]s, [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]], or a variety of [[mental disorder]]s such as [[schizophrenia]], [[Substance dependence|addictions]], and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-511121-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17402825"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lansbergen MM, Kenemans JL, van Engeland H |title=Stroop interference and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a review and meta-analysis |journal=Neuropsychology |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=251–62 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17402825 |doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.2.251 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19011235"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barch DM, Braver TS, Carter CS, Poldrack RA, Robbins TW |title=CNTRICS final task selection: executive control |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=115–35 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19011235 |pmc=2643948 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn154 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warped words ===
For example, the warped words Stroop effect produces the same findings similar to the original Stroop effect. Much like the Stroop task, the printed word's color is different from the ink color of the word; however, the words are printed in such a way that it is more difficult to read (typically curved-shaped).&lt;ref name="The Stroop Effect"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stroop Effect|url=http://brainstormpsychology.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-stroop-effect.html|publisher=Brainstorm Psychology|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea here is the way the words are printed slows down both the brain's reaction and processing time, making it harder to complete the task.

=== Emotional ===

The [[emotional Stroop test|emotional Stroop]] effect serves as an information processing approach to emotions. In an emotional Stroop task, an individual is given negative emotional words like "grief," "violence," and "pain" mixed in with more neutral words like "clock," "door," and "shoe".&lt;ref name="The Stroop Effect"/&gt;  Just like in the original Stroop task, the words are colored and the individual is supposed to name the color. Research has revealed that individuals that are depressed are more likely to say the color of a negative word slower than the color of a neutral word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frings|first=C|title=Decomposing the emotional Stroop effect|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2010|volume=1|pages=42–49|doi=10.1080/17470210903156594|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While both the emotional Stroop and the classic Stroop involve the need to suppress irrelevant or distracting information, there are differences between the two. The emotional Stroop effect emphasizes the conflict between the emotional relevance to the individual and the word; whereas, the classic Stroop effect examines the conflict between the incongruent color and word.&lt;ref name="The Stroop Effect"/&gt;

=== Spatial ===
The spatial Stroop effect demonstrates interference between the stimulus location with the location information in the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wuhr 2007 285–294"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wuhr|first=P|title=A Stroop Effect For Spatial Orientation|journal=The Journal of General Psychology|year=2007|volume=134|issue=3|pages=285–294|doi=10.3200/genp.134.3.285-294}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one version of the spatial Stroop task, an up or down-pointing arrow appears randomly above or below a central point. Despite being asked to discriminate the direction of the arrow while ignoring its location, individuals typically make faster and more accurate responses to congruent stimuli (i.e., an down-pointing arrow located below the fixation sign) than to incongruent ones (i.e., a up-pointing arrow located below the fixation sign).&lt;ref name="Wuhr 2007 285–294"/&gt;   A similar effect, the [[Simon effect]], uses non-spatial stimuli.&lt;ref name="Johnson 2004"/&gt;

=== Numerical ===
The [[Numerical Stroop effect]] demonstrates the close relationship between numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values but they also have physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., &lt;big&gt;5&lt;/big&gt; vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., &lt;big&gt;3&lt;/big&gt; 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., &lt;big&gt;5&lt;/big&gt; 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar to the effect of irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henik|first1=A|last2=Tzelgov|first2=J|title=Is three greater than five: The relation between physical and semantic size in comparison tasks|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|date=1982|volume=10|pages=389–395|doi=10.3758/BF03202431|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03202431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reverse ===
Another variant of the classic Stroop effect is the reverse Stroop effect. It occurs during a pointing task. In a reverse Stroop task, individuals are shown a page with a black square with an incongruent colored word in the middle — for instance, the word "red" written in the color green — with four smaller colored squares in the corners.&lt;ref name="Durgin 2000 121–125"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durgin|first=F|title=The Reverse Stroop Effect|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|year=2000|volume=7|issue=1|pages=121–125|doi=10.3758/bf03210730}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One square would be colored green, one square would be red, and the two remaining squares would be other colors. Studies show that if the individual is asked to point to the color square of the written color (in this case, red) they would present a delay.&lt;ref name="Durgin 2000 121–125"/&gt;  Thus, incongruently-colored words significantly interfere with pointing to the appropriate square. However, some research has shown there is very little interference from incongruent color words when the objective is to match the color of the word.&lt;ref name="McMahon"/&gt;

'''Sustainability''' is the process of maintaining change in a [[Homeostasis|balanced]] fashion, in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs and aspirations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/sustainability|title=What is sustainability|website=www.globalfootprints.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many in the field, sustainability is defined through the following interconnected domains or pillars: environment, economic and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/sustainability_primer_v9.pdf|title=Sustainability Primer|last=EPA|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-domains of sustainable development have been considered also: cultural, technological and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}; {{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=Jaes A.

==Etymology==
{{See also|Sustainable development}}

The name sustainability is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sustinere'' (''tenere'', to hold; ''sub'', under). ''Sustain'' can mean "maintain", "support", or "endure".&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|sustain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Onions, Charles, T. (ed) (1964). ''The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. p. 2095.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s ''sustainability'' has been used more in the sense of human sustainability on planet Earth and this has resulted in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept ''[[sustainable development]]'', that of the [[Brundtland Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] on March 20, 1987: "sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly (1987) [http://www.un-documents.net/wced-ocf.htm ''Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future''].

While the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, [[social sustainability|social development]] and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social sustainability. More recently, using a systematic domain model that responds to the debates over the last decade, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguished four domains of economic, ecological, political and [[cultural sustainability]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

Retrieved on 2016-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Metropolis, this approach does not mean adding a fourth domain of culture to the dominant [[triple bottom line]] figure of the economy, environment and the social. Rather, it involves treating all four domains—economy, ecology, politics and culture—as social (including economics) and distinguishing between ecology (as the intersection of the human and natural worlds) and environment as that which goes far beyond what we as humans can ever know.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metropolis.org/library Metropolis Action Plan 2018-2020, at www.metropolis.org] {{Cite book | year= 2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

===Seven modalities===
Another model suggests humans attempt to achieve all of their needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Steve A. (2016). The Nature of Sustainability. Chapbook Press. Grand Rapids, Michigan. {{ISBN|9781943359394}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the global to the individual human scale, each of the seven modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.

===Shaping the future===
Integral elements of sustainability are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]]. It aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to make them sustainable. Research and innovation in Europe are financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme]&lt;/ref&gt;
Encouraging good farming practices ensures farmers fully benefit from the environment and at the same time conserving it for future generations. Additionally, instigating innovative and sustainable travel and transportation solutions must play a vital role in this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign|date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205–220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/18877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resiliency==
[[wikt:resilience|Resiliency]] in ecology is the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb disturbance and still retain its basic structure and viability. Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems in a sustainable way despite the fact that to [[policymaker]]s a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from [[geopolitical]] policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources in order to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life?&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function''. Island Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at [[juncture]]s or events where the combination of [[nature|naturally]] occurring [[Regenerative (design)|regenerative]] forces ([[solar energy]], water, soil, [[atmosphere]], vegetation, and [[biomass]]) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead''. Chelsea Green Publishing, 2013, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A practical view of sustainability is [[closed system]]s that maintain processes of [[productivity]] indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin K. Hendrix, Sustainable Backyard Polyculture: Designing for ecological resiliency. Smashwords Edition, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of [[adaptation]] as an ecosystem returns to [[wikt:viability|viability]] from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by [[dissipation|absorption]], [[utilization]], or [[wikt:rejection|deflection]] of the [[energy]] or energies that the external forces created.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Walker and David Salt, ''Resilience Thinking: Sustaining ecosystems and people in a changing world''. Island Press, 2006. p. xiii; Crawford S. Holling, Adaptive environmental assessment and management. Wiley, 1978. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In analysing systems such as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one way to look at the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human engineers to respond to immediate environmental events.&lt;ref&gt;Walker and Salt, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and concepts==

The philosophical and analytic framework of sustainability draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; in recent years an area that has come to be called [[sustainability science]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/cid/publications/faculty/wp/213.pdf Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology – an introduction to the key literatures of sustainability science] CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scale and context===
Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales (levels or frames of reference) of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. The focus ranges from the total [[carrying capacity]] (sustainability) of planet Earth to the sustainability of economic sectors, ecosystems, countries, municipalities, neighbourhoods, home gardens, individual lives, individual goods and services{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}, occupations, lifestyles, behaviour patterns and so on. In short, it can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Conceptual Framework Working Group of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. (2003). "Ecosystems and Human Well-being." London: [[Island Press]]. Chapter 5. "Dealing with Scale". pp. 107–124. {{ISBN|9781559634038}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Daniel Botkin, author and environmentalist, has stated: "We see a landscape that is always in flux, changing over many scales of time and space."&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, D.B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies, a New Ecology for the 21st century''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507469-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer size and complexity of the planetary ecosystem has proved problematic for the design of practical measures to reach global sustainability. To shed light on the big picture, explorer and sustainability campaigner [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] has drawn parallels to other, more tangible [[closed systems]]. For example, he likens human existence on Earth&amp;nbsp;— isolated as the planet is in space, whereby people cannot be evacuated to relieve population pressure and resources cannot be imported to prevent accelerated [[depletion of resources]]&amp;nbsp;— to life at sea on a small boat isolated by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lecture by [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]] to the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in London|title=Sustainability Lessons From Life On A Small Boat|url=http://www.jasonexplorer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rgs_sustainability_end_piece_broadband.mov|date=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, he argues, exercising the [[precautionary principle]] is a key factor in survival.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jason "[http://www.billyfishbooks.com/Books.html The Seed Buried Deep (The Expedition Trilogy, part 2)]" BillyFish Books, December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption===
A major driver of human impact on Earth systems is the destruction of [[biophysical]] [[resources]], and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact of a community or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2006). ''A Rough Guide to Ethical Living''. London: Penguin. {{ISBN|978-1-84353-792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brower&gt;Brower, M. &amp; Leon, W. (1999). ''The Consumer's Guide to Effective Environmental Choices: Practical Advice from the Union of Concerned Scientists''. New York: Three Rivers Press. {{ISBN|0-609-80281-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial attempts to express human impact mathematically was developed in the 1970s and is called the [[I PAT]] formula. This formulation attempts to explain human consumption in terms of three components: [[population]] numbers, levels of consumption (which it terms "affluence", although the usage is different), and impact per unit of resource use (which is termed "technology", because this impact depends on the [[technology]] used). The equation is expressed:

:::::::: I = P × A × T

::: Where: I = Environmental impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology&lt;ref name=Ehrlich&amp;Holden&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Ehrlich | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Holden | first2 = J.P. | year = 1974 | title = Human Population and the global environment | url = |magazine= American Scientist | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 282–292 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circularity ==
In recent years, concepts based on (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts might be the [[Circular Economy]], with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geissdoerfer|first=Martin|last2=Savaget|first2=Paulo|last3=Bocken|first3=Nancy M.

In contrast, the population of the more [[Developed country|developed regions]] is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2009).

The [[Ecological footprint]] measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 [[global hectare]]s per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms).&lt;ref name="LPR"/&gt; The resulting [[ecological deficit]] must be met from unsustainable ''extra'' sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. [[fossil fuels]]); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by [[Overexploitation|over exploiting]] [[Forests#Forest management and forest loss|forests]] and [[fisheries management|fisheries]]).

The figure (right) examines sustainability at the scale of individual countries by contrasting their Ecological Footprint with their UN [[Human Development Index]] (a measure of standard of living). The graph shows what is necessary for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. The general trend is for higher standards of living to become less sustainable. As always, [[population growth]] has a marked influence on levels of consumption and the efficiency of resource use.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich&amp;Holden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability goal is to raise the global standard of living without increasing the use of resources beyond globally sustainable levels; that is, to not exceed "one planet" consumption.

[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and a [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0674257801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|303}} Leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Daly's concession|propounded the same argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Daly |first=Herman E., ed. |authorlink=Herman Daly |edition=2nd |date=1980 |title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics.

At the enterprise scale, carrying capacity now also plays a critical role in making it possible to measure and report the sustainability performance of individual organizations.  This is most clearly demonstrated through use of [[Context-Based Sustainability]] (CBS) tools, methods and metrics, including the MultiCapital Scorecard, which have been in development since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|title=Social Footprints|date=2008|publisher=University of Groningen|isbn=978-0-615-24274-3|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/13147558/00-titlecon.pdf|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Martin|last2=McElroy|first2=Mark|title=The MultiCapital Scorecard|date=2016|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=9781603586900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to many other mainstream approaches to measuring the sustainability performance of organizations – which tend to be more incrementalist in form – CBS is explicitly tied to social, environmental and economic limits and thresholds in the world.  Thus, rather than simply measure and report changes in relative terms from one period to another, CBS makes it possible to compare the impacts of organizations to organization-specific norms, standards or thresholds for what they (the impacts) would have to be in order to be empirically sustainable (i.e., which if generalized to a larger population would not fail to maintain the sufficiency of vital resources for human or non-human well-being).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=Jorna|first2=Rene|last3=van Engelen|first3=Jo|title=Sustaiability Quotients and the Social Footprint|journal=Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management|date=2007|volume=15|issue=4|pages=223–234|doi=10.1002/csr.164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Mark|last2=van Engelen|first2=Jo|title=Corporate Sustainability Management|date=2012|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=978-1-84407-911-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Millennium Ecosystem Assessment'' is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes the state of the Earth's [[ecosystem]]s and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of world [[ecosystems]], reducing both their [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[biocapacity]]. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's "life-support system", providing essential "[[ecosystem services]]". The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services concluding that only four have shown improvement over the last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 6–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainable development===
According to the data that member countries represented to the [[United Nations]], [[Cuba]] was the only country in the world in 2006 that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]], with an [[ecological footprint]] of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5, and a [[Human Development Index]] of over 0.8, 0.855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fanelli, Daniele (3 October 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development].

==Environmental dimension==
Healthy ecosystems provide vital goods and services to humans and other organisms. There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing [[ecosystem services]] and the first of these is [[environmental management]]. This direct approach is based largely on information gained from [[earth science]], [[environmental science]] and [[conservation biology]].
However, this is management at the end of a long series of indirect causal factors that are initiated by human [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], so a second approach is through demand management of human resource use.

Management of human consumption of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from [[economics]]. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources should provide a [[sustainable yield]] (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Daly | first1 = H.E. | year = 1990 | title = Toward some operational principles of sustainable development | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 1–6 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(90)90010-r| bibcode = 2005ecec.book.....C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental management===

At the global scale and in the broadest sense environmental management involves the [[ocean]]s, [[freshwater]] systems, land and [[atmosphere]], but following the sustainability principle of scale it can be equally applied to any ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a home garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems&amp;file=users/|title=The Economics and Social Benefits of NOAA Ecosystems Data and Products Table of Contents Data Users|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2009-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325190416/http://www.economics.noaa.gov/?goal=ecosystems|archivedate=25 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchenrieder, G., und A.R.

At a March 2009 meeting of the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]], 2,500 climate experts from 80 countries issued a keynote statement that there is now "no excuse" for failing to act on global warming and that without strong carbon reduction "abrupt or irreversible" shifts in climate may occur that "will be very difficult for contemporary societies to cope with".&lt;ref&gt;University of Copenhagen (March 2009) [http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ "Key Messages from the Congress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316181631/http://climatecongress.ku.dk/newsroom/congress_key_messages/ |date=16 March 2009 }} News item on Copenhagen Climate Congress in March 2009.

Retrieved on: 2009-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the global atmosphere now involves assessment of all aspects of the [[carbon cycle]] to identify opportunities to address human-induced [[climate change]] and this has become a major focus of scientific research because of the potential catastrophic effects on biodiversity and human communities (see [[Energy]] below).

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur dioxide|sulfur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] particulates such as sulfate [[aerosol]]s in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]], the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. ''et al''. (2007).

====Freshwater and oceans====
[[File:Bleached coral.jpg|thumb|Changes in environmental conditions lead to [[coral bleaching]] and harm to biodiversity of fragile marine ecosystems. ]]
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however there is still a limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing [[urbanization]] pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y.

[[Ocean]] circulation patterns have a strong influence on [[climate]] and [[weather]] and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, under the influence of climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of [[ocean current]]s that could drastically alter the climate in some regions of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kerr, R.A. |title=Global change.

====Land use====
[[File:Rice Field.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A farmer working in a rice paddy.|A rice paddy in Bangladesh. Rice, wheat, corn and potatoes make up more than half the world's food supply.]]

Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 560–582.&lt;/ref&gt; At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]] and [[green cities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelis, L. &amp; Lorek, S. (2004).

Environmental Project No. 904.&lt;/ref&gt; This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption of goods and services can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, T. &amp; Michaelis, L.

The UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), [[resource intensity]], and [[resource productivity]] are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are [[food]], [[energy]], materials and water.

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), published the first global scientific assessment on the impacts of consumption and production&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx ''Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production: Priority Products and Materials''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160513215416/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/tabid/54044/Default.aspx |date=13 May 2016 }} 2010, [[International Resource Panel]], [[United Nations Environment Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; and identified priority actions for developed and developing countries. The study found that the most critical impacts are related to [[ecosystem]] health, human health and [[resource depletion]]. From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and [[fisheries]] have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, [[food]] and energy-using products cause the majority of [[life cycle assessment|life-cycle]] impacts of consumption.

The Sun's energy, stored by plants ([[primary producer]]s) during [[photosynthesis]], passes through the [[food chain]] to other organisms to ultimately power all living processes. Since the [[industrial revolution]] the concentrated energy of the [[Sun]] stored in fossilized plants as [[fossil fuel]]s has been a major driver of [[technology]] which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels at 450–650&amp;nbsp;ppm from current levels of about 380&amp;nbsp;ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2&amp;nbsp;°C to produce "catastrophic" [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2007).[http://www.ipcc.ch/ "''Climate Change 2007: the Physical Science Basis.

[[Water security]] and [[food security]] are inextricably linked. In the decade 1951–60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade. This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the [[economy]]—especially the increase in irrigated land, growth in industrial and power sectors, and intensive [[dam]] construction on all continents. This altered the water cycle of [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, affected their [[water quality]] and had a significant impact on the global water cycle.&lt;ref name="Shik" /&gt; Currently towards 35% of human water use is unsustainable, drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers: this percentage is likely to increase if [[climate change]] impacts become more severe, [[population]]s increase, aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled—agricultural use increased by 75%, industrial use by more than 200%, and domestic use more than 400%.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s it was estimated that humans were using 40–50% of the globally available freshwater in the approximate proportion of 70% for agriculture, 22% for [[industry]], and 8% for domestic purposes with total use progressively increasing.&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;Shiklamov, I.

A recent UNEP report proposes a [[green economy]] defined as one that "improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities": it "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of [[natural capital]]". The report makes three key findings: "that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces a higher rate of GDP growth"; that there is "an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor"; "in the transition to a green economy, new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in "brown economy" jobs.

Historically there has been a close correlation between [[economic growth]] and [[environmental degradation]]: as communities grow, so the environment declines. This trend is clearly demonstrated on graphs of human population numbers, economic growth, and environmental indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Adams &amp; Jeanrenaud (2008) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsustainable economic growth has been starkly compared to the malignant growth of a cancer&lt;ref&gt;Abbey, E.

In [[economic]] and [[Environmental policy|environmental]] fields, the term [[Eco-economic decoupling|decoupling]] is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to [[environmental quality]].&lt;ref name=Costanza/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, C.J. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Biophysical_economics "Biophysical economics"], ''[[Encyclopedia of Earth]]'', Last updated: 14 September 2006. Retrieved on: 2009-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/ Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts of economic growth]. International Resource Panel report, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce [[resource intensity]] (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, H. (1996). ''Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4709-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting views whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit [[GDP]]) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U. (1998). ''Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Weizsacker, E.U., C. Hargroves, M.H. Smith, C. Desha, and P. Stasinopoulos (2009). ''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'', Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]] resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleveland | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Ruth | first2 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 15–50 | doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., [[second law of thermodynamics]]) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011).[http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a [[steady state economy]] in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by [[Herman Daly]] and others in the [[ecological economics]] community.

A different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.&lt;ref name="restore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the "conundrum"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1|url=https://peerj.com/preprints/46/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach views "restore" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.&lt;ref name="restore"/&gt;

{{Further|Ecosystem services}}
The economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression [[ecosystem services]] to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.&lt;ref name = Tragedy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G. | year = 1968 | title = The Tragedy of the Commons | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/162/3859/1243 | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3859| pages = 1243–1248 | doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 | pmid=5699198| bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, as a [[commodity]] or service becomes more scarce the [[price]] increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nemetz | first1 = P.N. | year = 2003 | title = Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students | url = | journal = Journal of International Business Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic [[externalities]] they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]].&lt;ref name = Tragedy/&gt;

One approach to this dilemma has been the attempt to "internalize" these "externalities" by using market strategies like [[ecotaxes]] and incentives, tradeable permits for carbon, and the encouragement of [[payment for ecosystem services]].

=== Ecosocialist approach ===
{{Further|Eco-socialism|Marxism}}
One school of thought, often labeled [[Eco-socialism|ecosocialism]] or ecological Marxism, asserts that the [[Capitalism|capitalist economic system]] is fundamentally incompatible with the ecological and social requirements of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory rests on the premises that:
# Capitalism's sole economic purpose is "unlimited [[capital accumulation]]" in the hands of the [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The urge to accumulate (the [[profit motive]]) drives capitalists to continually reinvest and expand production, creating indefinite and unsustainable economic growth&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 38, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Capital tends to degrade the conditions of its own production" (the ecosystems and resources on which any economy depends)&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, according to this analysis:

# Giving economic priority to the fulfillment of [[Human rights|human needs]] while staying within ecological limits, as [[sustainable development]] demands, is in conflict with the structural workings of capitalism&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A steady-state capitalist economy is impossible;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; further, a steady-state capitalist economy is socially undesirable due to the inevitable outcome of massive [[Unemployment|unemployment and underemployment]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 42, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Capitalism will, unless overcome by [[revolution]], run up against the physical limits of the biosphere and [[Societal collapse|self-destruct]]&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 27, 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this logic, market-based solutions to ecological crises ([[ecological economics]], [[environmental economics]], [[green economy]]) are rejected as technical tweaks that do not confront capitalism's structural failures.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 173–87.&lt;/ref&gt; "Low-risk" technology/science-based solutions such as [[solar power]], [[sustainable agriculture]], and increases in [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] are seen as necessary but insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; "High-risk" technological solutions such as [[nuclear power]] and [[climate engineering]] are entirely rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 111–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts made by businesses to "[[Greenwashing|greenwash]]" their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as [[Walmart]]'s proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has [[Jevons paradox|the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption]], viz. further economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 102–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sustainable business]] models and the [[triple bottom line]] are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the [[distribution of wealth]] to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable.&lt;ref name="Kovel 2007, p. 38"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders [[Environmental law|environmental reforms]] incapable of facilitating large-scale change: "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; They also note that, up until the event of total [[ecological collapse]], destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, pp. 285–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosocialists advocate for the [[revolution]]ary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill [[Human rights|human needs]]—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Kovel 2007, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in [[Nature]]: "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is going to survive this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, in order to create a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet."&lt;ref&gt;Magdoff &amp; Foster 2011, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such acknowledgment has been made by the [[Brundtland Report|Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=UN Documents Gathering a body of global agreements}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Millennium Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2009|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, "poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lusigi|first=Angela|title=Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf|publisher=UNDP-UNEP Poverty&amp;nbsp;— Environment Initiative|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are fewer children a route to prosperity?|url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|website=FACT SHEET: Population Growth and Poverty|publisher=United Nations Population Fund|accessdate=2011-04-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221140406/http://www.unfpa.org/public/home/factsheets/pid/3856|archivedate=21 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching [[water treatment]] to the poor by boiling their water with [[charcoal]], would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [[solar water disinfection]] would be. Also, sustainable [[best practices]] can involve the [[recycling]] of materials, such as the use of [[plastics recycling|recycled]] [[plastics]] for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as [[Bridges to Prosperity]]'s use of wire rope from shipping container [[gantry cranes]] to act as the structural wire rope for [[footbridges]] that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.

===Human relationship to nature===
According to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[Market (economics)|market]] relationships, if unchecked, have the capacity to reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: "The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital."&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2004). ''Post Scarcity Anarchism''. Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-06-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Bookchin, M. (2007). ''Social Ecology and Communalism''. Oakland: AK Press, p.&amp;nbsp;19. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-49-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pure capitalist approach has also been criticized in [[Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]] to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] the [[effects of global warming]] in this excerpt:

In regards of the United States of America, The Government and the Economy has had a long lasting impact on the environment, but in a problematic way. Policy issues regarding the environment has shown that the country regards the protection of the environment as a "second hand issue." One causation from this is a certain dilemma called "collective action problem" or collective action dilemmas." These occur when individuals, firms, or governments would be better off if they cooperated in the pursuit of a common goal, but, for one reason or another, one or more of those involved choose a less optimal course of action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Policy New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|last=Vig, Norman J.|first=Kraft, Michael E.|publisher=CQPress|year=2018|isbn=|location=2455 Teller Road Thousand Oaks, California|pages=269–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Potoski and Aseem Prakash have made a model establishing 4 cells that are explaining each benefit for the government or the economic process. For the government, one cost might be the loss of public confidence and trust, while a firm might lose market share and profitability &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Deep ecology]] is a movement founded by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] that establishes principles for the well-being of all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the ''[[quality of life]]'' rather than the ''[[standard of living]]''. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen.&lt;ref&gt;Devall, W. and G. Sessions (1985). ''Deep Ecology: Living as If Nature Mattered''. Layton, Utah: Gibbs Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;70. {{ISBN|978-0-87905-247-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a billion-year [[Sustainocene]] has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and fuel the needs of that species (for example through [[artificial photosynthesis]]) allowing [[Rights of Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Faunce, T |title=Towards a Global Solar Fuels Project-Artificial Photosynthesis and the Transition from Anthropocene to Sustainocene |journal=Procedia Engineering |volume=49 |pages=348–356 |doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2012.10.147 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255698345|year=2012 |bibcode=2017ProEn.204...69B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach to [[sustainable living]], exemplified by small-scale urban [[Transition Towns|transition towns]] and rural [[ecovillages]], seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of [[simple living]], which maximize [[self-sufficiency]] particularly in food production. These principles, on a broader scale, underpin the concept of a [[bioregionalism|bioregional]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vtcommons.org/journal/2006/02/kirkpatrick-sale-economics-scale-vs-scale-economics-towards-basic-principles-bioregi|title=Economics of Scale vs. the Scale of Economics&amp;nbsp;— Towards Basic Principles of a Bioregional Economy|last=Sale|first=Kirkpatrick|date=24 February 2006|publisher=Vermont Commons|accessdate=2009-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028195909/http://www.vtcommons.org/journal/2006/02/kirkpatrick-sale-economics-scale-vs-scale-economics-towards-basic-principles-bioregi|archivedate=28 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of [[open source appropriate technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = J.M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other approaches, loosely based around [[New Urbanism]], are successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve [[sustainable cities]] which support [[sustainable transport]] and [[Zero carbon housing|zero emission housing]]. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures, compared with those living in [[urban sprawl|sprawling]] suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing, R [http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html "Growing Cooler – the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |date=24 December 2010 }}. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Compact urban neighbourhoods would also promote a great people climate, where by increasing the accessibility to bike, walk or take public transport within neighbourhoods would increase the amount of interaction between people. With more diversification between people, this increases people's happiness and leads to a better standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Urban Crisis: How Our Cities Are Increasing Inequality, Deepening Segregation, and Failing the Middle Class and What We Can Do about it|last=Florida|first=Richard|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sustainable architecture]] the recent movement of [[New Classical Architecture]] promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism].

The concept of [[Circular flow land use management]] has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.

Large scale [[social movements]] can influence both community choices and the built environment. [[Eco-municipality|Eco-municipalities]] may be one such movement.&lt;ref&gt;LaColla, T.

In Sweden, more than 70 cities and towns—25 per cent of all municipalities in the country—have adopted a common set of [[The Natural Step#System conditions of sustainability|"Sustainability Principles"]] and implemented these systematically throughout their municipal operations. There are now twelve eco-municipalities in the United States and the [[American Planning Association]] has adopted sustainability objectives based on the same principles.&lt;ref name = James&gt;James, S.

Application of [[social sustainability]] requires stakeholders to look at human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/545/social-sustainability|title=Social Sustainability – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues should be considered in production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social sustainability, and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social sustainability of products and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/546/social-sustainability-initiatives-guidelines-standards|title=Social Sustainability Initiatives, Guidelines, and Standards   – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Equator Principles]] (financial industry), [[Fair Wear Foundation]] (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as [[Green Seal]] for cleaning products, [[NSF International|NSF]]-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of [[Organic food]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sftool.gov/plan/542/resources-verifying-sustainable-products|title=Resources for Verifying Sustainable Products   – GSA Sustainable Facilities Tool|website=sftool.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural dimension==
{{Further|Cultural sustainability}}
{{See also|Agenda 21 for culture|United Cities and Local Governments}}

The cultural dimension of sustainability is known as '''[[cultural sustainability]]'''. Important in the advancement of this notion have been the [[United Nations]], [[Unesco]], and in particular their [[Agenda 21]] and [[Agenda 21 for culture]] (now also known as [[Culture 21]]), a program for [[cultural governance]] developed in 2002–2004 and coordinated by [[United Cities and Local Governments|United Cities and Local Governments UCLG]], created in 2004.

===Tourism===

Sustainability is central to underpinning feelings of authenticity in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryce|first=Derek|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|last4=Taheri|first4=Babak|date=2015-02-01|title=Visitors' engagement and authenticity: Japanese heritage consumption|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261517714001642|journal=Tourism Management|volume=46|pages=571–581|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2014.08.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences can be enhanced when substituting the contrived for the genuine, and at the same time inspire a potentially deleterious appetite for follow-up visits to the real thing: objectively authentic sites untouched by repair or rejuvenation. Feelings of authenticity at a tourist site are thus implicitly linked to sustainable tourism; as the maximisation of existential "felt" authenticity at sites of limited historical provenance increases the likelihood of return visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Farrington|first2=Thomas|last3=Curran|first3=Ross|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2017-04-11|title=Sustainability and the authentic experience.

Other human impacts on the atmosphere include the [[air pollution]] in cities, the [[pollutants]] including toxic chemicals like [[nitrogen oxides]], [[Sulfur oxide|sulphur oxides]], [[volatile organic compounds]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]] that produce [[photochemical smog]] and [[acid rain]], and the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s that degrade the [[ozone layer]]. [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosols]] in the atmosphere reduce the direct [[irradiance]] and reflectance ([[albedo]]) of the [[Earth]]'s surface. Known as [[global dimming]] the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global [[water cycle]] by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a [[Thermal energy|cooling]] effect and this may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gases]] on [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;Hegerl, G.C. et al. (2007).

==Freshwater==
{{See|Water crisis}}

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is the salty water of the [[ocean]]s and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The remaining freshwater is found in lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. All life depends on the solar-powered global water cycle, the evaporation from oceans and land to form water vapour that later condenses from clouds as rain, which then becomes the renewable part of the freshwater supply.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;Clarke &amp; King (2006) pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Awareness of the global importance of preserving [[water]] for [[ecosystem services]] has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world’s [[wetlands]] have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. [[Biodiversity]]-rich [[freshwater]] ecosystems are currently declining faster than [[marine (ocean)|marine]] or land [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref name="water"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y. (2006).

Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (soil water available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.&lt;ref name="water" /&gt;

==Land==
{{See|Land use}}
Loss of biodiversity stems largely from the habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as [[natural capital]] is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of the [[biosphere]] because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to [[urbanisation]], [[agriculture]], [[forest]], [[woodland]], [[grassland]] and [[pasture]] have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems.&lt;ref name="Krebs 2001 pp. 560–582"/&gt; At the local human scale major sustainability benefits accrue from the pursuit of [[green cities]] and [[sustainable gardening|sustainable parks and gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6220 Organic Gardening Techniques], ''Missouri University Extension''.

==Forests==
{{See|Forestry|Ecoforestry}}
[[File:Grib skov.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark|Beech forest – Grib Skov, Denmark]]

Since the [[Neolithic Revolution]], human use has reduced the world’s forest cover by about 47%. Present-day forests occupy about a quarter of the world’s ice-free land with about half of these occurring in the tropics&lt;ref&gt;World Resources Institute (1998). ''World Resources 1998–1999.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-521408-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In temperate and [[boreal forest|boreal]] regions forest area is gradually increasing (with the exception of Siberia), but [[deforestation]] in the tropics is of major concern.&lt;ref&gt;Groombridge &amp; Jenkins (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Forests moderate the local climate and the global water cycle through their light reflectance ([[albedo]]) and [[evapotranspiration]]. They also conserve [[biodiversity]], protect [[water quality]], preserve soil and [[soil quality]], provide fuel and [[pharmaceuticals]], and purify the air. These free [[ecosystem services]] are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal when compared with the economic benefits of [[logging]] and clearance which, through [[soil degradation]] and organic [[decomposition]] returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name = FAO1&gt;Food and Agriculture Organisation (2006).

Retrieved on: 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions).&lt;ref name = FAO1/&gt; [[Climate change]] can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in [[reafforestation]] schemes, plantations and timber products. Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable [[carbon-neutral]] fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2006).'' IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Inventories, Vol.4, Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Uses.'' Japan: Institute for Global Environment Strategies.&lt;/ref&gt; However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the [[International Union of Forest Research Organizations]] in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

''Nature'' '''429''': 870–873.&lt;/ref&gt; Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness – everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s to the resource costs of food packaging, [[transport]] (now a major part of global trade) and retail.

Although [[biodiversity loss]] can be monitored simply as loss of species, effective conservation demands the protection of species within their natural habitats and ecosystems. Following human migration and population growth, species [[extinctions]] have progressively increased to a rate unprecedented since the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. Known as the [[Holocene extinction event]] this current human-induced extinction of species ranks as one of the worlds six mass [[extinction event]]s. Some scientific estimates indicate that up to half of presently existing species may become extinct by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leakey &amp; Lewin (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Current extinction rates are 100 to 1000 times their prehuman levels with more than 10% birds and mammals threatened, about 8% of plants, 5% of fish and more than 20% of freshwater species.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, pp. 42–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[IUCN Red List]] warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather put additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird species as threatened with extinction, which is one-in-eight of all bird species.&lt;ref&gt;Kinver, M.

In many parts of the industrial world land clearing for agriculture has diminished and here the greatest threat to biodiversity, after [[climate change]], has become the destructive effect of [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly efficient global transport has facilitated the spread of [[organism]]s across the planet. The potential danger of this aspect of [[globalization]] is starkly illustrated through the spread of human diseases like [[HIV]] [[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]], [[Avian influenza|bird flu]] and [[swine flu]], but invasive plants and animals are also having a devastating impact on native [[biodiversity]]. Non-indigenous organisms can quickly occupy disturbed land and natural areas where, in the absence of their natural [[predator]]s, they are able to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs (2001) pp. 190–205.&lt;/ref&gt; At the global scale this issue is being addressed through the [[Global Invasive Species Information Network]] but there is improved international [[biosecurity]] legislation to minimise the transmission of pathogens and invasive organisms. Also, through [[CITES]] legislation there is control the trade in rare and threatened species. Increasingly at the local level public awareness programs are alerting communities, gardeners, the nursery industry, collectors, and the pet and aquarium industries, to the harmful effects of potentially invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Blood (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance to change==
{{Main|Sustainability and systemic change resistance}}
The environmental sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
