'''Alexandre Galopin''' (26 September 1879 – 28 February 1944) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[businessman]]. He was director of the ''[[Société Générale de Belgique]]'', a large Belgian company founded in 1822 by [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], and [[chairman of the board]] of the armaments company ''[[FN Herstal|Fabrique Nationale d'Armes de Guerre]]''. Galopin was behind the Galopin Doctrine, a "lesser evil" (''moindre-mal'') tactic that allowed industrial development in the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|occupied Belgium]] during [[World War II]], under the auspices of the [[Belgian government in exile]]. In February 1944, he was murdered by Flemish collaborators from the [[DeVlag]] group.

==Early career==
Born to a university professor in Ghent on 28 September 1879, Galopin became in 1913 managing director of [[FN Herstal]].{{sfn|Biographie Belge d'Outremer}} He championed its development into an important manufacturer of motor vehicles in Belgium. In 1935 he became governor of the ''[[Société Générale de Belgique]]'' (SGB), a giant [[holding company]] with close ties to the Belgian government which dominated the economy of Belgium and [[Belgian colonial empire|its empire]] and controlled almost 40 percent of the country's industrial production.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=33}}

==World War II==
On 10 May 1940, Belgium was invaded by Nazi Germany. At the start of the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation]], Galopin was made chairman of a committee, dubbed the "Galopin Committee", which brought together the leaders of Belgian holding companies, banks and industry. The committee had been set up by the [[Belgian government in exile|Belgian government]], shortly before it left the country, on 15 May 1940.{{sfn|Mommen|2002|pp=61-2}}{{sfn|Grosbois|2007|pp=245-67}}{{sfn|Nefors|2006|p=137}} It served as a sort of a [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] that decided economic and social policy and was able to set rules for dealing with the Nazi German occupiers. [[Albert-Edouard Janssen]] and [[Léon Bekaert]] were among its members.{{sfn|Mommen|2002|pp=61-2}} Because of his power and influence within the Belgian wartime economy, he was nicknamed "the Uncrowned King of Belgium" by German occupation officials.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=268}}

===Galopin Doctrine===
Part of the goal of the Galopin Committee was to keep Belgian industry strong during the war so as to not leave the economy crippled once the war ended. Galopin pioneered a controversial policy, known as the "Galopin Doctrine". According to the doctrine, Belgian companies should continue producing goods for the Belgian civilian population (food, consumer goods etc.) under German occupation but should refuse to produce [[Materiel|war materiel]] or goods for the German war effort.{{sfn|Société Générale|1972|p=147}} The policy, dubbed the "politics of production", hoped to prevent a repeat of [[World War I]], when the Allies had encouraged Belgian workers to passively resist the Germans by refusing to work.{{sfn|Société Générale|1972|p=146}} The Germans instead deported Belgian workers and industrial machinery to German factories, benefitting their economy more.{{sfn|Société Générale|1972|p=146}} The policy also hoped to avoid an industrial decline which would have negative effects on the country's recovery after the war; however, many viewed the policy as collaboration.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=35}} Between 1941 and 1942, the German authorities began to force Belgian businessmen to make an explicit choice between obeying the Doctrine (and refusing to produce war materials, at risk of death) and circumventing the doctrine as collaborators.{{sfn|Van den Wijngaert|Dujardin|2006|p=36}} The cooperative approach did, however, prevent German companies from expanding their control over the Belgian economy.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=268-9}}

Galopin's policy was similar to the "cooperation" doctrine created in the occupied Netherlands by [[Max Hirschfeld]].{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=269}}

===Assassination===
Galopin was assassinated in 1944 by members of [[Devlag]], a pro-Nazi Flemish paramilitary group, under the direct orders of [[Robert Jan Verbelen]].{{sfn|Gildea|Wieviorka|Warring|2006|p=45}} Galopin's name has been given to a street: avenue Alexandre Galopin in [[Etterbeek]], [[Brussels]].

[[File:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|thumb|right|Anguilla.]]

'''Anguillan bankruptcy law''' regulates the position of individuals and companies who are unable to meet their financial obligations.

Bankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as "[[personal bankruptcy]]" in [[Anguilla]], whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as "[[corporate insolvency]]".  The legislation largely deals with both separately, although there are some common provisions.

==Personal bankruptcy==

Personal bankruptcy is regulated under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15).  Under that statute, a person commits an [[act of bankruptcy]] if he or she:&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
# makes a conveyance or [[assignment (law)|assignment]] of his property to a [[trustee]] or trustees for the benefit of his creditors generally;
# makes a [[fraudulent conveyance]], gift, delivery, or transfer of his property, or any part thereof;
# makes any conveyance or transfer of his property, or any part thereof, or creates any charge thereon, which would under this or any other Act be void as a [[fraudulent preference]] if he were adjudged bankrupt;
# with intent to defeat or delay his creditors he departs out of Anguilla, or being out of Anguilla remains out of Anguilla, or departs from his dwelling house, or otherwise absents himself, or begins to keep house;
# execution having issued against him, has been levied by seizure and sale of his goods under process in an action in any court, or in any civil proceeding;
# if any judgment debt has been ordered by the Court to be levied upon any lands&lt;ref&gt;Other than a plantation in which there are 40 acres under cultivation&lt;/ref&gt; or any mortgage, encumbrance or interest in or upon such land;
# files in the Court a declaration of his inability to pay his debts, or presents a bankruptcy petition against himself or herself;
# if a creditor has obtained a final judgment against him for any amount, and execution thereon not having been stayed, and he does not, within the time provided, either comply with the requirements of the notice, or satisfy the Court that he has a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt;
# if the debtor gives notice to any of his creditors that he has suspended, or that he is about to suspend, payment of his debts; or
# if the debtor has in fact suspended payment of his debts and given notice to any of his creditors that he is insolvent.

If any of those conditions are made out, then the court may make a "receiving order" (which is the name for what is ordinarily called a bankruptcy order in Anguilla).&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the making of a receiving order a receiver is constituted "receiver" of the property of the debtor, and thereafter no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the debtor in respect of the debt or shall commence any action or other legal proceedings unless with the leave of the Court, and on such terms as the Court may impose.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 9(1).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter a meeting of creditors is convened,&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and they may by resolution of 75% of creditors in value seek to implement an arrangement or compromise in relation to the debts of the bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, section 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the meeting is not successful in implementing a scheme, then the court will appoint a [[trustee in bankruptcy]] who will divide the property of the bankrupt between his creditors in the discharge of their claims.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Act, sections 19 and 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate insovlency==

Anguillan corporate insolvency law is presently highly fragmented, with various different parts of appearing in either the Bankruptcy Act (Cap B.15) or the Companies Act (Cap C.65).  However, the matrix of laws is nonetheless fragmentary and incomplete.  At present there are no provisions under Anguillan law in relation to corporate insolvency which address insolvency set-off, or the avoidance of dispositions after the commencement of winding-up.  There are also no powers conferred upon the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] specifically relating to challenging transactions entered into the "twilight" period which prejudice the general body of creditors, but there is limited scope to seek redress for such transactions outside of the insolvency regime under the Fraudulent Dispositions Act (Cap F.60).

However, the legislature is currently considering a comprehensive new Insolvency Act which will both close all of the relevant gaps in the law, and consolidate all related laws relating to both corporate insolvency and personal bankruptcy into a single statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harneys.com/publications/legal-updates/anguilla-publishes-draft-bill-for-new-insolvency-legislation|title=Anguilla publishes draft bill for new insolvency legislation|publisher=[[Harney Westwood &amp; Riegels]]|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a liquidator over a company is appointed (either voluntarily or by the court), the liquidator's primary duty is to collect in all of the company's assets and then distribute them ''[[pari passu]]'' to the company's creditors.  The law confers wide powers upon the liquidator to enable him to do so.  Once a liquidator is appointed, [[unsecured creditor]]s cannot commence legal proceedings against the insolvent company without the leave of the court, and any rights of action against the company are converted into claims in the liquidation process.  Any disposition of property by the company after the commencement of winding-up is void unless the court otherwise orders.

[[Secured creditor]]s generally do not participate in the liquidation process, and may continue to proceed with any enforcement action directly against their collateral pursuant to a valid [[security interest]].

Anguillan law provides for statutory [[netting]] relating to financial contracts under the Netting Act (Cap N.03), and this will prevail over any other off provisions arising by law.&lt;ref&gt;Netting Act, section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bashir Ahmad''' (12 February 1940 – 6 February 2009) was a successful businessman and a [[Scottish National Party]] politician. He made history when he was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] to represent the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow region]] at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 election]], as the first [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] to be elected from [[Asian-Scots]], [[Mohammedan|Muslim]] and non-White backgrounds.&lt;ref name="BBC News death"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7876038.stm |title=Scotland's first Muslim MSP dies |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ahmad was born in [[Amritsar]], [[British India]] on 12 February 1940. In 1961, at the age of 21, he emigrated to Scotland from Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Scotsman interview July 2007"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/keeping-the-faith-1-907247 |title=Keeping the Faith |first=Jim |last=Gilchrist |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=2 July 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served five terms as President of the Pakistan Welfare Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5133456.stm|title=Scotland set for first Asian MSP |work=BBC News |date=30 June 2006 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

[[Image:Scottish Parliament flags half-staff.jpg|thumb|Flags outside of the Scottish Parliament flying at half-mast following the death of Bashir Ahmad MSP]]

Ahmnad joined the SNP in 1992. In 1995, he founded [[Asian Scots for Independence]] to attract more [[Asian-Scots]] to the party. When Bashir launched Scots Asians for Independence at the SNP conference in 1995, he gave a speech saying "it isn't important where you come from, what matters is where we are going together as a nation"&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davison |first=Phil |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/bashir-ahmad-1-828488 |title=Bashir Ahmad |work=The Scotsman |date= 10 February 2009|accessdate=6 June 2018 |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from business in 2003 to devote himself to [[Politics of Scotland|politics]]. In [[Glasgow City Council election, 2003]], he defeated Labour to become the Councillor for the Pollokshields East ward.

Upon his selection as second on the SNP's Glasgow list, Ahmad said: "The lack of any Asian or ethnic minority voice in the Scottish Parliament has been felt deeply in my community. But SNP members have righted that wrong. By doing so, they have proved that the SNP aspires to lead a Scottish Parliament that will represent all of Scotland – a truly national parliament. I firmly believe the SNP can now earn the trust of the Asian community throughout Scotland and that this will be a bond that endures for generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12772876.Society__The_race_for_Holyrood/ |title=Society: The race for Holyrood |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=26 March 2007|accessdate=6 June 2018 |location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 elections]], Ahmad was elected to the [[Scottish Parliament]] on the Glasgow regional list. He thus became the first non-white and first Muslim [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6622915.stm |title=First Asian MSP goes to Holyrood |work=BBC News |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwitness.co.uk/scottish/0706s-01.htm] Interview with The iWitness, Scotland's Muslim Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6622865.stm] BBC election report, Friday, 4 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day of the [[3rd Scottish Parliament]], he wore traditional Pakistani clothing and took his oath of office using both the [[Urdu]] and [[English language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6638173.stm |title=MSPs at their best for ceremony |first=Andrew |last=Black |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6637097.stm |title=New members sworn in at Holyrood |work=BBC News |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad lead the bill on making [[forced marriage]]s a criminal offence in Scotland and participated in a humanitarian campaign for Scottish hospitals to treat the most serious casualties of [[Israel]]'s attacks on the [[Gaza Strip]], particularly women and children with life-threatening burns or other wounds.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;
He was a member of the Scottish Parliament's [[Public Petitions Committee]], which decides which action should be taken on petitions submitted by individuals, groups or organisations.&lt;ref name="scotsman obituary"/&gt;

Ahmad died of a heart attack on 6 February 2009 at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="BBC News death"/&gt; His funeral was held at the [[Glasgow Central Mosque]] and he was buried in [[Cathcart Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politicians-pay-respects-at-funeral-of-msp-ahmad-1-1303875 |title=Politicians pay respects at funeral of MSP Ahmad |first1=Lucinda |last1=Cameron |first2=Sam |last2=Reeves |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Business Times''''' is an English-language financial daily based in [[Singapore]] currently owned by [[Singapore Press Holdings]] (SPH). It is currently the only daily newspaper in [[Singapore]] that focuses on business and financial news. Its average daily circulation (print and digital editions combined) as of August 2016 was 36,900, according to SPH. &lt;ref&gt; [url=http://www.sph.com.sg/our-businesses/newspapers/the-business-times-the-business-times-weekend/ SPH].&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Business Times'' is published as a broadsheet on weekdays, with a weekend edition that is published as a compact-sized paper. On October 8, 2016, The Business Times revamped its weekend edition, featuring its own luxury [[lifestyle magazine]]. The main newspaper section for the weekend was also rebooted.

==History==

BT started as a supplement that was distributed three times a week with [[The Straits Times]]. On Oct 1, 1976, [http://www.businesstimes.com.sg The Business Times] became a newspaper in its own right. In June 1995, BT became the first English-language newspaper in [[Asia]] to go online. By 2000, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095605/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/ BT's website] was offering news updates throughout the day. In February 2012, BT launched a sister site [http://www.btinvest.com.sg/ BTInvest], a portal focused on finance and investment. Over the course of 2012 and 2013, BT also rolled out mobile apps, for the [https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/business-times-for-iphone/id531275824?mt=8 iPhone], [https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/business-times-for-ipad/id531283825?mt=8 iPad] and [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ps.bt&amp;hl=en Android smartphones].

In October 2014, BT simultaneously refreshed its newspaper, website, tablet and smartphone apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/refreshed-paper-refreshed-newsroom|title=Refreshed paper, refreshed newsroom|first=Teh Shi|last=Ning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One big change - applied to both its print and digital products - was in how it organises the news. Previously organised by geographical markets, BT's news is now categorised by industry sectors. The paper said that this was to underline its sharpened focus on business. Sections include: Companies &amp; Markets, Real Estate, Banking &amp; Finance, Energy &amp; Commodities, Technology, Consumer, Transport and Government &amp; Economy. Another important change for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095605/http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/ BT website] was the shift to [[responsive web design]], which ensures that the site is readable and easy to navigate on any screen. Other key changes include an emphasis on [[visual journalism]] and [[data-driven journalism]], and the introduction of three new [[blogs]] on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141014113048-39458673-five-things-to-know-about-the-new-business-times|title=Five Things to Know About the NEW Business Times|date=14 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 redesign also won BT an Award of Excellence from the [http://www.snd.org/ Society of News Design] in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snd.org/competitions/database/?d=1&amp;contest=&amp;ID=42367|title=Search Competition Database|date=16 August 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In computer software development, the '''business rules approach''' is a development methodology where rules are in a form that is used by, but does not have to be embedded in, business process management systems.

The business rules approach formalizes an enterprise's critical business rules in a language that managers and technologists understand. Business rules create an unambiguous statement of what a business does with information to decide a proposition. The formal specification becomes information for process and rules engines to run.

==Advantages==

The adoption of business rules adds another tier to systems that automate business processes. Compared to traditional systems, this approach has the following major advantages,
* lowers the cost incurred in the modification of business logic
* shortens development time
* rules are externalized and easily shared among multiple applications
* changes can be made faster and with less risk

Business rules represent a natural step in the application of computer technology aimed at enhancing productivity in the workplace. Automated business processes that have business logic embedded inside often take substantial time to change, and such changes can be prone to errors. And in a world where the life cycle of business models has greatly shortened, it has become increasingly critical to be able to adapt to changes in external environments promptly. These needs are addressed by a business rules approach.

Business rules enhance [[business agility]]. And the manageability of business processes also increases as rules become more accessible.

==Technical details==
&lt;!-- Stay neutral, don't say one vendor is a good example. MM --&gt;
The programs designed specifically to run business rules are called [[rule engine]]s. More complete systems that support the writing, deployment and management of business rules are called business rules management systems ([[BRMS]]s).

Many commercial rule engines provide the [[Rete algorithm]], a proprietary [[algorithm]] that embodies many of the principles of Rete. However, there are other execution algorithms such as the sequential algorithm (ILOG and Blaze Advisor terminology), algorithms for evaluating decision tables/trees, and algorithms tuned for hierarchical [[XML]]. The Rete algorithm is a stateful pattern matching algorithm designed to minimize the evaluation of repetitive tests across many objects/attributes and many rules. Different fields of usage are best for Rete-based and non-Rete-based execution algorithms. For simple stateless applications with minimal sharing of conditions across rules, a non-Rete-based execution algorithm (such as the sequential algorithm) may be preferable. For evaluating decision tables and trees, an algorithm that exploits the hierarchical relationships between the rule conditions may perform better than a simple Rete or sequential algorithm tuned for discrete rules.

Business rules can be expressed in conventional programming languages or natural languages. In some commercial BRMSs rules can also be expressed in user-friendly rule forms such as decision tables and decision trees. Provided with a suitable interface to design or edit decision tables or trees, it is possible for business users to check or change rules directly, with minimal IT involvement.

When rules are expressed in natural language, it is necessary to first define a vocabulary that contains words and expressions corresponding to business objects and conditions and the operations involving them. To make the rules executable by a rule engine, it is also necessary to implement the operations and conditions in a [[programming language]]. With a defined and implemented vocabulary, it is relatively easy to write rules in a BRMS. Changes can also be made quickly as long as they can be expressed in the existing vocabulary. If not, the vocabulary must be expanded accordingly.

Separating the vocabulary from the logic makes it possible for business rules to be modeled, with the business user mapping their business logic and with IT integrating data and the generated code into the target application. 
Business rules are also key to the [[enterprise decision management]] approach to decision automation.

Increasingly, business rules are also viewed as a critical component of [[business process management]] solutions because of the need to ensure flexibility.

== Relation to database management ==

As argued by [[Christopher J. Date]], business rules translate into [[data integrity constraint]]s when one thinks in terms of the [[relational model of database management]].  Thus, a true [[Relational database management system|RDBMS]] could be thought of in terms of a [[declarative programming|declarative]] [[business rules engine]] with added [[data management]] capability.

However, business rules need not only be regarded as constraints.  They can also be used to specify constructive business policies, such as "preferred clients get a discount of 10%".  Used in this way, business rules are like SQL queries, rather than data integrity constraints.

== Relation to business process management ==

Some analysts believe the combination of business rules technology with [[business process management]] offers an agile approach to workflow and enterprise integration.  BPM and BR software support business goals by managing and running business processes and business rules in separate yet complementary ways. A business process is often a complex map of flow controls. It might have many subprocesses, decisions and while loops. Wherever a decision or while loop appears, business rules can evaluate the data provided by the process and control the basis for change in flows.

Often there are separate reasons for updates to processes or rules. New regulations or business strategies may affect the rules without changing core business processes. New applications or procedures might change the business process. In either case, a composite approach to rules and processes can be very flexible.

As more and more BPM vendors either add business rules engines to their BPM engines or OEM business rules management systems, business rules seems to be becoming a subset of BPM.

'''[[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] Mellon''' was founded in 1996 as a [[joint venture]] between the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] (hereafter CIBC) and the [[Mellon Financial Corporation]] (now [[The Bank of New York Mellon]]) (hereafter Mellon) to offer asset servicing to institutional investors.  While commonly known as CIBC Mellon, the company comprises two sister companies, '''CIBC Mellon [[Trust company|Trust Company]]''' and '''CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services Company''' (''Compagnie Trust CIBC Mellon'' and ''Société de services de titres mondiaux CIBC Mellon'' in French respectively).  Based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] CIBC Mellon offers asset servicing to corporate and institutional clients.

On 16 February 2010, ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that BNY Trust Co. of Canada would be acquiring the corporate trust assets of CIBC Mellon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Van Hasselt | first = Caroline | title = Canada's BNY Trust to Buy CIBC Mellon's Corporate Trust Business: Sources | newspaper = Wall Street Journal | date = 16 February 2010 | url = https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100216-708834.html?mod=WSJ_Deals_LEFTLatestHeadlines | accessdate = 16 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CIBC Mellon was founded in 1996 after CIBC joined with Mellon Financial Corporation in a 50-50 joint venture named CIBC Mellon Global Securities Services (CMGSS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/business/international-business-bank-venture-in-canada.html?sec=&amp;spon= New York Times, February 13, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, 1997, CIBC purchased a 50% stake in The R-M Trust Company from Mellon, which would become CMGSS's sister company, CIBC Mellon Trust Company (CMTC).&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 4, 1997, pp. C8; Mellon Sells Half of Unit&lt;/ref&gt;  CIBC Mellon acquired the Pension and Institutional Trust businesses from [[Canada Trust]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, May 8, 1997, pp. D7; Canada Trust Plans Sale&lt;/ref&gt; and the global custody business from the [[Bank of Montreal]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 18, 1999, pp. F1; Also in Business&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 CIBC Mellon acquired, from [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Financial Group]], their third party investment fund custody business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efinancialnews.com/homepage/content/570779/printerfriendly/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Corporate Trust Company===

In 1998 it seemed that CIBC Mellon would be acquiring the Pacific Corporate Trust Company of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  That deal eventually fell through, and it was subsequently acquired by [[Computershare|Computershare Limited]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Thomson_M&amp;A/CIBC_Mellon_Global_Securities_acquires_Pacific_Corporate_Trust_Co-777320040 CIBC Mellon Global Securities acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Co]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133229494.html Computershare Acquires Pacific Corporate Trust Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Felcom Data Services acquisition===

On October 8, 2009, CIBC Mellon announced the acquisition of the unitholder recordkeeping and fund administration business of Felcom Data Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of [http://www.joviancapital.com Jovian Capital Corporation], for a purchase price of approximately C$4.2 million.  CIBC Mellon indicated that they would offer employment to the majority of employees involved in the business lines acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |title=CIBC Mellon Press Release, October 8, 2009 |access-date=2009-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128223115/http://cibcmellon.com/Contents/en_CA/English/NewsRoom/BulletinsReleases/2009/PR20091008.html# |archive-date=2016-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of issuer services business to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.===

On November 1, 2010, CIBC Mellon sold its issuer services business (stock transfer and employee share purchase plans) to Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canstockta.com/CSTPressRelease.pdf Canadian Stock Transfer Company, Inc. Press Release, November 3, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Securities investigations==

CIBC Mellon has been the subject of two securities investigations.  The first, in 1998, involved the now defunct Pay Pop Inc.  The second, in 2004, involved the disclosure of custodial information to an outside source.

===Pay Pop Inc.===

In 1998, Alnoor Jiwan, a manager in CIBC Mellon's Vancouver office, was approached by Pay Pop Inc. and asked whether CIBC Mellon could issue Pay Pop Inc. shares without the required disclaimer which stated that the securities were not registered with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]].

It was alleged by the SEC, in the subsequent investigation, that Mr Jiwan knew that the securities were not registered, but agreed to act as the transfer agent (in order to issue the stock certificates) in return for 820,000 Pay Pop shares.  The SEC subsequently cited CIBC Mellon for acting as an unregistered broker and transfer agent, and for offering to sell unregistered securities in addition to alleging that the company was uncooperative in the investigation.

Alnoor Jiwan was subsequently terminated for cause from CIBC Mellon, following the company's discovery of the transactions, and simultaneously ceasing all dealings with Pay Pop Inc.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, February 17, 2005, p.D.4&lt;/ref&gt;

CMTC agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of US$5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270.

CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.

Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the final judgment on March 2, 2005. Pursuant to the order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.&lt;ref name="TA1"&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1277690/000127769011000002/xslFTAX01/primary_doc.xml TA1 dated January 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy breach===

In 2004, a long-term employee of CIBC Mellon was terminated, after it had been discovered that they had been disclosing institutional holdings in certain companies to unidentified parties in return for gifts.  It was reported that the employee had received hockey and baseball tickets as well as up to $100 in cash for tips on big investors who owned specific stocks.

The disclosures were discovered when a temporary worker received a request for data through an email.  The subsequent investigation, which included reviewing phone and email records, discovered that the employee had been disclosing information for years.&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star, December 9, 2004, p. C.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related party transactions with Enron===

In 2003, [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce|CIBC]] paid out $80 million in charges for complicity with [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce#Enron|its involvement]] with [[Enron]].  While the involvement was not related to CIBC Mellon, as CIBC is a majority stakeholder, it was required that it be reported on the TA-1 to the SEC.&lt;ref name="TA1" /&gt;

==Biography==
Chan was born in Hong Kong and was educated at the [[Diocesan Boys' School]] and the [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Government Central School]] (today's Queen's College) and became Morrison scholar and pupil teacher after graduation. He was later appointed third clerk in the Magistracy and received only a small pension from the Hong Kong government.&lt;ref name="millionaire"&gt;{{cite news|title=DEATH OF CHINESE MULTIMILLIONAIRE.|newspaper=Hong Kong Daily Press|date=12 December 1919|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His began his fortune when he joined the opium farms which then existed in Hong Kong. He later became managing director of the Tai Yau Opium Farm. By the time the government took over the monopoly, Chan had already become a millionaire. At the time of his death, he was managing director of Gande, Price &amp; Co., partner of the Tai Yau Bank, director of the [[East Asia Bank]], Chung Kwong Co. and Hong Kong Mercantile Co. and became one of the richest men in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="millionaire"/&gt;

He was appointed member of the District Watchmen's Committee and was a member of the Permanent Chinese Cemetery Committee in [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]] and also the Chinese Public Dispensaries Committee.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; He was the Vice-Chairman of the [[Chinese General Chamber of Commerce]], past chairman of the [[Tung Wah Hospital]] and member of the [[Po Leung Kuk]]. He was also member of the Court of the [[University of Hong Kong]] and several scholarships bore his name.&lt;ref name="death"&gt;{{cite news|title=MR. CHAN KAI-MING.|newspaper=The Hong Kong Telegraph|date=11 December 1919|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was made [[Justice of the Peace]] and was subsequently appointed [[Sanitary Board]] member from April 1912 for three terms, becoming the senior unofficial member until his death in 1919. After the [[First World War]], he was member of the general committee for the Peace Celebrations.&lt;ref name="death"/&gt; He acted as member of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] during the absence on leave of [[Lau Chu-pak]] in 1918 .&lt;ref name="millionaire"/&gt;

Chan was in difficult heart problem during his last days of his life. His caught a cold his travel to Peking for a holiday as the suggestion of his doctor and died at his residence at 16 [[Caine Road]] on 11 December 1919, leaving five daughters and two sons.&lt;ref name="millionaire"/&gt;

A '''charterparty''' (sometimes '''charter-party''') is a maritime contract between a [[shipowner]] and a  "charterer" for the hire of either a ship for the carriage of passengers or cargo, or a yacht for pleasure purposes.
 
The name "charterparty" is an [[anglicisation]] the [[French language|French]] ''charte partie'', or "split paper", i.e. a document written in duplicate so that each party retains half.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Charter-party|volume=5|pages=953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Latin]] term ''charta partita'' is a [[back-formation]], and not a true etymological source.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of charterparty==
{{main|Chartering (shipping)}}
There are three main types of charterparty: '''time, voyage''' and '''demise and another
''':
* In a '''[[demise charter|demise]] (or bareboat) charter''', the charterer takes responsibility for the crewing and maintenance of the ship during the time of the charter. He assumes the legal responsibilities of the owner, and is known as a disponent owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* In a '''[[time charter]]''', the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The shipowner manages the vessel but the charterer gives orders for the employment of the vessel, and may sub-charter the vessel on a time charter or voyage charter basis. 
* In a '''[[voyage charter]]''', the charterer hires the vessel for a single voyage, but the shipowner provides the master, crew, [[bunkers]] and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html Maritimeknowhow website: voyage charter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714034807/http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demise charter operates as a long lease of the vessel, with the charterer completely in charge.  In time and voyage charters, the shipowner still runs the ship, but when in port the charterer becomes responsible for loading and unloading the ship within the agreed period of [[laytime]]. If the charterer exceeds the allowed laytime, [[demurrage]]&lt;ref&gt;"Demurrage" is a form of [[liquidated damages]], a penalty for exceeding laytime.&lt;/ref&gt; becomes payable.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]" case&lt;/ref&gt;

In a voyage charter, the route is pre-arranged and the charterer has little scope to interfere with the programme. By contrast, the time charter is almost a halfway-house between a demise charter and a voyage charter, in that the charterer decides on the voyages and the ports, and instructs the shipowner's crew to comply. This can lead to issues of [[indemnity]]: whereas the shipowner in a voyage charter takes responsibility for the ship, in a time charter the shipowner may need to be indemnified against losses or liabilities [[Proximate cause|proximately caused]] by the charterer.

==Legal aspects of charterparties==

Whereas a charterparty is the contract between a shipowner and a charterer, a contract of carriage lies between the shipper and the carrier. A carrier will issue a shipper with a [[bill of lading]], a receipt for cargo shipped which also serves as evidence of the contract of carriage. (In a demise charter, the charterer is the carrier; in a time or voyage charter the shipowner is the carrier).

The US  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act]] (COGSA), and the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] (which ratifies and incorporates the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]) do NOT apply to charterparties, but do apply to bills of lading (and similar documents such as ships delivery orders, or sea waybills).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a bill of lading is issued to a charterer by the shipowner, the question arises as to which is the dominant document.&lt;ref&gt;''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450, HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Henryk Sif'' [1982] 1 LL R 456&lt;/ref&gt; If a shipper returns a bill of lading to a carrier (perhaps as a [[Pledge (law)|pledge]]), the carrier will hold it only as a token of the pledge.

In both USA and the UK, the COGSA legislation provide a statement of the minimum duties that a carrier owes to the cargo-owner.  If the charterer has shipped cargo, charterparty document may incorporate the COGSA or the Harter Act, since the charter is also a cargo-owner. Such an incorporation is valid and enforceable even without the issuance of a bill of lading. In the reverse case, if a carrier issues a third-party shipper with a bill of lading that incorporates charterparty terms, the shipper/cargo-owner would not be liable for fees such as [[demurrage]], which are payable only by a charter.

Lawsuits brought for the breach of an obligation under a charterparty fall within admiralty jurisdiction. If a breach of charter terms creates a maritime lien, the suit may be ''in rem'' (i.e. against the vessel itself).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In pleasure boating, the most frequent charter arrangement is bareboat [[yacht charter]]. A voyage or time charter is used only for larger yachts and is uncommon. Yacht charter flotillas are mostly made up of boats belonging to individuals or companies who only use their boats on a part-time basis or as an investment. A recent innovation in recreational boating is "time-share chartering" whereby several charterers are assigned a certain number of days per month or season in a manner which resembles real-estate time-share.

==Typical clauses==

A charterparty may contain these clauses.

===Bunker clause===

A [[bunkers|bunker]] clause stipulates that the charterer shall accept and pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of delivery and conversely, (owners) shall pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of re-delivery at current price at the respective ports. It is customary to agree upon a certain minimum and maximum quantity in bunkers on re-delivery of the vessel. Since the [[OW Bunker]] test case, ship operators need to take care to ensure that bunker supply terms are suitable.

===Ship clause===

Under this clause, the owner of the ship writes clearly that the ship would be seaworthy at the start of the voyage in every respect, in other words, the ship would be appropriate to travel to the country for which it is taken.

===Ice clause===

An ice clause is inserted in a [[bill of lading]] or a charterparty when a vessel is bound for a port or ports which may be closed to shipping by ice when the vessel arrives or after the vessel's arrival.

===Lighterage clause===

A lighterage clause is inserted into charter-parties which show as port of discharge any safe port in a certain range, e.g. Havre/Hamburg range.

===Negligence clause===

A negligence clause tends to exclude shipowner's or carrier's liability for loss or damage resulting from an act, default or neglect of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation of manoeuvring of a ship, not resulting, however, from want of due diligence by the owners of the ship or any of them or by the ship's husband or manager.

===Ready berth clause===

A ready berth clause is inserted in a charterparty, ''i.e.'' a stipulation to the effect that [[layday]]s will begin to count as soon as the vessel has arrived at the port of loading or discharge "whether in berth or not". It protects shipowner's interests against delays which arise from ships having to wait for a [[berth (moorings)|berth]].

[[File:IFAC Definition of MA.jpg|thumb|right|The structure of accounting as documented by the [[International Federation of Accountants]]]]
The '''differences between [[management accounting]] and [[financial accounting]]''' include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Management and Cost Accounting |author=Colin Drury |chapter=Differences between management accounting and financial accounting |page=7 |isbn=9781844805662 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Management accounting provides information to people within an organization while financial accounting is mainly for those outside it, such as shareholders
#Financial accounting is required by law while management accounting is not.  Specific standards and formats may be required for statutory accounts such as in the I.A.S [[International Accounting Standard]] within Europe.
#Financial accounting covers the entire organization while management accounting may be concerned with particular products or cost centres.

Managerial accounting is used primarily by those within a company or organization.  Reports can be generated for any period of time such as daily, weekly or monthly.  Reports are considered to be "future looking" and have forecasting value to those within the company.

Financial accounting is used primarily by those outside of a company or organization. Financial reports are usually created for a set period of time, such as a financial year or period.  Financial reports are historically factual and have predictive value to those who wish to make financial decisions or investments in a company.
Management Accounting is the branch of Accounting that deals primarily with confidential financial reports for the exclusive use of top management within an organization. These reports are prepared utilizing scientific and statistical methods to arrive at certain monetary values which are then used for decision making. Such reports may include:

* Sales Forecasting reports
* Budget analysis and comparative analysis
* Feasibility studies
* Merger and consolidation reports

Financial Accounting, on the other hand, concentrates on the production of financial reports, including the basic reporting requirements of profitability, liquidity, solvency and stability. Reports of this nature can be accessed by internal and external users such as the shareholders, the banks and the creditors.

== Regulation and standardization ==

While financial accountants follow [[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] set by professional bodies in each country or International Financial Reporting Standards, managerial accountants make use of procedures and processes that are not regulated by standard-setting bodies.

== Time period ==

Managerial Accounting provides top management with reports that are future-oriented, while Financial Accounting provides reports based on historical information.
There is no time span for producing managerial accounting statements but financial accounting statements are generally required to be produced for the period of 12 previous months.

==Legal differences in the United States==

* There is no legal requirement for an organization to use management accounting, but publicly traded firms (limited companies or whose shares are bought and sold on an open market) must, by law, prepare financial account statements.
* In management accounting systems there is no requirement for an independent external review but financial accounting annual statements must be audited by an independent CPA firm.
* In management accounting systems, management may be concerned about how reports will affect employees behavior whereas financial management concerns are about the adequacy of disclosure in financial statements.

{{Unreferenced|date=April 2009}}
{{Admiralty law}}
In a [[contract of carriage]], the '''consignee''' is the entity who is financially responsible (the buyer) for the receipt of a [[shipment]].  Generally, but not always, the consignee is the same as the receiver.

If a sender dispatches an item to a receiver via a delivery service, the sender is the ''sender'', the recipient is the ''consignee'', and the deliverer is the ''carrier''.

==A brief statement of law==
This is a difficult area of [[law]] in that it regulates the mass [[transport]]ation industry which cannot always guarantee arrival on time or that [[good (accounting)|goods]] will not be damaged in the course of transit. Furthermore, two other problems are that unpaid consignors or [[freight]] carriers may wish to hold goods until payment is made, and [[fraudulent]] individuals may seek to take delivery in place of the [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimate]] consignees. The key to resolving such disputes lies in the [[documentation]]. The standard form of contract is a [[bill of lading]] which, in international shipping law, is simply a contract for the carriage of goods entered into between the shipper and the carrier that is not a [[Charter-party|charter party]]. It is always a term of that contract that the carrier must deliver the goods to a specific receiver. 

=== Documentation and legal requirements for delivery ===

A straight bill of lading by land or sea, or air [[waybill]] are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an "order" or "bearer" bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the [[Hague Rules]], and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in [[Hong Kong]], there is no need to present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in "The Rafaela S" [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and "The Happy Ranger" [2002] 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of [[cargo]] being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge [[port]].

=== Consignee rights ===

The rights of the consignee under an air waybill are regulated by the [[Warsaw Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, 1929 and the [[Montreal Convention]] for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air 1999 and the relevant state laws (which may be one law chosen as the proper law by the parties, or any combination of laws representing the seller, buyer, consignor, and carrier.)
This is very important as per export documents.

The receiver can be different than that of the consignee.

===IMPORTANCE===
It is helpful to give and take the information about to be paid and received.
It helps to settle dispute as it includes the detail about the goods and terms of [[trade]] and payment.
It informs the selling price to the [[consignee]]. 
It helps to know the quality , the quantity, the price and the discount to the importer.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4626">In relation to [[juristic person]]s, the '''constitutional documents''' (sometimes referred to as the '''charter documents''') of the entity are the documents which define the existence of the entity and regulate the structure and control of the entity and its members. The precise form of the constitutional documents depends upon the type of entity.

== Companies ==
By convention, most [[common law]] jurisdictions divide the constitutional documents of [[company (law)|companies]] into two separate documents:&lt;ref&gt;Although, for example, in Australia, a company has a single consolidated corporate constitution.&lt;/ref&gt;
*the '''[[Memorandum of Association]]''' (in some countries referred to as the '''[[Articles of Incorporation]]''') is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world, such as the company's objects and powers.
*the '''[[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]]''' (in some countries referred to as the '''[[bylaw|by-laws]]''') is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for [[Board of directors|board meetings]], [[dividend]] entitlements etc.&lt;ref&gt;In the event of any inconsistency, the Memorandum usually prevails, see ''Ashbury v Watson'' (1885) 30 Ch D 376&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, only the primary document is filed, and the secondary document remains private. In other countries, both documents are filed.

In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the '''[[charter]]'''.

It is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as ''[[shareholders' agreement]]s'', whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.&lt;ref&gt;''Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley'' [1924] NZLR 561&lt;/ref&gt; One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed.

Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of ''[[voting trust]]s'', although these are relatively uncommon outside of the [[United States]] and certain [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]].

== Partnerships ==
Partnerships also have constitutional documents in the form of a [[partnership agreement]]. In some jurisdictions, a more formal constitution, sometimes referred to as '''articles of partnership''' or a partnership deed is used (particularly where the partnership has certain corporate aspects, such as a [[Limited Liability Partnership]]). However, many partnerships are not created formally, and may have no written partnership agreement and leave the regulation of the partnership to be regulated in accordance with the understandings of the parties and by general law. Some of the largest partnerships in the world have no written partnership agreement.&lt;ref&gt;The best example is probably the leading English [[Magic Circle (law)|magic circle]] law firm, [[Slaughter and May]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trusts ==
A [[trust law|trust]] is not a separate legal entity as such, but is often treated as one for certain legal purposes. Like partnerships, trusts are not normally required to have a written [[trust instrument]] to constitute them,&lt;ref&gt;Although some jurisdictions require one in specific instances, for example, where the trust property include land.&lt;/ref&gt; although most large and formal trusts do.

== Unincorporated associations ==
An [[unincorporated association]] may also have a constitution which provides for the rights and remedies of the members as between themselves, and governs the conduct of the association. Because, in most legal systems, unincorporated associations do not have separate legal personality, this aspect of the constitutional documents is not applicable. In most legal systems unincorporated associations are not required to have formal written constitutions, but many of the larger and more complex organisations would be almost impossible to administer without one.&lt;ref&gt;For example, many [[trade union]]s and [[political party|political parties]] have many millions of members, and would be almost impossible to run without clear internal regulations.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cumulative quantities''' are a concept in [[logistics]] that involves adding up required materials quantities over a defined time-window that can be drawn as a 'cumulative curve'. This concept is applied in [[serial production]] and mainly used in the [[automotive industry]] to plan, control and monitor production and delivery.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lödding: ''Verfahren der Fertigungssteuerung.'' Springer Verlag, 2008, Kap. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-loop-cycle ==
The Concept of Cumulative Quantities (CCQ) uses the [[feedback]] mechanism of a [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed loop]], which can be found in industrial, engineering and electronic systems. The target requirements are summarized for each time-interval and compared with the actual values for [[closed-loop control]]. Positive cumulative deviation for a certain time-interval requires no further order, while negative deviations require a new order. To "calm" production and material flow upper and lower tolerance boundaries are defined and only if these boundaries are violated is a renewed order.

To check the entire production and material flow 'reporting limits' can be defined at a chosen [[Counting Point (logistics)|counting point]] and if a limit is exceeded a concerned 'alert' is issued. The logistics staff has to explain the reason for the 'alert'. If the reason is correct and traceable no further action is needed. If mistakes are present in the [[database]], [[data processing]] or in data-acquisition appropriate counter-measures are needed. Examples for mistakes or failures  wrong primary demand or bad [[forecasting]], mistakes in [[Bill of Material]] or [[master data]], old [[Master Production Schedule]], inaccurate or delayed [[data acquisition]], calculation mistakes, mounting of incorrect parts at [[assembly line]].

== Counting points  ==
Target-actual-control-loop uses exactly defined [[Counting Point (logistics)|counting points]] that demarcate the next-following intervals along the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schönsleben: ''Integrales Logistikmanagement'', Springer Vieweg Verlag, 7. Aufl., 2016, S. 308&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative differences of next-following counting points show the quantities of material items which traverse the Interval and therefore offer transparency of the inventory of an item along the entire [[supply chain]].

== Supply chain  ==
Cumulative quantities are a part of official [[Electronic data interchange|EDI]]-formats (e.g. [[EDIFACT]] - DELFOR) that are widely used by OEMs and their suppliers. Normally the data acquisition at 'goods receipt' are used for communication between consignee and goods dispatcher. Using the CCQ for the entire supply chain a [[Bullwhip effect]] can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;W. Herlyn: ''The Bullwhip Effect in expanded Supply Chains and the Concept of Cumulative Quantities.'' epubli Verlag, Berlin 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-8442-9878-9}}, S. 513–528.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the age of 18, Aegarter founded his first company, Megabyte.&lt;ref name=30years/&gt;

In 1988, at the age of 19, Aegerter founded Dynabit, an importer and distributor of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Macintosh]] peripherals, particularly for those used in [[electronic publishing]]. At that time, he was working as an intern for [[Swiss Bank Corporation]].&lt;ref name=exigen/&gt;&lt;ref name=enabler&gt;{{cite news | last=Moran | first=Susan | title=The Enabler | url=http://citebm.business.illinois.edu/emba/references/mod7/b2b_tradex.htm | work=[[Business 2.0]] | date=September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a loan of 250,000 [[Swiss franc]]s from Zug Cantonal Bank.&lt;ref name=30years/&gt;

In 1990, he moved to [[Tampa]] with his wife to start a computer trading business.

'''Sir Denys Hartley Henderson''' (11 October 1932 – 21 May 2016) was a British businessman. He was chairman of [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] from 1987 to 1995.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Henderson was born on 11 October 1932, in [[Colombo]], Sri Lanka, where his father was a tea planter.  The family returned to Scotland and Henderson went to school in [[Aberdeen]] and graduated from the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1955 in Arts and Law with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] and an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]]

===National Service===
Henderson trained as a solicitor but never practised at a [[law firm]].  He says that it was his [[National Service]] that finally convinced him to use his legal training, by showing him a side of the law which he could never aspire to in [[:wikt:civvy street|civvy street]]. He was a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in the [[Army Legal Services Branch|directorate of army legal services]] and for 18 months acted as a [[Prosecutor|prosecuting attorney]] handling everything from fraud, assault and attempted murder to what he has described, with great delicacy, as "various unnatural offences".   After that kind of drama he said there was no way he could face the tedium of a provincial solicitor's office where wills and small debt summonses would be the highlights of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 April 1991 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408214/uk-sir-denys-henderson-nucleus-ici-1-3/ | title=Sir Denys Henderson – the nucleus of ICI. (1 of 3) | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Chemical Industries===
Henderson joined the secretary's department at ICI head office in 1957 and was paid £900 a year.  He said "The honest truth is I just wanted a job that paid the rent" adding that "I found the change from having a huge amount of personal initiative and personal responsibility as a prosecuting officer to being a 'scrubber' in the secretary's department not very stimulating – I made one or two attempts to leave but never did."  He went on to hold various ICI legal posts including at Paints and after taking on various commercial roles went on to become Chairman of the Paints division in 1977, a position he held until 1980 when he joined the main ICI board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 April 1991 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/408213/uk-sir-denys-henderson-nucleus-ici-2-3/ | title=Sir Denys Henderson – the nucleus of ICI.

(3 of 3) | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson joined the main ICI board in 1980 and was appointed deputy chairman in 1986, succeeding [[John Harvey-Jones|Sir John Harvey-Jones]] as chairman a year later.  He was instrumental in implementing a major streamlining of ICI to help it ride out the recession and face up to the tough competition of the 1990s, including a severe belt tightening and decentralised organisation with a lot of authority delegated to the chief executives who ran the individual businesses.

In recognition of his service to not only his business but his country, Henderson was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the [[1989 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=51772 |date=17 June 1989 |pages=1–2  |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=52009 |date=5 January 1990 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 1991, [[Hanson plc|Hanson]] disclosed that it had purchased about 20 million, or 2.8 percent, of ICI's shares, leading to speculation of a possible takeover of what was at the time the UK's third-largest company.  A management team headed by Henderson and [[Frank Whitely]], its deputy chairman, led the takeover-defense plan against [[James Hanson, Baron Hanson|Lord Hanson]], the chairman of Hanson, and his partner, Sir Gordon White (later [[Gordon White, Baron White of Hull|Lord White of Hull]]), enlisting the help of [[S. G. Warburg &amp; Co]], the British [[Investment banking|investment bank]], and [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company]], the American investment bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=18 May 1991 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC1E3DF93BA25756C0A967958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Often-Ravenous+Hanson+Takes+a+Taste+of+I.C.I.+ | title=Often-Ravenous Hanson Takes a Taste of I.C.I. | publisher=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=14 January 2008 | first=Steven | last=Prokesch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Hanson was forced to back down from the takeover.

Henderson was also in charge when ICI split in two in June 1993 to create [[AstraZeneca|Zeneca]].  He said "the demerger will produce two powerful, focused new companies able to concentrate even more on strengthening their leading positions in world markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 October 1992 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/409340/uk-demerger-1-says-british-economy-ici/ | title=That demerger (1) – what it says about the British economy – ICI | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 May 1996 | url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/410703/uk-fortress-zeneca/ | title=Fortress Zeneca | publisher=managementtoday.co.uk | accessdate=14 January 2008 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson was also chairman of the Zeneca Group from 1993 until 1995.

Henderson was awarded an [[Honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws|doctorate in law]] in 1993 by the [[University of Bath]].

=== Life after ICI ===
In March 1995 Henderson was appointed chairman of [[Rank Organisation]] a position he held until he retired at the April 2001 [[Annual general meeting|AGM]].  He was also chairman of [[Dalgety plc]] from 1995 to 1997, First '[[Crown Estate]]' Commissioner and chairman from 1995 to 2002 and has also held a number of [[non-executive director]]ships, including at [[Barclays plc|Barclays' Bank]] (1990 to 1995), [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Zinc]] (1990 to 1996), [[Schlumberger]] (1995 to 2001), Market &amp; Opinion Research International Ltd ([[Ipsos MORI|MORI]]) (2000 to 2002) and [[QinetiQ]] (2003 to 2005). Henderson was appointed to the Greenbury committee in 1995, which reported on the topic of executive remuneration. 

In an interview in 2002 Henderson said that nowadays, in a public company, 70 is the end of the road.  "Everybody should have his 15 minutes of fame," he says, "but I think this is a time to call it quits."  He also said {{cquote|I was brought up as an ICI man.

Henderson was appointed a non-executive director of [[AZ Electronic Materials]] by [[Carlyle Group|The Carlyle Group]] following its acquisition of the company in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=1 October 2004 | url=http://www.carlyle.com/News/News%20Archive/2004/item6661.html | title=The Carlyle Group Completes AZ Electronic Materials Acquisition and Announces Management Team and Board | publisher=[[Carlyle Group]] | accessdate=14 January 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708121218/http://www.carlyle.com/News/News%20Archive/2004/item6661.html | archivedate=8 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 21 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/203086/henderson HENDERSON]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Companies law}}

In [[corporate law]], the '''directors register''' is a list of the [[board of directors|directors]] elected by the [[shareholders]], generally stored in the company's [[minute book]].  By law, companies are required to keep this list up to date to remove those directors who are deceased or resign, and to add those who have been elected by the shareholders. However, the register must also list any person who had been a director indefinitely.  The record must indicate the dates a director started and stopped holding office. As directors carry certain personal legal obligations to a corporation (for example, being responsible for any money held in [[Trust law|trust]] for another person, e.g. [[sales taxes]] not remitted to a government), those seeking recourse against directors are allowed to rely on the directors register as proof that a director held office on any particular day.

In many jurisdictions, corporations are required to keep the list of directors up to date with the corporate affairs office where the corpororation was incorporated. This is so that both government agencies and interested third parties may be aware of the name and address of directors (for example, in order to serve a [[statement of claim]] on the corporation).

[[Publicly traded corporations]] are usually required to notify the appropriate securities and exchange commission about any change to their directors register.

When used in conjunction with an [[electronic signature]], it can provide evidence whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. In a time where fraud and [[identity theft]] has become rampant, electronic authentication can be a more secure method of verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balbas|first1=Luis|title=Digital Authentication - Factors, Mechanisms and Schemes|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-factors-mechanisms-schemes|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various e-authentication methods that can be used to authenticate a user's identify ranging from a password to higher levels of security that utilize [[multifactor authentication]] (MFA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMahon|first1=Mary|title=What is E-Authentication?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-e-authentication.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of security used, the user might need to prove his or her identity through the use of [[security token]]s, challenge questions or being in possession of a certificate from a third-party certificate authority that attests to their identity.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Digital Authentication - the Basics|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/digital-authentication-the-basics|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Digital enrollment and authentication reference process.jpg|thumb|Digital enrollment and authentication reference process by the American National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] The American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) has developed a generic electronic authentication model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Newton|first3=Elaine|title=Electronic Authentication Guideline|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63-1/SP-800-63-1.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that provides a basic framework on how the authentication process is accomplished regardless of jurisdiction or geographic region. According to this model, the enrollment process begins with an individual applying to a [[Credential Service Provider]] (CSP). The CSP will need to prove the applicant's identity before proceeding with the transaction. Once the applicant's identity has been confirmed by the CSP, he or she receives the status of "subscriber", is given an authenticator, such as a token and a credential, which may be in the form of a username.

The CSP is responsible for managing the credential along with the subscriber's enrollment data for the life of the credential. The subscriber will be tasked with maintaining the authenticators. An example of this is when a user normally uses a specific computer to do their online banking. If he or she attempts to access their bank account from another computer, the authenticator will not be present. In order to gain access, the subscriber would need to verify their identity to the CSP, which might be in the form of answering a challenge question successfully before being given access.&lt;ref name="Turner-AuthenticationBasics" /&gt;

==History==
The need for authentication has been prevalent throughout history. In ancient times, people would identify each other through eye contact and physical appearance. The [[Sumer]]ians in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] attested to the authenticity of their writings by using seals embellished with identifying symbols. As time moved on, the most common way to provide authentication would be the handwritten signature.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication factors==
There are three generally accepted factors that are used to establish a digital identity for electronic authentication, including:
* Knowledge factor, which is something that the user knows, such as a password, answers to challenge questions, ID numbers or a PIN.
* Possession factor, which is something that the user has, such as mobile phone, PC or token
* [[Biometric]] factor, which is something that the user is, such as his or her fingerprints, eye scan or voice pattern
Out of the three factors, the biometric factor is the most convenient and convincing to prove an individual's identity. However, having to rely on this sole factor can be expensive to sustain. Although having their own unique weaknesses, by combining two or more factors allows for reliable authentication. It is always recommended to use multifactor authentication for that reason.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Methods==
Authentication systems are often categorized by the number of factors that they incorporate. The three factors often considered as the cornerstone of authentication are:
Something you know (for example, a password)
Something you have (for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key)
Something you are (for example, a voice print, thumb print or other biometric)

Multifactor authentication is generally more secure than single-factor authentication. But, some multi-factor authentication approaches are still vulnerable to cases like man-in-the-middle attacks and Trojan attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneier|first1=Bruce|title=The Failure of Two-Factor Authentication|url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/03/the_failure_of.html|website=Schneier on Security|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common methods used in authentication systems are summarized below.

=== Token ===
[[File:SecureID token new.JPG|thumb|A sample of token]]
Tokens generically are something the claimant possesses and controls that may be used to authenticate the claimant's identity. In e-authentication, the claimant authenticates to a system or application over a network. Therefore, a token used for e-authentication is a secret and the token must be protected. The token may, for example, be a cryptographic key, that is protected by encrypting it under a password. An impostor must steal the encrypted key and learn the password to use the token.

=== Passwords and PIN-based authentication===
Passwords and PINs are categorized as "something you know" method. A combination of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases are considered to be stronger than all-letter password. Also, the adoption of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) features during the information transmission process will as well create an encrypted channel for data exchange and to further protect information delivered. Currently, most security attacks target on password-based authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Passwords and PINs based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=2 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015717/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/passwords.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public-key authentication===
This type of authentication has two parts. One is a public key, the other is a private key. A public key is issued by a Certification Authority and is available to any user or server.  A private key is known by the user only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Public-Key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531015722/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/pkey.htm |archivedate=May 31, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetric-key authentication===
The user shares a unique key with an authentication server. When the user sends a randomly generated message (the challenge) encrypted by the secret key to the authentication server, if the message can be matched by the server using its shared secret key, the user is authenticated.
When implemented together with the password authentication, this method also provides a possible solution for two-factor authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Symmetric-key Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709050327/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/skey.htm |archivedate=July 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SMS-based authentication===
[[File:US-VISIT (CBP).jpg|thumb|Biometric authentication]]
The user receives password by reading the message in the cell phone, and types back the password to complete the authentication. [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) is very effective when cell phones are commonly adopted. SMS is also suitable against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, since the use of SMS does not involve the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=SMS based Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827103712/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/sms.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biometric authentication ===
Biometric authentication is the use of unique physical attributes and body measurements as the intermediate for better identification and access control. Physical characteristics that are often used for authentication include fingerprints, voice recognition, face, recognition, and iris scans because all of these are unique to every individual separately. Traditionally, Biometric Authentication based on token-based identification systems, such as passport, and nowadays becomes one of the most secure identification systems to user protections. A new technological innovation which provides a wide variety of either behavioral or physical characteristics which are defining the proper concept of Biometric Authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Office of the Government Chief Information Officer |title=Biometric Authentication |url=http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108205213/http://www.e-authentication.gov.hk/en/professional/biometric.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital identity authentication ===
Digital identity authentication refers to the combined use of device, behavior, location and other data, including email address, account and credit card information, to authenticate online users in real time.

==Electronic credentials==
Paper credentials are documents that attest to the identity or other attributes of an individual or entity called the subject of the credentials. Some common paper credentials include passports, [[birth certificate]]s, driver's licenses, and employee identity cards. The credentials themselves are authenticated in a variety of ways: traditionally perhaps by a signature or a seal, special papers and inks, high quality engraving, and today by more complex mechanisms, such as holograms, that make the credentials recognizable and difficult to copy or forge. In some cases, simple possession of the credentials is sufficient to establish that the physical holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. More commonly, the credentials contain biometric information such as the subject's description, a picture of the subject or the handwritten signature of the subject that can be used to authenticate that the holder of the credentials is indeed the subject of the credentials. When these paper credentials are presented in-person, authentication [[biometrics]] contained in those credentials can be checked to confirm that the physical holder of the credential is the subject.

Electronic identity credentials bind a name and perhaps other attributes to a token. There are a variety of [[Electronic identification|electronic credential]] types in use today, and new types of credentials are constantly being created (eID, [[Voter ID laws|electronic voter ID card]], biometric passports, bank cards, etc.) At a minimum, credentials include identifying information that permits recovery of the records of the registration associated with the credentials and a name that is associated with the subscriber.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Verifiers==
In any authenticated on-line transaction, the verifier is the party that verifies that the claimant has possession and control of the token that verifies his or her identity. A claimant authenticates his or her identity to a verifier by the use of a token and an authentication protocol. This is called Proof of Possession (PoP). Many PoP protocols are designed so that a verifier, with no knowledge of the token before the authentication protocol run, learns nothing about the token from the run. The verifier and CSP may be the same entity, the verifier and [[relying party]] may be the same entity or they may all three be separate entities. It is undesirable for verifiers to learn shared secrets unless they are a part of the same entity as the CSP that registered the tokens. Where the verifier and the relying party are separate entities, the verifier must convey the result of the authentication protocol to the relying party. The object created by the verifier to convey this result is called an assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burr|first1=William|last2=Dodson|first2=Donna|last3=Polk|first3=W|title=INFORMATION SECURITY|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-63/SP800-63V1_0_2.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authentication schemes==
There are four types of authentication schemes: local authentication, centralized authentication, global centralized authentication, global authentication and web application (portal).

When using a local authentication scheme, the application retains the data that pertains to the user's credentials. This information is not usually shared with other applications. The onus is on the user to maintain and remember the types and number of credentials that are associated with the service in which they need to access. This is a high risk scheme because of the possibility that the storage area for passwords might become compromised.

Using the central authentication scheme allows for each user to use the same credentials to access various services. Each application is different and must be designed with interfaces and the ability to interact with a central system to successfully provide authentication for the user. This allows the user to access important information and be able to access private keys that will allow he or she to electronically sign documents.

Using a third party through a global centralized authentication scheme allows the user direct access to authentication services. This then allows the user to access the particular services they need.

The most secure scheme is the global centralized authentication and web application (portal). It is ideal for E-Government use because it allows a wide range of services. It uses a single authentication mechanism involving a minimum of two factors to allow access to required services and the ability to sign documents.&lt;ref name="Balbas-AuthFactorsMechsSchemes" /&gt;

==Authentication and digital signing working together==
Often, authentication and digital signing are applied in conjunction. In [[advanced electronic signature]]s, the signatory has authenticated and uniquely linked to a signature. In the case of a [[qualified electronic signature]] as defined in the [[eIDAS]]-regulation, the signer's identity is even certified by a qualified [[trust service provider]]. This linking of signature and authentication firstly supports the probative value of the signature – commonly referred to as [[non-repudiation]] of origin. The protection of the message on the network-level is called non-repudiation of emission. The authenticated sender and the message content are linked to each other. If a 3rd party tries to change the message content, the signature loses validity.&lt;ref name="Turner-NonRep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Understanding Non-Repudiation of Origin and Non-Repudiation of Emission|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-non-repudiation-of-origin-and-non-repudiation-of-emission|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics biometric authentication==

=== Homogenization and decoupling ===
Biometric authentication can be defined by many different procedures and sensors which are being used to produce security. Biometric can be separated into physical or behavioral security. Physical protection is based on identification through fingerprint, face, hand, iris, etc. On the other hand, behavioral safety is succeeded by keystroke, signature, and voice.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c3e6/b094d8052137c6e91f9c89cba860d356483a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main point is that all of these different procedures and mechanism that exist, produce the same homogeneous result, namely the security of the system and users. When thinking of the decoupling of hardware, the hardware is not coded in the same form by digitization which directly makes decoupling more difficult. Because of unlinkability and irreversibility of biometric templates, this technology can secure user authentication.

=== Digital traces ===
Biometric authentication has a substantial impact on digital traces. For example when the user decides to use his fingerprint to protect his data on his smartphone, then the system memorizes the input so it will be able to be re-used again. During this procedure and many other similar applications proves that the digital trace is vital and exist on biometric authentication.

=== Connectivity ===
Another characteristic of biometric authentication is that it combines different components such as security tokens with computer systems to protect the user. Another example is the connection between devices, such as camera and computer systems to scan the user’s retina and produce new ways of security. So biometric authentication could be defined by connectivity as long it connects different applications or components and through these users are getting connected and can work under the same roof and especially on a safe environment on the cyber world.

=== Reprogrammable &amp; smart ===
As new kinds of cybercrime are appearing, the ways of authentication must be able to adapt. This adaptation means that it is always ready for evolution and updating, and so it will be able to protect the users at any time. At first biometric authentication started in the sampler form of user’s access and defining user profiles and policies. Over time the need of biometric authentication became more complex, so cybersecurity organizations started reprogramming their products/technology from simple personal user’s access to allow interoperability of identities across multiple solutions. Through this evolution, business value also rises.&lt;ref&gt;http://journal.fidis-project.eu/fileadmin/journal/issues/1-2007/Biometric_Implementations_and_the_Implications_for_Security_and_Privacy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk assessment ==
When developing electronic systems, there are some industry standards requiring United States agencies to ensure the transactions provide an appropriate level of assurance. Generally, servers adopt the US' [[Office of Management and Budget]]'s (OMB's) E-Authentication Guidance for Federal Agencies (M-04-04) as a guideline, which is published to help federal agencies provide secure electronic services that protect individual privacy. It asks agencies to check whether their transactions require e-authentication, and determine a proper level of assurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E-Authentication Risk Assessment for Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances|url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ecomm/e_rx/risk_assessment_dea_218.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It established four levels of assurance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assurance Level 1: Little or no confidence in the asserted identity's validity.&lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 2: Some confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 3: High confidence in the asserted identity's validity. &lt;br /&gt;
Assurance Level 4: Very high confidence in the asserted identity's validity.

=== Determining assurance levels ===
The OMB proposes a five-step process to determine the appropriate assurance level for their applications:
* Conduct a risk assessment, which measures possible negative impacts. 
* Compare with the five assurance levels and decide which one suits this case.
* Select technology according to the technical guidance issued by NIST.
* Confirm the selected authentication process satisfies requirements.
* Reassess the system regularly and adjust it with changes.&lt;ref name="OMB"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolten|first1=Joshua|title=Memorandum: E-Authentication Guideline for Federal Agencies|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf|publisher=Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB)|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The required level of authentication assurance are assessed through the factors below:
* Inconvenience, distress, or damage to standing or reputation;
* Financial loss or agency liability;
* Harm to agency programs or public interests;
* Unauthorized release of sensitive information;
* Personal safety; and/or civil or criminal violations.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt;

=== Determining technical requirements ===
[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) guidance defines technical requirements for each of the four levels of assurance in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radack |first1=Shirley |title=ELECTRONIC AUTHENTICATION:  GUIDANCE FOR SELECTING SECURE TECHNIQUES |url=http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |accessdate=3 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915011249/http://www.itl.nist.gov/lab/bulletns/bltnaug04.htm |archivedate=September 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tokens are used for proving identity. Passwords and symmetric cryptographic keys are private information that the verifier needs to protect. Asymmetric cryptographic keys have a private key (which only the subscriber knows) and a related public key.
* Identity proofing, registration, and the delivery of credentials that bind an identity to a token. This process can involve a far distance operation.
* Credentials, tokens, and authentication protocols can also be combined together to identify that a claimant is in fact the claimed subscriber. 
* An assertion mechanism that involves either a digital signature of the claimant or is acquired directly by a trusted third party through a secure authentication protocol.

==Guidelines and regulations==
Triggered by the growth of new cloud solutions and online transactions, person-to-machine and machine-to-machine identities play a significant role in identifying individuals and accessing information. According to the Office of Management and Budget in the U.S, more than $70 million was spent on identity management solutions in both 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Shawn|title=E-authentication: What IT managers will be focusing on over the next 18 months|url=https://gcn.com/articles/2013/07/31/eauthentication.aspx|website=GCN|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments use e-authentication systems to offer services and reduce time people traveling to a government office. Services ranging from applying for visas to renewing driver's licenses can all be achieved in a more efficient and flexible way. Infrastructure to support e-authentication is regarded as an important component in successful e-government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agimo.gov.au/infrastructure/authentication|title=Whole of Government Information and Communications Technology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor coordination and poor technical design might be major barriers to electronic authentication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc?id=27391 Breaking Barriers to eGovernment (Draft Deliverable 1b)], eGovernment unit, European Commission, August 2006. See table 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In several countries there has been established nationwide common e-authentication schemes to ease the reuse of digital identities in different electronic services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japanpkiforum.jp/shiryou/e-auth_policy/overview_e-auth_v07.pdf An overview of International Initiatives in the field of Electronic Authentication], Japan PKI Forum, June 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Other policy initiatives have included the creation of frameworks for electronic authentication, in order to establish common levels of trust and possibly interoperability between different authentication schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finance.gov.au/e-government/security-and-authentication/ Australia], [http://e-com.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ecic-ceac.nsf/en/h_gv00090e.html Canada], [http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy04/m04-04.pdf US] (M04-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

===US===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the [[United States government]]'s effort to expand electronic government, or [[e-government]], as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier to access. The e-authentication service enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) from other web sites that both the user and the government  trust.

E-authentication is a government-wide partnership that is supported by the agencies that comprise the Federal CIO Council. The United States General Services Administration (GSA) is the lead agency partner. E-authentication works through an association with a trusted credential issuer, making it necessary for the user to log into the issuer's site to obtain the authentication credentials.  Those credentials or e-authentication ID are then transferred the supporting government web site causing authentication.The system was created in response a December 16, 2003  memorandum was issued through the  Office of Management and Budget.  Memorandum M04-04 Whitehouse.&lt;ref name="OMB" /&gt; That memorandum updates the guidance issued in the  ''Paperwork Elimination Act'' of 1998, 44 U.S.C. § 3504 and implements section 203 of the E-Government Act, 44 U.S.C. ch. 36.

NIST provides guidelines for digital authentication standards and does away with most knowledge-based authentication methods. A stricter standard has been drafted on more complicated passwords that at least 8 characters long or passphrases that are at least 64 characters long.&lt;ref name="NIST800-63-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft NIST Special Publication 800-63-3: Digital Authentication Guideline|url=https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In [[Europe]], [[eIDAS]] provides guidelines to be used for electronic authentication in regards to electronic signatures and certificate services for website authentication. Once confirmed by the issuing Member State, other participating States are required to accept the user's electronic signature as valid for cross border transactions.

Under eIDAS, electronic identification refers to a material/immaterial unit that contains personal identification data to be used for authentication for an online service. Authentication is referred to as an electronic process that allows for the electronic identification of a natural or legal person. A trust service is an electronic service that is used to create, verify and validate electronic signatures, in addition to creating, verifying and validating certificates for website authentication.

Article 8 of eIDAS allows for the authentication mechanism that is used by a natural or legal person to use electronic identification methods in confirming their identity to a relying party. Annex IV provides requirements for qualified certificates for website authentication.&lt;ref name="Tuner_Understanding eIDAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn|title=Understanding eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/understanding-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="eIDAS-EUR-Lex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|website=EUR-Lex|publisher=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
E-authentication is a centerpiece of the Russia government's effort to expand e-government, as a way of making government more effective and efficient and easier for the Russian people to access. The e-authentication service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garant.ru/products/ipo/prime/doc/12092469/|title=Постановление Правительства РФ от 28 ноября 2011 г. N 977 "О федеральной государственной информационной системе "Единая система идентификации и аутентификации в инфраструктуре, обеспечивающей информационно-технологическое взаимодействие информационных систем, используемых для предоставления государственных и муниципальных услуг в электронной форме"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; enables users to access government services online using log-in IDs (identity credentials) they already have from web sites that they and the government trust.

== Other applications ==
Apart from government services, e-authentication is also widely used in other technology and industries. These new applications combine the features of authorizing identities in traditional database and new technology to provide a more secure and diverse use of e-authentication. Some examples are described below.

=== Mobile authentication ===
Mobile authentication is the verification of a user's identity through the use a mobile device. It can be treated as an independent field or it can also be applied with other multifactor authentication schemes in the e-authentication field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Margaret|first1=Rouse|title=mobile authentication definition|url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-authentication|website=SearchSecurity.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mobile authentication, there are five levels of application sensitivity from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 is for public use over a mobile device and requires no identity authentications, while level 4 has the most multi-procedures to identify users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government of India Department of Electronics and Information Technology Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|title=e-Pramaan: Framework for e-Authentication|url=https://epramaan.gov.in/documents/ePramaan_Framework.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For either level, mobile authentication is relatively easy to process. Firstly, users send a one-time password (OTP) through offline channels. Then, a server identifies the information and makes adjustment in the database. Since only the user has the access to a PIN code and can send information through their mobile devices, there is a low risk of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tolentino|first1=Jamie|title=How to Increase App Security Through Mobile Phone Authentication|url=https://thenextweb.com/future-of-communications/2015/03/16/increasing-application-security-with-mobile-phone-authentication/|accessdate=3 November 2015|publisher=TNW news|date=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-commerce authentication ===
In the early 1980s, [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) systems was implemented, which was considered as an early representative of E-commerce. But ensuring its security is not a significant issue since the systems are all constructed around closed networks. However, more recently, business-to-consumer transactions have transformed. Remote transacting parties have forced the implementation of E-commerce authentication systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Matthew|title=Identity Authentication and 'E-Commerce'|journal=Warwick, Journal of Information Law &amp;Technology|date=23 Feb 2005|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/law/elj/jilt/1998_3/ford/#a2|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the approaches adopted in E-commerce authentication are basically the same as e-authentication. The difference is E-commerce authentication is a more narrow field that focuses on the transactions between customers and suppliers. A simple example of E-commerce authentication includes a client communicating with a merchant server via the Internet. The merchant server usually utilizes a web server to accept client requests, a database management system to manage data and a payment gateway to provide online payment services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawma|first1=Victor|title=A New Methodology for Deriving Effective Countermeasures Design Models|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.100.1216&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==
To keep up with the evolution of services in the digital world, there is continued need for security mechanisms. While passwords will continued to be used, it is important to rely on authentication mechanisms, most importantly multifactor authentication. As the usage of e-signatures continues to significantly expand throughout the United States, the EU and throughout the world, there is expectation that regulations such as [[eIDAS]] will eventually be amended to reflect changing conditions along with regulations in the United States.&lt;ref name="Walker-Perspectives"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Heather|title=How eIDAS affects the USA|url=https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/how-eidas-affects-the-us|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">'''Existential counselling''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] form of [[counselling]] which addresses the situation of a person's life and situates the person firmly within the predictable challenges of the human condition. 

Well known authors on existential counselling are [[Irvin Yalom]] in the USA through his book ''Existential Psychotherapy'' (1981),  and [[Emmy van Deurzen]], who created the British School and published ''Existential Counselling and Psychotherapy'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;M. Adams, ''A Concise Introduction to Existential Counselling'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions of living==
Existential counselling considers human living to take place in confrontation with three different dimensions – external world; other people; inner world.&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Others would nominate four dimensions: physical, social, psychological and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;M. Adams, ''A Concise Introduction to Existential Counselling'' (2013) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these dimensions can be seen as constituted like a force field, within which predictable paradoxes, tensions and dilemmas play out. Human beings can learn to deal with these tensions and conflicts more effectively by facing up to the negatives as well as the positives of their lives, including the tensions of life and death, love and hate, strength and weakness and meaning and absurdity.  

==Personal element==
Existential counsellors stress the importance of the examined life, and of preparatory work on oneself, in paving the way for effective counselling.&lt;ref&gt;H. Johns, ''Personal Development in Counsellor Training'' (1996) p. 5-6 and p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in counselling adolescents the counsellor can optimally model an autonomous life based on the making of realistic decisions, but one which also acknowledges the role of failure as well as success in everyday life, and the ongoing and inescapable presence of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;K. and D. Geldard, ''Counselling Adolescents'' (2009) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research basis==

In the debate on evidence-based research in counselling, existential counsellors tend to stress the dangers of over-simplification, and the importance of qualitative as well as quantitative measurements of outcome.&lt;ref&gt;R. Woolfe et al, eds., ''Handbook of Counselling Psychology'' (2009) p. 145-6&lt;/ref&gt;  While not necessarily expecting an easy resolution of the specific/non-specific factors in therapy debate, an existential counsellor will nonetheless favor evidence-based practice.&lt;ref&gt;M. Adams, ''A Concise Introduction to Existential Counselling'' (2013) p. 124-6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

'''Frustration of purpose''', in [[law]], is a defense to enforcement of a [[contract]]. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made.&lt;ref name="1982 HCA 24"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1992|litigants=[[Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW]] |parallelcite=(1982) 149 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |date=11 May 1982 |courtname=auto}}.austlii&lt;/ref&gt; Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.

For example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a [[hell or high water clause]], Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a [[foreclosure]] on his [[credit rating]].

Frustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of [[impossibility]]. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.

However, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.

The ''[[Restatement (Second) of Contracts]]'', Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:
{{quote|Where, after a contract is made, a party's principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, his remaining duties to render performance are discharged, unless the language or circumstances [of the contract] indicate the contrary.}}

A circumstance is not deemed to be a "basic assumption on which the contract is made" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of [[Prohibition]], when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.

If the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.

==In English law==
{{main|Frustration in English law}}
{{see also|Coronation cases}}

The [[English law| English]] case of ''[[Taylor v Caldwell]]'' established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of "[[sanctity of contract]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beale (2002) p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a [[Royal Surrey Gardens|music hall]], for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Judge Blackburn]] held that the absolute liability set forth in ''[[Paradine v Jane]]'' would not apply here, as there was an [[Implied terms in English law|implied term]] that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts.&lt;ref name=km1&gt;Koffman, Macdonald, p. 520&lt;/ref&gt; 

The requirement of "impossibility" in ''Taylor v Caldwell'' was modified in the 1903 case of ''[[Krell v Henry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Krell v Henry]]'' [1903] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 740.&lt;/ref&gt; which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation procession]] of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]]. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for [[breach of contract]]; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of "impossibility" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.

Some fans believed that the Technical Committee was a show from Kashani to pull over Daei, and select his "beloved friend" Estili.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/177466/%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D9%88-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85 Tabnak]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the opening match of the season against [[Malavan]], which ended 1–1 after the weak performance of Persepolis and late tying goal by [[Hossein Badamaki]], fans started screaming the name of Ali Daei since 60th minute, showing their displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{fa icon}} [http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2011/08/03/2602312/%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B4%DB%8C%D9%87-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B2%DB%8C-%D9%BE%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%BE%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D8%B3-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%88%DB%8C%D9%82-%D8%AF%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D9%88-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%AE%D8%B4%D8%B4-%DA%A9%D8%B1%DB%8C%D9%85%DB%8C Goal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

These principles are subsequently referred to as “management principles” within the body of this standard. The intent of this document is to provide top management with information to facilitate effective application of management principles and selection of methods and tools that enable the sustainable success of an organization".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:10014:ed-1:v1:en ISO 10014:2006], accessed 10 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A predecessor standard, "PD ISO/TR 10014:1998 Guidelines for managing the economics of quality" was withdrawn with the adoption of ISO 10014:2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenbs.com/PublicationIndex/documents/details?Pub=BSI&amp;DocId=254288 PD ISO/TR 10014:1998 Guidelines for managing the economics of quality (withdrawn)], accessed 10 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Financial Congress (IFC)''' is a major annual conference dedicated to the finance industry. The event brings together heads of central and commercial banks, financial institutions, international financial organizations and financial regulatory authorities, as well as renowned experts from around the world and figures from academia and business. Since 1992, it has been held in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]. 
Before 2016, the event was called the International Banking Congress (IBC).
Congress sessions are held in the form of interactive discussions, in which the most topical issues arising in the global banking and financial system are discussed.

== History ==
In the autumn of 1991, the first International Banking Congress was held in Frankfurt am Main, which was attended by [[Anatoly Sobchak]], the then Mayor of [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], and Viktor Khalansky, who was in charge of the Main St. Petersburg Office of the [[Central Bank of Russia]]. In his speech, [[Anatoly Sobchak|Sobchak]] suggested that the next Congress be held in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].

An initiative was put forward by the [[Central Bank of Russia]], and subsequently approved by the Russian government, to approach the world's leading banking institutions with the proposal to hold the International Banking Congress in [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].

The proposal gained support from representatives of leading banks, international banking and financial institutions, and audit firms.

On January 16, 1992, a non-governmental organization, named the Foundation for Support of the International Banking Congress, was established to facilitate the running of the congress. The organization was renamed the St. Petersburg Public Foundation for the Support of the International Banking Congress in 1998.

In April 1992, the first St. Petersburg-based International Banking Congress was held. The Congress was attended by over 350 participants from 50 countries. The Vice-Mayor of St. Petersburg was a member of the organizing committee for the first five International Banking Congress events. At present, the President of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] [[Vladimir Putin]] is a member of the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbk.spb.ru/en/about.php|title=The Saint-Petersburg Foundation for Support of International Banking Congresses (IBC)|website=www.mbk.spb.ru|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 he succeeded his father [[Jo Colruyt]] as head of [[Colruyt]], a company with more than 26,000 employees. With an estimated fortune of 2.521 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] [[euro]], he is one of the wealthiest people of Belgium.

King Albert II decided by royal decree that he was named Baron Colruyt, it was published at the honours list of the national Holiday by the Belgian Court.

==Career==
After his studies, Jef Colruyt became a representative at [[Dexion]] in 1985, a German company for logistic systems. In 1986 and 1987 he was a representative at [[Marchal Systems]], a company for chemical pumps.

In 1987, Jef Colruyt started working in the family business.

When his father Jo Colruyt deceased unexpectedly in 1994, Jef Colruyt took over the operational management of the company at 36 years old. Under his leadership, the French market was entered into and new store formulas were developed, such as the local shop OKay, baby specialist DreamBaby, toys and gaming specialist DreamLand and the organic supermarket Bio-Planet. In 2003, Spar was also added to this.

Under the leadership of Jef Colruyt, Colruyt Group also started to pay more attention to sustainable entrepreneurship and social responsibility projects.

'''''Jobs''''' is a 2013 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[drama film|drama]] film based on the life of [[Steve Jobs]], from 1974 while a student at [[Reed College]] to the introduction of the [[iPod]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=30653/|title=Palo Alto Online Film Review: Jobs|author=Peter Canavese |publisher=Palo Alto Online|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by [[Joshua Michael Stern]], written by Matt Whiteley, and produced by Stern and Mark Hulme. Steve Jobs is portrayed by [[Ashton Kutcher]], with [[Josh Gad]] as [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]]. ''Jobs'' was chosen to close the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="sundance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |title=2013 Sundance Film Festival Announces Films in Premieres and Documentary Premieres |work=Sundance.org |publisher=Sundance Institute |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222004405/http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-films-in-premieres-and-documentary-pr/ |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/28/sundance-festival-jobs-first-look-review |title=Sundance film festival 2013: Jobs – first look review |date=January 28, 2013 |last=Gibbs |first=Ed |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens in 2001 with a middle-aged [[Steve Jobs]] ([[Ashton Kutcher]]) introducing the [[iPod]] at an Apple Town Hall meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everystevejobsvideo.com/original-ipod-introduction-apple-special-event-2001/|title=Original iPod introduction – Apple Special Event (2001)|last=|first=|date=|website=EverySteveJobsVideo|access-date=2017-10-09|quote=October 2001 (Location: Apple Town Hall). Steve was 46 years old.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It then flashes back to [[Reed College]] in 1974. Jobs had already dropped out due to the high expense of tuition, but was still attending classes with the approval of Dean Jack Dudman ([[James Woods]]) who took him under his wing. Jobs is particularly interested in a course on calligraphy. He meets up with his friend [[Daniel Kottke]] ([[Lukas Haas]]) who is excited to see that Jobs is holding a copy of [[Be Here Now (book)|''Be Here Now'']]'' ''by [[Ram Dass|Baba Ram Dass]]. Influenced by this book and his experiences with [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], Jobs and Kottke spend time in [[Hippie trail|India]].

Two years later, Jobs is back in [[Los Altos, California]] living at home with his adoptive parents Paul ([[John Getz]]) and Clara ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]). He is working for [[Atari]] and develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there already is a company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak then teases Jobs that this is symbolic of his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them, Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage (set up as a carpentry/tool center) for his new company. Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone, Jobs also recruits Kottke, [[Bill Fernandez]] ([[Victor Rasuk]]), and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

Terrell, however, is disappointed by the Apple I, a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the [[Apple II]]. In addition, after many failed attempts, Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist, [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), who also joins Apple. They release the Apple II at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success. Suddenly Jobs and the company are very successful.

The success also causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends and his high school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]). When Brennan tells him she is pregnant with their child, he promptly ends their relationship. Brennan eventually gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs continues to deny as his daughter. He also brings in [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) to become the CEO of the company. As his behavior becomes more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved away from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces the original team leader of the Macintosh group, [[Jef Raskin]], out of it. Though the Macintosh is introduced with a great deal of fanfare in 1984, Jobs is forced out of the company by Sculley in 1985.

The film jumps forward to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running the company [[NeXT]] which Apple decides to buy. He is asked by then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs does so and soon he is named the new CEO, ultimately firing Amelio and his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jony Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and works to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there are original photos of all the main characters paired with clips from the film of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.

===Development===
[[File:Jobsmovie Los Altos.JPG|thumb|Crew filming ''Jobs'' at Steve Jobs' childhood home in [[Los Altos, California]].]]
Screenwriter Matt Whiteley began work on the screenplay around the time Steve Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name=mercurynews/&gt; Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mark Hulme, our producer, had an expert team of researchers to comb through all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs. Mark, the screenwriter and the research team, also took it upon themselves to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film's length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bohemianrhapsodyclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/0/0/4/7004357/jobs_production_notes.pdf|title=Q&amp;A with JOBS director, Joshua Michael Stern|date=|author=|publisher=MELBOURNE PUBLICITY|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We shot near the [[Red Fort]] and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere.

==Release==
The ''Business Insider'' described the film's opening as a [[box office flop]], earning $6.7 million in its first weekend and placed seventh overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-movie-bombed-2013-8 |title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Movie Bombed |publisher=Business Insider |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[E! Online]]'' said, "Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition, marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Loinaz | first=Alexis L. | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/449465/jobs-reviews-are-in-ashton-kutcher-s-steve-jobs-homage-not-quite-the-apple-of-critics-eyes|title=''Jobs'' Reviews Are In: Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs Homage Not Quite the Apple of Critics' Eyes | work=[[E!

The website's critical consensus reads, "An ambitious but skin-deep portrait of an influential, complex figure, ''Jobs'' often has the feel of an over-sentimentalized made-for-TV biopic."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobs (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jobs_2013/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 44 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jobs|title=Jobs Reviews|accessdate=June 26, 2013|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert X. Cringely]], author of ''[[Accidental Empires]]'' and creator of the documentaries ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'' and ''[[Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview]]'', argues that "the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher's portrayal of Jobs, while not spot-on, is pretty darned good. He certainly has the look down and the walk. But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he's definitely a better actor than producer. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don't have to be there. ... The great failing of this film is the same failing as with [[Steve Jobs (book)|Walter Isaacson's book]]: something happened during Steve's [[NeXT]] years (which occupy less than 60 seconds of this 122 minute film) that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader, but they don't bother to cover that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cringely.com/2013/08/19/ashton-kutchers-steve-jobs-somehow-misses-the-whole-point/|title=Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs somehow misses the whole point|date=August 19, 2013|website=cringely.com|last=Cringely|first=Robert X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' states that "at its best, it's a good picture, and at its worst, it's almost good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Jobs-review-Kutcher-s-fine-but-film-s-timing-4735382.php|title=''Jobs'' review: Kutcher's fine, but film's timing is off|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' suggests that "Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism. It's a quietly dazzling performance" but also notes that "''Jobs'' is a one-man show that needed to go for broke and doesn't. My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/jobs-20130815|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=''Jobs''|first=Peter|last=Travers|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributor for [[Roger Ebert|rogerebert.com]], Susan Wloszczyna, gave the movie 2/4 stars, saying that, "Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business-model gospel according to [[Apple Inc.]] guru Steve Jobs and – more importantly – what it says about our culture, the filmmakers follow the easy rise-fall-rise-again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH1's ''Behind the Music''."&lt;ref name=RogerE&gt;{{cite web|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Jobs|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jobs-2013|publisher=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further discusses how Kutcher's performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs' passing. In a movie review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer [[Manohla Dargis]] writes that ''Jobs'' was "inevitably unsatisfying"&lt;ref name="New York Times Movie Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=Portrait of the Artist Behind Apple Ashton Kutcher in a Biopic About Steve Jobs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/movies/ashton-kutcher-in-a-biopic-about-steve-jobs.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves.

==Historical Accuracy==
In a January 2013 interview with ''[[The Verge]]'', [[Steve Wozniak]] notes that he was approached by the crew of ''Jobs'' and given an early script to read. He read it as far as he "could stomach it and felt it was crap. [[Steve Jobs (film)|The Sony people]] got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them. You can't do both [films] and be paid."&lt;ref name=vergejan/&gt; At around the same time, he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on ''[[Gizmodo]]'' by stating that the "personalities are very wrong, although mine is closer ... our relationship was so different than what was portrayed."&lt;ref name="vergejan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Ross|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/26/3919472/steve-wozniak-turned-down-offer-to-work-on-jobs-after-reading-early-script/in/2794100|title=Steve Wozniak turned down offer to work on ''Jobs'' after reading early script: 'I felt it was crap'|work=[[The Verge]]|date=January 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, before the wide release of the film, Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews. In an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Kutcher stated that: "Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film. It's personal for him, but it's also business. We have to keep that in mind. He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film. He's a brilliant man and I respect his work, but he wasn't available to us as a resource, so his account isn't going to be our account because we don't know exactly what it was. We did the best job we could. Nobody really knows what happened in the rooms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/qanda-ashton-kutcher-talks-about-becoming-apple-co-founder-steve-jobs/2013/08/13/46587d3e-041c-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html|title=Q&amp;A: Ashton Kutcher talks about becoming Apple co-founder Steve Jobs|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Washington Post|date=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated this point in an interview with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' by stating that Wozniak "is being paid by another movie studio to help support their Steve Jobs film, so he's gonna have an opinion that is connected to that, somewhat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlson|first=Erin|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jobs-ashton-kutcher-responds-steve-602679|title=''Jobs'': Ashton Kutcher Responds to Steve Wozniak's Criticism of Film (Video)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak responded to Kutcher's comments as well as to the film itself on ''Gizmodo'' by stating that "either film would have paid me to consult, but the ''Jobs ''one already had a script written. I can't take that creative leadership from someone else. And I was turned off by the ''Jobs'' script. But I still hoped for a great movie." He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately and/or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wozniak|first=Steve|url=https://gizmodo.com/jobs-reviewed-by-steve-wozniak-1153771108|title=''Jobs'', Reviewed by Steve Wozniak|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with [[Bloomberg Television]] adding that he is "really easy to get a hold of, [Kutcher] could have called me and consulted over the phone any time."&lt;ref name=vergaug17/&gt; ''The Verge'' noted that "Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film, but declined after reading the script, saying he and his wife were 'abhorred' by it. Wozniak was a consultant on [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s [[Steve Jobs (film)|2015 ''Steve Jobs'' film]]. When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw, Wozniak said, 'I have a very busy life, and it came at a very busy time in my life.'"&lt;ref name="vergaug17"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toor|first=Amar|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/17/4630596/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-movie-ashton-kutcher|title=Steve Wozniak says 'there were a lot of things wrong' with ''Jobs'' movie|work=[[The Verge]]|date=August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Slashdot]]'', [[Daniel Kottke]] states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that "Ashton's very good. I have no complaints with him at all, no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs. The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs, which is really unfair." He also said that the early versions of the screenplay "were painful. Really painful. I forwarded the first draft to [[Mike Markkula]] because they wanted his feedback, and Mike took such a bad reaction to it, he wouldn't have anything more to do with the project. By the time it got to the fourth draft, it was okay. It wasn't making me cringe."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film. [[Bill Fernandez]] was part of the same interview but states that he didn't see the film because "the whole thing is a work of fiction, and I don't want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don't represent the truth." Kottke responded that he didn't think of the film as fiction because "I was involved early on in the film, and they really, sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could."&lt;ref name="slashdot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Assar|first=Vijith|url=http://insights.dice.com/2013/08/16/early-apple-employees-talk-memories-of-steve-jobs-new-movie-2/|title='Early Apple Employees Talk Memories of Steve Jobs, New Movie| work=[[Slashdot]]|date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same interview, Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of [[Rod Holt]] (portrayed by actor [[Ron Eldard]]). Kottke disputed the characterization, noting that: "What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time. Rod comes up wearing leathers, riding up on a motorcycle with long hair ... he's like this motorcycle dude. It just cracked us all up."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who had not seen the film at the time of the interview, was also surprised by this portrayal. Holt, however, (according to Kottke), "thought it was hilarious."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; As for why he may have been characterized this way, Kottke states that, "Rod was really into dirt bikes. And I never saw him riding one, but he talked about it all the time. So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle. I liked that guy. I met him on the set. I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn't look at all like Rod, he has long straight hair and he's wearing leathers."&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt; Fernandez, who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking, "Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe? ... It seems to me that there's a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there's been to date.
&lt;ref name=slashdot/&gt;

[[Chris Espinosa]] stated on Twitter, "FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the #JobsMovie with the press or public. But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/cdespinosa/status/368618820409126914 Chris Espinosa@Twitter]. August 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV show ''[[John Wants Answers]]'' took Wozniak, Kottke, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred.&lt;ref name="johnwants"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vink|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gICwMQQ48Dk|title=The Cast of ''Jobs''|work=[[John Wants Answers]]|publisher=KMVT 15|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathryn "Kathy" Keeton''' (February 17, 1939&amp;nbsp;– September 19, 1997) was a [[magazine]] [[publisher]] along with her partner, and later husband, ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' publisher [[Bob Guccione]].

==Early life and show business career==
Born in South Africa and raised on a farm, Keeton took up dancing in childhood to strengthen a leg affected by [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. She won a scholarship to the [[Sadler's Wells Ballet]] in London, but left after she turned 18 to work in a [[nightclub]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra |last=Wesley |title=Editor Kathy Keeton sells the naked truth |newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |date=May 6, 1974 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in [[bit part]]s in four British movies: ''[[Carlton-Browne of the F.O.]]'' (1959) (as a tabletop dancer), ''[[Expresso Bongo]]'' (1959), ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (film)|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1965) (as a [[stripper]]). At the age of 24 she was what The Associated Press called "one of the highest-paid strippers in Europe".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/23/business/kathy-keeton-guccione-58-president-of-magazine-company.html |first=Robin |last=Pogrebin |title=Kathy Keeton Guccione, 58, President of Magazine Company |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 23, 1997 |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing career==
She met Bob Guccione in 1965 and they remained together, although they did not marry until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=W. Patrick |last=McCray |title=The Visioneers |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2013 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publishing company her title was President/Chief Operating Officer of General Media Communications, Inc.  She founded the magazines ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'' (1973), ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'' (1978), and ''[[Longevity (magazine)|Longevity]]'' (1989). She also wrote two non-fiction books, ''Woman of Tomorrow'' (1986) and ''Longevity: The Science of Staying Young'' (1992). She was [[plaintiff]] in the landmark [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Libel and the First Amendment: Legal History and Practice in Print and Broadcasting |first=Richard |last=Labunski |publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]] |date=1987 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==
After her diagnosis with [[breast cancer]], Keeton treated herself with [[hydrazine sulfate]], after reading about it in ''Penthouse'', one of her own publications. She claimed that she had rid herself of or shrunk almost all of the tumors and extended her life by several years, after being given a dire initial prognosis of only six weeks to live by her doctors.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Vine |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110889259.html |title=Is This Cancer Drug Too Cheap for Its Own Good? |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=September 10, 1996 |via=Highbeam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=William M. |last=London |url=http://www.cancertreatmentwatch.org/reports/hydrazine.shtml |title=Penthouse's Promotion of Hydrazine Sulfate |publisher=Cancer Treatment Watch |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeton died of [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] from surgery for an [[intestinal obstruction]], aged 58, in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;  Keeton was buried at "The Willows" (now known as [[Locusts on Hudson]]) in [[Staatsburg, New York]], the country home she shared with her husband.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2709">'''Manfred Rein''' (19 December 1948, [[Dornbirn]], [[Austria]] – 22 April 2016, [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]], Austria&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Reiner: ''[http://www.vol.at/wkv-praesident-manfred-rein-verstorben/4697956 „WKV-Präsident Manfred Rein verstorben“]'', Vorarlberg Online (VOL.at), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;) was an Austrian politician for the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) and president of the Economic Chamber of [[Vorarlberg]].

== Life ==
After completing grammar school in his hometown of Dornbirn, Rein went to the Handelsschule in Feldkirch. Subsequently, he completed studying as a tiler, which he completed in 1971. In 1976, he passed the master's examination for plate tiler and in 1980 founded his own company in Dornbirn.

He was married and lived with his wife as well as a son and a daughter in Dornbirn.

== Politics ==
From 1980 to 1994, Rein was a member of the Dornbirn City Council for the Austrian People's Party. From 1985 to 1994, he was also city councilor in Dornbirn. From 1995 until the end of 2008, he worked as a provincial councilor in the Vorarlberg state government. He was responsible for the areas of general economic affairs (economic and transport policy), economic law (business and water law), spatial planning and construction law, housing promotion, and traffic law and road construction.

On 20 November 2008, Rein was appointed by the General Assembly of the Vorarlberg branch of the [[Austrian Federal Economic Chamber]] as the successor of the President of the Federal Economic Chamber, Kuno Riedmann. His successor as provincial councilor in the state government became [[Karlheinz Rüdisser]].&lt;ref name="Wirtschaftskammerpräsidentenwahl"&gt;ORF Vorarlberg: ''[http://vorarlberg.orf.at/stories/323527/ Rein neuer Wirtschaftskammer-Präsident]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the Landtag meeting on 10 December 2008, Rein resigned from office as provincial councilor and on the following day took his new position as President of the Federal Economic Chamber. He held this office until his death in 2016.&lt;ref name="Wahl Rüdisser"&gt;[http://presse.vorarlberg.at/land/dist/vlk.html?id=28805 Presseaussendung] des Amts der Vorarlberger Landesregierung zur Angelobung von Karlheinz Rüdisser.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as chairman of the Vorarlberg branch of the ÖVP sub-organization Österreichische Wirtschaftsbund.

'''Michel Antoine Gaston Esteban''' (born 7 May 1951) is a French [[record producer]], [[record label|record company executive]], [[cultural center]] director and former [[magazine editor]], who founded the Paris shop Harry Cover in 1973, was influential in the early development of [[punk rock]], and, together with [[Michael Zilkha]], established the [[New York City|New York]]-based [[record label]] [[ZE Records]] in 1978.

== Life and career==
Esteban was born in Paris. From 1968, he studied [[graphic arts]] at L'École d'Arts Graphiques in the city, and in 1973 founded a shop in the [[Les Halles|Rue des Halles]], Harry Cover, which specialised in [[rock music|rock]] merchandise, magazines and books as well as imported records from the US and UK.  The basement was used as a rehearsal space by bands, particularly as the [[punk rock]] scene developed in the mid 1970s.  In 1974 Esteban travelled around the US, returning to New York where he studied under [[Milton Glaser]] at the [[School of Visual Arts]].  He became a friend of [[Patti Smith]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Richard Hell]] and [[Tom Verlaine]] of [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[John Cale]], and was a regular visitor to the [[CBGB]] music club.&lt;ref name=ink&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_3.php INK 19: Interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210724/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_3.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=strangedays&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_1.php ''Strange Days'' magazine: interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210655/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_1.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Returning to Paris in 1975, he founded the magazine ''Rock News'', which began chronicling the emergence of the punk music scene in the US, UK and France, coming into contact with [[Lester Bangs]], Richard and Lisa Robinson, and [[Danny Fields]] in the US, and [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]] in England.&lt;ref name=ink/&gt;  Together with then-girlfriend [[Lizzy Mercier Descloux]],&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt; he attended many of the early punk performances in [[England]], and published Mercier Descloux's first book of poems, ''Desiderata'', as well as Patti Smith's ''[[Witt (book)|Witt]]'' and ''The Night''.  He helped promote the first punk rock concerts in France, with the [[Sex Pistols]] in September 1976, and promoted the French band [[Stinky Toys]] in England.

In 1977, Esteban shared his time between Paris and New York, forming Rebel Records and recording French band [[Marie &amp; les Garçons]].  In New York, he worked with John Cale, who introduced him to British-born entrepreneur and writer [[Michael Zilkha]].  They set up Cale's record label, SPY, before Esteban and Zilkha left to set up another label, [[ZE Records]].&lt;ref name=vman&gt;[http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_2.php VMAN magazine: John Norris: interview with Michel Esteban, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916210703/http://www.zerecords.com/2010/about_interview_2.php |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, Esteban was in a relationship with fashion editor [[Anna Wintour]].&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt; Over the next four years, ZE became one of the most influential and fashionable record labels in the world, recording such artists as [[Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts]], [[Was (Not Was)]], [[Bill Laswell]], [[Lydia Lunch]], and [[Suicide]], and bringing together aspects of punk rock, the art of the [[Lower East Side]] such as [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] and [[Keith Haring]], and the disco scene.&lt;ref name=vman/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/5978110/Mutant-disco-from-planet-ZE.html  Thomas H Green, "Mutant disco from planet ZE", ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 August 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Esteban left New York after differences with Zilkha in 1982.&lt;ref name=ink/&gt;   In 1983 he produced the album ''Paolino Parc'' by French [[New wave music|new wave]] band Octobre.  He also continued to work closely with Lizzy Mercier Descloux, visiting, recording and undertaking promotional work in Asia, Africa, and South America.  He produced her successful single "Mais où sont passées les gazelles?", and the albums ''Lizzy Mercier Descloux'' (1984) and ''One For The Soul'' (1986). In 1986, he began working with the Portuguese-born Belgian singer [[Lio]], producing her albums ''Pop Model'' (1986) and ''Cancan'' (1988); their daughter was born in 1987 but they separated in 1989.&lt;ref name=strangedays/&gt;

During the 1990s, Esteban retreated from the music business and studied esoteric disciplines including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Sufism]].  Later in the decade he recorded musicians in [[Cuba]].  In 2003 he re-established ZE Records, based in Paris, which has reissued many of the label's original recordings as well as new material, including [[Glasgow]] band Michael Dracula.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;  He now lives in [[Salvador da Bahia]], Brazil, where he has a cultural arts center project including galleries and recording studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://en-afabrica.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A Mokken scale is a unidimensional scale that consists of hierarchically-ordered items that measure the same underlying, latent concept.

Mokken scaling belongs to [[Item response theory]]. In essence, a Mokken scale is a non-parametric, probabilistic version of [[Guttman scale]]. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling can be used to assess whether a number of items measure the same underlying concept. Both Guttman and Mokken scaling are based on the assumption that the items are hierarchically ordered: this means that they are ordered by degree of "difficulty". Difficulty here means the percentage of respondents that answers the question affirmatively. The hierarchical order means that a respondent who answered a difficult question correctly is assumed to answer an easy question correctly.&lt;ref name="Crichton"&gt;Crichton, N. (1999) "Mokken Scale Analysis" ''Journal of Clinical Nursing 8, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
The key difference between a Guttman and Mokken scale is that Mokken scaling is probabilistic in nature. The assumption is not that ''every'' respondent who answered a difficult question affirmatively will ''necessarily'' answer an easy question affirmatively. Violations of this are called Guttman errors. Instead, the assumption is that respondents who answered a difficult question affirmatively are more ''likely'' to answer an easy question affirmatively. The scalability of the scale is measured by Loevinger's coefficient H. H compares the actual Guttman errors to the expected number of errors if the items would be unrelated.&lt;ref name="Crichton"/&gt;

The chance that a respondent will answer an item correctly is described by an item response function. Mokken scales are similar to [[Rasch model|Rasch scales]], in that they both adapted Guttman scales to a probabilistic model. However, Mokken scaling is described as 'non-parametric' because it makes no assumptions about the precise shape of the item response function, only that it is monotone and non-decreasing. The key difference between Mokken scales and Rasch scales is that the latter assumes that all items have the same item response function. In Mokken scaling the Item Response Functions differ for different items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

Mokken scales can come in two forms: first as the Double Monotonicity model, where the items can differ in their difficulty. It is essentially, is an ordinal version of Rasch scale; and second, as the Monotone Homogeneity model, where items differ in their discrimination parameter, which means that there can be a weaker relationship between some items and the latent variable and other items and the latent variable.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt; Double Monotonicity models are used most often.

Double Monotonicity models are based on three assumptions.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;
# There is a unidimensional latent trait on which subject and items can be ordered.
# The item response function is monotonically nondecreasing. This means that as one moves from one side of the latent variable to the other, the chance of giving a positive response should never decrease.
# The items are locally stochastically independent: this means that responses to any two items by the same respondent should not be the function any other aspect of the respondent or the item, but his or her position on the latent trait.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken/&gt;

The issue of sample size for Mokken scaling is largely unresolved. Work using simulated samples and varying the item quality in the scales (Loevinger's coefficient and the correlation between scales) suggests that, where the quality of the items is high that lower samples sizes in the region of 250-500 are required compared with sample sizes of 1250-1750 where the item quality is low.&lt;ref name="Straat"/&gt; Using real data from the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well Being Scale (WEMWBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentalhealthpromotion.net/resources/user-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the required sample size depends on the Mokken scaling parameters of interest as they do not all respond in the same way to varying sample size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/21642850.2018.1505520|title = What are the minimal sample size requirements for Mokken scaling? An empirical example with the Warwick- Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale| journal=Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine| volume=6| pages=203–213|year = 2018|last1 = Watson|first1 = Roger| last2=Egberink| first2=Iris J. L.| last3=Kirke| first3=Lisa| last4=Tendeiro| first4=Jorge N.| last5=Doyle| first5=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions ==

While Mokken scaling analysis was originally developed to measure the extent to which individual dichotomous items form a scale, it has since been extended for polytomous items.&lt;ref name=vanschuur2003mokken&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Schuur|first1=Wijbrandt|title=Mokken scale analysis: Between the Guttman scale and parametric item response theory|journal=Political Analysis|date=2003|volume=11|issue=2|pages=139–163|url=http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/11/2/139.short|doi=10.1093/pan/mpg002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while Mokken scaling analysis is a confirmatory method, meant to test whether a number of items form a coherent scale (like [[Confirmatory factor analysis]]), an Automatic Item Selection Procedure has been developed to explore which latent dimensions structure responses on a number of observable items (like [[Factor analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = van der Ark | first1 = L.A. (Andries) | year = 2012 | title = New Developments in Mokken Scale Analysis in R | url = | journal = Journal of Statistical Software | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | doi=10.18637/jss.v048.i05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some confusion in Mokken scaling between the concepts of Double Monotonicity model and invariant item ordering. The latter implies that all respondents to a series of questions all respond to them in the same order across the whole range of the latent trait.

Often bi-functional [[silane]]s are used in which one termination of the molecule is reactive. For example, a functional [[chlorosilane]] (R-Si-Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can react with surface [[hydroxyl]] groups (-OH) resulting a radicalized (R) deposition on the surface. The advantage of a gas phase reaction over a comparable liquid phase process is the control of moisture from the ambient environment, which often results in cross polymerization of the silane leading to particulates on the treated surface. Often a heated sub-atmospheric vacuum chamber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insurftech.com/products_rgm210.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115041017/http://www.insurftech.com/products_rgm210.html |archivedate=2015-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to allow precise control of the reactants and water content. Additionally the gas phase process allows for easy treatment of complex parts since the coverage of the reactant is generally diffusion limited. Microelectromechanical Systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) sensors often use molecular vapor deposition as a technique to address [[stiction]] and other parasitic issues relative to surface-to-surface interactions.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Muda'''''|[[wikt:無駄|無駄]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "futility; uselessness; wastefulness",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', 5th edition, 2003, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2530.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in [[Lean manufacturing|lean process thinking]], like the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of deviation from optimal allocation of resources (the others being ''[[mura (Japanese term)|mura]]'' and ''[[muri (Japanese term)|muri]]'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste reduction]] is an effective way to increase profitability. 

From an end-customer's point of view, value-added work is any activity that produces goods or provides a service for which a customer is willing to pay; ''muda'' is any constraint or impediment that causes waste to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kato |first1=Isao  |authorlink1=Isao Kato |last2=Smalley |first2=Art |authorlink2=Art Smalley |date=2011 |title=Toyota Kaizen Methods: Six Steps to Improvement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of muda:&lt;ref&gt;Lean Enterprise Institute, [https://www.lean.org/lexicon/waste Waste], accessed 3 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Muda Type I''': non value-adding, but necessary for end-customers. These are usually harder to eliminate because while classified as non-value adding, they may still be necessary. For example, while an end-customer might not view quality inspection in car assembly as value-adding, it is necessary to ensure the car meets safety standards.
* '''Muda Type II''': non value-adding and unnecessary for end-customers. These contribute to waste, incur hidden costs, and should be eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sayer |first1=Natalie |last2=Williams |first2=Bruce |date=2012 |title=Lean For Dummies 2nd Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The seven forms of waste==
One of the key steps in lean process and TPS is to identify which activities add value and which do not, then to progressively work to improve or eliminate them. 

[[Taiichi Ohno]], "father" of the Toyota Production System, originally identified seven forms of ''muda'' or waste:&lt;ref&gt;Ohno, T. (1988), ''Toyota Production System: Beyond Large Scale Production'', Productivity Press, Portland, Oregon&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Different kinds of waste in lean manufacturing.png|7 types of waste identified in lean manufacturing]]

Later, an eighth waste, unused skills, was added.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

A mnemonic may be useful for remembering the categories of waste, such as TIM WOOD or TIM WOODS:&lt;ref&gt;Phillips Healthcare Ultrasound Division. "Gemba Tour: Come and see for yourself." 2016. Pamphlet distributed by Philips Ultrasound Factory in Bothell, WA.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==={{font color|red|T}}ransportation===
Every time a product is touched or moved unnecessarily there is a risk that it could be damaged, lost, delayed, etc. as well as being a cost for no added value. Transportation does not add value to the product, i.e. is not a transformation for which the consumer is willing to pay.

==={{font color|red|I}}nventory===
Whether in the form of raw materials, [[Work in process|work-in-progress]] (WIP), or finished goods, represents a capital outlay that cannot yet produce an income. The longer a product sits in one of these states, the more it contributes to waste. The smooth, continuous flow of work through each process ensures excess amounts of inventory are minimized. 

==={{font color|red|M}}otion===
In contrast to transportation, which refers to damage and transaction costs associated with moving the product, motion refers to the damage and costs inflicted on what creates the product. This can include [[wear and tear]] for equipment, [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive strain injuries]] for workers, or unnecessary downtime.

==={{font color|red|W}}aiting===
Whenever the product is not in transportation or being processed, it is waiting (typically in a queue). In traditional processes, a large part of an individual product's life is spent waiting to be worked on. 

==={{font color|red|O}}ver-production===
Making more of a product than is required results in several forms of waste, typically caused by production in large batches. The customer's needs often change over the time it takes to produce a larger batch. Over-production has been described as the worst kind of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consulting-xp.com/blog/?p=546|title=Why is Overproduction the Worst Muda? |publisher=XP Consulting|work=Le BLOG|date=4 January 2015|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{font color|red|O}}ver-processing===
Doing more to a product than is required by the end-customer results in it taking longer and costing more to produce. This also includes using components that are more precise, complex, expensive or higher quality than absolutely required.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

==={{font color|red|D}}efects===
Having to discard or rework a product due to earlier defective work or components results in additional cost and delays.

==Unused skills==
Organizations often under-utilize the skills their workers have or permit workers to operate in silos so that knowledge is not shared. This was added to the original seven forms of waste, as resolving this waste is a key enabler to resolving the others.&lt;ref&gt;Liker (2004) - The Toyota Way (p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative forms of waste==
The eight forms of waste were developed for Toyota specific processes. Companies have further identified such other forms of waste as:{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Confusion ===
{{Main|Confusion}}
General uncertainty about the right thing to do, or absence of documented procedures and operating statements.

===Self-doubt===
Writer [[James P. Womack|Jim Womack]] described "thinking you can't" as the worst form of waste, quoting [[Henry Ford]]'s [[aphorism]]:
:''Henry Ford probably said it best when he noted, "You can think you can achieve something or you can think you can't and you will be right.''&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J., [https://www.lean.org/womack/DisplayObject.cfm?o=763 The Worst Form of Muda], published 14 August 2008, accessed 3 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[Shigeo Shingo]] divides process related activity into Process and Operation.&lt;ref&gt;A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Productivity Press, 1989, p xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguishes "Process", the course of material that is transformed into product, from "Operation" which are the actions performed on the material by workers and machines. This distinction is not generally recognized because most people would view the "Operations" performed on the raw materials of a product by workers and machines as the "Process" by which those raw materials are transformed into the final product. He makes this distinction because value is added to the product by the process but not by most of the operations. He states that whereas many see Process and Operations in parallel he sees them at right angles (orthogonal) (see [[Value Stream Mapping]]). This starkly throws most of the operations into the waste category.

Many of the TPS/Lean techniques work in a similar way. By planning to reduce manpower, or reduce change-over times, or reduce campaign lengths, or reduce lot sizes the question of waste comes immediately into focus upon those elements that prevent the plan being implemented. Often it is in the operations' area rather than the process area that muda can be eliminated and remove the blockage to the plan. Tools of many types and methodologies can then be employed on these wastes to reduce or eliminate them.

The plan is therefore to build a fast, flexible process where the immediate impact is to reduce waste and therefore costs. By ratcheting the process towards this aim with focused muda reduction to achieve each step, the improvements are 'locked in' and become required for the process to function. Without this intent to build a fast, flexible process there is a significant danger that any improvements achieved will not be sustained because they are ''just'' desirable and can slip back towards old behaviours without the process stopping.

The word was brought across cultures as the "catchword" of [[Dio Brando]], a central antagonist from the popular, long running manga series [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]. The word would go on to be repeated rapidly as the stand cry of Dio and later his son, Giorno Giovanna.

Prince Muhammed memorized parts of the Quran. He studied and graduated from the Princes School with his older brothers. He then went to Europe to study English and French. Prince Muhammed is from the eldest generation of King Abdulaziz's family. King Saud relied on him on many tasks regarding the independence of the Arab countries.

==Career==
During the reign of his father, King Saud, Prince Muhammed held many governmental positions. He began his service as the chief of the Royal Court.&lt;ref name=ssabri/&gt; Then he was appointed the [[Saudi Royal Guard Regiment]] in 1953.&lt;ref name=stig/&gt; Later, he was appointed the minister of defense and inspector general in December 1960 succeeding his brother Fahd bin Saud in the post.&lt;ref name=rslf/&gt; His tenure ended on 31 October 1962.&lt;ref name=rslf&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Forces History|url=http://rslf.gov.sa/English/aboutus/pages/overview.aspx|work=Royal Saudi Land Forces|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, was a Minister of Finance and stayed for only six days.

'''Partner relationship management (PRM)''' is a system of methodologies, strategies, [[software]], and [[web-based]] capabilities that help a [[vendor]] to manage [[Business partner|partner relationships]]. The general purpose of PRM is to enable vendors to better manage their partners through the introduction of reliable systems, processes and procedures for interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svcawards.com/files/Forrester%20Wave%20PRM%20Q4%202013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/sales-focused-partner-relationship-management-prm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/partner-relationship-management&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based PRM systems typically include a [[Content Management System]], a partner and customer contact database, and the notion of a partner portal which allows partners to log in and interact with a [[vendor]]'s sales opportunity database and obtain product, pricing, and training information. There are a number of solution providers who offer PRM software companies who rely heavily on a PRM solution to stay relevant in their respective industries.

Vendors who implement a PRM solution are typically motivated by a need to reduce the financial overhead and establish new partnerships to drive channel revenue and scale.  Partners may also be integrators or managed service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.compubase.net/Partners-Resellers-ISVs-MSPs-Integrators-lists-for-business_a272.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike [[Customer relationship management|CRM]] systems, which are tailored toward getting an end customer to purchase from you, a PRM system is focused on getting a partner to sell on your behalf.  As a result, they commonly offer web-based self-service tools, information, and resources to partner resellers. Tools often include:
* [[Market development funds|MDF]] Request Programs
* Training, [[Certification]], and [[Accreditation]] Automation
* [[Qualified prospect|Deal]] Registration Programs
* Indirect [[Sales process|Sales Pipeline]] Reporting
* Joint [[Business Plan]]ning
* [[Bounty (reward)|Reward]] and [[Loyalty Program]]s
* [[Digital library|Content Library]]

==Trends==

Gartner reports that PRM solutions have mainly been adopted by companies in the hardware technology, software technology, telecommunication, and manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The PRM application market has expanded significantly in the last 10 years, with vendors offering improved end-to-end and point solutions for the management of channel sales partners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gartner.com/technology/media-products/newsletters/impartner/1-34MYI19/gartner.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18067">A '''press pass''' (alternatively referred to as a '''press card''' or a '''journalist pass''') grants some type of special privilege to [[journalist]]s.  Some cards have recognized [[legal]] status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist.  The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: [[news organization]]s, [[police|law-enforcement agencies]], and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate [[press conference]]).  Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Photos"&gt;{{cite web

==Law-enforcement cards==
[[Image:MRpresspass.jpg|thumb|right|A Denver press pass.]]
Police departments at a [[city]], [[county]], or [[State (country subdivision)|state/provincial]] level may issue press passes in some countries.&lt;ref name="Photos"/&gt;  Such passes allow the bearer to cross police or fire lines to report [[breaking news]], or grant access to [[crime scene]]s or other restricted areas&lt;ref name="SFPD"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;– though admission may be denied if it would interfere with the duties of emergency personnel. Popular media of the mid-20th century often depicted reporters at a crime scene with their press passes tucked into their [[hat band]]s, which was unusual in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CzwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=or4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2437%2C1843017|title=Press card – ticket into harm's way|last=McDonnell|first=Pat J.|date=July 21, 1982|work=Evening Herald|page=4|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=Rock Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the exceptional dispensation endowed by police press passes, they are issued with discretion–some jurisdictions require an in-person [[interview]] with all prospective applicants, complete set of fingerprints, and a background check.&lt;ref name="Gothamist"&gt;{{cite web

Police-issued passes do not grant access to government press conferences or any other such privileges: they are only recognized by emergency response personnel, and only valid within the jurisdiction of the issuing agencies.&lt;ref name="SFPD"/&gt;

===Parking permits===
Police [[parking]] permits, issued in some jurisdictions, exempt news vehicles from certain [[Parking violation|parking restrictions]] while on the job.  They may be offered to any news-gathering organization that covers breaking news for use in company vehicles employed by full-time reporters, photographers, and camera operators. Often, these permits are only granted to journalists who already carry a police press card.

When conspicuously displayed, these permits may allow the bearer to park in restricted "[[Residential zoned parking|resident-only]]" parking zones, and may exempt him or her from [[Parking meter|parking-meter]] costs. These privileges apply only for the duration of breaking-news coverage, and do not nullify all parking restrictions: red zones, [[fire hydrant]]s, [[crosswalk]]s, [[Bus stop|bus zones]], [[Disabled parking permit|disabled parking]] zones or access ramps, commercial loading zones, [[taxi cab]] zones, "no stopping" or "no parking" zones, transit lanes, and other towaway zones are still off-limits.&lt;ref name="SFPD"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many events publicity in [[Mass media|news media]] and elsewhere is of great importance, and granting privileges to the press can help in this. The privileges granted to holders of press badges, and who is eligible to receive them, depends on the nature of the affair.

===Open events===
[[File:Bryan1900press.JPG|thumb|1900 press pass to a [[William Jennings Bryan]] speech]]

===Closed events===
For events closed to the general public, police- or news organization-issued press passes sometimes grant access, but almost all require advance application for admittance.  Greater exclusivity, however, means more restrictions on potential pass recipients.  For professional conferences or trade shows, passes may be granted only to journalists who regularly cover the industry or who hold a title of "[[industry analyst]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Press Registration| work =| publisher =Cambridge Health Institution| date =| url =http://www.healthtech.com/press.ASP| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5jxfn4LFL?url=http://www.healthtech.com/press.ASP| archivedate =2009-09-21| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or with an editorial or reporting designation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Press Pass Request Form| work =| publisher =Bike Information Association| date =| url =https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf| archive-url =http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081028233108/https://www.diahome.org/DIAHome/AboutDIA/Resources/Docs/DIAPressPassFinal.pdf| dead-url =yes| archive-date =2008-10-28| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization.  As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.

In the United Kingdom, the UK Press Card Authority (a voluntary consortium of news agencies) issues a nationally standardized card to United Kingdom-based news gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =The UK Press Card Authority| work =| publisher =The UK Press Card Authority| date =| url =http://www.presscard.uk.com/| format =| doi =| accessdate =2007-05-07| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5jxg0As3A?url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/press-and-media/press-cards/about-press-cards/| archivedate =2009-09-21| deadurl =yes| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most other European countries, cards are issued by national trade unions of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =How to get a national press card from 28 countries| work =| publisher =Press.Cards| date =| url =http://press.cards/index.php/blog/18-how-to-get-a-national-press-card-from-28-countries| format =| doi =| accessdate =2018-05-14| archiveurl =http://press.cards/index.php/blog/18-how-to-get-a-national-press-card-from-28-countries| archivedate =2018-05-14| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some require membership or government approval.

For [[freelance journalist]]s, organizations like the [[National Writers Union]], [[Professional Publishers Association]] issue cards. 

==Fake cards==
Genuine press cards can be obtained by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists&lt;ref name=cioj/&gt; to rulers).

;Spurious cards
Press passes not issued by a recognised publication can be obtained or made, with the intention of gaining benefits offered to holders of legitimate press cards. Joan Stewart of the [[Public Relations Society of America]] reports, “Fake press passes abound at [[restaurant]] and [[theater]] openings, [[sporting events]], [[concert|music festivals]], [[political rally|political rallies]], celebrity parties and even crime scenes. With a decent [[computer]] and color [[Computer printer|printer]], almost anybody can crank out an official-looking pass within minutes.”&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award''' is the [[List of national quality awards|national quality award]] given by the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] to Indian organisations that show excellence in their performance. It is named after [[Rajiv Gandhi]], the former [[Prime Minister of India]], and was introduced in 1991 after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krajewski|first=Lee J.|title=Operations Management: Processes and Supply Chains|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=8131728846|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rpbFaTkeN4C&amp;lpg=PA202}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award aims to promote quality services to the consumers and to give special recognition to organisations that contribute significantly towards the quality movement of India.&lt;ref name=bis&gt;{{cite web|last=Bureau of Indian Standards |title=Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award |url=http://www.bis.org.in/other/rgnqa_geninfo.htm |publisher=Bureau of Indian Standards |accessdate=9 May 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PRgnKQGZ |archivedate=May 9, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The award is presented annually as per the financial year, and is similar to other national quality awards worldwide like the [[Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award]] of the United States, [[European Quality Award]] of the [[European Union]] and the [[Deming Prize]] of [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=bis/&gt;

==Awards==
The award is presented to organisations in five broad categories: large scale manufacturing, small scale manufacturing, large scale service sector, small scale service sector and best overall. Furthermore, there are 14 commendation certificates for organisations showing excellence in various fields, including but not limited to [[biotechnology]], [[chemicals]], [[electronics]], food and drugs, metallurgy, textiles, jewelry, [[education]], finance, healthcare and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=bis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kakkar|first=Gurudatt|title=Renaissance of HRM; Through Creativity and Quality|date=2009|publisher=Laxmi Publications, Ltd.|isbn=8131807118|pages=89-91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpUayZnpew8C&amp;lpg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the certificated and awards, the winner of Best of All gets a monetary prize of {{INRConvert|500000}}, while the other four awards carry a cash prize of {{INRConvert|200000}}. The commendation certificate carries a financial incentive of {{INRConvert|100000}}.&lt;ref name=bis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14997">{{Competition law}}
In [[competition law]], before deciding whether companies have significant [[market power]] which would justify government intervention, the test of '''small but significant and non-transitory increase in price''' (SSNIP) is used to define the [[relevant market]] in a consistent way.  It is an alternative to [[ad hoc]] determination of the relevant market by arguments about product similarity.

The SSNIP test is crucial in [[competition law]] cases accusing [[abuse of dominance]] and in approving or blocking [[merger]]s.  Competition regulating authorities and other actuators of anti-trust law intend to prevent [[market failure]] caused by [[cartel]], [[oligopoly]], [[monopoly]], or other forms of [[market dominance]].

== History ==

In 1982 the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] Merger Guidelines introduced the SSNIP test as a new method for defining markets and for measuring market power directly. In the [[European Union|EU]] it was used for the first time in the ''Nestlé/Perrier'' case in 1992 and has been officially recognized by the [[European Commission]] in its "Commission's Notice for the Definition of the Relevant Market" in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See Crai International discussion on the issue {{cite web |url=http://www.crai.com/ecp/assets/Modernisation_of_DGIV.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928135805/http://www.crai.com/ecp/assets/Modernisation_of_DGIV.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original concept is believed to have been proposed first in 1959 by economist David Morris Adelman of the [[Aston University]].&lt;ref&gt;See M. A. Adelman, "Economic Aspects of the Bethlehem Opinion," Virginia Law Review, vol. 45 (1959), p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other individuals formulated, apparently independently, similar conceptual approaches during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;See Gregory Werden, "The 1982 Merger Guidelines and the Ascent of the Hypothetical Monopolist Paradigm," Antitrust Law Review, vol. 71 (2003), pp. 253-269.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSNIP approach was implemented by F. M. Scherer in three antitrust cases:  in a 1972 Justice Department attempt to enjoin the merger of Associated Brewing Co. and G. W. Heileman Co., in 1975 during hearings on the U.S. government's monopolization case against [[IBM]], and in a 1981 proceeding precipitated by [[Marathon Oil Company]]'s effort to avert takeover by [[Mobil Oil Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;See F. M. Scherer, "On the Paternity of a Market Delineation Approach," working paper, American Antitrust Institute web site, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scherer also proposed the basic concept underlying SSNIP along with limitations posed by what has come to be known as "the cellophane fallacy" in the second (1980) edition of his industrial organization textbook.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Scherer, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance (1980), p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical retrospectives suggest that early proponents were unaware of other individuals' conceptual proposals.

== Measurement ==

The SSNIP test seeks to identify the smallest [[relevant market]] within which a hypothetical monopolist or cartel could impose a profitable significant increase in price.  The [[relevant market]] consists of a "catalogue" of goods and/or services which are considered [[substitute good|substitutes]] by the customer. Such a catalogue is considered "worth monopolising" if should only one single supplier provided it, that supplier could profitably increase its price without its customers turning away and choosing other goods and services from other suppliers.

The application of the SSNIP test involves interviewing consumers regarding buying decisions and determining whether a hypothetical monopolist or cartel could profit from a price increase of 5% for at least one year (assuming that "the terms of sale of all other products [[ceteris paribus|are held constant]]"). If sufficient numbers of buyers are likely to switch to alternative products and the lost sales would make such price increase unprofitable, then the hypothetical market should not be considered a relevant market for the basis of litigation or regulation.  Therefore, another, larger, basket of products is proposed for a hypothetical monopolist to control and the SSNIP test is performed on that [[relevant market]].

The SSNIP test can be applied by estimating empirically the critical [[elasticity of demand]]. In the case of linear demand information on firms' price cost margins is sufficient for the calculation.  If the pre-merger elasticity of demand exceeds the critical elasticity then the decline in sales arising from the price increase will be sufficiently large to render the price increase unprofitable and the products concerned do not constitute the relevant market.

An alternative method for applying the SSNIP test where demand elasticities cannot be estimated, involves estimating the "critical loss." The critical loss is defined as the maximum sales loss that could be sustained as a result of the price increase without making the price increase unprofitable. Where the likely loss of sales to the hypothetical monopolist (cartel) is less than the Critical Loss, then a 5% price increase would be profitable and the market is defined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/masseyp/term1lecture4.htm The SSNIP Test.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The test consists of observing whether a small increase in price (in the range of 5 to 10 percent) would provoke a significant number of consumers to switch to another product (in fact, substitute product). In other words, it is designed to analyse whether that increase in price would be profitable or if, instead, it would just induce substitution, making it unprofitable.

In general, one uses databases from the firms which may include data on variables such as [[cost]]s, prices, [[revenue]] or sales and over a sufficiently long period (generally over at least two years).

In economic terms, what the SSNIP test does is to calculate the [[elasticity of demand|residual elasticity of demand]] of the firm. That is, how a change in prices by the firm affects its own [[demand]].

=== First phase ===
As an example, let's suppose the following situation for a firm:
* [[Price]] = 10
* [[Sales]] = 1000
* [[Variable cost]] per unit = 5
In this case, the firm would make profits equal to 5000: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Price} \times \mathrm{Sales} - \mathrm{Variable\ cost} \times \mathrm{Sales}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now suppose the firm decides to increase its price by a 10 percent, which would imply that the new price would be 11 (10 percent increase). Suppose that the new situation facing the firm is therefore:
* [[Price]] = 11
* [[Sales]] = 800
* [[Variable cost]] per unit = 5
In this case, the firm would make profits equal to 4800: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Price} \times \mathrm{Sales} - \mathrm{Variable\ cost} \times \mathrm{Sales}&lt;/math&gt;.

As can be seen, such an increase in prices would induce a certain substitution for our hypothetical firm, in fact, 200 units less will be sold. This may be so because some consumers have started to buy a substitute product, the same consumers have bought a smaller quantity of the product given its price increase or maybe because they have stopped from buying that type of product.

If we want to know whether such price increase has been profitable, we should solve the following equation:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Profits} = \mathrm{Price} \times \mathrm{Sales} - \mathrm{Variable\ cost\ per\ unit} \times \mathrm{Sales} = 4800.&lt;/math&gt;

In our example, the increase in price produces too much consumer substitution which is not compensated by the increase in price nor the reduction in costs. Overall, the firm would make less profits (4800 compared to 5000). In other words, there are other substitute products that should be included in the relevant market and the product of the firm does not constitute by itself a separate relevant market. The "market" formed by this only product is not "worth monopolising" as an increase in prices would not be profitable. The investigation should continue by including new products which we may guess are substitutes of the one under investigation.

=== Second phase ===
We already know that the previous product is not by itself a relevant market because there do exist other substitute products. Lets suppose that the previous firm (A) tells us that it considers as competitors the products of B and C. In this case, in the second phase we should include these products to our analysis and repeat the exercise.

The situation can be described as follows:
{| 
| Price A = 10; || Sales A = 1000; || Variable cost per unit A = 5
|-
| Price B = 13; || Sales B = 800; || Variable cost per unit B = 4
|-
| Price C = 9; || Sales C = 1100; || Variable cost per unit C = 4
|}

Given that we want to know if products A, B and C constitute a relevant market, the exercise would consist in supposing that an hypothetical monopolist X would control all three products. In that case, the monopolist would make profits of:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;10 \times 1000 - 5 \times 1000 + 13 \times 800 - 4 \times 800 + 9 \times 1100 - 4 \times 1100 = 17700&lt;/math&gt;

Now suppose that monopolist X decides to increase the price of product A, maintaining the price of B and C constant. Suppose that a 10 percent increase in the price of A provokes the following situation:
{| 
| Price A = 11; || Sales A = 800; || Variable cost per unit A = 5
|-
| Price B = 13; || Sales B = 900; || Variable cost per unit B = 4
|-
| Price C = 9; || Sales C = 1200; || Variable cost per unit C = 4
|}

This means that the price increase of A would provoke that 200 units less of A be sold and instead, 100 more units of B and C will be sold respectively. Given that our hypothetical monopolist controls all three products, its profits will be:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;11 \times 800 - 5 \times 800 + 13 \times 900 - 4 \times 900 + 9 \times 1200 - 4 \times 1200 = 18900&lt;/math&gt;

As can be seen, the monopolist controlling A, B and C would profitably increase the price of A by 10 percent, in other words, these three products do constitute a market "worth monopolising" and therefore constitutes a relevant market. This result is because X controls all three products which are the only substitutes of A. Thus, X knows that even if its increase in price of A will generate some substitution, a significant share of these consumers will end up buying other products which he controls, therefore overall, his profits will not be reduced but rather increased.

If we had found that such an increase would not have been profitable, we should further include new products which we may imagine are substitutes in a third phase until we arrive at a situation in which such an increase in price would have been profitable, indicating that those products do constitute a relevant market.

==Limitations==

Despite its widespread usage, the SSNIP test is not without problems. Specifically:

*In evaluating a merger of A and B, '''performing the SSNIP test on A's products will not necessarily yield the same relevant market as applying the SSNIP test on B's products'''.  (This presented a legal issue in the 2000 Bayer/Aventis Crop Science merger.)  So a competition authority investigating A should only consider competitive pressure (or lack thereof) that B puts on A - reverse pressure from A to B is irrelevant.
*The SSNIP test relies on '''total losses in sales''' after a 5% price increase, '''not just substitutions to a particular competitor's product'''.  Thus it includes sales losses due to outpricing by competitor 1, a more attractive deal by competitor 2, or to customers saving their money instead of spending it on any of those competitors' products.  Mathematically speaking, what is important is the own-price elasticity of the good in question, not its cross-price elasticity relative to any other product.  Cross-price elasticities can help determine what products are substitutes (high, positive cross-price elasticities) in succeeding iterations of the SSNIP test, but the attractiveness of controlling a market can only be evaluated with an own-price elasticity.
*In succeeding iterations of larger market control, the hypothetical price increase still only applies to the first product.  The gains to the hypothetical owner of substitute products come from increasing the price of one base product and thus getting higher revenue from it and spillover from its competitors - ''not'' from increasing the price of the base product and the price for its competitors.
*The SSNIP test only measures competition based on price and thus cannot be considered a catch-all or fully sufficient tool for defining markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxera.com/cmsDocuments/Capital%20and%20Competing%20Ideas/SSNIP%20test%20-%20some%20common%20misconceptions%20(March%202005).pdf The SSNIP test: some common misconceptions]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, many economists have noted an important pitfall in the use of [[Elasticity of demand|demand elasticities]] when inferring both the [[market power]] and the [[relevant market]]. The problem arises from the fact that [[economic theory]] predicts that any profit-maximizing firm will set its prices at a level where demand for its product is elastic. Therefore, when a [[monopoly|monopolist]] sets its prices at a monopoly level it may happen that two products appear to be close substitutes whereas at competitive prices they are not. In other words, it may happen that using the SSNIP test one defines the relevant market too broadly, including products which are not substitutes.

This problem is known in the literature as the [[cellophane paradox]] after the celebrated [[DuPont|Du Pont]] case. In this case, Du Pont (a [[cellophane]] producer) argued that cellophane was not a separate relevant market since it competed with flexible packaging materials such as aluminum foil, wax paper and polyethylene. The problem was that Du Pont, being the sole producer of cellophane, had set prices at the monopoly level, and it was at this level that consumers viewed those other products as substitutes. Instead, at the competitive level, consumers viewed cellophane as a unique relevant market (a small but significant increase in prices would not have them switching to goods like wax or the others). In the case, the [[US Supreme Court]] failed to recognise that a high own-price elasticity may mean that a firm is already exercising monopoly power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compecon.ie/Mktdefn.htm Market Definition and Market Power in Competition Analysis.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613225401/http://www.compecon.ie/Mktdefn.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soda Industry Inc.'''  ({{lang-tr|Soda Sanayii A.Ş.}}, also called Sodakrom) is a chemical company in [[Mersin]], [[Turkey]] producing soda ash and chromium compounds mainly for the glass industry in its parent's group of companies. It is owned and operated by the Şişecam Group.

The soda plant at {{coord|36|48|51|N|34|44|55|E}} is to the west of [[Kazanlı]] neighborhood in [[Akdeniz]] district of Mersin, southern Turkey.

==History==
The Soda Industry Inc. was established in 1969 as a subsidiary of the Şişecam Group, Turkey's major glass producer. Production of soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), a key raw material for the [[glass industry]], began in 1975.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;

In 1979, the Kromsan Chromium Compounds Plant ({{lang-tr|Kromsan Krom Bileşikleri Fabrikası}}) was founded.&lt;ref name="sck"/&gt; It is situated just to the northwest of the Soda Plant. In 1982, it joined the Şişecam Chemicals Group, one of the four main businesses of Şişecam Group.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt; In 1986, Kromsan merged with the  Soda Industry company.&lt;ref name="sck"/&gt;

Beginning by 1997, Soda Industry began foreign investments. Soda Industry acquired  25% share of the Bulgarian Soda factory Sodi in 1997 and all shares of the Bosnian soda factory Lukavac in 2006 to increase its soda production. In 2011 Soda Industry also acquired the Italian Chromium Products factory Cromital .
The Soda Plant and the Kromsan Chromium Compounds Plant produce chemicals, which are used in a variety of industrial and consumer goods  such as detergents, leather and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;

==Production==
Soda Industry now is the leading producer of  chromium compounds  and the 4th greatest producer of sodium compounds (such as [[sodium dichromate]] ([[sodium|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[chromium|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[chromium(III) sulfate|basic chromium sulfate]] (&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[chromium|Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[oxygen|O]])&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;([[oxygen|O]][[hydrogen|H]])&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][[sulfur|S]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[chromic acid]] ([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]][[chromium|Cr]][[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] ) with an annual production of 2.2 million metric tons in Europe. [[Vitamin K3]] and [[sodium metabisulphite]] are among the other products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sisecamkimyasallar.com/sites/catalogs/tr/Documents/surdurulebilirlik-raporlari/SodaSanayiiAS_Surdurulebilirlik_Raporu.pdf Soda Sanayii sustainability report {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scc"/&gt;
