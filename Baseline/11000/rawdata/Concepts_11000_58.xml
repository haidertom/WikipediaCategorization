{{DISPLAYTITLE:''A priori'' and ''a posteriori''}}
The [[Latin]] phrases '''''a priori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the earlier") and '''''a posteriori''''' (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt; "from the later") are [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[term of art|terms of art]] popularized by [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (first published in 1781, second edition in 1787), one of the most influential works in the [[history of philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Birdarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Graham Bird |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=439 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in their Latin forms they appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|BCE}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

These terms are used with respect to reasoning ([[epistemology]]) to distinguish "necessary conclusions from first premises" (i.e., what must come before sense observation) from "conclusions based on [[sense observation]]" which must follow it. Thus, the two kinds of [[knowledge]], [[Justification (epistemology)|justification]], or [[argument]], may be glossed:

*''A priori'' knowledge or justification is independent of [[experience]], as with [[mathematics]] (3 + 2 = 5), [[tautology (grammar)|tautologies]] ("All bachelors are unmarried"), and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[pure reason]] (e.g., [[Ontological argument|ontological proofs]]).{{refn|[[Galen Strawson]] has stated that an ''a priori'' argument is one in which "you can see that it is [[Truth|true]] just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science."&lt;ref name="Galen Strawson interviewed by Tamler Sommers"&gt;{{harvnb|Sommers|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
*[[A posteriori knowledge|''A posteriori'' knowledge]] or justification depends on [[experience]] or [[empirical evidence]], as with most aspects of [[science]] and [[anecdotal evidence|personal knowledge]].

There are many points of view on these two types of knowledge, and their relationship gives rise to one of the oldest problems in [[modern philosophy]].

The terms ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' are primarily used as [[adjective]]s to modify the [[noun]] "knowledge" (for example, "''a priori'' knowledge"). However, "''a priori''" is sometimes used to modify other nouns, such as "truth". Philosophers also may use "apriority" and "aprioricity" as nouns to refer (approximately) to the quality of being "''a priori''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitcher|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2014}}

Although definitions and use of the terms have varied in the history of philosophy, they have consistently labeled two separate epistemological notions. See also the related distinctions: [[deductive reasoning|deductive]]/[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic]], [[Contingency (philosophy)|necessary/contingent]].

==Examples==
The intuitive distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge (or justification) is best seen via examples, as below:

;''A priori''
:Consider the proposition, "If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days."  This is something that one knows ''a priori'', because it expresses a statement that one ''can'' derive by reason alone. 
;''A posteriori''
:Compare this with the [[Proposition (philosophy)|proposition]] expressed by the sentence, "George V reigned from 1910 to 1936."  This is something that (if true) one must come to know ''a posteriori'', because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.

==Analyticity and necessity==
===Relation to the analytic-synthetic===
{{details|Analytic-synthetic distinction}}

Several philosophers reacting to Kant sought to explain ''a priori'' knowledge without appealing to, as [[Paul Boghossian]] (MD) explains, "a special faculty ... that has never been described in satisfactory terms."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996"&gt;{{harvnb|Boghossian|2003|p=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theory, popular among the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the "analytic explanation of the a priori."&lt;ref name="Boghossianj_1996" /&gt; The distinction between [[analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic and synthetic propositions]] was first introduced by Kant. While Kant's original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of the distinction primarily involves, as the American philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] put it, the notions of "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact."&lt;ref name=Q21&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone, while ''a posteriori analytic'' propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning ''and'' certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the ''a priori'', all ''a priori'' knowledge is analytic; so ''a priori'' knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition, since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question.  In short, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity.

However, the analytic explanation of ''a priori'' knowledge has undergone several criticisms.  Most notably, Quine argued that the analytic–synthetic distinction is illegitimate. Quine states: "But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quine|1951|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the soundness of Quine's critique is highly disputed, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the ''a priori'' in terms of the analytic.

===Relation to the necessary and contingent===
The metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge. A proposition that is ''[[Modal logic|necessarily true]]'' is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, it is said to be true in every [[possible world]]). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is ''contingently true'' is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is ''not'' true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known ''a priori'', because "[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §3&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, "[[logical positivism|Positivism]], in particular, took it for granted that ''a priori'' truths must be necessary...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fodor|1998|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|Analytic propositions]] were largely taken to be "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact",&lt;ref name=Q21/&gt; while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the [[truth-value]] of synthetic propositions.

Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. The American philosopher [[Saul Kripke]] (1972), for example, provided strong arguments against this position.  Kripke argued that there are necessary ''a posteriori'' truths, such as the proposition that water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (if it is true). According to Kripke, this statement is necessarily true (since water and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary) and ''a posteriori'' (since it is known only through empirical investigation). Following such considerations of Kripke and others (such as [[Hilary Putnam]]), philosophers tend to distinguish more clearly the notion of aprioricity from that of necessity and analyticity.

Kripke's definitions of these terms, however, diverge in subtle ways from those of Kant. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and ''a priori'' would, according to Stephen Palmquist, best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it "analytic a posteriori".{{refn|group=nb |In this pair of articles, Stephen Palmquist demonstrates that the context often determines how a particular proposition should be classified. A proposition that is synthetic ''a posteriori'' in one context might be analytic ''a priori'' in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Palmquist|1987|pp=269, 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Aaron Sloman]] presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical and necessary/contingent) in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sloman|first=A.|date=1965-10-01|title='Necessary', 'a priori' and 'analytic'|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/analys/26.1.12|journal=Analysis|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=12–16|doi=10.1093/analys/26.1.12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It did not assume "possible world semantics" for the third distinction, merely that some part of ''this'' world might have been different.

Thus, the relationship between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity is not easy to discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the ''a priori''/''a posteriori'' distinction is [[epistemology|epistemological]], the analytic/synthetic distinction is [[linguistics|linguistic]], and the necessary/contingent distinction is [[metaphysics|metaphysical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baehr|2006}}, §2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early uses===
The phrases "''a priori''" and "''a posteriori''" are [[Latin]] for "from what comes before" and "from what comes later" (or, less literally, "from first principles, before experience" and "after experience"). They appear in Latin translations of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', of about 300&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, a work widely considered during the [[Early modern Europe|early European modern]] period as the model for precise thinking.

An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of ''a priori'' knowledge (though not called by that name) is [[Plato]]'s [[Innatism|theory of recollection]], related in the  dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' (380&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}), according to which something like ''a priori'' knowledge is knowledge inherent, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] in the human mind.

[[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]], a 14th-century logician, wrote on both ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori''.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G. W. Leibniz]] introduced a distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' criteria for the possibility of a notion in his (1684) short treatise "Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas".&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/ Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''A priori'' and ''a posteriori'' arguments for the existence of God appear in his ''[[Monadology]]'' (1714).&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[George Berkeley]] outlined the distinction in his 1710 work ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (para. XXI).

===Immanuel Kant===
The 18th-century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1781) advocated a blend of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] theories. Kant says, "Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises [is caused by] from experience"&lt;ref name="kant_1781"&gt;{{harvnb|Kant|1781|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant, ''a priori'' cognition is [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], or based on the ''form'' of all possible experience, while ''a posteriori'' cognition is empirical, based on the ''content'' of experience. Kant states, "[…] it is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving merely the ''occasion'' [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect]."&lt;ref name="kant_1781"/&gt; Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. And unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that ''a priori'' cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the [[condition of possibility|conditions of possible experience]]. These ''a priori'', or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that ''a priori'' intuitions can be "triggered" by experience). 

Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a [[transcendental logic]] with which to consider the deduction of the ''a priori'' in its pure form. [[Space]], [[time]] and [[causality]] are considered pure ''a priori'' intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure ''a priori'' intuitions are established via his [[transcendental aesthetic]] and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these ''a priori'' forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i.&amp;nbsp;e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental deduction]] and it is the central argument of his major work, the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the ''a priori'', this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of [[subjectivity]],  what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical.

===Johann Fichte===
After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of [[German Idealism]]. One of these philosophers was [[Johann Fichte]]. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], accused him of rejecting the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' knowledge:

{{Quote|... Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

'''Algorithmic logic''' is a calculus of programs which allows the expression of [[semantic property|semantic properties]] of programs by appropriate logical [[formula]]s. It provides a [[Software framework|framework]] that enables proving the formulas from the [[axiom]]s of program constructs such as assignment, iteration and composition instructions and from the axioms of the data structures in question see {{harvtxt|Mirkowska|Salwicki|1987}}, {{harvtxt|Banachowski|Kreczmar|Mirkowska|Rasiowa|1977}}.

The following diagram helps to locate algorithmic logic among other [[Mathematical logic|logics]].
&lt;math&gt;\qquad \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Propositional\ logic}\\or \\ \mathrm{Sentential\ calculus} \end{array}\right ]\subset  \left [\begin{array}{l} \mathrm{Predicate\ calculus} \\or \\ \mathrm{First\ order\ logic}\end{array}\right ]  \subset \left [\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{Calculus\ of\ programs}\\or \\ \mbox{Algorithmic logic} \end{array}\right ] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The formalized language of algorithmic logic (and of algorithmic theories of various data structures) contains three types of well formed expressions: ''[[Term (logic)|Terms]]'' - i.e. expressions denoting operations on elements of data structures, 
''formulas'' - i.e. expressions denoting the relations among elements of data structures,  ''programs'' - i.e. [[algorithm]]s - these expressions describe the computations.
For semantics of terms and formulas consult pages on [[First-order logic|first order logic]] and Tarski's semantic. The meaning of a program &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the set of possible computations of the program.

Algorithmic logic is one of many logics of programs.
Another logic of programs is dynamic logic, see [[dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]], {{harvtxt|Harel|Kozen|Tiuryn|2000}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">An '''ambient space''' or '''ambient configuration space''' is the [[dimensional space|space]] surrounding an object.

==Mathematics==
[[File:Euclidian and non euclidian geometry.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Three examples of different geometries:  [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], and [[hyperbolic geometry]]]]

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], an ''ambient space'' is the space surrounding a [[mathematical object]].  For example, a [[line (mathematics)|line]] may be studied in isolation, or it may be studied as an object in [[two-dimensional]] space—in which case the ambient space is the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], or as an object in [[three-dimensional space]]—in which case the ambient space is three-dimensional.  To see why this makes a difference, consider the statement "Lines that never meet are necessarily [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]."  This is true if the ambient space is two-dimensional, but false if the ambient space is three-dimensional, because in the latter case the lines could be [[skew lines]], rather than parallel.

==Biography==
Capping what was already a long and distinguished career, in 2012 Annette Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). The influential magazine ''Indian Country Today'' immediately named it as one of the 12 most important books in Native American Studies published in 2012. The Western Literature Association awarded the book the Thomas Lyon Prize as "the best book in Western literary and cultural studies published in 2012." Professor Kolodny had earlier made her mark in the field of Native American Studies with the publication of the long-lost 1893 masterpiece of Native American literature, [[Joseph Nicolar]]'s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press, 2007). This new edition included an interpretive analysis of Nicolar's text as well as a fascinating history of the [[Penobscot Nation]] in Maine. These two latest books mark the culmination of a scholarly career that began with studies of the American frontiers and moved into breakthrough examinations of trans-Atlantic contacts between Europeans and Native Americans.

Kolodny was born in [[New York City]] to Esther Rifkind Kolodny and David Kolodny.&lt;ref name="Jay 211"&gt;Jay, Gregory (ed.), ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', Detroit: Gale Research Company, 1988, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; She did her undergraduate work at Brooklyn College, from which she graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] [[magna cum laude]] in 1962.  After graduation, she took a position on the editorial staff at ''[[Newsweek]]''. Kolodny left to return to graduate studies in 1964, citing a desire “to teach people to think critically and because she wanted to be able to publish her own ideas, not merely report the ideas of others."&lt;ref name="Jay 211" /&gt; Her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] work were completed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she earned the latter degree in 1969. &lt;ref name="Leitch 2143"&gt;"Annette Kolodny", Leitch, Vincent B. (ed.), ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism.'' New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2001, p. 2143.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first teaching position at [[Yale University]] was cut short as she left after a year to move to [[Canada]] with her husband, whose [[conscription|draft]] board appeal for [[conscientious objector]] status for the duration of the [[Vietnam War]] was rejected.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; Finding a position at the [[University of British Columbia]], she helped develop western Canada’s first accredited interdisciplinary [[women’s studies]] program before returning to the United States in 1974 to teach at the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Jay 212"&gt;Jay, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In [[New Hampshire]], she wrote her first major work of feminist eco-criticism, ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (1975). While the book got positive reviews and pioneered the field of feminist [[ecocriticism]], Kolodny was denied promotion and [[tenure]] in the English Department at the University of New Hampshire. (Richter 1387) Active in the student movements while in Berkeley, she continued to advocate for the right to establish a program in women’s studies. She later [[lawsuit|sued]] the University of New Hampshire charging sex discrimination and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144"&gt;Leitch, p. 2144.&lt;/ref&gt; She settled with the "largest financial award in history in a case of this kind".&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; She used this money to establish the Legal Fund of the Task Force on Discrimination for the [[National Women's Studies Association]] (NWSA),&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; an organization she had helped found, and served as director of the task force from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The Task Force is now renamed Feminists Against Academic Discrimination within the NWSA.

Kolodny taught at several universities, including the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] before being named Dean of the College of Humanities at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. Following her tenure as dean, which spanned from 1988 to 1993, Kolodny was named College of Humanities Professor of American Literature and Culture at the University of Arizona. Currently, she is Professor Emerita of Comparative Cultural and Literary Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

In 1993 she was elected to lifetime membership in the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40106|title=Gruppe 4: Litteraturvitenskap|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate= January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her books have won many awards both in the United States and abroad. Over the course of her scholarly career, Kolodny has received grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship, and others. She retired from the University of Arizona in July 2007 and has continued an active professional life as a consultant in higher education policy issues and as a scholar of American literature and culture.

==Works==
Kolodny’s first two books were ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1975) and ''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860 ''(University of North Carolina Press, 1984); both of these texts deal with [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns and the historic destruction of the land (Jay 217). Based on her experience as a senior administrator in higher education, Kolodny published ''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century'' (Duke University Press, 1998), which "details the extent to which women and non-white students are still outsiders on American campuses."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The book also examines the status of the humanities disciplines in higher education, the value of tenure, and the need for family friendly policies on campus. It is a book about needed educational innovations in the twenty-first century.

Kolodny is also well known for two essays published in 1980: "Dancing Through the Minefield: Some Observations on the Theory, Practice, and Politics of a Feminist Literary Criticism" (''Feminist Studies'', Spring 1980) and "A Map for Re-Reading: Gender and the Interpretation of Literary Texts" (''New Literary History'', Spring 1980). Of these, "Dancing Through the Minefield" is the most well-known, and has been called "the most reprinted essay of American feminist literary criticism".&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; It has been translated and reprinted worldwide.

In 2007, Kolodny published a long-lost masterpiece of Native American literature, Joseph Nicolar’s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press), originally published in 1893. Nicolar’s work traces the history of his people, the Penobscot Nation, from the first moments of creation through the arrival of the white man. Kolodny’s reprint of this important work includes a history of the Penobscot Nation and an interpretive introduction to the text. It was stipulated that the royalties from this text go to the Penobscot. In 2012, Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). A major contribution to the field of American Studies, this book examines both Native American and Euroamerican stories of first contacts between the peoples of the New and Old Worlds. It examines the competition between [[Leif Eiriksson]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] for the title of "first discoverer".

===Literary theory and criticism===

====Landscape symbolism and ecofeminism====

=====''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor As Experience and History in American Life and Letters''=====

In her first book, ''The Lay of the Land'', Kolodny explores the [[colony|colonization]] of America, both in reality and in the realm of [[metaphor]]. She examines "the continued repetition of the land-as-woman symbolization in American life and letters" (Kolodny, ix). The projection of female imagery onto the landscape was essential to its colonization, she argued; in her introduction, she asks, "was there perhaps a need to experience the land as a nurturing, giving maternal breast because of the threatening, alien, and potentially emasculating terror of the unknown?" (9) By construing the land as female, she argued, it was possible for the colonists to remove some of the terror and mystery from an unknown land. Instead, it became either a nurturing maternal figure, existing to provide sustenance, or a passive virginal figure, existing only to be dominated, sexually or otherwise. With these metaphors firmly in sight, the colonists had a framework through which to view the vast stretches of [[North America]] as less alien and terrifying. Through an examination of several male writers, such as [[Philip Freneau]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], and [[John James Audubon]], Kolodny pursues the implications of this metaphorically female land.

Different chapters of the book correspond to different chronological eras after the discovery and colonization of the Americas and to different metaphorical mindsets as manifested in the writings of the authors considered. In chapter 2, "Surveying the Virgin Land: The Documents of Exploration and Colonization, 1500–1740", the comparison of the land to an untouched, virginal paradise begins the exploration. Chapter 3, "Laying Waste Her Fields of Plenty: The Eighteenth Century", discusses the romanticized [[agriculture|agrarian]] and [[pastoral]] ideals that coloured the view of America, especially in its comparisons to ideal lands like [[Elysium]] and [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], and the consequences that arose from such ideals, such as the exploitation and alteration of the land. Chapter 4, "Singing Her Past and Singing Her Praises: The Nineteenth Century", examines the dual images of Mother and Mistress in the land, as well as the frustration of the pastoral impulse with the closing of the American frontier and the victory of the industrialized North in the [[American Civil War]]. Finally, chapter 5, "Making It with Paradise: The Twentieth Century", deals with the increase of [[industrialization]] and the yearning both "to return to and to master the beautiful and bountiful femininity of the new continent." (139)

[[Freud]]ian and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] influences are apparent in this text, especially in the "psychosexual dynamic of a virginal paradise" (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', 3). It also has tones of [[ecofeminism]], which will be discussed below.

=====''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860''=====

In the preface to this book, Kolodny states that "[t]he purpose of this study is to chart women’s private responses to the successive American frontiers and to trace a tradition of women’s public statements about the west." (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', xi) Thus, she approaches the same topic as that of ''Lay of the Land'' ("landscape as a symbolic…realm" [xii]), but from a different direction. In the writings she examined, she noticed a different theme from that of the male writers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like their husbands and fathers, women too shared in economic motives behind [[emigration]]; and like the men, women also dreamed of transforming the wilderness. But the emphases were different…Avoiding for a time male assertions of a rediscovered [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], women claimed the frontiers as a potential sanctuary for an idealized domesticity. Massive exploitation and alteration of the continent do not seem to have been a part of women’s [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].  They dreamed, more modestly, of locating a home and a familial human community within a cultivated garden. (xii–xiii)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is little sense of the conquering-of-the-[[frontier]] mentality that Kolodny discovered in the male writers she discussed in ''Lay of the Land''. There were no triumphant [[hero]]es of the order of [[Daniel Boone]] or [[Davey Crockett]]; rather, the narratives of these women focused on the triumph of domesticity and order in a wild land.

The book is organized chronologically, in much the same way as ''Lay of the Land''. The first section is titled "Book One: From Captivity to Accommodation, 1630-1833", and traces the writings of and about women as they moved from captivity both literal ([[Mary Rowlandson]]’s account of being captured by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s) and figurative (the sense of being forcibly confined in a new and strange land) to adaptation in the form of survival skills, such as those reputedly possessed by [[Rebecca Boone]], the wife of Daniel Boone. Book two, "From Promotion to Literature, 1833–1850", follows attempts to encourage women to move westward by male writers to western narratives by the women themselves. The third and final section, "Book Three: Repossessing Eden, 1850–1860", documents the attempts by women to create a familiar order in a still unfamiliar country.

=====Ecofeminism=====

Both of these books relate to a subgenre of feminism called ecological feminism or ecofeminism, a social and political doctrine that posits a relationship between the subjugation of women and the destruction of nature. Ecofeminists theorize that a culture based on dominating women is directly connected to social ideals that promote the environmental abuse of the earth. 

These two books have a connection to ecofeminism, particularly ''Lay of the Land''. The feminization of the land and the images of the earth as a passive, giving female figure show the social ideas that ecofeminism protests against. Likewise, ''The Land Before Her'' exemplifies the same ideas from a different point of view in the ideal of the domestic garden, or the altering of nature.

===="Dancing Through the Minefield"====

Perhaps her best known work, Kolodny’s 1980 essay "Dancing Through the Minefield" was the "first work to attempt both a survey of the first ten years of feminist literary inquiry and an analysis of the informing theoretical propositions".&lt;ref&gt;Jay, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the subject of criticism in the years since its initial publication, but can still be seen as a guide to "feminist concerns and methodologies."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

=====Social constructionism=====
{{Main article|Social constructionism}}
Kolodny emphasizes Social constructionism in this essay, although she herself never uses the term. Briefly, social constructionism is a school of thought that involves looking at the ways social phenomena are created, by people. (See full article on Social constructionism) Using this theory, social entities are seen as always being in a state of change as society itself changes, and the relationships of the entities change. "[T]hings in the world … are the products of ongoing social processes of interaction, and thus do not have fixed or inherent meanings."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

In "Dancing Through the Minefield", Kolodny applies this theory to the [[wiktionary:canon|literary canon]], those works of [[literature]] that are considered appropriate for study. But such a canon is formed by critics whose values of [[Literary Criticism|aestheticism]] are not neutral. The critical interpretation is formed by the interaction between two objects: the text and the reader. According to Kolodny, the reader’s ability to read any given text is shaped by the social conventions and assumptions of their time and place; Reading becomes a social product. But neither is the text pure; it is also moulded by social relations and customs. So any critical interpretation is necessarily a product of two forms of social construction. "Readers and texts are both made &amp;mdash; and they are continually being remade."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The dynamic nature of both texts and readers must be taken into consideration when examining any text, or the established criticism of that text.

=====Theory=====
Kolodny’s essay has a clear theoretical outline. In light of the social constructionist view that aesthetic values, as assigned to the literary canon, are in actuality the products of social conventions and values, Kolodny claims that feminist criticism should "discover how aesthetic value is assigned in the first place" (Kolodny 2147) and then assess the socially-constructed reading patterns that lead to those value judgements. "Having become embroiled in value disagreements, feminism should consider the processes underlying value judgements."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; "Dancing Through the Minefield" outlines a three-part nucleus assumed by most contemporary feminist literary critics to be essential. First, any construction of a literary canon is a social construction; second, readers unconsciously engage texts from a certain point-of-view; and third, this unconscious bias present in all readers must be consciously and critically re-examined. 

First, she writes, "literary history…is a fiction." (Kolodny 2153) This refers to the traditional formation of the literary canon and literary history as a social construction. Literary histories define the major, minor, and ignored texts according to their own social values and conventions, not out of any inherent aesthetic value on the text itself. For example, the western literary canon has been largely created by well-educated white men, and the focus of the canon is therefore on works by well-educated white men. It embodied, as well as upheld, the dominant ideology of the time, and had implications beyond aesthetic values. To give preference to texts by this group was to ignore texts created by other social groups. In recent years, the monolithic nature of the canon has been challenged, and works by previously ignored sections of the literary world (women, [[homosexual]]s, and [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]) have gained some footholds in the canon.

Secondly, readers of texts "engage…not texts but [[paradigm]]s." (2155) Just as texts and canons are socially constructed, so are the vantage points from which readers engage with any given text. This was also mentioned by [[Stanley Fish]], who called these vantage points [[interpretive communities]]. Kolodny states that "we appropriate meaning from a text…according the critical assumptions or predispositions (conscious or not) that we bring to it." (2155)

Finally, Kolodny "strives to undo the unconsciousness of the reader identified"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145"&gt;Leitch, p. 2145.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second part of her theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the grounds upon which we assign aesthetic value to texts are never infallible, unchangeable, or universal, we must re-examine not only our [[aesthetics]] but, as well, the inherent biases and assumptions informing the critical methods which (in part) shape our aesthetic responses. (Kolodny 2158)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
These three general theoretical principles are then supported by the concept of pluralism. Pluralism in this context refers to a conscious effort not to limit oneself to a single critical approach when reading a text. Rather, the object of pluralism is to make use of multiple critical approaches and to get a fuller appreciation of the variety of meanings which can be present in a single text. Kolodny specifically refers to a feminist pluralism, which validates "multiple interpretations of various texts"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; according to the usefulness of a pluralistic view of a text. This method of reading would give equality to different approaches as well as allow critical examinations of those same approaches, which in turn helps create the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; advocated by Kolodny’s third principle as outlined above.

The essay emphasizes the real situation of contemporary women. Kolodny believes that feminism and women’s studies should not be confined to books or classrooms. “[I]deas are important because they determine the ways we live, or want to live, in the world” (Kolodny 2164); ideas are therefore not meant to exist in a vacuum. Rather, they must be taken into the world through [[activism]].

=====Criticism=====
Several authors have criticized "Dancing Through the Minefield". The most well-known of these criticisms appeared in a collaborative article Kolodny wrote with Judith Gardiner, Elly Bulkin, and Rena Patterson entitled "An Interchange on Feminist Criticism: On ‘Dancing Through the Minefield’", which was published in the journal ''Feminist Studies'' in 1983. 

Both Bulkin and Patterson believe that Kolodny, while speaking to women in her essay, is only speaking to a certain group of women &amp;mdash; those who are white, [[middle class]], and [[heterosexual]]. Patterson states that "despite its language and intent, [the essay]…represents [[classism|classist]], white, and [[heterosexism|heterosexist]] attitudes which are common in feminist literary criticism and which contradict the best of feminist thought and the aims of the women's movement" (Patterson, 654). This is a common criticism of [[second-wave feminism]]: that it tended to ignore the problems of non-white and non-heterosexual women in favor of a homogenized white heterosexual feminist culture. However, Kolodny’s advocacy of the concept of pluralism may offset this claim. While she does not specify that alternative critical approaches should come from different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] or [[Sexual orientation|sexualities]], there is no reason why they could not and such inclusion would only increase the scope of the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; mentioned above.

Gardiner, on the other hand, disagrees with Kolodny about the use of pluralism. While there can be no single ideology to which all feminist theories belong, Gardiner writes, there are some strong ideological concepts that define areas of feminism. Examples of this would include [[liberal feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[ecofeminism]]. In Gardiner’s view, the strong ideological beliefs shared by these groups would "limit their susceptibility to pluralism." (Gardiner 634)

====''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century''====
Kolodny’s 1998 book is not a work of literary criticism, but rather one of institutional criticism. After serving as dean of Humanities for five years at the University of Arizona, Kolodny wrote this book in order to outline some of the problems facing academic institutions. These include the ability of legislators and administrators to make uninformed decisions about budget cuts without realizing the effect of such cuts on quality education; a myriad of problems about [[tenure]] and promotions processes, which Kolodny believes still reflect an attitude antagonistic to women or ethnic minorities; a problem with anti-feminist and anti-[[intellectual]] harassment; the lack of support available for students with children; the extent to which women and non-whites are still considered outsiders on university campuses; and the effect of an outdated curriculum in the face of greater demographic diversity and changing student learning needs. She outlines a number of changes which can be made to improve conditions and, realizing that any substantial change will require equally substantial money, encourages government reinvestment in higher education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8542">The '''argument from marginal cases''' (also known as the '''argument from species overlap''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animal-ethics.org/argument-species-overlap/ | website=Animal Ethics | title=The argument from species overlap | accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[philosophical argument]] within [[animal rights]] theory regarding the moral status of non-human animals. Its proponents hold that if human infants, the senile, the [[coma|comatose]], and the [[cognition|cognitively]] disabled have direct moral status, animals must have a similar status, since there is no known morally relevant ability that those marginal-case humans have that animals lack. "Moral status" may refer to a right not to be killed or made to suffer, or to a general moral requirement to be treated in a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Dombrowski|Dombrowski, Daniel]] (1997). ''Babies and Beasts: The Argument from Marginal Cases''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of this argument has been put forward by [[Peter Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/anim-eth/#SSH3ai Animals and Ethics – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the argument==
The argument from marginal cases takes the form of a [[proof by contradiction]]. It attempts to show that you cannot coherently believe both that all humans have moral status, ''and'' that all non-humans lack moral status.

Consider a cow. We ask why it is acceptable to kill this cow for food – we might claim, for example, that the cow has no concept of [[self (philosophy)|self]] and therefore it cannot be wrong to kill it. However, many young children may also lack this same concept of "self".&lt;ref&gt;Harter, S. (1983). Developmental perspectives on the self-system. In P. H. Mussen (Ed.), Handbook of child psychology, (4th ed., Vol. 4, (pp. 275–385). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; So if we accept the self-concept criterion, then we must also accept that killing children is acceptable in addition to killing cows, which is considered a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''. So the concept of self cannot be our criterion.

The proponent will usually continue by saying that for any criterion or set of criteria (either capacities, e.g. language, consciousness, the ability to have moral responsibilities towards others; or relations, e.g. sympathy or power relations)&lt;ref&gt;Horta, Oscar. “The Scope of the Argument from Species Overlap”, ''Journal of Applied Philosophy'', 31, 2014, 142-154.&lt;/ref&gt; there exists some "marginal" human who is [[mentally handicapped]] in some way that would also meet the criteria for having no moral status. [[Peter Singer]] phrases it this way: 

{{Quote|text=The catch is that any such characteristic that is possessed by all human beings will not be possessed only by human beings. For example, all human beings, but not only human beings, are capable of feeling pain; and while only human beings are capable of solving complex mathematical problems, not all humans can do this.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. Animal Liberation. New York: HarperCollins, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Proponents==
[[Daniel Dombrowski]] writes that the argument can be traced to [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the third century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Dombrowski, Daniel A. "Vegetarianism and the Argument from Marginal Cases in Porphyry". ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 45.1 (1984): 141–143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Rachels]] has argued that the theory of [[evolution]] implies that there is only a gradient between humans and other animals, and therefore marginal-case humans should be considered similar to non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachels, James. ''Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism. Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism&lt;!--'Argument from species normality' redirects here--&gt;==
A counter-argument is the '''argument from species normality'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a term coined by David Graham), proposed by [[Tibor Machan]]. In considering the rights of children or the disabled, Machan uses the analogy of a broken chair:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... classifications and ascriptions of capacities rely on the good sense of making certain generalizations. One way to show this is to recall that broken chairs, while they aren't any good to sit on, are still chairs, not monkeys or palm trees. Classifications are not something rigid but something reasonable. While there are some people who either for a little or longer while – say when they're asleep or in a coma – lack [[moral agency]], in general people possess that capacity, whereas non-people don't. So it makes sense to understand them having rights so their capacity is respected and may be protected. This just doesn't work for other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Machan, Tibor. ''Putting Humans First: Why We Are Nature's Favorite''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

David Graham interprets this to mean that if most of a species' members are moral agents then any member has the same rights and protections as the species. In brief, "The moral status of an individual depends on what is normal for that individual's species."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strike-the-root.com/4/graham/graham1.html A Libertarian Replies to Tibor Machan's 'Why Animal Rights Don't Exist'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

James Rachels has responded to Machan that if one adopts the idea that individuals of a species must be treated according to what is normal for that species, then it would imply a chimp that somehow acquired the ability to read and write should not enter a university since it is not "normal" behavior for a chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;''Animal Rights and Human Obligations'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related counterargument from [[Roderick Long]] is that a being can obtain moral agency by developing a [[Rationality|rational]] capacity, and from there on has full moral agency even if this capacity is lost or diminished:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That is why a cow has no rights, though a human being reduced to the mental level of a cow does have them. There's something wrong with the human; there's nothing wrong with the cow. One might say that in the case of the cow-minded human, there's a blank spot where her moral agency is supposed to be, and someone else can step into that blank spot and act as an agent on her behalf. But in the cow there's no blank spot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/unblog01-03.htm#13 Why Fur Is Not Murder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Doctor Arthur L. Caplan, in an article on the ethics of organ donation by infants with [[anencephaly]] - born essentially without a brain - before physical death, raises some points that might be considered counters to the Argument from Marginal Cases.{{by whom|date=June 2017}}{{clarify|reason=Aren't those points ''for'' marginal cases - instead of counters?|date=June 2017}} He writes that some people cannot emotionally handle treating the anencephalic child as not worthy of moral status. Caplan also mentions concerns about possible misdiagnosis risk - the risk that an infant would be incorrectly diagnosed with anencephaly, and also the slippery-slope concern - the concern that other individuals are then at risk for organ donation, such as those in vegetative states or with severe disabilities.&lt;ref&gt; "Is It Ethical to Use Anencephalic Newborns for Organ Donation?" by Arthur L. Caplan, PhD (Medscape, http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/876605)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16744">'''Asian pride''' is a term utilized internationally but has various origins and meanings.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;

==International usage==
Asian pride is a broad term that can cover several topics. Within the [[international relations]] context, [[Asian people|Asian]] [[pride]] can be seen within Asian politics as advancement of [[Pan-Asianism]] through heavy criticism of the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langguth |first1=Gerd |year=1996 |title=Dawn of the "Pacific Century"? |journal=German Foreign Affairs Review |volume=47 |issue=4 |url=http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |accessdate=18 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610190612/http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalrymple |first=Rawdon |title=Continental Drift: Australia's Search for a Regional Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujY4nUQdtkC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Asian%20Pride%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 January 2013 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd |isbn=9780754634461 |page=119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, China referred to India's successful [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] of ''Mangalyaan'' as the "pride of Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-heralds-indias-mars-mission-mangalyaan-pride-asia-1466953 |title=China Heralds India's Mars Mission Mangalyaan as 'Pride of Asia'

==United States==
The pan-ethnicity Asian American concept is not embraced by many Asian Americans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wong |first=William |title=Yellow Journalist: Dispatches from Asian America |series=Maping Racisms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evNtIyLKQZcC&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2001 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=9781566398305 |page=187 |quote=The Asian pride argument is not realistic in these times, at least in most cities and especially at state and national levels. For one thing, what is "Asian Pride"? There is a pan-Asian sentiment among some Asian Americans. Many Americans of Asian background, though, don't embrace the vague "Asian American" sobriquet. The identity label of choice rangers from plain old "American" to particular Asian ethnicity.}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Tilden Rhea|title=Race Pride and the American Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nlue11bhyb4C&amp;pg=PA39|date=1 May 2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00576-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow Power===
In the United States the term has older roots within the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter culture movement]] among Asian Americans in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Meredith Leigh Oyen|editor=Gina Misiroglu|title=American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4KsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45|date=26 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47729-7|page=45|chapter=Asian Pride}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period there was the [[Black Power]] movement, and Asian Americans seeing the impact it had on African-American culture and overall society, rejecting being called "[[Oriental]]" and the stereotype of the "[[yellow peril]]" used the term Asian Pride, along with "yellow power", to advance empowerment of Asian Americans.&lt;ref name="Misiroglu2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L.

===Hip Hop culture===
A more modern usage of the term "Asian Pride" (also spelled '''AZN pride''') the [[United States]] is a positive stance to being Asian American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term arose from influences of [[Hip hop#Culture|hip hop culture]] within [[Asian American]] communities in the [[Western United States]] due to the creation of an Asian American pan-ethnicity (the concept was influenced in the late 20th century due to the influence of publications such as ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]'' and ''[[Giant Robot (magazine)|Giant Robot]]'' magazines) that did not specify a specific ethnicity (such as [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]], or [[Hmong American|Hmong]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DiMaggio |first=Paul |last2=Fernández-Kelly |first2=María Patricia  |title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uHJprl1xkmUC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Asian+pride&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XAfUUPPpLOGuiQLk7YHQAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813547572 |page=135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Kathleen |editor1-last=Nadeau |editor2-first= Jonathan H.X.  |editor2-last=Lee |last=Nguyen |first=Jason R. |title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1 |chapter=Pan Asian Americans: "Got Rice?" |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0sEJ_0vV1QC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 December 2012 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313350672 |page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One manifestation of this was the [[Got Rice?]] term, which spun off from the advertising campaign [[Got Milk?]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Malaspina|title=The Ethnic and Group Identity Movements: Earning Recognition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYvUouktxv4C&amp;pg=PA31|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0633-5|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger Asian Americans are finding strength from their Asian identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chou |first=Rosalind S. |title=Asian American Sexual Politics: The Construction of Race, Gender, and Sexuality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVUvp-XcLB8C&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=Asian%20pride&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q=Asian%20pride&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442209244 |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another usage of the term was [[Greg Pak]]'s ''Asian Pride Porn!'', which used [[political correct]] [[pornography]] parody to present Asian Americans in a positive light compared to their [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|portrayal in late 20th century mainstream media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rachel C.

===Got Rice?===
The phrase '''"Got Rice?"''' is a term that was coined by [[Asian American]] youth in the 1990s shortly after the original "[[Got Milk?]]" advertising campaign for the California Milk Board in 1993.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan H. X. Lee|author2=Kathleen M. Nadeau|title=Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BrfLWdeISoC&amp;pg=PA67|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35066-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase has since come to be used as a symbol for the cohesiveness of Asian American cultural identity and cultural pride, especially on the [[Internet]]. It's usually mentioned close to the [[Asian Pride]] slogan.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

The humor is derived from the fact that [[rice]] is a staple food in many Asian cultures. The slogan can thus be viewed as an Asian American cultural response to American media and advertising.&lt;ref name="LeeNadeau2011" /&gt;

There is also a parody song called "Got Rice?", often referred as AZN Pride, which samples [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac's]] "[[Changes (Tupac Shakur song)|Changes]]".&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TuNguyen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thuy Linh Nguyen Tu|author2=Mimi Thi Nguyen|title=Alien Encounters: Popular Culture in Asian America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCt-TShr854C&amp;pg=PA66|date=27 March 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8983-5|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song dates back to at least 2000, and has been described as being in the [[wikt:raptivist|raptivist]] genre;&lt;ref name="Raphael-HernandezSteen2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heike Raphael-Hernandez|author2=Shannon Steen|title=AfroAsian Encounters: Culture, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvqgBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 November 2006|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-7690-2|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also noted as an example of Asian Americans, specifically [[Chinese Americans]], adoption and adaption of [[Hip Hop culture]].&lt;ref name="Lee2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. X. Lee|title=Chinese Americans: The History and Culture of a People: The History and Culture of a People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcLQCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340|date=12 November 2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-550-3|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been referred to as "satirically pro-Asian", for its use of the AZN terminology which is not fully embraced by all Asian Americans.&lt;ref name="DiMaggioFernandez-Kelly2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul DiMaggio|author2=Patricia Fernandez-Kelly|title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mK147fnLIrAC&amp;pg=PA137|date=13 October 2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-5041-1|page=137-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Fung Brothers]] released a modification of the song in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.angryasianman.com/2010/09/ode-to-san-gabriel-valley-eats.html |title=An Ode to San Gabriel Valley Easts |date=29 September 2010 |website=[[Angry Asian Man]] |publisher=Blogger |access-date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====T-shirt campaign====
While the phrase itself presumably began as Asian American slang, the first notable usage is the T-shirt campaign first started by the Asian American magazine ''[[Yolk magazine|Yolk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | author= Olivia Barker
  | title= Eastern Influences Become Icons of Popular Culture
  | url = http://www.modelminority.com/article8.html
  | publisher=USA Today
  | date = March 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Soon, other Asian American organizations began promoting the phrase and selling similar T-shirt designs. The organizations and their proponents intended for the T-shirts to be a fun way of promoting Asian American cultural heritage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Political identi-tees don’t all have to be so in-your-face. The Japanese American National Museum (http://www.janm.org/) in L.A.’s Little Tokyo offers an array of kinder, gentler tees commemorating aspects of Japanese-American heritage both fun and serious. Among the most popular designs, a line of adult and baby tees feature the rallying cry of the lactose liberation movement, "Got Rice?"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |author=S. D. Ikeda 
 |url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/ikeda_asian_tshirts1_archived.asp

 |archivedate=2006-03-16 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many in the Asian American community viewed the design as evidence of significant progress for the viability of Asian American culture and identity; whereas before identity may have been enforced on Asians via stereotypes from the dominant society, the "Got Rice?" shirts were an attempt by Asian Americans to define their identity and to take back those symbols used to stereotype them.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Berner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2762">'''Bloch's Principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] principle in [[mathematics]]
stated by [[André Bloch (mathematician)|André Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=A.|last=Bloch|
title=La conception actuelle de la theorie de fonctions entieres et meromorphes|journal=Enseignement math.|year=1926| volume=25|pages=83–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloch states the principle in Latin as: ''Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito,'' and explains this as follows:  Every proposition in whose statement the [[actual infinity]] occurs can be always considered a consequence, almost immediate, of a proposition where it does not occur, a proposition in ''finite terms''.

Bloch mainly applied this principle to the theory of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of a [[complex variable]].  Thus, for example, according to this principle, [[Picard's theorem]] corresponds to [[Schottky's theorem]], and [[Bloch's theorem (complex variables)|Valiron's theorem]] corresponds to [[Bloch's theorem (complex variables)|Bloch's theorem]].

Based on his Principle, Bloch was able to predict or conjecture several
important results such as the [[Ahlfors theory|Ahlfors's Five Islands theorem]],
[[Henri cartan|Cartan]]'s theorem on holomorphic curves omitting hyperplanes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref="la"|first=S.|last=Lang|
title=Introduction to complex hyperbolic spaces|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Hayman|Hayman]]'s result that an exceptional set of radii is unavoidable in [[Nevanlinna theory]].

In the more recent times several general theorems were proved which can be regarded as rigorous statements in the spirit of the Bloch Principle.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}}

==Zalcman's lemma==

Let &lt;math&gt;\{f_n\}&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of meromorphic functions in a region ''D'', which is not a [[normal family]].
Then there exist a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;z_n &lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' and positive numbers &lt;math&gt;\rho_n &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\rho_{n}=0&lt;/math&gt; such that

: &lt;math&gt;f_n(z_n+\rho_nz)\to f, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|first=L.|last=Zalcman|
title=Heuristic principle in complex function theory|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|
volume=82|year=1975|pages=813–817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brody's lemma==

Let ''X'' be a [[compact space|compact]] [[complex analytic manifold]], such that every [[holomorphic map]] from the [[complex plane]]
to ''X'' is constant. Then there exists a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on ''X'' such that every holomorphic map from the unit disc with the [[Poincaré metric]] to ''X'' does not increase distances.&lt;ref&gt;Lang (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has offices in London, New York and Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Barrow"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2079128/Yachts-guitars-fine-wine-Henry-Moore-As-belts-tighten-families-pawn-times-cash.html?ito=feeds-newsxml| title=Yachts, guitars, fine wine and a Henry Moore: As belts tighten, families pawn four times as much for cash|accessdate=2011-12-28 |work= The Daily Mail|location=London|first=Becky|last=Barrow|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2018 Borro Private Finance has written over $416,000,000 in lending and its average loan size on luxury assets is $70,000.

==History==
Borro Private Finance is a privately held finance company and was first funded by European Founders and partners Eden Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edenventures.co.uk/portfolio_profile.php?id=7| accessdate=2009-04-19 |title=Eden Ventures portfolio - Borro}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the asset lender received two sets of funding, firstly a £7,500,000 investment from Augmentum Capital in April 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/augmentum-capital/investments/investments_list|title=Augmentum Capital - Investments|last=|first=|date=|work=Crunchbase|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; then Octopus in a deal that would allow business to "meet the demands of services".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ftadviser.com/FTAdviser/Mortgages/Products/Specialist/News/article/20110613/5696a180-95c9-11e0-bcd6-00144f2af8e8/borro-signs-new-funding-deal-with-Octopus.jsp| title=borro signs new funding deal with Octopus |accessdate=2011-07-28 |work=FT Advisor}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2014 Borro Private Finance raised $112,000,000 from Victory Park Capital.&lt;ref name="Borro, The High-End Online Pawnshop, Raises $112M To Fill Its Finance Pool, Expand In U.S."&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/borro-closes-112m-financing-from-victory-park-capital-248377271.html|title=Borro Closes $112M Financing From Victory Park Capital|last=|first=|date=|work=PR Newswire|accessdate=2014-04-03|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Borro Private Finance raised an additional $19,500,000 in funding. This round pushed Borro Private Finance's total capital raised to over $200,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.closingcircle.com/borro-uk-ny-based-asset-backed-online-lender-closes-19-5m-series-e-funding/|title=Borro, the UK-NY based, asset-backed online lender, closes $19.5M in Series E funding|last=|first=|date=10 February 2015|work=ClosingCircle|accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoryparkcapital.com/2017/nov-16.html|title=News 2017 {{!}} Victory Park Capital|website=www.victoryparkcapital.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victory Park Capital took a majority stake in Borro Private Finance, expanding its involvement to also include working capital financing along with strategic and operational support.

Borro became Borro Private Finance in July 2018.

==Services==
Borro Private Finance was lauded as the UK's first ever online luxury asset lender.&lt;ref name="Channel 4 News"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.borro.com/in-the-news/channel-4-news|title=borro announces launch on Channel 4 News|work=Channel4|date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after launch the company's advertising campaign commenced on television, aimed at the daytime audience and those seeking to take "discreet" loans online. Credit Today named Borro Private Finance Alternative Lender of the Year in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.credittoday.co.uk/news/news-item.cfm?news=2288 Credit Today Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of Borro Private Finance and the other newly established online loan companies can be aligned to the worldwide economic decline of 2008-2010.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/investment/article5298003.ece| title=Even Hip Hoppers Get Caught In The Crunch?|accessdate=2011-04-27 |work= The Times|location=London|first1=Philippe|last1=Naughton|first2=Miles|last2=Costello}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was felt by some that, with banks cutting back on readily available funds to offer as loans to their customers, luxury asset lenders would be the acceptable alternative and that more people would begin to use the service. This trend to bypass banks and more conventional lenders has not just been applicable to personal finance but has risen in the business sector too with a reported one in four customers using Borro Private Finance to facilitate a business transaction or opportunity.&lt;ref name="Barrow"/&gt;

In its initial four months Borro Private Finance doubled its loan book every month, as a surge in business owners, developers, and City financiers attempted to secure loans on their luxury items gained in more wealthy times. By June 2011 it was reported in The Times that Borro Private Finance conducted its first £1,000,000 loan.&lt;ref name="The Times"/&gt;

In August 2013 it was suggested that online asset lending is a viable option when raising finance for a start-up company. It was also suggested that the increase in popularity of asset lending relates to the speed in which the funds could be released because the loan itself is secured against an asset.

The rise of online luxury asset lending was again underlined in 2014 when an article from Real Homes stating that asset lending could be used to raise finance for major renovations around the house. In the same month, it was presented by This is Money that jewelry can be used as collateral when sourcing funds for a new business.

In response to partner demand, Borro Private Finance introduced a new, long-term loan in March 2015. Term Loans provide loans for 18, 24 or 36 months. Prompted by the launch of the Term Loan, Borro Private Finance changed the name of its flagship product to Bridging Loans. Sale Advance Loans round out Borro Private Finance’s product offerings. This product provides clients with a loan on their luxury asset(s) prior to it being sold at auction or private sale by Borro Private Finance's experts. Upon sale of the luxury asset(s) the net proceeds are then remitted to the client.

On July 4th, 2017 John Allbrook became CEO of Borro Private Finance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://specialistfinanceintroducer.co.uk/borro-appoints-john-allbrook-as-chief-exec/| title=Borro appoints John Allbrook as Chief Exec |work=Specialist Finance Introducer |location=London |date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, replacing Paul Aitken who stepped down from the role.

==In the Media==
Amidst the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal]] in 2009, Borro Private Finance offered any "struggling" MPs a loan at half the normal interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/money/spend-save/julian-knight-good-banking-costs-less-at-sainsburys-really-1804651.html| title=borro rides to MPs Rescue |accessdate=2011-04-27 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=18 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Borro Private Finance was featured in a [[Channel 4]] documentary "The Pawn King" as part of its "First Cut" series which featured Paul Aitken the CEO and founder and an insight into the Pawnbroking industry. Screened at 7pm on Jan 14th, 2011, Channel 4 used the following to describe the programme: "In the tough economic climate, pawning is no longer just the preserve of the poor. First Cut provides a fascinating insight into the pawnbroking business." In a review [[the Guardian]] stated "Aitken's warehouses are crammed with Ferraris and artworks as well as the usual trinkets of sentimental but small financial value" 

In June 2011 Borro Private Finance demonstrated why SME's are turning to short term lenders for cash as reported by the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3910b64a-9e44-11e0-8e61-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1QSdEtU2O| title=Rich drive demand for asset lenders |accessdate=2011-05-24 |work=The Financial Times |location=London |first1=Tanya |last1=Powley |first2=Elaine |last2=Moore |date=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview for [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] Paul Aitken expanded this point showing there was a greater trend in the self-employed and SME's looking for alternatives to bank funding as they are finding it increasingly difficult to raise finance in a conventional manner. So much so that in a Borro Private Finance survey reported in the ''Financial Times'', one in ten small business owners were willing to put up their domicile as security for a loan because of lack of viable alternatives.

At the beginning of 2012 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' highlighted the rise of families using their assets to raise money to pay school fees, solve business cash-flow problems or meet mortgage repayments, whereas ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' Business Club showed Borro Private Finance as a new alternative lender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telegraph Business Club Video|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/business-club-video/finance-sector-videos/9069704/borro.html|date=9 February 2012|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On launching in the US [[Reuters]] reported in February 2012 the increasing number of people using wine collections as security for loans, as Borro Private Finance lends $120,000 in exchange for 128 bottles of [[Chateau d'Yquem]]. Interest in the diverse range of assets used to secure finance with Borro Private Finance was also expressed by [[CNN Money]] in the article “Got a Picasso? Get a small business loan.” highlighting the use of asset based loans by entrepreneurs and small businesses.&lt;ref name="CNNMoney.com"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lamothe|first=Keisha|title=Got a Picasso? Get a small business loan|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/01/smallbusiness/borro-loans/|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=CNN Money|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012 [[Yahoo Finance]] charted the rise of high end asset lending highlighting how people are increasingly lending against assets due to lack of lending from the banks.

In July 2012 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine quoted Paul Aitken’s wishes to expand Borro Private Finance further by creating a presence in California.

In July 2012 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' presented how asset lending has become more popular amongst wealthy business owners that bought expensive assets during the years before the recession and now use them to speedily finance business opportunities. Yahoo cars highlighted the quantity and quality of cars being used to secure a loan.

In October 2012, Paul Aitken (CEO and Founder of Borro Private Finance) explained in an interview for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that there was an increase on small firms using alternative financing methods because those alternative methods are more accessible than the banks.

In November 2012, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' showed how wealthy individuals are using their valuable pieces of art to take out loans in order to raise finance.

''The Times'' reported in February 2013 that Borro Private Finance had appointed [[Nigel Morris]], one of the UK's most successful entrepreneurs and co-founder of [[Capital One]] as chairman.

In August 2013 BestAdvice.net reported on how introducers are providing a business boost to Borro Private Finance, stating that Borro Private Finance had seen a 40% increase in sign-ups to its introducer programme, which includes; wine merchants, art dealers, mortgage brokers, accountants, wealth managers and loan brokers. During the same month, the Financial Times presented that there had been an increase in the amount of fine wine used to raise funds.

In October 2013 the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' showed that Borro Private Finance as a personal asset lender fills a lending void that was perhaps previously unavailable. In this particular report, Borro Private Finance had assisted an individual in releasing equity in a bronze nude torso sculpture.

''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' presented in December 2013 the variety of assets that Borro Private Finance have lent against. The article showed that Borro Private Finance has released equity in everything from Olympic gold medals to F1 cars and Oscars.

''The Economic Voice'' presented in August 2014 that Borro Private Finance were continuing to boost small businesses by offering alternative methods of financing. It was reported in the article that the average SME loan at Borro Private Finance had increased from £24000 to £26000 from the previous year.

In October 2014, the ''Wall Street Journal'' produced an online video featuring Borro Private Finance. CEO, Paul Aitken, was interviewed about the history of the business and how it provides short-term loans to the wealthy.

In February 2015, Borro Private Finance was featured on [[CNN]]’s ''Out Front with [[Erin Burnett]]''. The piece focused on the appeal of Borro Private Finance to the rich and famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.borro.com/news-detail/Funds-for-the-Rich-and-Famous?gid=10180&amp;aid=106915&amp;v=1.1|title=Funds for the Rich and Famous|last=|first=|date=23 February 2015|work=borro.com|accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, ''[[The Times]]'' covered Borro Private Finance and interviewed Group Sales Director, Claire Barrington-Jones about how [[asset backed lending]] is on the rise despite the economy’s recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bridge|first=Mark| url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/borrowing/article4407429.ece |title=Rich, but feeling the pinch?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1563">[[Chemotaxis]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] are expressed in the surface membrane with diverse dynamics, some of them have long-term characteristics as they are determined genetically, others have short-term moiety as their assembly is induced ''ad hoc'' in the presence of the ligand. The diverse feature of the chemotaxis receptors and ligands provides the possibility to select chemotactic responder cells with a simple [[chemotaxis assay]]. By chemotactic selection we can determine whether a still not characterized molecule acts via the long- or the short-term receptor pathway. Recent results proved that [[chemokines]] (e.g. [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]], [[RANTES]]) are working on long-term chemotaxis receptors, while vasoactive peptides (e.g. [[endothelin]]) act more on the short-term ones.  Term ''chemotactic selection'' is also used to design a technique which separates [[eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryotic]] cells upon their chemotactic responsiveness to selector ligands.

{{Alternative dispute resolution}}

'''Conflict resolution''' is conceptualized as the methods and processes involved in facilitating the peaceful ending of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[Retribution (disambiguation)|retribution]]. Committed  group members attempt to resolve group conflicts by actively communicating information about their conflicting motives or ideologies to the rest of the group (e.g., intentions; reasons for holding certain beliefs) and by engaging in collective [[negotiation]].&lt;ref name=F&gt;{{cite book |last1=Forsyth |first1=Donelson R. |date=19 March 2009 |title=Group Dynamics |edition=5th |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Wadsworth [[Cengage Learning]] |page= |isbn=978-0495599524 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions of resolution typically parallel the dimensions of conflict in the way the conflict is processed. Cognitive resolution is the way disputants understand and view the conflict, with beliefs, perspectives, understandings and attitudes. Emotional resolution is in the way disputants feel about a conflict, the emotional energy. Behavioral resolution is reflective of how the disputants act, their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Bernard |date=27 March 2012 |title=The Dynamics of Conflict: A Guide to Engagement and Intervention |edition=2nd |url= |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0470613535 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately a wide range of methods and procedures for addressing conflict exist, including [[negotiation]], [[mediation]], mediation-arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-the-different-types-of-conflict-resolution.htm|title=Conflict Resolution|last=Methods|first=Conflict Resolution|date=14 March 2016|work=14 March 2016|access-date=14 March 2016|via=wisegeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diplomacy]], and creative [[peacebuilding]].

The term ''conflict resolution'' may also be used interchangeably with ''[[dispute resolution]]'', where arbitration and litigation processes are critically involved. The concept of conflict resolution can be thought to encompass the use of nonviolent resistance measures by conflicted parties in an attempt to promote effective resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Roberts |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Ash |editor2-first=Timothy Garton |date=3 September 2009 |title=Civil Resistance and Power Politics:The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present |edition= |url= |location=Oxford, UK |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199552016 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories and models==

===Dual concern model===

The dual concern model of conflict resolution is a conceptual perspective that assumes individuals’ preferred method of dealing with conflict is based on two underlying themes or dimensions: concern for self ([[assertiveness]]) and concern for others ([[empathy]]).&lt;ref name=F/&gt;

According to the model, group members balance their concern for satisfying personal needs and interests with their concern for satisfying the needs and interests of others in different ways. The intersection of these two dimensions ultimately leads individuals towards exhibiting different styles of conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldfien |first1=Jeffrey H. |last2=Robbennolt |first2=Jennifer K. |date=2007 |title=What if the lawyers have their way? An empirical assessment of conflict strategies and attitudes toward mediation styles. |url= |journal=Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution |publisher= [[Ohio State University]] [[Moritz College of Law]] |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=277–320 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dual model identifies five [[group conflict|conflict]] resolution styles/strategies that individuals may use depending on their dispositions toward pro-self or [[prosocial behavior|pro-social]] goals.
 
; Avoidance conflict style
: Characterized by joking, changing or avoiding the topic, or even denying that a problem exists, the [[conflict avoidance]] style is used when an individual has withdrawn in dealing with the other party, when one is uncomfortable with conflict, or due to cultural contexts.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For example, in Chinese culture, reasons for avoidance include sustaining a good mood, protecting the avoider, and other philosophical and spiritual reasonings (Feng and Wilson 2011).{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During conflict, these avoiders adopt a “wait and see” attitude, often allowing conflict to phase out on its own without any personal involvement.&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayazit |first1=Mahmut |last2=Mannix |first2=Elizabeth A |date=2003 |title=Should I stay or should I go? Predicting team members intent to remain in the team. |url=http://sgr.sagepub.com/content/34/3/290.full.pdf |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=290–321 |doi=10.1177/1046496403034003002 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By neglecting to address high-conflict situations, avoiders risk allowing problems to fester or spin out of control.
; Yielding conflict style
: In contrast, yielding, “accommodating”, smoothing or [[thought suppression|suppression]] conflict styles are characterized by a high level of concern for others and a low level of concern for oneself. This passive pro-social approach emerges when individuals derive personal satisfaction from meeting the needs of others and have a general concern for maintaining stable, positive social relationships.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; When faced with conflict, individuals with a yielding conflict style tend to harmonize into others’ demands out of respect for the social relationship.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
; Competitive conflict style
: The [[Competition|competitive]], “fighting” or forcing conflict style maximizes individual assertiveness (i.e., concern for self) and minimizes empathy (i.e., concern for others). Groups consisting of competitive members generally enjoy seeking domination over others, and typically see conflict as a “win or lose” predicament.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; Fighters tend to force others to accept their personal views by employing competitive power tactics (arguments, insults, accusations or even violence) that foster intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrill |first1=Calvin|year=1995 |title=The Executive Way: Conflict Management in Corporations |edition= |url= |location=Chicago, US |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0-226-53873-7 |lccn=94033344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Conciliation conflict style
: The [[conciliation]], “compromising”, bargaining or negotiation conflict style is typical of individuals who possess an intermediate level of concern for both personal and others’ outcomes. Compromisers value fairness and, in doing so, anticipate mutual give-and-take interactions.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By accepting some demands put forth by others, compromisers believe this agreeableness will encourage others to meet them halfway, thus promoting conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van de Vliert |first1=Evert |last2=Euwema |first2=Martin C. |date=1994 |title=Agreeableness and activeness as components of conflict behaviors. |url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=674–687 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.674 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conflict style can be considered an extension of both “yielding” and “cooperative” strategies.&lt;ref name=F/&gt;
;Cooperation conflict style
:Characterized by an active concern for both pro-social and pro-self behavior, the [[cooperation]], integration, confrontation or problem-solving conflict style is typically used when an individual has elevated interests in their own outcomes as well as in the outcomes of others. During conflict, cooperators collaborate with others in an effort to find an amicable solution that satisfies all parties involved in the conflict. Individuals using this type of conflict style tend to be both highly assertive and highly empathetic.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; By seeing conflict as a creative opportunity, collaborators willingly invest time and resources into finding a “win-win” solution.&lt;ref name=F/&gt; According to the literature on conflict resolution, a cooperative conflict resolution style is recommended above all others. This resolution may be achieved by lowering the aggressor's guard while raising the ego.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fitness365academy.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sternberg |first1=Robert J. |last2=Dobson |first2=Diane M. |date=1987 |title=Resolving interpersonal conflicts: An analysis of stylistic consistency. |url= |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=794–812 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.4.794 |issn=0022-3514 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jarboe |first1=Susan C. |last2=Witteman |first2=Hal R. |date=1996 |title=Intragroup conflict management in task-oriented groups: The influence of problem sources and problem analyses. |url= |journal=Small Group Research |publisher=[[Sage Publications]] |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=316–338 |doi=10.1177/1046496496272007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict resolution curve==

There are many examples of conflict resolution in history, and there has been a debate about the ways to conflict resolution: whether it should be forced or peaceful. Conflict resolution by peaceful means is always a better option. The conflict resolution curve derived from an analytical model offers a peaceful solution by motivating conflicting entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Regret Analysis Towards Conflict Resolution |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3173490 |ssrn=3173490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced resolution of conflict might invoke another conflict in future.

Conflict resolution curve (CRC) separates conflict styles into two separate domains: domain of competing entities and domain of accommodating entities([https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conflict-resolution-curve_fig1_325262817 Image of CRC ]). There is a sort of agreement between targets and aggressors on this curve. Their judgements of badness compared to goodness of each other are analogous on CRC. So, arrival of all conflicting entities to some negotiable points on CRC is important before peace building. CRC does not exist (i.e., singular) in reality if the chance of aggression of the aggressor is certain. Under such circumstances it might lead to apocalypse with mutual destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |title=Conflict Resolution Curve: Concept and Reality |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3196791 |ssrn=3196791}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The curve explains why nonviolent struggles ultimately toppled repressive regimes from power and sometimes forced leaders to change the nature of governance. Also, this methodology has been applied to capture the conflict styles in Korean Peninsula and dynamics of negotiation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tuhin K. |last2=Datta Ray |first2=Ishita |title=North Korea's Peace Building in the Light of Conflict Resolution Curve |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2018 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3193759 |ssrn=3193759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political conflict resolution in practice==
[[File:Dayan and el Tell.jpg|thumb|[[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Abdullah el Tell]] reach a ceasefire agreement during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] in Jerusalem on 30 November 1948]]
[[Wars]] may occur between parties who contest an incompatibility. The nature of an incompatibility can be [[territory (country subdivision)|territorial]] or [[governmental]], but a warring party must be a "government of a state or any opposition organization or alliance of organizations that uses [[armed force]] to promote its position in the incompatibility in an intrastate or an interstate armed conflict".&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Warring_party_2 Definitions: Warring party]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can conclude with a [[peace agreement]], which is a "formal agreement... which addresses the disputed incompatibility, either by settling all or part of it, or by clearly outlining a process for how... to regulate the incompatibility."&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Peace_agreement Definitions: Peace agreement]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[ceasefire]] is another form of agreement made by warring parties; unlike a peace agreement, it only "regulates the conflict behaviour of warring parties", and does not resolve the issue that brought the parties to war in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]. "[http://www.pcr.uu.se/research/ucdp/definitions/#Ceasefire_agreements Ceasefire agreements]". Accessed April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peacekeeping]] measures may be deployed to avoid violence in solving such incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bellamy|first1=Alex J.|last2=Williams|first2=Paul|title=Understanding Peacekeeping|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the last century, political theorists have been developing the theory of a [[global peace system]] that relies upon broad social and political measures to avoid war in the interest of achieving [[world peace]].&lt;ref name="RamSummy2007"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McElwee|first=Timothy A. |editor1-first=Senthil |editor1-last=Ram |editor2-first=Ralph |editor2-last=Summy|encyclopedia=Nonviolence: An Alternative for Defeating Global Terror(ism) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yopi-nCzQF8C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2007 |publisher=[[Nova Science Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-60021-812-5 |title=The Role of UN Police in Nonviolently Countering Terrorism |pages=187–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Peace approach developed by [[Strategic Foresight Group]] facilitates cooperation between countries over shared water resources, thus reducing the risk of war and enabling sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/28458Lessons%20Learnt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as a conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Conflict management capabilities of peace-brokering international organizations, 1945–2010: A new dataset|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0738894215572757|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|publisher=SAGE|volume=33|issue=2|pages=198–223|via=|last1=Lundgren|first1=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many major international [[non-governmental organizations]] have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as  in businesses, court systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and educational institutions throughout the world.

==Culture-based==
Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to [[culture|cultural]] practices. In Western cultural contexts, such as [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants, problem solving, and drafting agreements that meet underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding a mutually satisfying ("[[Win-win game|win-win]]") solution for everyone involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ury |first1=William |last2=Fisher |first2=Roger |date=1981 |title=Getting To Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In |edition=1st |url= |location=Boston, MA |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |page= |isbn=0-395-31757-6 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many non-Western cultural contexts, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Vietnam]], and [[China]], it is also important to find "win-win" solutions; however, the routes taken to find them may be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. It can make sense to involve religious, tribal, or community leaders; communicate difficult truths through a third party; or make suggestions through stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Augsburger |first1=David W. |date=1992 |title=Conflict Mediation Across Cultures:Pathways and Patterns |edition=1st |url= |location=Louisville, KY |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |page= |isbn=978-0664219611 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intercultural Conflict in Groups|journal=Journal for Specialists in Group Work|date=December 2016|volume=41|issue=4|pages=350–369|doi=10.1080/01933922.2016.1232769|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
Conflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, including dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and [[primates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Waal |first1=Frans B. M. |authorlink=Frans de Waal |date=28 July 2000 |title=Primates—A natural heritage of conflict resolution. |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/289/5479/586.full |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |volume=289 |issue=5479 |pages=586–590 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.586 |issn=0036-8075 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aggression]] is more common among relatives and within a group than between groups. Instead of creating distance between the individuals, primates tend to be more intimate in the period after an aggressive incident. These intimacies consist of [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and various forms of body contact. [[Stress (medicine)|Stress responses]], including increased heart rates, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who live in groups, display different types of conciliatory behavior. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, giving it a strong [[evolution]]ary value.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} These findings contradict previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by [[Konrad Lorenz]]), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.

In addition to research in [[primates]], biologists are beginning to explore [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] in other animals. Until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates has consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in [[feral]] [[sheep]]. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wahaj |first1=Sofia A. |last2=Guse |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Holekamp |first3=Kay E. |date=December 2001 |title=Reconciliation in the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). |url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |journal=Ethology |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=1057–1074 |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2001.00717.x |ISSN=0179-1613 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Jennifer E. |last2=Powning |first2=Katherine S. |last3=Dawes |first3=Stephanie E. |last4=Estrada |first4=Jillian R. |last5=Hopper |first5=Adrienne L. |last6=Piotrowski |first6=Stacey L. |last7=Holekamp |first7=Kay E. |date=February 2011 |title=Greetings promote cooperation and reinforce social bonds among spotted hyaenas. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210004501 |journal=Animal Behaviour |publisher= |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=401–415 |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.11.007 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; lions, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaver |first1=Ann |date=October 2003 |title=Conflict and reconciliation in captive bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus. |url= |journal=Marine Mammal Science |publisher=[[Society for Marine Mammalogy]] |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=836–846 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2003.tb01134.x |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dwarf mongoose, domestic goats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schino |first1=Gabriele |date=1998 |title=Reconciliation in domestic goats. |url= |journal=Behaviour |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |volume=135 |issue=3 |pages=343–356 |doi=10.1163/156853998793066302 |jstor=4535531 |issn=0005-7959 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; domestic dogs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cools |first1=Annemieke K.A. |last2=Van Hout |first2=Alain J.-M. |last3=Nelissen |first3=Mark H.

==Education==

Universities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research, analysis, and practice. [[Conrad Grebel University College]] at the [[University of Waterloo]] has the oldest-running [[peace and conflict studies]] (PACS) program in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;University at Waterloo. "[https://uwaterloo.ca/peace-conflict-studies/ Peace and Conflict Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; PACS can be taken as an Honors, 4-year general, or 3-year general major, joint major, minor, and diploma. Grebel also offers an interdisciplinary Master of Peace and Conflict Studies professional program. The [[Cornell University]] [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|ILR School]] houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, which offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional training on conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Cornell ILR Scheinman Institute |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/conflictRes/about/index.html |date= |work= |publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also offers dispute resolution concentrations for its {{abbr|MILR|Master of Industrial and Labor Relations}}, JD/MILR, [[Master of Professional Studies|MPS]], and [[Master of Science|MS]]/PhD graduate degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution – Degrees |url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/conflictRes/academic/degrees/index.html |year=2014 |work= |publisher=[[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the graduate level, [[Eastern Mennonite University]]'s [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] offers a [[Master of Arts]] in Conflict Transformation, a dual [[Master of Divinity]]/MA in Conflict Transformation degree, and several graduate certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Graduate Program in Conflict Transformation |url=http://www.emu.edu/cjp/grad/ |date= |work= |publisher=[[Eastern Mennonite University]]'s [[Center for Justice and Peacebuilding]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMU also offers an accelerated 5-year BA in Peacebuilding and Development/MA in Conflict Transformation.

Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action and those that lead to peaceful resolution. The [[University of Law]], one of the oldest common law training institutions in the world, offers a legal-focused masters degree in Conflict Resolution as an LL.M. (Conflict resolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ac.uk/postgraduate/llm/|title=LLM Masters in Law Degree {{!}} The University of Law|website=www.law.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tel Aviv University]] offers two graduate degree programs in the field of conflict resolution, including the English-language [[International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation]], allowing students to learn in a geographic region which is the subject of much research on international conflict resolution.

The Nelson Mandela Center for Peace &amp; Conflict Resolution at Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi, is one of the first centers for peace and conflict resolution to be established at an Indian university. It offers a two-year full-time MA course in Conflict Analysis and Peace-Building, as well as a PhD in Conflict and Peace Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmi.ac.in/aboutjamia/centres/conflict-resolution/introduction|title=Jamia - Centres - Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace and Conflict Resolution - Introduction|publisher=Jmi.ac.in|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict management==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}
'''Conflict management''' refers to the long-term management of intractable conflicts. It is the label for the variety of ways by which people handle grievances—standing up for what they consider to be right and against what they consider to be wrong. Those ways include such diverse phenomena as gossip, ridicule, lynching, terrorism, warfare, feuding, genocide, law, mediation, and avoidance.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Which forms of conflict management will be used in any given situation can be somewhat predicted and explained by the social structure—or social geometry—of the case.

Conflict management is often considered to be distinct from conflict resolution. 
In order for actual conflict to occur, there should be an expression of exclusive patterns which explain why and how the conflict was expressed the way it was. Conflict is often connected to a previous issue. Resolution refers to resolving a dispute to the approval of one or both parties, whereas management is concerned with an ongoing process that may never have a resolution. Neither is considered the same as [[conflict transformation]], which seeks to reframe the positions of the conflict parties.

The role of culture is not always fully appreciated and must be taken into account. In a [http://www.britac.ac.uk/blog/ocean-model-civilization-sustainable-history-theory-and-global-cultural-understanding piece on “the ocean model of civilization”], Prof Nayef Al-Rodhan argues that greater transcultural understanding is critical for global security because it diminishes ‘hierarchies’ and alienation, and avoids dehumanization of the ‘other’.

===Counseling===
When personal conflict leads to [[frustration]] and loss of efficiency, [[counseling]] may prove helpful. Although few [[organization]]s can afford to have professional counselors on staff, given some training, managers may be able to perform this function. Nondirective counseling, or "listening with understanding", is little more than being a good listener—something every manager should be.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Henry P. |last1=Knowles |first2=Börje O. |last2=Saxberg |title= Personality and Leadership Behavior |publisher= Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.|location=Reading, MA |year=1971 |asin=B0014O4YN0 |oclc=118832 |doi= |nopp=true |chapter=Chapter 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes simply being able to express one's feelings to a concerned and understanding listener is enough to relieve frustration and make it possible for an individual to advance to a problem-solving frame of mind. The nondirective approach is one effective way for managers to deal with frustrated subordinates and coworkers.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard Arvid |last=Johnson |title=Management, Systems, and Society: An Introduction |publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co. |date=January 1976 |location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.  |pages=148–142 |isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496 |ol=8091729M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other, more direct and more diagnostic, methods that could be used in appropriate circumstances. However, the great strength of the nondirective approach&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Nondirective counseling is based on the [[client-centered therapy]] of [[Carl Rogers]].&lt;/ref&gt; lies in its simplicity, its effectiveness, and that it deliberately avoids the manager-counselor's diagnosing and interpreting emotional problems, which would call for special psychological training. Listening to staff with sympathy and understanding is unlikely to escalate the problem, and is a widely-used approach for helping people cope with problems that interfere with their effectiveness in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

====Steps to conflict resolution in the classroom====

Step 1: Clarifying and focusing: problem ownership

Negative feelings such as annoyance, anger and discomfort can interfere with understanding exactly what is wrong in situations of confrontation and how to set things right again. Gaining a bit of distance from negative feelings is exactly what such moments call for, especially on the part of the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity. ''Problem ownership'' is defined as deciding who should take ownership of the behavior or conflict in the issue (Gordon, 2003). The main person who is bothered by the root problem is also the “owner” of the problem, and thus the owner of a problem needs to be the one who takes primary responsibility for solving the issue. Identifying ownership makes a difference in how behavior is dealt with, as well as how the problem is effectively solved. It is important to ask clarifying questions to really understand the root causes of the conflict.

Step 2: Active listening

Several strategies help with distinguishing who has a problem with a behavior and who takes ownership. One of those strategies is active listening. Active listening is attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to understand or empathize as much as one can (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Active listening consists of continually asking questions in order to test your understanding. It also requires giving encouragement to the student by letting them tell their story, and paraphrasing what the student says so you can form an unbiased conclusion. It is key not to move too quickly at solving the problem by just giving advice, instructions, or scolding. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down the student’s communication and leave you with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem (Seifert &amp; Sutton).

Step 3: Assertive discipline and I-messages

Once you, as the teacher, have taken in the student’s point of view, form your comments around how the student’s behavior affects your role. Your comments should be assertive, emphasize I-messages, and encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her behavior. They should not be passive, apologetic, hostile or aggressive, but matter-of-fact, such as, “Charlie, you are talking while I am talking.” The comments should emphasize I-messages that focus on how the behavior is affecting the teacher’s teaching and the other students' learning (Seifert &amp; Sutton). An example of this would be, “You are making it hard for me to focus on teaching this math lesson.” Lastly, you should ask the student more open-ended questions that make him or her think about the consequences of his or her behavior, such as, “How do the other kids feel when you yell in the middle of class?” (Seifert &amp; Sutton). 
* The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others—-a strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs, 2003). Instead of simply saying, “When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them”, you can try asking, “How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?”

Step 4: Negotiation

Seifert and Sutton state that the first three steps describe desirable ways of handling situations that are specific and last for only a short time. These steps by themselves could potentially not be enough when conflicts persist over extended periods of time. Often it is better to negotiate a solution in these situations. Negotiating is defined as methodically deliberating various options and deciding on one if possible (Seifert &amp; Sutton). Even though negotiation demands time and energy, it often demands less time or effort ultimately than continuing to cope with the problem. The results of negotiation can be valuable to everyone involved in the situation. Various experts on conflict resolution have suggested different ways to negotiate with students about problems that are continual (Seifert &amp; Sutton). The theories differ in specifics, but typically are generally similar to the steps we previously discussed:
* Determine what the problem is—involves active listening 
* Discuss and share possible solutions, consider their efficacy
* Attempt to reach a consensus: Total agreement on the subject will not always be possible, but should be set as your end goal
* Assess the success of the decision: Renegotiation might be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classroom Management and the Learning Environment|last=Seifert|first=K|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2976">In [[type theory]], '''containers''' are abstractions which permit various "collection types", such as [[list (computing)|lists]] and [[tree (data structure)|trees]], to be represented in a uniform way. A ([[unary operation|unary]]) container is defined by a type of ''shapes'' S and a type family of ''positions'' P, indexed by S. The ''extension'' of a container is a family of dependent pairs consisting of a shape (of type S) and a function from positions of that shape to the element type. Containers can be seen as [[canonical form]]s for collection types.&lt;ref name='containers'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael Abbott |author2=Thorsten Altenkirch |author3=Neil Ghani |year=2005 |title=Containers: Constructing strictly positive types  |journal=Theoretical Computer Science |volume=342 |issue=1 |pages=3–27 |doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2005.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For lists, the shape type is the [[natural number]]s (including zero). The corresponding position types are the types of natural numbers less than the shape, for each shape.

For trees, the shape type is the type of trees of units (that is, trees with no information in them, just structure). The corresponding position types are isomorphic to the types of valid paths from the root to particular nodes on the shape, for each shape.

Note that the natural numbers are isomorphic to lists of units. In general the shape type will always be isomorphic to the original non-generic container type family (list, tree etc.) applied to unit.

One of the main motivations for introducing the notion of containers is to support [[generic programming]] in a [[dependent type|dependently typed]] setting.&lt;ref name='containers'/&gt;

== Categorical aspects ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
The extension of a container is an [[endofunctor]]. It takes a function &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; to

&lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(s,f\right).\left(s,g\circ f\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the familiar &lt;code&gt;map g&lt;/code&gt; in the case of lists, and does something similar for other containers.

== Indexed containers ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
'''Indexed containers''' (also known as '''dependent polynomial functors''') are a generalisation of containers, which can represent a wider class of types, such as vectors (sized lists).&lt;ref name='indexed-containers'&gt;{{cite journal
| author         = Thorsten Altenkirch, Neil Ghani, Peter Hancock, [[Conor McBride]], and Peter Morris
| title          = Indexed Containers

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The element type (called the ''input type'') is indexed by shape and position, so it can vary by shape and position, and the extension (called the ''output type'') is also indexed by shape.

A '''cultural system''', is the interaction of different elements in [[culture]]. While a cultural system is very different from a [[social system]], sometimes both systems together are referred to as the [[sociocultural system]].

==Social theory==
A major concern in the social sciences is the problem of order. One way that social order has been theorized is according to the degree of integration of cultural and social factors.

===Action theory===
[[Talcott Parsons]], a major figure in sociology, who was the main originator of [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] in the early 20th century, based his sociological theory of action system is built up around a general theory of society, which is codified within a cybernetic model featuring four functional imperatives: adaptation, goal-attainment, integration, and pattern maintenance. The hierarchy of systems is, from least to most encompassing system, respectively, behavioral organism, personality system, social system, and cultural system as well. Ritzer and Goodman (2004) summarize Parsons view, "Parsons saw these action systems acting at different levels of analysis, starting with the behavioral organism and building to the cultural system. He saw these levels hierarchically, with each of the lower levels providing the impetus for the higher levels, with the higher levels controlling the lower levels." In an article, late in life, Parsons maintained that the term "functionalism" was an inappropriate characterization of his theory.

===System and social integration===
The British Sociologist David Lockwood argued for a contrast between social content and social transmission in his work on social [[structure and agency]]. Noting that social systems were distinct in structure and transmission. Lockwood's conceptual distinction influenced [[Jürgen Habermas]]' discussion in the classic ''Legitimation Crises'', who made the now famous distinction between system integration and social integration of the lifeworld.

===Cultural and socio-cultural integration===
[[Margaret Archer]] (2004) in a revised edition of her classic work ''Culture and Agency'', argues that the grand idea of a unified, integrated culture system, as advocated by early Anthropologists such as [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and later by [[Mary Douglas]], is a myth. Archer reads this same myth through Pitirim Sorokin's influence and then Talcott Parsons' approach to cultural systems (2004:3). The myth of a unified, integrated cultural system was also advanced by Western Marxists such as by [[Antonio Gramsci]] through the theory of [[cultural hegemony]] through a dominant culture. Basic to these mistaken conceptions was the idea of culture as a community of meanings, which function independently in motivating social behavior. This combined two independent factors, community and meanings which can be investigated quasi-independently (2004:4)

Archer, a proponent of [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], suggests that cultural factors can be objectively studied for the degree of compatibility (and that various aspects of cultural systems may be found to contradict each other in meaning and use). And, social or community factors in socialization may be studied in the context of the transmission of cultural factors by studying the social uniformity (or lack thereof) in the transmitted culture.  Cultural systems are used (and inform society) both through idea systems and the structuring of social systems. To quote Archer in this regard:
: "logical consistency is a property of the world of ideas; causal consistency is a property of people. The main proposition here is the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence can vary independently of one another. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that any social unit, from a community to a civilization, could be found the principle ideational elements (knowledge, belief, norms, language, mythology, etc.) of which do display considerable logical consistency&amp;nbsp;– that is, the components are consistent, not contradictory&amp;nbsp;– yet the same social unit may be low on causal consensus. " (2004:4)

Archer notes that the opposite may be the case: low cultural logical consistency and high social consistency. Complex societies can include complex sociocultural systems that mix of cultural and social factors with various levels of contradiction and consistency.

==Research==	
According to Burrowes (1996), in two recent approaches to the study of culture, in the 1980-1990s, the "cultural studies" and "cultural indicators" approaches, investigators explored the traditionally functionalist concern of "cultural systems integration." These two approaches could be synthesized in the investigating cultural systems. Burrowes (1996) writes, "If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology, and cultural studies caution a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies." Constrained by Merton's [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle range theory]] [note: to be discussed here], the specification of cultural elements and social structures makes possible the investigation of specific cultural and social systems and their interaction.

'''''Dawnsong''''' is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] artist [[Brose Partington]], located at [[Indianapolis Art Center]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. ''Dawnsong'' was installed as part of the Center's ARTSPARK initiative.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Indianapolis Art Center | year=2009 | title=ARTSPARK Sculptures | work=ARTSPARK | publisher=Indianapolis Art Center | url=http://www.indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File/ARTSPARK_harndout_0209.pdf | accessdate=22 December 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925191145/http://indplsartcenter.org/userfiles/File/ARTSPARK_harndout_0209.pdf | archivedate=25 September 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

''Dawnsong'' is a [[Kinetic art|kinetic sculpture]] that serves as an interactive [[Bicycle stand|bike rack]]. A steel obelisk with a hand-crank on it juts upwards with a [[Nest box|birdhouse]] resting on the top. The aluminum bird house has multiple holes throughout its multiple "stories." When the hand-crank is turned the house expands and contracts slightly. The sculpture is placed at the Efroymson Canoe Launch area along the [[White River (Indiana)|White River]] near the [[Monon Trail]].&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK1"/&gt;

==Artist==
{{Main|Brose Partington}}

==Acquisition==

This piece was placed in conjunction with the Center's ARTSPARK which brings together art and nature. Partington worked alongside the City of Indianapolis to plan this work of art.&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK1"/&gt;

==Information==
This sculpture is representative of the artist's interest in [[urban sprawl]]. According to Partington: "In ''Dawnsong'', I am taking the multioccupancy home and through a series of gears and a hand-crank allowing the viewer to transform it into a single, more suburban home. Through this cyclical pattern, it creates the effect of a developing or dissolving community."&lt;ref name="ARTSPARK1"/&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], a '''deflationary theory of truth''' is one of a family of theories that all have in common the claim that assertions of predicate [[truth]] of a statement do not attribute a property called "truth" to such a statement.

==Redundancy theory==
{{main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

[[Gottlob Frege]] was not the first philosopher or logician to note that predicating truth or existence does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} He noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is worthy of notice that the sentence "I smell the scent of violets" has the same content as the sentence "it is true that I smell the scent of violets".  So it seems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property of truth. (Frege, G., 1918. "Thoughts", in his ''Logical Investigations'', Oxford: Blackwell, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth/#SH7a Truth – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-deflationary/#HisDef The Deflationary Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the first serious attempt at the formulation of a theory of truth which attempted to systematically define the truth predicate out of existence  is attributable to [[F.P. Ramsey]].  Ramsey argued, against the prevailing currents of the times, that not only was it not necessary to construct a theory of truth on the foundation of a prior theory of meaning (or mental content) but that once a theory of content had been successfully formulated, it would become obvious that there was no further need for a theory of truth, since the truth predicate would be demonstrated to be redundant. Hence, his particular version of deflationism is commonly referred to as the ''redundancy theory''. Ramsey noted that in ordinary contexts in which we attribute truth to a proposition directly, as in "It is true that Caesar was murdered", the predicate "is true" does not seem to be doing any work. "It is true that Caesar was murdered" just means "Caesar was murdered" and "It is false that Caesar was murdered" just means that "Caesar was not murdered".

Ramsey recognized that the simple elimination of the truth-predicate from all statements in which it is used in ordinary language was not the way to go about attempting to construct a comprehensive theory of truth. For example, take the sentence ''Everything that John says is true''. This can be easily translated into the formal sentence with variables ranging over propositions ''For all P, if John says P, then P is true.'' But attempting to directly eliminate "is true" from this sentence, on the standard first-order [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]] in  terms of objects, would result in the ungrammatical formulation ''For all P, if John says P, then P.'' It is ungrammatical because P must, in that case, be replaced by the name of an ''object'' and not a proposition. Ramsey's approach was to suggest that such sentences as "He is always right" could be expressed in terms of relations: "For all ''a'', ''R'' and ''b'', if he asserts ''aRb'', then ''aRb''".

Ramsey also noticed that, although his paraphrasings and definitions could be easily rendered in logical symbolism, the more fundamental problem was that, in ordinary English, the elimination of the truth-predicate in a phrase such as ''Everything John says is true'' would result in something like "If John says something, then ''that''". Ramsey attributed this to a defect in natural language, suggesting that  such ''pro-sentences'' as "that" and "what" were being treated as if they were pronouns. This "gives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which disappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism..." According to Ramsey, it is only because natural languages lack, what he called, ''pro-sentences'' (expressions that stand in relation to sentences as pronouns stand to nouns) that the truth predicate cannot be defined away in all contexts.

[[A.J. Ayer]] took Ramsey's idea one step further by declaring that the redundancy of the truth predicate implies that there is no such ''property'' as truth.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are sentences...in which the word "truth" seems to stand for something real; and this leads the speculative philosopher to enquire what this "something" is. Naturally he fails to obtain a satisfactory answer, since his question is illegitimate. For our analysis has shown that the word "truth" does not stand for anything, in the way which such a question requires.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This extreme version of deflationism has often been called the ''disappearance theory'' or the ''no truth'' theory of truth and it is easy to understand why, since Ayer seems here to be claiming both that the ''predicate'' "is true" is redundant (and therefore unnecessary) and ''also'' that there is no such ''property'' as truth to speak of.

==Performative theory==

[[Peter Strawson]] formulated a ''performative theory'' of truth in the 1950s. Like Ramsey, Strawson believed that there was no separate problem of truth apart from determining the semantic contents  (or facts of the world) which give the words and sentences of language the meanings that they have. Once the questions of meaning and reference are resolved, there is no further question of truth. Strawson's view differs from Ramsey's, however, in that Strawson maintains that there is an important role for the expression "is true" : specifically, it has a ''performative'' role similar to "I promise to clean the house".  In asserting that ''p'' is true, we not only assert that ''p'' but also perform the "speech act" of confirming the truth of a statement in a context. We signal our agreement or approbation of a previously uttered assertion or confirm some commonly held belief or imply that what we are asserting is likely to be accepted by others in the same context.

==Tarski and deflationary theories==
Some years before Strawson developed his account of the sentences which include the truth-predicate as performative utterances, [[Alfred Tarski]] had developed his so-called [[semantic theory of truth]]. Tarski's basic goal was to provide a rigorously logical definition of the expression "true sentence" within a ''specific formal language'' and to clarify the fundamental conditions of ''material adequacy'' that would have to be met by any definition of the truth-predicate. If all such conditions were met, then it would be possible to avoid [[semantic paradox]]es such as the [[liar paradox]] (i.e., "This sentence is false.") Tarski's material adequacy condition, or Convention T, is: a definition of truth for an object language implies all instances of the sentential form

:(T) ''S'' is ''true'' if and only if ''P''

where ''S'' is replaced by a name of a sentence (in the [[object-language]]) and ''P'' is replaced by a translation of that sentence in the metalanguage. So, for example, "''La neve è bianca'' is true if and only if snow is white" is a sentence which conforms to Convention T; the object-language is Italian and the metalanguage is English.  The predicate "''true''" does not appear in the object language, so no sentence of the object language can directly or indirectly assert truth or falsity of itself. Tarski thus formulated a two-tiered scheme that avoids semantic paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]].

Tarski formulated his definition of truth indirectly through a recursive definition of the satisfaction of [[sentential functions]] and then by defining truth in terms of satisfaction. An example of a sentential function is "''x'' defeated ''y'' in the 2004 US presidential elections"; this function is said to be satisfied when we replace the variables ''x'' and ''y'' with the names of objects such that they stand in the relation denoted by "defeated in the 2004 US presidential elections" (in the case just mentioned, replacing ''x'' with "George W. Bush" and ''y'' with "John Kerry" would satisfy the function, resulting in a true sentence). In general, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ''satisfy'' n-[[arity|ary]] predicate φ(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. ..., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) [[if and only if|if, and only if]] substitution of the names 'a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;', ..., 'a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;' for the variables of φ in the relevant order yields "φ(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)", and φ(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). Given a method for establishing the satisfaction (or not) of every [[atomic sentence]] of the form A(...x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;...), the usual rules for [[Logical connective|truth-functional connectives]] and [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] yield a definition for the satisfaction condition of all sentences of the object language. For instance, for any two sentences ''A'', ''B'', ''A''&amp;''B'' is satisfied if and only if ''A'' and ''B'' are satisfied (where '&amp;' stands for [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]]), for any sentence ''A'', ~''A'' is satisfied if and only if ''A'' fails to be satisfied, and for any open sentence ''A'' where x is free in ''A'', (x)''A'' is satisfied if and only if for every substitution of an item of the [[Domain of discourse|domain]] for x yielding ''A''*, ''A''* is satisfied. Whether any complex sentence is satisfied is seen to be determined by its structure. An [[Logical interpretation|interpretation]] is an assignment of [[denotation]] to all of the non-logical terms of the object language. A sentence ''A'' is true (under an interpretation ''I'') if and only if it is satisfied in ''I''.

Tarski thought of his theory as a species of [[correspondence theory of truth]], not a deflationary theory.

==Disquotationalism==
On the basis of Tarski's semantic conception, [[W. V. O. Quine]] developed what eventually came to be called the ''disquotational theory'' of truth. Quine interpreted Tarski's theory as essentially deflationary. He accepted Tarski's treatment of sentences as the only truth-bearers. Consequently, Quine suggested that the truth-predicate could only be applied to sentences within individual languages. The basic principle of disquotationalism is that an attribution of truth to a sentence undoes the effects of the quotation marks that have been used to form sentences. Instead of (T) above then, Quine's reformulation would be something like the following "Disquotation Schema":

:(DS) Sentence "S" is true if and only if S.

Disquotationalists are able to explain the existence and usefulness of the truth predicate in such contexts of generalization as "John believes everything that Mary says" by asserting, with Quine, that we cannot dispense with the truth predicate in these contexts because the convenient expression of such generalization is precisely the role of the truth predicate in language. In the case of "John believes everything that Mary says", if we try to capture the content of John's beliefs, we would need to form an infinite conjunction such as the following:

:If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then lemons are yellow, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then lemons are green, and...

The disquotation schema (DS), allows us to reformulate this as:

:If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then the sentence "lemons are yellow" is true, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then the sentence  "lemons are green" is true, and...

Since ''x'' is equivalent to ''"x" is true'', for the disquotationalist, then the above infinite conjunctions are also equivalent. Consequently, we can form the generalization:

:For all sentences "S", if Mary said S, then "S" is true.

Since we could not express this statement without a truth-predicate along the lines of those defined by deflationary theories, it is the role of the truth predicate in forming such generalizations that characterizes all that needs to be characterized about the concept of truth.

==Prosententialism==
Grover, Camp and Belnap developed a deflationary theory of truth called ''prosententialism'', which has since been defended by Robert Brandom.

Prosententialism asserts that there are prosentences which stand in for and derive their meanings from the sentences which they substitute. In the statement:

:''Bill is tired and he is hungry.''

the pronoun "he" takes its reference from the noun "Bill." By analogy, in the statement:

:''He explained that he was in financial straits, said that this is how things were, and that therefore he needed an advance.''

the clause "this is how things were" receives its reference from the previously occurring sentential clause "he was in financial straits", according to a prosententialist account.

How does this relate to truth? Prosententialists view the statements that contain "is true" as sentences which do not contain a truth-predicate but rather contain ''some'' form of prosentence; the truth-predicate itself is part of an anaphoric or prosentential construction. Prosententialists point out the many parallels which exist between pronouns and prosentences. Pronouns are often used out of "laziness", as in:

:''Bill is tired and he is hungry''

or they can be used in quantificational contexts, such as:

:''Someone is in the room and he is armed with a rifle''.

In a similar manner, "it is true" can be used as a prosentence of laziness, as in:

:''Fred believes that it is raining and it is true.''

and as a quantificational prosentence, such as:

:''Whatever Alice believes is true''.

Prosententialists therefore reject the idea that truth is a property of some sort.

==Horwich's minimalism==

[[Paul Horwich]]'s theory of truth, known as the ''minimalist theory'', takes the primary truth-bearing entities to be propositions, rather than sentences. According to the minimalist view then, truth is indeed a property of propositions (or sentences, as the case may be) but it is so minimal and anomalous a property that it cannot be said to provide us with any useful information about or insight into the nature of truth. It is fundamentally nothing more than a sort of metalinguistic property.

Another way of formulating the minimalist thesis is to assert that the conjunction of all of the instances of the following schema:

:''The proposition that P is true if and only if P''.

provides an implicit definition of the property of truth. Each such instance is an axiom of the theory and there are an infinite number of such instances (one for every actual or possible proposition in the universe). Our concept of truth consists of nothing more than a disposition to assent to all of the instances of the above schema when we encounter them.

==Objections to deflationism==
One of the main objections to deflationary theories of all flavors was formulated by Jackson, Oppy and Smith in 1994 (following Kirkham 1992). According to the objection, if deflationism is interpreted as a ''sentential'' theory (that is, one where truth is predicated of sentences on the left hand side of the biconditionals such as (T) above), then deflationism is false; on the other hand, if it is interpreted as a ''propositional'' theory, then it is trivial. Examining another simple instance of the standard equivalence schema:

:''Grass is green'' is true if and only if grass is green.

the objection is just that, if the italicized words are taken as a ''sentence'', then it is false, because something more is required for the whole statement to be true than merely the fact that "grass is green" is true. It is also necessary that the sentence "grass is green" means that grass is green and this further ''linguistic'' fact is not dealt with in the equivalence schema.

However, if we now assume that ''grass is green'' on the left-hand side refers to a proposition, then the theory seems trivial since grass is green is defined as true if and only if grass is green. Note that the triviality involved here is not caused by the concept of truth but by that of ''proposition''.  In any case, simply accepting the triviality of the propositional version implies that, at least within the Deflationary Theory of Truth, there can be no explanation of the connection between sentences and the things that they express; i.e., propositions.

===Normativity of assertions===
[[Michael Dummett]], among others, has argued that deflationism cannot account for the fact that truth should be a normative goal of assertion. The idea is that truth plays a central role in the activity of stating facts. The deflationist response is that the assertion that truth is a norm of assertion can be stated only in the form of the following infinite conjunction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One should assert the proposition that grass is green only if grass is green and one should assert the proposition that lemons are yellow only if lemons are yellow and one should assert the proposition that a square circle is impossible only if a squared circle is impossible and...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This, in turn, can be reformulated as:

:For all propositions P, speakers should assert the propositions that P only if the proposition that P is true.

It may be the case that we use the truth-predicate to express this norm, not because it has anything to do with the nature of truth in some inflationary sense, but because it is a convenient way of expressing this otherwise inexpressible generalization.

'''Ecotechnology''' - not to be confused with [[ecotechnics]] - is an [[applied science]] that seeks to fulfill [[human]] needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution, by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects. Ecotechnology integrates two fields of study: the '[[ecology]] of technics' and the 'technics of ecology,' requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of [[ecosystems]] and societies. All [[sustainable engineering]] that can reduce damage to ecosystems, adopt ecology as a fundamental basis, and ensure conservation of [[biodiversity]] and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology.

Ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a [[Holism|holistic]] point of view. For example, [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of rivers should not only consider one single area. Rather, the whole [[Drainage basin|catchment area]], which includes the upstream, middle stream and downstream sections, should be considered.

Construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment.

Sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions. Ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Summers|first1=Max|title=Eco-Friendly IT Solutions that Minimise Environmental Damage and Save Natural Resources|url=https://magora-systems.com/eco-friendly-it-solutions/|publisher=Magora|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources,
* control of impacts on ecosystems,
* development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products,
* eco-marketing,
* introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors, and
* development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public.

During ''Ecotechnics '95 - International Symposium on Ecological Engineering'' in [[Östersund]], [[Sweden]], the participants agreed on the definition: "Ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames."

An '''eternal statement''' is a [[:wikt:statement|statement]] whose [[type-token distinction|token instances]] all have the same [[truth value]]. For instance, every inscription or [[utterance]] of the sentence "On July 15, 2009 it rains in Boston" has the same truth value, no matter when or where it is asserted. This type of statement is distinguished from others in that its context will not influence its truth value. Essentially, an eternal statement is a true statement, regardless of how it used.

The '''Functional Mock-up Interface''' (or '''FMI''') defines a standardized [[Interface (computing)|interface]] to be used in [[computer simulation]]s to develop complex [[cyber-physical system]]s.

The vision of '''FMI''' is to support this approach: if the real product is to be assembled from a wide range of parts interacting in complex ways, each controlled by a complex set of [[physical law]]s, then it should be possible to create a '''virtual product''' that can be assembled from a set of models that each represent a combination of parts, each a model of the physical laws as well as a model of the [[control system]]s (using [[electronics]], [[hydraulics]], digital [[software]], ..) assembled digitally.
The FMI standard thus provides the means for '''model based development of systems''' and is used for example for designing functions that are driven by electronic devices inside vehicles (e.g. ESP controllers, active safety systems, combustion controllers).
Activities from systems modelling, simulation, validation and test can be covered with the FMI based approach. 
 
To create the FMI standard, a large number of software companies and research centers have worked in a cooperation project established through a European consortium  that has been conducted by [[Dassault Systèmes]] under the name of '''MODELISAR'''.
The [[MODELISAR]] project started in 2008 to define the FMI specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through Use Cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products.

The development of the FMI specifications was coordinated by [[Daimler AG]].

After the end of the [[MODELISAR]] project in 2011, FMI is managed and developed as a [https://www.modelica.org/projects Modelica Association Project (MAP)].

The four required FMI aspects of creating models capable of being assembled have been covered in Modelisar project: 
* FMI for model exchange,
* FMI for [[co-simulation]],
* FMI for applications,
* FMI for [[Product life cycle management (marketing)|PLM]] (integration of models and related data in product life-cycle management).

In practice, the FMI implementation by a software modelling tool enables the creation of a simulation model that can be interconnected or the creation of a software library called '''FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit)'''.

== The FMI approach ==
The typical FMI approach is described in the following stages:
* a modelling environment describes a product sub-system by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time, state and step-events. These models can be large for usage in off-line or on-line simulation or can be used in embedded control systems;
* as an alternative, an engineering tool defines the controller code for controlling a vehicle system;
* such tools generate and export the component in an FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit);
* an FMU can then be imported in another environment to be executed;
* several FMUs can – by this way – cooperate at runtime through a co-simulation environment, thanks to the FMI definitions of their interfaces.

  &lt;/ModelVariables&gt;
&lt;/fmiModelDescription&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Comparison to Simulink S-Functions==
FMI is often compared to [[Simulink]] S-Functions since both technologies can be used to integrate third-party tools together.  S-Functions are used to specify a computer language description of a dynamic system. They are compiled as MEX-files that are dynamically linked into [[MATLAB]] when needed. S-Functions use a calling syntax that interacts with Simulink’s equation solvers. This interaction is similar to the interaction that takes place between built-in Simulink blocks and the solvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author1=Stepan Ozana |author2=Martin Pies | work=Proceedings of the 13th WSEAS International Conference on SYSTEMS)
| accessdate=2015-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMI proponents explain that FMI models have several advantages over Simulink S-Functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://synchronics.inria.fr/lib/exe/fetch.php/modelica-fmi-elmqvist.pdf |title=Functional Mockup Interface – Overview |author1=Martin Otter |author2=Hilding Elmqvist |author3=Torsten Blochwitz |author4=Jakob Mauss |author5=Andreas Junghanns |author6=Hans Olsson |work=synchronics.inria.fr |publisher=[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|INRIA]] |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233637/http://synchronics.inria.fr/lib/exe/fetch.php/modelica-fmi-elmqvist.pdf |archivedate=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* S-Functions format is proprietary, whereas the FMI schema is licensed under a [[BSD licenses|BSD license]].
* The building blocks of S-Functions are much more complex than FMI, making it very difficult to integrate in simulators other than Simulink itself.
* Furthermore, the S-Functions format is specific to Simulink.
* S-Functions are not suited for [[embedded system]]s, due to the memory overhead of S-Functions.

There are also several limitations cited when using FMI/FMU:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Memory - Parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are not exposed directly to the outside, which is in contrast to how ECU software is normally organized with respect to memory to allow transparency, simplicity, and efficiency.
* Event handling - Events could increase the runtime for real-time systems in an unpredictable manner.
* Potentially dangerous features can be included on ECU - Some features that make sense for offline simulations should not be present on the ECU.  Examples of features that are either supported or not explicitly forbidden in the FMI include logging and I/O operations such as print().
* Data type support - More supported data types are necessary for optimized code.  For example, there is not a way to distinguish between a uint8 and uint32 variable.

==Tools support==
As of November 2011, FMI is supported on the following simulation frameworks:&lt;ref name="modelica_Jan10"/&gt;

== Accompanying Standards and Recommendations ==
In May 2014, the Project Group Smart Systems Engineering (SmartSE) of the [[ProSTEP iViP]] Association published its Recommendation PSI 11 for the cross-company behavior model exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prostep.org/en/medialibrary/publications/recommendations-standards.html#c1077 ProSTEP iViP Recommendation PSI 11, Smart Systems Engineering, Behavior Model Exchange, V 1.0], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; FMI thereby is the technological basis. The PSI 11 specifies interaction scenarios, use cases, a reference process and templates, which thereby could ease the industrial application. End of 2016 the group published a movie, which should highlight the industrial benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-3iIot0fO8&amp;t=52s Benefits of utilizing FMI for realizing cross-company Systems Engineering], Status February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generosity''' (also called largess) is the virtue of being unattached to material possessions, often symbolized by the giving of [[gift|gifts]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pakaluk, ''Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: An Introduction'', 2005, p. 173 explains the translation difficulties and names ''generosity'' as the least bad translation of Greek ''eleutheriotes'' ([https://books.google.ee/books?id=c1ZR3AU2WIwC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=eleutheriotes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=x2dWc48SmO&amp;sig=yH411BOBRI3g7wSDJyWViC-FVgY&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bVRPVa-XBsmGywP1uYCACg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eleutheriotes&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Generosity is regarded as a [[virtue]] by various world religions, and is often celebrated in cultural and religious ceremonies. Scientific investigation into generosity has examined the effect of a number of scenarios and games on individuals' generosity, and potential links with [[neurochemicals]] such as [[oxytocin]], and relationship with similar feelings, such as that of [[empathy]].

==Other uses==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=The most generous of people is the one who gives to those from whom he has no hope of return.|salign=right |source=— [[Husain ibn Ali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Saying of Imam Hussain |url=https://aliimmam.com/tag/imam-hussain-whoishussian/page/2/ |website=POiSON WORLD |publisher=POiSON WORLD |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Generosity is sometimes used to denote [[Charity (practice)|charity]], (the virtue of giving without expecting anything in return). It can involve offering time, assets or talents to aid someone in need. In times of [[natural disaster]], relief efforts are frequently provided, voluntarily, by individuals or groups acting unilaterally in making gifts of time, resources, goods, money, etc. Generosity is a guiding principle for many registered [[charities]], [[foundation (charity)|foundations]], and [[non-profit organization]]s.

Although the term generosity often goes hand-in-hand with charity, many people in the public's eye want recognition for their good deeds. Donations are needed to support organizations and committees, however, generosity should not be limited to times of great need such as natural disasters and extreme situations.

==Etymology==
The modern English word ''generosity'' derives from the Latin word ''generōsus'', which means "of noble birth", which itself was passed down to English through the Old French word ''généreux''. The Latin stem ''gener–'' is the [[declension]]al stem of ''genus'', meaning "kin", "clan", "race", or "stock", with the root Indo-European meaning of ''gen'' being "to beget". The same root gives the words ''genesis'', ''gentry'', ''gender'', ''genital'', ''gentile'', ''genealogy'', and ''genius'', among others.

Most recorded English uses of the word ''generous'' up to and during the sixteenth century reflect an aristocratic sense of being of noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility.

During the 17th century, however, the meaning and use of the word began to change. ''Generosity'' came increasingly to identify not literal family heritage but a nobility of spirit thought to be associated with high birth—that is, with various admirable qualities that could now vary from person to person, depending not on family history but on whether a person actually possessed the qualities. In this way ''generosity'' increasingly came in the 17th century to signify a variety of traits of character and action historically associated (whether accurately or not) with the ideals of actual nobility: gallantry, courage, strength, richness, gentleness, and fairness. In addition to describing these diverse human qualities, ''generous'' became a word during this period used to describe fertile land, the strength of animal breeds, abundant provisions of food, vibrancy of colors, the strength of liquor, and the potency of medicine.

Then, during the 18th century, the meaning of ''generosity'' continued to evolve in directions denoting the more specific, contemporary meaning of munificence, open–handedness, and liberality in the giving of money and possessions to others. This more specific meaning came to dominate English usage by the 19th century. Over the last five centuries in the English speaking world, ''generosity'' developed from being primarily the description of an [[ascribed status]] pertaining to the elite nobility to being an achieved mark of admirable personal quality and action capable of being exercised in theory by any person who had learned virtue and noble character (Smith 2009).

==In religion==

In [[Buddhism]], generosity is one of the [[Ten Perfections]] and is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] called ''greed''. Generosity is known as [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] in the Bible, and [[Dāna|daan]] in the Eastern religious scriptures.

In [[Islam]] Quran states that whatever one gives away generously, with the intention of pleasing God, He will replace it. God knows what is in the hearts of men. Say: “Truly, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His slaves, and also restricts it) for him, and whatsoever you spend of anything (in God’s Cause), He will replace it.  And He is the Best of providers.” (Quran 34:39)

In [[Christianity]], the [[Book of Acts]] states that [[Jesus]] said that giving is better than receiving ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2020:35&amp;version=NASB Acts 20:35]). 

===In knowledge===
* [[Missionary Church of Kopimism]] says that all knowledge is for everyone and copying or sharing information is sacred.
* According to the Bible, having all the knowledge in the world is useless, without the desire for charity (sharing):
{{"|'''And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.'''|[[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#Chapter 13|KJV: 1 Corinthians 13:2]]}}
{{"|'''And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding '''| Douay-Rheims: Philippians 1:9&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=57&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9#x|title=Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, Philippians Chapter 1|author=|date=|website=DRBO.org|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* In the Bible, obstruction of the flow of knowledge is suggested to be the destruction of mankind:
{{"|'''my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. "Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children."'''|[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Hosea#4|Hosea 4:6]]}}
* '''Vidya Daan'''(विद्या दान) translated as ''knowledge charity'', a concept in [[Dāna|daan]], is a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] that also values the sharing of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskrit.us/vidya.html|title=विद्या - Vidya (knowledge)|author=|date=|website=www.Sanskrit.us|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vidyadaan.in/about/|title=About|author=|date=28 April 2009|website=Vidyadaan.in|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gyan yoga'''/'''[[Jnana yoga]]'''(ज्ञान योग) translated as ''wisdom exercise'' or ''knowledge path'', is the sacred search for true knowledge, in all Dharmic religions.
* In Hinduism, [[Vidya|right knowledge]] is a form of God, and anything knowledge is written or recorded on is considered sacred, to be protected from obscurity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''अपूर्व: कोपि कोशोयं विद्यते तव भारति |&lt;br/&gt;व्ययतो वॄद्धिम् आयाति क्षयम् आयाति संचयात् ||'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Translation: Oh Goddess Saraswati, your treasure of knowledge ([[Vidya]]) is indeed very amazing! If used(shared) it grows and if unused(obscured) it shrinks!
*In Islam, the [[prophet Muhammad]] said: "'''Wisdom is the lost property of the faithful; wherever he finds it he has the right to take it'''"&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi Tradition:4159, Sunan Ibn Majah Tradition:9784, Ibid Tradition:9785, Mishkat al-Masabih Tradition:216&lt;/ref&gt;
:Prophet Muhammad also said: "Whoever is asked about a knowledge that he knows about and then hides it and keeps it away, he will be bridled on the day of judgement with a bridle of fire."&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:en:Selections from Muhammadan Traditions/II|Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and Al-Tirmidhi]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and scholarship ==
Research has shown that generosity is associated with [[empathy]]. In this research, by  [[Paul J. Zak]] and colleagues and published in Public Library of Science ONE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/home.action|title=PLOS ONE: accelerating the publication of peer-reviewed science|author=|date=|website=www.PLOSONE.org|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[peptide]] [[oxytocin]] or placebo was given to about 100 men and then they made several decisions regarding money.  One, the [[Dictator Game]], was used to measure altruism by asking people to make a unilateral transfer of $10 they were given by the experimenters to a stranger in the lab; oxytocin had no effect on altruism.

Another task, the [[Ultimatum Game]], was used to measure generosity. In this game, one person was endowed with $10 and was asked to offer some split of it to another person in the lab, all done by computer.  If the second person did not like the split, he could reject it (for example, if it was stingy) and both people would get zero.  In a clever twist, the researchers told participants they would be randomly chosen to be ''either'' the person making the offer or the person responding to it. This required the person making the offer to take the other's perspective explicitly. Generosity was defined as an offer greater than the minimum amount needed for acceptance. Oxytocin increased generosity 80% compared to those on placebo. In addition, oxytocin was quantitatively twice as important in predicting generosity as was altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001128|title=Oxytocin Increases Generosity in Humans|first1=Paul J.|last1=Zak|first2=Angela A.|last2=Stanton|first3=Sheila|last3=Ahmadi|date=7 November 2007|publisher=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e1128|access-date=30 June 2017|via=PLoS Journals|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001128|pmid=17987115|pmc=2040517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of generosity initiative at the [[University of Notre Dame]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://generosityresearch.nd.edu/|title=Science of Generosity // University of Notre Dame|first=RKD // AgencyND // University of Notre|last=Dame|date=|website=GenerosityResearch.nd.edu|access-date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is investigating the sources, origins, and causes of generosity; manifestations and expressions of generosity; and consequences of generosity for both the givers and receivers involved. Generosity for the purposes of this project is defined as the virtue of giving good things to others freely and abundantly.

The '''golden age of Jewish culture in Spain''' coincided with the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, a period of [[Al-Andalus|Muslim rule]] throughout much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. During intermittent periods of time, [[Jews]] were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. 

The nature and length of this "Golden Age" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as  711–718, the [[Umayyad Conquest of Iberia|Muslim conquest of Iberia]]. Others date it from 912, during the rule of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Caliphate of Cordoba]] ended; 1066, the date of the [[1066 Granada massacre|Granada massacre]]; 1090, when the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the [[Almohades|Almohads]] invaded.

==The nature of the Golden Age==
[[Image:Spanishhaggadah.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Image of a [[Hazzan|cantor]] reading the [[Passover]] story in [[Al Andalus]], from the 14th century [[Haggadah]] of [[Barcelona]].]]
Having invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. [[Al-Andalus]] was a key center of Jewish life during the early [[Middle Ages]], producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As [[Sefarad]], al-Andalus was the "capital" of world Judaism. 

[[María Rosa Menocal]], a specialist in Iberian literature at [[Yale University]], claims  that "tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050828225825/http://twbookmark.com/books/52/0316566888/press_release.html The Ornament of the World by María Rosa Menocal]&lt;/ref&gt; Menocal's 2003 book, ''The Ornament of the World'', argues that the Jewish [[dhimmi]]s living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to ''al-Andalus'', where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on [[proselytisation]] and, sometimes, on [[synagogue]] construction.

[[Bernard Lewis]] takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a "theological as well as a logical absurdity."&lt;ref name = lewis&gt;Lewis, Bernard W (1984). ''The Jews of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; However, also Lewis states:

{{Quotation|Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.&lt;ref name = lewis /&gt;|}} Jews were allowed certain freedoms but, like their Christian counterparts, were prohibited from having administrative authority over Muslims except in a few cases.

[[Mark R. Cohen|Mark Cohen]], Professor of Near Eastern Studies at [[Princeton University]], in his ''Under Crescent and Cross'', calls the idealized interfaith utopia a "myth" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as [[Heinrich Graetz]] in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name = cohen&gt;{{cite book |last= Cohen |first= Mark R. |title= Under Crescent and Cross |publisher= [[Princeton University Press]] |date=October 1995 |isbn= 0-691-01082-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This myth was met with the "counter-myth" of the "neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history" by [[Bat Yeor]] and others,&lt;ref name = cohen /&gt; which also "cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review |year=1997 |volume=88 |issue=1/2 |pages=76–78|doi=10.2307/1455066 |title=  Review of Under Crescent and Cross. The Jews in the Middle Ages by Mark R. Cohen |author= Daniel J. Lasker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth of the Golden Age==
Prior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The [[Visigoths]] were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the [[Visigoths]] joined the [[Catholic Church]], they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and mainly [[Berber people|Berber]] conquerors in the 8th century.

A period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest.{{cn|date=April 2018}} North African Jewish immigrants  and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and his son, [[Al-Hakam II]], the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the [[Caliphate of Cordoba]]. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of [[Jewish Philosophy]]. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim [[Al-Andalus]]. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called [[Toledo School of Translators]], as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to [[botany]], [[geography]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="weiner"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim] by Rebecca Weiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]], the patron of [[Menahem ben Saruq]], [[Dunash ben Labrat]], and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as [[Samuel Ha-Nagid]], [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Judah Halevi]].&lt;ref name="weiner" /&gt; During 'Abd al-Rahman's  term of power, the scholar [[Moses ben Hanoch|Moses ben Enoch]] was appointed [[rabbi]] of [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and as a consequence [[al-Andalus]] became the center of [[Talmud]]ic study, and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] the meeting-place of Jewish savants.

This was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As "[[dhimmi]]s", or "protected non-Muslims", Jews in the [[Islam]]ic world paid the [[jizya]], which was administered separately from the [[zakat]] paid by Muslims. The [[jizya]] has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own [[legal system]] and [[social services]]. [[Monotheism|Monotheist]] religions of the [[people of the book]] were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Fred J. Hill et al., ''A History of the Islamic World'' 2003 {{ISBN|0-7818-1015-9}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing the treatment of Jews in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] and medieval [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], the Jews were far more integrated in [[Political aspects of Islam|the political]] and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic life of Islamic society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages|author=[[Mark R.

Other authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a "myth".&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"&gt;Darío Fernández-Morera: [http://www.mmisi.org/ir/41_02/fernandez-morera.pdf "The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise"], ''The Intercollegiate Review'', Fall 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–31&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the [[1066 Granada massacre]] of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the [[Rhineland]] slightly later.&lt;ref name="Fernández-Morera, 2006, 29"/&gt; The notable Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:

{{Quotation|Dear brothers, because of our many sins Hashem has cast us among this nation, the Arabs, who are treating us badly. They pass laws designed to cause us distress and make us despised. ... Never has there been a nation that hated, humiliated and loathed us as much as this one.&lt;ref name="Finkel"&gt;Avraham Yaakov Finkel (translator): "Rambam: Selected Letters of Maimonides", Yeshivat Beit Moshe, Scranton, PA, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9626226-3-X}}, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==End of the Golden Age==
With the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The first major persecution was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, "more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.
[[Image:Manuscript page by Maimonides Arabic in Hebrew letters.jpg|thumb|150px|Manuscript page by [[Maimonides]], one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in [[Córdoba (Spain)|Córdoba]]. [[Arabic language]] in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letters]]

Beginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], a puritan Muslim sect from [[Morocco]]. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under [[Ali ibn Yusuf|Ali III]], than under his father [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]]). Among those who held the title of "[[vizier]]" or "[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|nasi]]" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician [[Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam]], [[Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial]], [[Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar]], and [[Solomon ibn Farusal]]. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical [[Almohades]].

During the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had been [[Reconquista|reconquered]] in 1085 by Christian forces.

The major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the [[Alhambra decree]] of 1492 and a similar [[Portuguese Inquisition|decree]] by  [[Portugal]] in 1496.

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met. Copyright in such a case protects the particular literary or pictorial expression chosen by the author. But it gives the copyright owner no exclusive rights concerning the idea, method or system involved. ''CIT : [https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ31.pdf US Copyright Office], circular 31 reviewed: 01 ⁄ 2012 P&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In the case of copyright law, it is the work that realizes the idea that is protected (i.e. a document), and it is the act of recording that work that fixes copyright in the item itself.'' – CIT : [https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/protect/p21_protecting_ideas The UK Copyright Service], Issued: 17th May 2007, Last amended: 17th May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''(…) there is likely to be an infringement of copyright if the way the information is expressed in the copyrighted work used without the permission of the copyright owner and no exception to infringement applies to the use. This can sometimes occur even if the precise expression is not directly reproduced, but important elements of the work, such as the structure and arrangement of the information, are copied.'' – CIT : [https://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Legal_Advice/Manage/Precedents/019_Protecting_Ideas.aspx?WebsiteKey=8a471e74-3f78-4994-9023-316f0ecef4ef Australien Copyright Council], ACN 001 228 780, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;''Intellectual property consists of products, work or processes that you have created and which give you a competitive advantage. There are 3 subcategories : '''Industrial property''' : inventions (patents), trademarks, industrial designs, new varieties of plants and geographic indications of origin '''Artistic work''' protected by copyright: original literary and artistic works, music, television broadcasting, software, databases, architectural designs, advertising creations and multimedia '''Commercial strategies''' : trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements, or rapid production.'' – CIT : [https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/start-grow/intellectual-property-rights/index_en.htm Intellectual property rights], [https://europa.eu/ European Union], Updated 22/01/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

The '''International Center on Small Hydro Power''' (ICSHP) is a non-profit institution operating under the auspices of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) to promote the development of [[small hydro power]]. The ICSHP is also the headquarters of the International Network on Small Hydro Power (INSHP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iecoafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=69|title=Hydropower organisations|publisher=www.iecoafrica.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The ICSHP was formed in 1994 by the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) in co-operation with the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Following approval from the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] in 1999 the ICSHP became the first international institution to be established in China. The following year an official agreement between the Chinese government brought the ICSHP directly under the auspices of UNIDO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energypedia.info/wiki/Hydropower_-_International_Organisations#International_Association_for_Small_Hydro|title=International hydropower organisations|publisher=Energypedia |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment has been described as 'one of the major achievements of China's reform and a symbol of world SHP demand, which reflects the international status of China's SHP development'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/the-outlook-for-small-hydropower-in-china/?pagenum=7|title=The Outlook for Small Hydropower in China|publisher=www.powermag.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/jul/21china.htm|title=Chinese know how for small hydropower stations|publisher=[[Rediff]] |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ICSHP was established 'to promote small hydropower development worldwide'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a specific focus on developing countries, south-south co-operation and the promotion of small hydro power for 'the social, economic and environmental development of rural areas'. The organisation provides training, advice, research and information exchange on small hydro power development and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=4|title=ICSHP Main Tasks|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the ICSHP is also in keeping with UNIDO's focus on promoting South-South Co-operation, 'by encouraging more horizontal investment flows'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browne |first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=UNIDO: Industrial solutions for a sustainable future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw9PhbZ8jnEC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= |isbn= |access-date=12/5/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Small Hydro Power Development Report ==
In 2013 the ICSHP and UNIDO published the World Small Hydro Power Development Report. According to Li Yong, Director-General of UNIDO, the report was "a world first compilation of global small hydropower data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/news/press/first-launched.html|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2013|publisher=UNIDO|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed small hydro power development in 149 countries across 20 regions from over 60 different authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/11/unido-icshp-release-comprehensive-small-hydropower-study.html|title=UNIDO, ICSHP release comprehensive small hydropower study|publisher=www.hydroworld.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that while installed small hydro power was estimated at 75 GW, potential small hydro power was approximately 173 GW. Over 50% of the world's potential small hydro power was found to be in Asia however the report noted "It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents". In 2015 it was announced that a second, updated edition of the report would be published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/article.asp?id=471|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2016|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy-l.iisd.org/news/unido-icshp-launch-small-hydropower-knowledge-sharing-portal|title=UNIDO, ICSHP Launch Small Hydropower Knowledge Sharing Portal|publisher=Sustainable Energy Policy and Practice|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energias-renovables.com/articulo/small-hydropower-a-promising-technology-for-rural-20130514|title=Small Hydropower, a promising technology for rural electrification|publisher=www.energias-renovables.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Headquarters==
The ICSHP is based in [[Hangzhou]], [[China]] with additional bases in Hunan and Gansu provinces and sub-bases in India, Nigeria and Colombia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browne |first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=UNIDO: Industrial solutions for a sustainable future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw9PhbZ8jnEC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= Routledge |page= |isbn= |access-date=12/5/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[algebraic K-theory]], the '''K-theory of a [[category (mathematics)|category]]''' ''C'' (usually equipped with some kind of additional data) is a sequence of [[abelian group]]s ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') associated to it. If ''C'' is an [[abelian category]], there is no need for extra data, but in general it only makes sense to speak of K-theory after specifying on ''C'' a structure of an [[exact category]], or of a [[Waldhausen category]], or of a [[dg-category]], or possibly some other variants. Thus, there are several constructions of those groups, corresponding to various kinds of structures put on ''C''. Traditionally, the K-theory of ''C'' is ''defined'' to be the result of a suitable construction, but in some contexts there are more conceptual definitions. For instance, the K-theory is a 'universal additive invariant' of dg-categories&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Goncalo|last1=Tabuada|title=Higher ''K''-theory via universal invariants| journal=Duke Mathematical Journal|volume=145|number=1|year=2008|pages=121–206|arxiv=0706.2420|doi=10.1215/00127094-2008-049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[small category|small]] [[stable ∞-category|stable ∞-categories]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal|last=Blumberg|first=Andrew J|last2=Gepner|first2=David|last3=Tabuada|first3=Gonçalo|date=2013-04-18|title=A universal characterization of higher algebraic K-theory|url=http://www.msp.org/gt/2013/17-2/p03.xhtml|journal=Geometry &amp; Topology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=733–838|arxiv=1001.2282|doi=10.2140/gt.2013.17.733|issn=1364-0380|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation for this notion comes from [[algebraic K-theory]] of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]]. For a ring ''R'' [[Daniel Quillen]] in {{harvtxt|Quillen|1973}} introduced two equivalent ways to find the higher K-theory. The [[Algebraic K-theory#The_+-construction| plus construction]] expresses ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') in terms of ''R'' directly, but it's hard to prove properties of the result, including basic ones like functoriality. The other way is to consider the exact category of [[projective module|projective]] [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over ''R'' and to set ''K''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') to be the K-theory of that category, defined using the [[Q-construction]]. This approach proved to be more useful, and could be applied to other exact categories as well. Later [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]] in {{harvtxt|Waldhausen|1985}} extended the notion of K-theory even further, to very different kinds of categories, including the category of [[topological space]]s. 

== K-theory of Waldhausen categories==
In algebra, the '''S-construction''' is a construction in [[algebraic K-theory]] that produces a model that can be used to define higher K-groups. It is due to [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]] and concerns a category with cofibrations and weak equivalences; such a category is called a [[Waldhausen category]] and generalizes Quillen's [[exact category]]. A cofibration can be thought of as analogous to a [[monomorphism]], and a category with cofibrations is one in which, roughly speaking, monomorphisms are stable under [[Pushout (category theory)|pushouts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mitya/langlands/spectra/ktwcss-new.pdf|title=''K''-theory of a Waldhausen category as a symmetric spectrum|last=Boyarchenko|first=Mitya|date=4 November 2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Waldhausen, the "S" was chosen to stand for [[Graeme B. Segal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the [[Q-construction]], which produces a topological space, the S-construction produces a [[simplicial set]].

=== Details ===
The [[arrow category]] &lt;math&gt;Ar(C)&lt;/math&gt; of a category ''C'' is a category whose objects are morphisms in ''C'' and whose morphisms are squares in ''C''. Let a finite ordered set &lt;math&gt;[n] = \{ 0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; \cdots &lt; n \}&lt;/math&gt; be viewed as a category in the usual way.

Let ''C'' be a category with cofibrations and let &lt;math&gt;S_n C&lt;/math&gt; be a category whose objects are functors &lt;math&gt;f: Ar[n] \to C&lt;/math&gt; such that, for &lt;math&gt;i \le j \le k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(i = i) = *&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(i \le j) \to f(i \le k)&lt;/math&gt; is a cofibration, and &lt;math&gt;f(j \le k)&lt;/math&gt; is the pushout of &lt;math&gt;f(i \le j) \to f(i \le k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(i \le j) \to f(j = j) = *&lt;/math&gt;. The category &lt;math&gt;S_n C&lt;/math&gt; defined in this manner is itself a category with cofibrations. One can therefore iterate the construction, forming the sequence&lt;math&gt;S^{(m)}C = S \cdots SC&lt;/math&gt;. This sequence is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] called the '''K-theory spectrum''' of ''C''.

==The additivity theorem==
Most basic properties of algebraic K-theory of categories are consequences of the following important theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first1 = Ross | last1 = Staffeldt | title = On fundamental theorems of algebraic K-theory | journal = K-theory | volume = 2 | issue=4|year = 1989|pages = 511–532 | doi=10.1007/bf00533280}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are versions of it in all available settings. Here's a statement for Waldhausen categories. Notably, it's used to show that the sequence of spaces obtained by the iterated S-construction is an [[Spectrum (topology)| Ω-spectrum]]. 

Let ''C'' be a [[Waldhausen category]]. The category of extensions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(C)&lt;/math&gt; has as objects the sequences &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrowtail B \twoheadrightarrow A'&lt;/math&gt; in ''C'', where the first map is a cofibration, and &lt;math&gt;B \twoheadrightarrow A'&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map, i.e. a [[pushout (category theory) | pushout]] of the first one along the zero map ''A'' → ''0''. This category has a natural Waldhausen structure, and the [[forgetful functor]] &lt;math&gt;[ A \rightarrowtail B \twoheadrightarrow A' ] \mapsto (A, A')&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}(C)&lt;/math&gt; to ''C'' × ''C'' respects it. The '''additivity theorem''' says that the induced map on K-theory spaces &lt;math&gt;K(\mathcal{E}(C)) \to K(C) \times K(C)&lt;/math&gt; is a homotopy equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weibel | first = Charles | author-link = Charles Weibel | title = The K-book: an introduction to algebraic K-theory | publisher = AMS | series = Graduate Studies in Mathematics | volume = 145 | year = 2013 | chapter = Chapter V: The Fundamental Theorems of higher K-theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[dg-category | dg-categories]] the statement is similar. Let ''C'' be a small pretriangulated dg-category with a [[semiorthogonal decomposition]] &lt;math&gt;C \cong \langle C_1, C_2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Then the map of K-theory spectra K(''C'') → K(''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊕ K(''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a homotopy equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Tabuada | first = Gonçalo | title = Invariants additifs de dg-catégories | journal = International Mathematics Research Notices | volume = 53 | year = 2005 | pages = 3309-3339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, K-theory is a universal functor satisfying this additivity property and [[Morita equivalence | Morita invariance]].&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;

== Category of finite sets==

Consider the category of [[Glossary of category theory#P|pointed]] finite sets.  This category has an object &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_+ = \{0, 1, \ldots, k\}&lt;/math&gt; for every [[natural number]] ''k'', and the morphisms in this category are the functions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f : m_+ \to n_+&lt;/math&gt; which preserve the zero element.  A theorem of [[Barratt–Priddy theorem|Barratt, Priddy and Quillen]] says that the algebraic K-theory of this category is a [[sphere spectrum]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEDjmKdyFAAC|title=The Local Structure of Algebraic K-Theory|last=Dundas|first=Bjørn Ian|last2=Goodwillie|first2=Thomas G.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Randy|date=2012-09-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781447143932|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous==

More generally in abstract category theory, the K-theory of a category is a type of [[categorification|decategorification]] in which a set is created from an equivalence class of objects in a stable (∞,1)-category, where the elements of the set inherit an [[Abelian group]] structure from the [[exact sequence]]s in the category.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;{{cite web|title=K-theory in nLab|url=https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/K-theory#idea|website=ncatlab.org|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group completion method ===
The [[Grothendieck group]] construction is a functor from the category of rings to the category of abelian groups. The higher ''K''-theory should then be a functor from the category of rings but to the category of higher objects such as [[simplicial abelian group]]s.

=== Topological Hochschild homology ===
Waldhausen introduced the idea of a trace map from the algebraic ''K''-theory of a ring to its [[Hochschild homology]]; by way of this map, information can be obtained about the ''K''-theory from the Hochschild homology. Bökstedt factorized this trace map, leading to the idea of a functor known as the topological Hochschild homology of the ring's [[Eilenberg–MacLane space|Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwänzl|first=R.|last2=Vogt|first2=R. M.|last3=Waldhausen|first3=F.|date=October 2000|title=Topological Hochschild Homology|url=https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/1785323/2314834|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=62|issue=2|pages=345–356|issn=1469-7750|via=|doi=10.1112/s0024610700008929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== K-theory of a simplicial ring ===
If ''R'' is a constant simplicial ring, then this is the same thing as ''K''-theory of a ring.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11775">'''Kröger–Vink notation''' is a set of conventions that are used to describe [[electric charge]] and [[Crystal structure|lattice]] position for [[Crystallographic defect#|point defect]] species in [[crystal]]s. It is primarily used for ionic crystals and is particularly useful for describing various defect reactions. It was proposed by [[F. A. Kröger]] and [[H. J. Vink]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=F.

==Schottky and Frenkel defects==

===Schottky pairs===
A [[Schottky defect]] is an intrinsic [[Crystallographic defect|point defect]] that creates vacancies on both the cation and anion sublattices. This defect occurs in ionic crystals when one (positively charged) [[cation]] and one (negatively charged) [[anion]] leave the lattice simultaneously, resulting in two [[Vacancy defect|vacant lattice sites]]. Because the mass, site, and charge must remain balanced, these vacancies always occur in [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric ratios]]. However, due to the loss of ions within the crystal lattice, these Schottky defects tend to lead to a decrease in the density of the material because vacancies have been created.

===Frenkel pairs===
Similarly to a [[Schottky defect]], a [[Frenkel defect]] is an intrinsic point defect that produces a vacancy site on either the cation or anion sublattice along with an [[Interstitial defect|interstitial site]] on that same lattice. In an ionic crystal, this occurs when a cation or anion leaves its site in the sublattice, creating the vacancy, and moves to another location to create an interstitial. These Frenkel defect pairs maintain a balanced mass, site, and charge ratio throughout the relocation of the ions. Since the movement remains within the material's single lattice, the density remains the same.

==Notation==
The notation follows the scheme:
:&lt;big&gt;M{{su|p=C|b=S}}&lt;/big&gt;

*'''''M''''' corresponds to the species. These can be
**[[atom]]s – e.g., Si, Ni, O, Cl,
**[[Vacancy defect|vacancies]] – V or v (since V is also the symbol for vanadium)
**[[interstitial compound|interstitials]] – i
**[[electron]]s – e
**[[electron hole]]s – h
*'''''S''''' indicates the lattice site that the species occupies. For instance, Ni might occupy a Cu site. In this case, M would be replaced by Ni and S would be replaced by Cu. The site may also be a lattice interstice, in this case the symbol "i" is used. A cation site can be represented by the symbols C or M (for metal), and an anion site can be represented by either an A or X.
*'''''C''''' corresponds to the electronic charge of the species relative to the site that it occupies. The charge of the species is calculated by the charge on the current site minus the charge on the original site. To continue the previous example, Ni often has the same valency as Cu, so the relative charge is zero. To indicate null charge, '''×''' is used. A single '''•''' indicates a net single positive charge, while two would represent two net positive charges. Finally, '''′''' signifies a net single negative charge, so two would indicate a net double negative charge.

===Examples===
*Al{{su|p=×|b=Al}} — an aluminum ion sitting on an aluminum lattice site, with neutral charge.
*Ni{{su|p=×|b=Cu}} — a nickel ion sitting on a copper lattice site, with neutral charge.
*v{{su|p=•|b=Cl}} — a chlorine [[Vacancy defect|vacancy]], with single positive charge.
*Ca{{su|p=••|b=i}} — a calcium interstitial ion, with double positive charge.
*Cl{{su|p=′|b=i}} — a chlorine anion on an interstitial site, with single negative charge.
*O{{su|p=′′|b=i}} — an oxygen anion on an interstitial site, with double negative charge.
*e{{su|p=′}} — an electron. No site is normally specified.

==Procedure==
When using Kröger–Vink notation for both intrinsic and extrinsic defects, it is imperative to keep all masses, sites, and charges balanced in each reaction. If any piece is unbalanced, the reactants and the products do not equal the same entity and therefore all quantities are not conserved as they should be. The first step in this process is determining the correct type of defect and reaction that comes along with it; Schottky and Frenkel defects begin with a null reactant (∅) and produce either [[Ion|cation]] and [[Ion|anion]] vacancies (Schottky) or cation/anion vacancies and interstitials (Frenkel). Otherwise, a compound is broken down into its respective cation and anion parts for the process to begin on each lattice. From here, depending on the required steps for the desired outcome, several possibilities occur. For example, the defect may result in an ion on its own ion site or a vacancy on the cation site. To complete the reactions, the proper number of each ion must be present (mass balance), an equal number of sites must exist (site balance), and the charges of the reactants and products must also be equivalent (charge balance).

===Example usage===

*∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′′′|b=Ti}} + 2&amp;nbsp;v{{su|p=••|b=O}}
*:[[Schottky defect]] formation in [[Titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].
*∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=Ba}} + v{{su|p=′′′′|b=Ti}} + 3&amp;nbsp;v{{su|p=••|b=O}}

*:[[Schottky defect]] formation in [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]].

==Basic types of defect reactions==

Assume that the cation C has +1 charge and anion A has −1 charge.

#Schottky defect – forming a vacancy pair on both anion and cation sites:
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=C}} + v{{su|p=•|b=A}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=M}} + v{{su|p=•|b=X}}
#Schottky defect (charged) – forming an electron–hole pair:
#:∅ {{eqm}} e{{su|p=′}} + h{{su|p=•}}
#Frenkel defect – forming an interstitial and vacancy pair on an anion or cation site:
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=C}} + C{{su|p=•|b=i}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′|b=M}} + M{{su|p=•|b=i}} (cationic [[Frenkel defect]])
#:∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=•|b=A}} + A{{su|p=′|b=i}} {{eqm}} v{{su|p=•|b=X}} + X{{su|p=′|b=i}} (anionic [[Frenkel defect]])
#Associates – forming an [[Entropy|entropically]] favored site, usually depending on temperature. For the two equations shown below, the right side is usually at high temperature as this allows for more movement of [[electron]]s. The left side is usually at low temperature as the electrons lose their mobility due to loss in [[kinetic energy]].
#:M{{su|p=×|b=M}} + e{{su|p=′}} → M{{su|p=′|b=M}} (metal site reduced)
#:B{{su|p=×|b=M}} → B{{su|p=•|b=M}} + e{{su|p=′}} (metal site oxidized, where B is an arbitrary cation having one more positive charge than the original site)

==Oxidation–reduction tree==
The following [[Redox|oxidation–reduction]] tree of an ionic species shows the various ways in which a substance can be broken down. Depending on the cation-to-anion ratio, the species can either be reduced and therefore classified as '''n-type''', or if the converse is true, the ionic species is classified as '''p-type'''. Below, the tree is shown for a further explanation of the pathways and results of each breakdown of the substance. (A is a cation and X is an anion.)

[[File:Oxidation-Reduction Tree.jpg|thumb|center|621px|Tree diagram representation of the oxidation and reduction of intrinsic defects in ionic substances.]]

===Schematic examples===
From the chart above, there are total of four possible chemical reactions using Kröger–Vink Notation depending on the intrinsic deficiency of atoms within the material. Assume the chemical composition is AX, with A being the cation and X being the anion. (The following assumes that X is a diatomic gas, namely, oxygen and therefore A has a +2 charge as a cation. Note that this could be used to make an [[oxygen sensor]].)

#For the reduced n-type, with the cation in excess on the interstitial sites:
#:A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} {{eqm}} A{{su|p=••|b=i}} + {{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[gas|g]]) + 2&amp;nbsp;e{{su|p=′}}
#For the reduced n-type, with the anion in deficiency on the lattice sites:
#:A([[solid|s]]) {{eqm}} A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + v{{su|p=••|b=X}} + 2&amp;nbsp;e{{su|p=′}}
#For the oxidized p-type, with the cation in deficiency on the lattice site:
#:{{1/2}}&amp;nbsp;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[gas|g]]) {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} + 2&amp;nbsp;h{{su|p=•}}
#For the oxidized p-type, with the anion in excess on the interstitial site:
#:A{{su|p=×|b=A}} + X{{su|p=×|b=X}} {{eqm}} A([[solid|s]]) + X{{su|p=′′|b=i}} + 2&amp;nbsp;h{{su|p=•}}

==Relating chemical reactions to the equilibrium constant==
Using the [[law of mass action]], defect [[concentration (chemistry)|concentration]] can be related to its [[Gibbs free energy]] of formation, and the energy terms ([[enthalpy of formation]]) can be calculated given the defect concentration or vice versa.

===Examples===
For a Schottky reaction in [[Magnesium oxide|MgO]], the Kröger–Vink defect reaction can be written as follows:

{{NumBlk|:|∅ {{eqm}} v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}} + v{{su|p=••|b=O}} |{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Note that the vacancy on the Mg sublattice site has a −2 effective charge, and the vacancy on the oxygen sublattice site has a +2 effective charge. Using the [[law of mass action]], the reaction [[equilibrium constant]] can be written as ([[square bracket]]s indicating concentration):

{{NumBlk|:|2=''k'' = [v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}][v{{su|p=••|b=O}}] |3={{EquationRef|2}}}}

According to the reaction, the stoichiometric relation is as follows,

{{NumBlk|:|2=[v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}] = [v{{su|p=••|b=O}}] |3={{EquationRef|3}}}}

Also, the equilibrium constant can be related to the Gibbs free energy of formation Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; according to the following relations,

{{NumBlk|:|2=''k'' = [[Exponential function|exp]]{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}}, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] |3={{EquationRef|4}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|2=Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; − ''T''Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; |3={{EquationRef|5}}}}

Relating equations {{EquationNote|2}} and {{EquationNote|4}}, we get:

:exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''G''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}} = [v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Using equation {{EquationNote|5}}, the formula can be simplified into the following form where the enthalpy of formation can be directly calculated:

:[v{{su|p=′′|b=Mg}}] = exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} + {{sfrac|Δ''S''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}}{{big|)}} = ''A'' exp{{big|(}}−{{sfrac|Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;|2''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}}{{big|)}}, where ''A'' is a constant containing the [[entropy|entropic]] term.

Therefore, given a temperature and the formation energy of Schottky defect, the intrinsic Schottky defect concentration can be calculated from the above equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1776">A '''logical [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]''' is a special type of diagramatic structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.

'''Louisine Waldron Elder Havemeyer''' (July 28, 1855 &amp;ndash;  January 6, 1929) was an [[art collector]], [[feminist]], and [[philanthropist]]. In addition to being a [[patron]] of [[impressionist art]], she was one of the more prominent contributors to the [[suffrage movement]] in the United States. The impressionist painter [[Edgar Degas]] and feminist [[Alice Paul]] were among the renowned recipients of the [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]]'s support.

==Background==
Louisine Waldron Elder was born in New York City on July 28, 1855, to a merchant George W. Elder (1831–1873) and his wife, Matilda Adelaide Waldron (1834–1907). She was the second of four children: Anne Eliza Elder, later Mrs. Henry Norcross Munn (1853-1917), Adaline Deliverance Mapes Elder, later Mrs. Samuel Twyford Peters (1859-1943), and brother George Waldron Elder (1860-1916).

===Life in Paris===
Shortly after her father's death, Louisine Elder and her family travelled to Europe for a three-year stay. They set sail on May 25, 1873, aboard the ''S.S. Calabria'', accompanied by their extended family, aunt Amanda McCready and family, and cousin [[Mary Mapes Dodge]], the editor of ''St. Nicholas Magazine'' and author of ''Hans Brinker; or the Silver Skates''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Catharine Morris|title=Lady of the silver skates : the life and correspondence of Mary Mapes Dodge, 1830-1905|date=1979|publisher=Clingstone Press|location=Jamestown, R.I.|isbn=0-9602454-1-3|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Mapes Dodge's sister Sophie Mapes Tolles was living in Paris with her friend [[Emily Sartain]], studying art in the atelier of [[Evariste Luminais]] and boarding in the ''pensionnat'' of Mme. Del Sarte, widow of [[François Delsarte|François Del Sarte]], famed teacher of the art of expression. Louisine and her sister Addie joined Sophie Mapes Tolles and Emily Sartain in boarding at Mme. Del Sarte's, and it was during this time that [[Emily Sartain]] introduced Louisine to [[Mary Cassatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzenhoffer|first1=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|date=1986|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1096-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Philadelphians, Cassatt and Sartain had studied together at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts]] in the early 1860s and travelled to Europe together in the fall of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathews|first1=Nancy Mowll|title=Mary Cassatt: A Life|date=1998|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-07754-4|pages=76-82}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Mary Cassatt took Louisine Elder under her wing, becoming a mentor and encouraging her to make her first art acquisition, a pastel by Edgar Degas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weitzenhoffer|first1=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|date=1886|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc|location=New York|isbn=0-8109-1096-9|pages=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, particularly after Louisine married [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer|Henry O. Havemeyer,]] Cassatt became an advisor to the Havemeyers, helping to build their art collection and facilitating the working relationship which they would have with the [[Impressionism|Impressionist Artists]], including [[Edgar Degas]], [[Edouard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Claude Monet]]. A lifelong friendship developed between Louisine Havemeyer and Mary Cassatt, who later made several pastels of Louisine and her children.

===Art Collection===
Together with her husband, Louisine would build perhaps the finest art collection in America. Her three-story mansion at Fifth Avenue and East 66th Street in New York was filled with the finest possible examples of works by [[Manet]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]]. The home was decorated 1889-1890 by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Samuel Colman]], who made it an elegant showplace for their patron's varied and important collections.&lt;ref name=Weitzenhoffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Weitzenhoffer|first=Frances|title=The Havemeyers: Impressionism Comes to America|year=1986|publisher=Harry Abrams|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8109-1096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Clay Frick]], [[J.P. Morgan]], and Mrs. [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] were among the collectors with which Mr. and Mrs. Havemeyer would have known and competed.

===Family life===
On August 22, 1883, a decade after her father's death, Louisine married [[Henry O. Havemeyer]] of the [[American Sugar Refining Company]].*

Louisine and Henry Osborne had three children:
*Adaline Havemeyer, a.k.a. Mrs. [[Peter Frelinghuysen Jr.|Peter H.B. Frelinghuysen]] &amp;mdash; (1884–1963)
*Horace Havemeyer &amp;mdash; (1886–1956)
*[[Electra Havemeyer Webb|Electra Havemeyer]], a.k.a. Mrs. James Watson Webb &amp;mdash; (1888–1960)

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''(Prior to his marriage to Louisine, Henry was married to Louisine's aunt Mary Louise Elder (1847-1897), but that marriage ended in divorce.)''

==Legacy==
In addition to her standing as an early and important collector of Impressionist art, Louisine Havemeyer was an advocate of women's rights.
[[File:Louisine havemeyer prison special.jpg|thumb|300px|Policeman in Syracuse welcoming Louisine Havemeyer on the arrival of the [[National Woman's Party|Prison Special]] in 1919.]]

===Suffrage activist===
After her husband's death in 1907, Mrs. Havemeyer focused her attention on the [[Suffrage movement|women's suffrage movement]]. In 1912 she lent her artistic collection to [[Knoedler]]'s Gallery in New York to raise money for the cause.&lt;ref name="Pollock2013"/&gt; In 1913, she founded the [[National Woman's Party]] with the radical suffragist [[Alice Paul]]. (The organization was previously known as the "Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage".) She repeated the money raising art exhibition at Knoedler's in 1915.&lt;ref name="Pollock2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Griselda Pollock|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJZF2IhysUcC&amp;pg=PA204|date=15 April 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-08440-0|pages=204–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

With the financial backing of Mrs. Havemeyer and others like her, Ms. Paul launched an increasingly confrontational series of protests that agitated for the right to vote.  Paul's most famous efforts were the 1913 National Suffrage Parade, which produced a riot on the eve of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first inauguration, and the wartime picketing of the White House.  During the latter Paul used portions of the President's speeches heralding the defense of democracy in Europe which she masterfully contrasted with the denial of liberty to American women.  When jailed for obstructing traffic in 1917, she hunger struck, bringing tremendous pressure to bear on the Congress and Wilson Administration.  The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which extended voting rights to women, was debated by Congress, gained the necessary 2/3 votes in 1919, was sent to the states for ratification, and gained the necessary 3/4 of states ratifying in 1920.  

Louisine Havemeyer became a well-known suffragist, publishing two articles about her work for the cause in [[Scribner's Magazine]]. The first, entitled "The Prison Special: Memories of a Militant", appeared in May 1922, and the other, "The Suffrage Torch: Memories of a Militant" appeared in June the same year.&lt;ref name="Great Women Collectors"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gere|first=Charlotte|title=Great women collectors|date=1999|publisher=P. Wilson|location=London|isbn=0856675032|page=138|author2=Vaizey, Marina }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 and 1915, Mrs. Havemeyer organized exhibitions of art works from her collection at [[Knoedler]] Gallery to raise funds to support suffrage efforts.&lt;ref name=Canon&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=1135084475}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She participated in marches, much to the dismay of her children {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, down New York's famed Fifth Avenue and addressed a standing room only audience at [[Carnegie Hall]] upon the completion of a nationwide speaking tour.  A famous photograph of Mrs. Havemeyer shows her with an electric torch, similar in design to that of the [[Statue of Liberty]], among other prominent suffragists. Her attempt to burn an effigy of President Wilson outside the White House in 1919 drew national attention.

After a period of failing health, Mrs. Havemeyer died in 1929. Mrs. Havemeyer is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The terms of her will left a few choice paintings to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.  The final bequest, made possible by the generosity of her children, included nearly two-thousand works that enrich nearly every segment of the museum's collections.

Many Tiffany pieces from her Fifth Avenue home, including a magnificent peacock mantelpiece decoration, and a chandelier are on permanent display at the [[University of Michigan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Museum of Art catalog|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?rgn1=musart_an&amp;select1=starts&amp;q1=1986.146&amp;op2=And&amp;rgn2=ic_all&amp;select2=all&amp;q2=&amp;op3=And&amp;rgn3=ic_all&amp;select3=all&amp;q3=&amp;rgn4=musart_da_start&amp;op4=And&amp;q4=&amp;q4=&amp;rgn9=musart_iod&amp;sel9=ic_exact&amp;op9=And&amp;view=thumbnail&amp;type=boolean&amp;c=musart|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the Music Room furniture suite is on view at the [[Shelburne Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electra Havemeyer Webb Memorial Building at Shelburne Museum|url=http://shelburnemuseum.org/explore/buildings/galleries/electra-havemeyer-webb-memorial-building/|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family Legacy ===
Louisine's children would continue to build upon their family's legacy as art collectors. Louisine's daughter [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] collected American fine and folk paintings and sculpture that helped to found the [[Shelburne Museum]]. The museum showcases a "collection of collections" in fine examples of early American homes and public buildings; a general store, meeting house, log cabin, and even a steamship dot the grounds. Her great-grandson, [[John Wilmerding]], is a well known professor of art, collector, and [[curator]], and is best known as a prolific author of books on American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8644-2004May7_2.html|title=John Wilmerding, Giving His Awe for American Art (washingtonpost.com)|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Adeline and son Horace Havemeyer, and Horace Havemeyer, Jr. bequeathed several works from [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], and others to the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/global-site-search-page.html?searchterm=havemeyer&amp;:cq_csrf_token=undefined|title=Global Site Search Page|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mónica Rey Gutiérrez''' (born 1964) is an [[Afro-Bolivian]] cultural leader and activist whose [[anthropological]] research helped pass legislation for formal recognition of Afro-Bolivians as an ethnic category in the census of the country. After serving as an educator and cultural activist for many years, she went to work in the government. She is currently a supranational delegate in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] of [[Bolivia]].

==Early life==
Adalberta Mónica Rey Gutiérrez was born on 23 April 1964 in Comunidad Marca, of the [[Nor Yungas Province]], [[La Paz Department, Bolivia]]. She was raised in the Comunidad Santa Ana, near [[Coroico]] by her mother, Florentina Gutiérrez Barra, and step-father, Simeón Rey Barra.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}{{sfn|Legislative Assembly of Bolivia|2017}} Rey moved to [[La Paz]] when she was eleven and continued her schooling at the boarding school Hogar y Colegio Ave María. She was the first Afro-Bolivian to graduate with a high school diploma from the school. Rey continued her education at the [[Higher University of San Andrés]] ({{lang-es|Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA)}})and earned a bachelor’s degree in [[Communication studies|social communications]] in 1997. Her thesis, ''La Saya como medio de comunicación y expresión cultural en la comunidad Afroboliviana'' (Saya as Mode of Communication and Cultural Expression in the Afro-Bolivian Community) was the first substantial work which had been extensively researched which analyzed the Afro-Bolivian segment of the population.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} In interviews with community elders, Rey discovered that members of the Yungas communities still had songs and ceremonies performed in African languages.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} The thesis evaluated the importance of ''[[Saya (artform)|saya]]'', a unique song and dance tradition to the identity of Afro-Bolivians, confirming that it was not a musical performance, but an integral part of their cultural expression. It became an important reference for both researchers who followed, and journalists.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

While still in college, Rey emerged as one of the leaders of the identity movement of Afro-Bolivians, which at that time was made up mostly of young people who had moved from the countryside to the capital for education or work. They began performing ''saya'' at public events and gained official recognition of their organization,{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Cultural Saya Afroboliviana (MCSA)}}), which was created in 1989 to revive and assert the cultural traditions of Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} One of their first successes was to replace the vernacular way of referencing the people of African descent in Bolivia from being called ''negritos'' (dear/cute little blacks) or ''morenos'' (dark-colored people) to ''Afroboliviano'', recognizing that blacks were a distinct ethnic group but also Bolivian.{{sfn|Busdiecker|2016|p=125}} In 1994, she led a march on the presidential palace to gain recognition for Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} Rey, one of the founders of the organization, served as president of MCSA from 1996 to 2001.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}}   

==Career==
Almost immediately after her graduation, Rey began working with a group of team members on a project sponsored by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] to conduct research and survey conditions throughout the country effecting the Afro-Bolivian population. Their findings reported as, ''Diagnóstico de la situación del pueblo negro en Bolivia'' (Diagnostic of the Situation of the Black Community in Bolivia), estimated for the first time the size of that segment of the population to be around 20,000. Another booklet, ''El tambor mayor'' (The main drum), written in conjunction with the Fundación Simón y Patiño, was produced in 1998 by Rey, who coordinated a group effort written on the culture and history of Afro-Bolivians. That same year, Rey took a position in the General Directorate of Archaeology and Anthropology, leaving after one year to teach at the {{ill|Franz Tamayo Private University|es|Universidad Privada Franz Tamayo}} (UniFranz). After five years, she left UniFranz and in 2004 began teaching at her alma mater, UMSA.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

Between 1990 and 2009, Rey participated in and led workshops at many international events related to the [[African diaspora]] traveling to [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], the United States, [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]].{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She also served as the Bolivian representative at numerous meetings of African American organizations throughout the continent.{{sfn|Ceaser|2001|p=3}} In 2009, Rey accepted a post in the Ministry of Culture became the Director General of the Fight Against Racism within the Vice-Ministry of Decolonization. The following year, she became an advisor to the Office of the Ministry of Productive Development and Plural Economy{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} and at the same time, Afro-Bolivians were allowed to participate in the government and as part of the Departmental Council. They formed the National Council of Afro-Bolivians ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional del Afroboliviano (Conafro)}}) on which Rey served as secretary of communication and international relations.{{sfn|Inarra|2011}}{{sfn|Legislative Assembly of Bolivia|2017}} In 2012, for the first time Bolivians of African descent were enumerated on the national population census as a specific ethnic group. Census data, which counted citizens over age fifteen, showed that the Afro-Bolivian sector represented 16,329 people compared to the 10 million people in the entire population.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}}

In 2014 Rey became Director General of Consumer Protection in the Ministry of Productive Development and was elected as supranational deputy in the [[Chamber of Deputies]] of the administration of President [[Evo Morales]].{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She introduced legislation in 2016 to protect the human and civil rights of the African community in Bolivia including anti-discrimination provisions.{{sfn|''El Diario''|2016}}

Rey has published articles both nationally and internationally in journals as well as having been the subject of interview for other researchers and journalists on Afro-Bolivian themes.{{sfn|Busdiecker (OUP)|2016}} She is one of the few authors who have created major reference works on Afro-Bolivian people.{{sfn|Walker|2001|p=330}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5275">In [[modal logic]], the '''necessity of identity''' is the thesis that for every object x and object y, if x and y are the same object, it is [[necessary proposition|necessary]] that x and y are the same object.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, J., ‘On a derivation of the necessity of identity’, Synthese May 2014, Volume 191, Issue 7,  pp 1567–1585, p 1567&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis is best known for its association with [[Saul Kripke]], who published it in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, S. ‘Identity and Necessity’, in Milton K. Munitz (ed.), ''Identity and Individuation''. New York University Press. pp. 135-164 (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; although it was first derived by the logician [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Ruth Barcan, ‘[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/marcus/Barcan_Identity.pdf Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order]’, ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 1947 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, in simplified form, by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O. Quine]] in 1953&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W.V.O., ‘Three Grades of Modal Involvement’ ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 1953, 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kripke's derivation==
The derivation in Kripke's 'Identity and Necessity' is in three steps:
 
:(1) ∀x nec(x = x)
:(2) ∀x∀y(x = y → (nec(x = x) → nec(x = y))) 
:(3) ∀x∀y(x = y → nec(x = y))

The first premiss is simply postulated: every object is identical to itself. The second is an application of the [[Identity of indiscernibles#Indiscernibility of identicals|principle of substitutivity]]: if a = b, then a has all the properties b has, thus from Fa, infer Fb, where F is 'nec(a = --)'. The third follows by elementary predicate logic.

===Rigid designation===
{{see|Rigid designator}}
In the later ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'', Kripke suggested that the principle could be derived directly, assuming what he called [[Rigid designator|rigid designation]]. A term is a rigid designator when it designates the same object in every [[possible world]] in which that object exists. When a name’s referent is fixed by the original act of naming, it becomes a rigid designator. Some examples of rigid designators include proper names (i.e. ‘Richard Nixon’), natural kind terms ( i.e. ‘gold’ or ‘H2O’) and some descriptions.

Proper names are typically rigid designators, but [[definite description]]s are typically not. So we can speak of "Richard Nixon" referring to the same person in all possible worlds, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” could refer to many different people. According to Kripke, the proper name “Richard Nixon” can only be used rigidly, but the description “the man who won the 1968 election” can be used non-rigidly.  Kripke argues,&lt;ref&gt;‘Identity and Necessity’ p. 154, there is a similar argument in ''Naming and Necessity'' p.104)&lt;/ref&gt; that if names are rigid designators, then identity must be necessary, because the names ‘a’ and ‘b’ will be rigid designators of an object x if a is identical to b, and so in every possible world, ‘a’ and ‘b’ will both refer to this same object x, and no other, and there could be no situation in which a might not have been b, otherwise x would not have been identical with itself.

:Waiving fussy considerations deriving from the fact that x need not have necessary existence, it was clear from (x) nec (x = x) and Leibniz’s law that identity is an ‘internal’ relation: (x) (y) (x = y -&gt; nec (x = y)). (What pairs (x, y) could be counterexamples? Not pairs of distinct objects, for then the antecedent is false; nor any pair of an object and itself, for then the consequent is true.) If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are rigid designators, it follows that ‘a = b’, if true, is a necessary truth. If ‘a’ and ‘b’ are not rigid designators, no such conclusion follows about the statement ‘a = b’ (though the objects designated by ‘a’ and ‘b’ will be necessarily identical).&lt;ref&gt;Naming and Necessity p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not mean that we have knowledge of this necessity. Before the discovery that Hesperus (the evening star) and Phosphorus (the morning star) were the same planet, this fact was not known, and could not have been inferred from [[A priori and a posteriori|first principles]]. Thus there can be [[a posteriori necessity]].

The principle can also be applied to [[natural kind]]s. If [[water]] is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then water is ''necessarily'' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'. Therefore, water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, but that does not affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed is that water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but ''conditionally'', ''if'' water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it is true), then water is necessarily H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

'''Newton's laws of motion''' are three [[physical law]]s that, together, laid the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]. They describe the relationship between a body and the [[force]]s acting upon it, and its [[motion (physics)|motion]] in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three centuries,&lt;ref&gt;For explanations of Newton's laws of motion by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in the early 18th century, by the physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] in the mid-19th century, and by a modern text of the early 21st century, see:-

The three laws of motion were first compiled by [[Isaac Newton]] in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (''Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy''), first published in 1687.&lt;ref name=Principia&gt;See the ''Principia'' on line at [https://archive.org/details/newtonspmathema00newtrich Andrew Motte Translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton used them to explain and investigate the motion of many physical objects and systems.&lt;ref name=Motte&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/~gravitee/axioms.htm Andrew Motte translation of Newton's ''Principia'' (1687) ''Axioms or Laws of Motion'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the third volume of the text, Newton showed that these laws of motion, combined with his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], explained [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].

A '''fourth law''' is often also described in the bibliography, which states that forces add up like vectors, that is, that forces obey the [[Superposition principle|principle of superposition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greiner|first1=Walter|title=Classical mechanics: point particles and relativity|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-21851-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeidler|first1=E.|title=Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications IV: Applications to Mathematical Physics|date=1988|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4612-4566-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wachter|first1=Armin|last2=Hoeber|first2=Henning|title=Compendium of theoretical physics|date=2006|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-387-25799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|150px|Isaac Newton (1643–1727), the physicist who formulated the laws]]
Newton's laws are applied to objects which are idealised as single point masses,&lt;ref&gt;''[...]while Newton had used the word 'body' vaguely and in at least three different meanings, Euler realized that the statements of Newton are generally correct only when applied to masses concentrated at isolated points;''{{Cite book| last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford A.| last2 = Becchi| first2 = Antonio| last3 = Benvenuto| first3 = Edoardo| title = Essays on the history of mechanics: in memory of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell and Edoardo Benvenuto| publisher = Birkhäuser| date = 2003| location = New York| page = 207| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6LO_U6T-HvsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essays+in+the+History&amp;cd=9#v=snippet&amp;q=%22isolated%20points%22| isbn = 3-7643-1476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that the size and shape of the object's body are neglected to focus on its motion more easily. This can be done when the object is small compared to the distances involved in its analysis, or the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] and rotation of the body are of no importance. In this way, even a planet can be idealised as a particle for analysis of its orbital motion around a star.

In their original form, Newton's laws of motion are not adequate to characterise the motion of [[rigid bodies]] and [[deformable bodies]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1750 introduced a generalisation of Newton's laws of motion for rigid bodies called [[Euler's laws of motion]], later applied as well for deformable bodies assumed as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]]. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's laws can be derived from Newton's laws. Euler's laws can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubliner |first=Jacob |title=Plasticity Theory (Revised Edition) |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2008 |url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |isbn=0-486-46290-0 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331022415/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~coby/plas/pdf/book.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton's laws hold only with respect to a certain set of [[frames of reference]] called [[Inertial reference frame|Newtonian or inertial reference frames]]. Some authors interpret the first law as defining what an inertial reference frame is; from this point of view, the second law holds only when the observation is made from an inertial reference frame, and therefore the first law cannot be proved as a special case of the second. Other authors do treat the first law as a corollary of the second.&lt;ref name=tseitlin&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/j42866672t863506/ |title= Newton's First Law: Text, Translations, Interpretations and Physics Education |journal= Science &amp; Education | author= Galili, I. | author2= Tseitlin, M. |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |year= 2003 |pages= 45–73 |doi= 10.1023/A:1022632600805 |bibcode = 2003Sc&amp;Ed..12...45G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/1np/ch04/ch04.html |title= Newtonian Physics |author= Benjamin Crowell |chapter= 4.

In the given interpretation [[mass]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and (most importantly) [[force]] are assumed to be externally defined quantities. This is the most common, but not the only interpretation of the way one can consider the laws to be a definition of these quantities.

Newtonian mechanics has been superseded by [[special relativity]], but it is still useful as an approximation when the speeds involved are much slower than the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;In making a modern adjustment of the second law for (some of) the effects of relativity, ''m'' would be treated as the [[relativistic mass]], producing the relativistic expression for momentum, and the third law might be modified if possible to allow for the finite signal propagation speed between distant interacting particles.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
===Newton's first law===
{{Main|Inertia}}

The first law states that if the [[net force]] (the [[vector sum]] of all forces acting on an object) is zero, then the [[velocity]] of the object is constant. Velocity is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity which expresses both the object's [[speed]] and the direction of its motion; therefore, the statement that the object's velocity is constant is a statement that both its speed and the direction of its motion are constant.

The first law can be stated mathematically when the mass is a non-zero constant, as,
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum \mathbf{F} = 0\; \Leftrightarrow\; \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v} }{\mathrm{d}t} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently,
* An object that is at rest will stay at rest unless a force acts upon it.
* An object that is in motion will not change its velocity unless a force acts upon it.

This is known as ''uniform motion''. An object ''continues'' to do whatever it happens to be doing unless a force is exerted upon it. If it is at rest, it continues in a state of rest (demonstrated when a tablecloth is skilfully whipped from under dishes on a tabletop and the dishes remain in their initial state of rest). If an object is moving, it continues to move without turning or changing its speed. This is evident in space probes that continuously move in outer space. Changes in motion must be imposed against the tendency of an object to retain its state of motion. In the absence of net forces, a moving object tends to move along a straight line path indefinitely.

Newton placed the first law of motion to establish [[frames of reference]] for which the other laws are applicable. The first law of motion postulates the existence of at least one [[frame of reference]] called a Newtonian or [[inertial reference frame]], relative to which the motion of a particle not subject to forces is a straight line at a constant speed.&lt;ref name=tseitlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ggPXQAeeRLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=1852334266#PPA6,M1 |title=Special relativity |page=6 |author=NMJ Woodhouse |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |isbn=1-85233-426-6 |location=London/Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's first law is often referred to as the ''[[Inertia|law of inertia]]''. Thus, a condition necessary for the uniform motion of a particle relative to an inertial reference frame is that the total net [[force]] acting on it is zero. In this sense, the first law can be restated as:

{{quote|''In every material universe, the motion of a particle in a preferential reference frame Φ is determined by the action of forces whose total vanished for all times when and only when the velocity of the particle is constant in Φ. That is, a particle initially at rest or in uniform motion in the preferential frame Φ continues in that state unless compelled by forces to change it.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beatty, Millard F.|date=2006|title=Principles of engineering mechanics Volume 2 of Principles of Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics-The Analysis of Motion, |page=24| publisher =Springer|isbn=0-387-23704-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wr2QOBqOBakC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Newton's first and second laws are valid only in an inertial reference frame. Any reference frame that is in uniform motion with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame, i.e. [[Galilean invariance]] or the [[principle of relativity|principle of Newtonian relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thornton, Marion|date=2004|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|page=53| publisher = Brooks/Cole| edition=5th|

===Newton's second law=== &lt;!-- [Newton's second law] --&gt;

The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}(m\mathbf v)}{\mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;
The second law can also be stated in terms of an object's acceleration. Since Newton's second law is valid only for constant-mass systems,&lt;ref name="plastino"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plastino|first=Angel R. |author2=Muzzio, Juan C.|year=1992|title=On the use and abuse of Newton's second law for variable mass problems|journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|volume= 53|issue= 3|pages=227–232|issn=0923-2958|bibcode=1992CeMDA..53..227P|doi=10.1007/BF00052611}} "We may conclude emphasizing that Newton's second law is valid for constant mass only.

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} = m\mathbf{a},&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force applied, ''m'' is the mass of the body, and '''a''' is the body's acceleration. Thus, the net force applied to a body produces a proportional acceleration. In other words, if a body is accelerating, then there is a force on it. An application of this notation is the derivation of [[G Subscript C]].

Consistent with the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|first law]], the time derivative of the momentum is non-zero when the momentum changes direction, even if there is no change in its magnitude; such is the case with [[uniform circular motion]]. The relationship also implies the [[conservation of momentum]]: when the net force on the body is zero, the momentum of the body is constant. Any net force is equal to the rate of change of the momentum.

Any mass that is gained or lost by the system will cause a change in momentum that is not the result of an external force. A different equation is necessary for variable-mass systems (see [[#Variable-mass_systems|below]]).

Newton's second law is an approximation that is increasingly worse at high speeds because of [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects.

====Impulse====
An [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]] '''J''' occurs when a force '''F''' acts over an interval of time Δ''t'', and it is given by&lt;ref&gt;Hannah, J, Hillier, M J, ''Applied Mechanics'', p221, Pitman Paperbacks, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Serway&gt;{{cite book |title=College Physics |page=161 |author=Raymond A.

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \int_{\Delta t} \mathbf F \,\mathrm{d}t .&lt;/math&gt;
Since force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \Delta\mathbf{p} = m\Delta\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;
This relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.&lt;ref name=Harman&gt;{{cite book |title=The investigation of difficult things: essays on Newton and the history of the exact sciences in honour of D.T.

====Variable-mass systems====
{{main|Variable-mass system}}
Variable-mass systems, like a rocket burning fuel and ejecting spent gases, are not [[closed system|closed]] and cannot be directly treated by making mass a function of time in the second law;&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt; that is, the following formula is wrong:&lt;ref name="Kleppner"/&gt;
&lt;!-- If you have the Halliday book, please add the missing fields of the Cite book template. While you're at it, update the same citation found in [[Force]].--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{net} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\big[m(t)\mathbf{v}(t)\big] = m(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} + \mathbf{v}(t) \frac{\mathrm{d}m}{\mathrm{d}t}. \qquad \mathrm{(wrong)}&lt;/math&gt;
The falsehood of this formula can be seen by noting that it does not respect [[Galilean invariance]]: a variable-mass object with '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= 0 in one frame will be seen to have '''F'''&amp;nbsp;≠ 0 in another frame.&lt;ref name="plastino" /&gt;
The correct equation of motion for a body whose mass ''m'' varies with time by either ejecting or accreting mass is obtained by applying the second law to the entire, constant-mass system consisting of the body and its ejected/accreted mass; the result is&lt;ref name="plastino"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf F + \mathbf{u} \frac{\mathrm{d} m}{\mathrm{d}t} = m {\mathrm{d} \mathbf v \over \mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u''' is the velocity of the escaping or incoming mass relative to the body. From this equation one can derive the equation of motion for a varying mass system, for example, the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].
Under some conventions, the quantity '''u'''&amp;thinsp;d''m''/d''t'' on the left-hand side, which represents the [[advection]] of [[momentum]], is defined as a force (the force exerted on the body by the changing mass, such as rocket exhaust) and is included in the quantity '''F'''. Then, by substituting the definition of acceleration, the equation becomes '''F'''&amp;nbsp;= ''m'''''a'''.

===Newton's third law===
[[File:Skaters showing newtons third law.svg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of Newton's third law in which two skaters push against each other. The first skater on the left exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; on the second skater directed towards the right, and the second skater exerts a normal force N&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; on the first skater directed towards the left. &lt;br/&gt;The magnitudes of both forces are equal, but they have opposite directions, as dictated by Newton's third law.]]

The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction: if one object ''A'' exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; on a second object ''B'', then ''B'' simultaneously exerts a force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'', and the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; = −'''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="resnick83"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Resnick|last2=Halliday|last3=Krane|title=Physics, Volume 1|edition=4th|page=83|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third law means that all forces are ''[[interaction]]s'' between different bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In some situations, the magnitude and direction of the forces are determined entirely by one of the two bodies, say Body ''A''; the force exerted by Body ''A'' on Body ''B'' is called the "action", and the force exerted by Body ''B'' on Body ''A'' is called the "reaction". This law is sometimes referred to as the ''[[Reaction (physics)|action-reaction law]]'', with '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the "action" and '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; the "reaction". In other situations the magnitude and directions of the forces are determined jointly by both bodies and it isn't necessary to identify one force as the "action" and the other as the "reaction". The action and the reaction are simultaneous, and it does not matter which is called the ''action'' and which is called ''reaction''; both forces are part of a single interaction, and neither force exists without the other.&lt;ref name="resnick83" /&gt;

The two forces in Newton's third law are of the same type (e.g., if the road exerts a forward frictional force on an accelerating car's tires, then it is also a frictional force that Newton's third law predicts for the tires pushing backward on the road).

From a conceptual standpoint, Newton's third law is seen when a person walks: they push against the floor, and the floor pushes against the person. Similarly, the tires of a car push against the road while the road pushes back on the tires—the tires and road simultaneously push against each other. In swimming, a person interacts with the water, pushing the water backward, while the water simultaneously pushes the person forward—both the person and the water push against each other. The reaction forces account for the motion in these examples. These forces depend on friction; a person or car on ice, for example, may be unable to exert the action force to produce the needed reaction force.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Newtons laws in latin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Newton's First and Second laws, in Latin, from the original 1687 ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'']]
===Newton's 1st Law===
From the original [[Latin]] of Newton's ''Principia'':
{{Cquote|''Lex I: Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus a viribus impressis cogitur statum illum mutare.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:
{{Cquote|Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton, ''The Principia'', A new translation by I.B. Cohen and A. Whitman, University of California press, Berkeley 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had the view that all objects have a natural place in the universe: that heavy objects (such as rocks) wanted to be at rest on the Earth and that light objects like smoke wanted to be at rest in the sky and the stars wanted to remain in the heavens. He thought that a body was in its natural state when it was at rest, and for the body to move in a straight line at a constant speed an external agent was needed continually to propel it, otherwise it would stop moving. [[Galileo Galilei]], however, realised that a force is necessary to change the velocity of a body, i.e., acceleration, but no force is needed to maintain its velocity. In other words, Galileo stated that, in the ''absence'' of a force, a moving object will continue moving. (The tendency of objects to resist changes in motion was what [[Johannes Kepler]] had called ''inertia''.) This insight was refined by Newton, who made it into his first law, also known as the "law of inertia"—no force means no acceleration, and hence the body will maintain its velocity. As Newton's first law is a restatement of the law of inertia which Galileo had already described, Newton appropriately gave credit to Galileo.

The law of inertia apparently occurred to several different natural philosophers and scientists independently, including [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes wrote in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'': {{quote|style=margin-top: -0.5em; padding-left: 0.5em;|That when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still forever, is a truth that no man doubts. But [the proposition] that when a thing is in motion it will eternally be in motion unless somewhat else stay it, though the reason be the same (namely that nothing can change itself), is not so easily assented to. For men measure not only other men but all other things by themselves. And because they find themselves subject after motion to pain and lassitude, [they] think every thing else grows weary of motion and seeks repose of its own accord, little considering whether it be not some other motion wherein that desire of rest they find in themselves, consists.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] also formulated the law, although he did not perform any experiments to confirm it.&lt;ref name="cohen117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=I.

===Newton's 2nd Law===
Newton's original Latin reads:
{{Cquote|''Lex II: Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur''.}}

This was translated quite closely in Motte's 1729 translation as:

{{Cquote|Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impress'd; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impress'd.}}

According to modern ideas of how Newton was using his terminology,&lt;ref&gt;According to Maxwell in ''Matter and Motion'', Newton meant by ''motion'' "''the quantity of matter moved as well as the rate at which it travels" and by ''impressed force'' he meant "the time during which the force acts as well as the intensity of the force''". See Harman and Shapiro, cited below.&lt;/ref&gt; this is understood, in modern terms, as an equivalent of:
''{{quote|The change of momentum of a body is proportional to the impulse impressed on the body, and happens along the straight line on which that impulse is impressed.}}''
This may be expressed by the formula F = p', where p' is the time derivative of the momentum p. This equation can be seen clearly in the [[Wren Library]] of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in a glass case in which Newton's manuscript is open to the relevant page.

Motte's 1729 translation of Newton's Latin continued with Newton's commentary on the second law of motion, reading:
''{{quote|If a force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.}}''

The sense or senses in which Newton used his terminology, and how he understood the second law and intended it to be understood, have been extensively discussed by historians of science, along with the relations between Newton's formulation and modern formulations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example (1) I Bernard Cohen, "Newton's Second Law and the Concept of Force in the Principia", in "The Annus Mirabilis of Sir Isaac Newton 1666–1966" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1967), pages 143–185; (2) Stuart Pierson, "'Corpore cadente. . .': Historians Discuss Newton’s Second Law", Perspectives on Science, 1 (1993), pages 627–658; and (3) Bruce Pourciau, "Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law", Archive for History of Exact Sciences, vol.60 (2006), pages 157–207; also an online discussion by G E Smith, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/index.html#NewLawMot 5. Newton's Laws of Motion], s.5 of "Newton's ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica''" in (online) ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newton's 3rd Law===
{{Cquote|''Lex III: Actioni contrariam semper et æqualem esse reactionem: sive corporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse æquales et in partes contrarias dirigi.''}}

Translated to English, this reads:

{{Cquote|Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.}}
Newton's [[Scholium]] (explanatory comment) to this law:
{{quote|Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone: for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. If a body impinges upon another, and by its force changes the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, toward the contrary part. The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of the bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. For, as the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made toward contrary parts are reciprocally proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next scholium.&lt;ref&gt;This translation of the third law and the commentary following it can be found in the ''[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|Principia]]'' on [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false page 20 of volume 1 of the 1729 translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425035710/https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 |date=25 April 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the above, as usual, ''motion'' is Newton's name for momentum, hence his careful distinction between motion and velocity.

Newton used the third law to derive the law of [[momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]];&lt;ref&gt;Newton, ''Principia'', Corollary III to the laws of motion&lt;/ref&gt; from a deeper perspective, however, conservation of momentum is the more fundamental idea (derived via [[Noether's theorem]] from [[Galilean invariance]]), and holds in cases where Newton's third law appears to fail, for instance when [[force field (physics)|force fields]] as well as particles carry momentum, and in [[quantum mechanics]]. &lt;!-- In force fields I do not think the violation is a necessity; we could easily remodel the fields perhaps as interaction between particles at the quantum level and still have the 3rd law holding. I think the 3rd law breakdown is just a consequence of the model used --&gt;

==Importance and range of validity==
Newton's laws were verified by experiment and observation for over 200 years, and they are excellent approximations at the scales and speeds of everyday life. Newton's laws of motion, together with his law of [[universal gravitation]] and the mathematical techniques of [[calculus]], provided for the first time a unified quantitative explanation for a wide range of physical phenomena.

These three laws hold to a good approximation for macroscopic objects under everyday conditions. However, Newton's laws (combined with universal gravitation and [[classical electrodynamics]]) are inappropriate for use in certain circumstances, most notably at very small scales, very high speeds (in [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz factor]] must be included in the expression for momentum along with the [[rest mass]] and velocity) or very strong gravitational fields. Therefore, the laws cannot be used to explain phenomena such as conduction of electricity in a [[semiconductor]], optical properties of substances, errors in non-relativistically corrected [[GPS]] systems and [[superconductivity]]. Explanation of these phenomena requires more sophisticated physical theories, including [[general relativity]] and [[quantum field theory]].

In [[quantum mechanics]], concepts such as force, momentum, and position are defined by linear [[Operator (physics)|operators]] that operate on the [[quantum state]]; at speeds that are much lower than the speed of light, Newton's laws are just as exact for these operators as they are for classical objects. At speeds comparable to the speed of light, the second law holds in the original form '''F'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;d'''p'''/d''t'', where '''F''' and '''p''' are [[four-vector]]s.

==Relationship to the conservation laws==
In modern physics, the [[Conservation law (physics)|laws of conservation]] of [[momentum]], energy, and [[angular momentum]] are of more general validity than Newton's laws, since they apply to both light and matter, and to both classical and non-classical physics.

This can be stated simply, "Momentum, energy and angular momentum cannot be created or destroyed."

Because force is the time derivative of momentum, the concept of force is redundant and subordinate to the conservation of momentum, and is not used in fundamental theories (e.g., [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], [[general relativity]], etc.). The [[standard model]] explains in detail how the three fundamental forces known as [[Gauge theory|gauge forces]] originate out of exchange by [[virtual particles]]. Other forces, such as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle#Consequences|fermionic degeneracy pressure]], also arise from the momentum conservation. Indeed, the conservation of [[4-momentum]] in inertial motion via [[curved space-time]] results in what we call [[gravitational force]] in [[general relativity]] theory. The application of the space derivative (which is a [[momentum operator]] in quantum mechanics) to the overlapping [[wave functions]] of a pair of [[fermion]]s (particles with half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) results in shifts of maxima of compound wavefunction away from each other, which is observable as the "repulsion" of the fermions.

Newton stated the third law within a world-view that assumed instantaneous action at a distance between material particles. However, he was prepared for philosophical criticism of this [[Action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], and it was in this context that he stated the famous phrase "[[Hypotheses non fingo|I feign no hypotheses]]". In modern physics, action at a distance has been completely eliminated, except for subtle effects involving [[quantum entanglement]]. (In particular, this refers to [[Bell's theorem]] – that no [[local hidden variable theory|local model]] can reproduce the predictions of quantum theory.) Despite only being an approximation, in modern engineering and all practical applications involving the motion of vehicles and satellites, the concept of action at a distance is used extensively.

The discovery of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in the 19th century showed that not every physical quantity is conserved over time, thus disproving the validity of inducing the opposite metaphysical view from Newton's laws. Hence, a "steady-state" worldview based solely on Newton's laws and the conservation laws does not take [[entropy]] into account.

'''Personhood''' is the status of being a [[person]]. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in [[philosophy]] and [[law]] and is closely tied with legal and [[political]] concepts of [[citizenship]], [[equality before the law|equality]], and [[liberty]]. According to law, only a [[natural person]] or [[legal personality]] has [[rights]], protections, privileges, responsibilities, and [[legal liability]].&lt;ref&gt;"Where it is more than simply a synonym for 'human being', 'person' figures primarily in moral and legal discourse. A person is a being with ''a certain moral status'', or a bearer of rights. But underlying the moral status, as its condition, are ''certain capacities''. A person is a being who has a sense of self, has a notion of the future and the past, can hold values, make choices; in short, can adopt life-plans. At least, a person must be the kind of being who is in principle capable of all this, however damaged these capacities may be in practice." Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate and has been questioned critically during the abolition of human and nonhuman [[slavery]], in theology, in debates about [[abortion]] and in [[fetal rights]] and/or [[reproductive rights]], in [[animal rights]] activism, in [[theology]] and [[ontology]], in [[ethics|ethical theory]], and in debates about [[corporate personhood]] and the [[beginning of human personhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''The New York Times'', January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes through which personhood is recognized socially and legally vary cross-culturally, demonstrating that notions of personhood are not universal. Anthropologist Beth Conklin has shown how personhood is tied to social relations among the [[Wari' people]] of [[Rondônia]], Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Beth A. Conklin and Lynn M. Morgan, "Babies, Bodies, and the Production of Personhood in North America and a Native Amazonian Society," 'Ethos,' Vol. 24, No. 4 (Dec., 1996), pp. 657–694.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Knauft's studies of the Gebusi people of Papua New Guinea depict a context in which individuals become persons incrementally, again through social relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Knauft, 'The Gebusi: Lives Transformed in a Rainforest World, 3e" New York: McGraw-Hill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jane C. Goodale]] has also examined the construction of personhood in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodale, 'To Sing With Pigs Is Human: The Concept of Person in Papua New Guinea,' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{cleanup|section|reason=Various concepts of personhood are listed in no particular order with no overarching structure or organization|date=June 2012}}
Capacities or attributes common to definitions of personhood can include [[human nature]], [[agency (philosophy)|agency]], [[self-awareness]], a notion of the past and future, and the possession of [[rights]] and [[duties]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taylor, "The Concept of a Person", ''Philosophical Papers. Volume 1.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the concept of a person is difficult to define in a way that is universally accepted, due to its historical and cultural variability and the controversies surrounding its use in some contexts.

===Western philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Functionalism (philosophy of mind)'--&gt;===
In philosophy, the word "person" may refer to various concepts. According to the "naturalist" [[epistemology|epistemological]] tradition, from [[Descartes]] through [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], the term may designate any human (or [[Non human|non-human]]) [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] who: (1) possesses continuous [[consciousness]] over time; and (2) who is therefore capable of framing representations about the world, formulating plans and acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 97–114&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], the problem with the naturalist view is that it depends solely on a "performance criterion" to determine what is an agent. Thus, other things (e.g. machines or animals) that exhibit "similarly complex adaptive behaviour" could not be distinguished from persons. Instead, Taylor proposes a significance-based view of personhood:

{{quote|What is crucial about agents is that things matter to them. We thus cannot simply identify agents by a performance criterion, nor assimilate animals to machines... [likewise] there are matters of significance for human beings which are peculiarly human, and have no analogue with animals.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], "The Concept of a Person", Philosophical Papers. Volume 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, 98–102&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others, such as American Philosopher [[Francis J. Beckwith]], argue that personhood is not linked to function at all, but rather that it is the underlying personal unity of the individual.

{{quote|What is crucial morally is the being of a person, not his or her functioning.  A human person does not come into existence when human function arises, but rather, a human person is an [[entity]] who has the natural inherent capacity to give rise to human functions, whether or not those functions are ever attained.  …A human person who lacks the ability to think [[Rationality|rationally]] (either because she is too young or she suffers from a disability) is still a human person because of her nature.  Consequently, it makes sense to speak of a human being’s lack if and only if she is an actual person.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckwith|first=Francis J.|title=Abortion, Bioethics, and Personhood: A Philosophical Reflection|url=http://www.personhoodkansas.com/files/Keith%20Ashley/AbortionBioethicsandPersonhood.pdf|publisher=The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[J. P. Moreland]] clarifies this point:

{{quote|It is because an entity has an essence and falls within a natural kind that it can possess a unity of dispositions, capacities, parts and properties at a given time and can maintain identity through change.|2=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreland|first=J. P.|title=James Rachels and the Active Euthanasia Debate|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|year=1988|volume=31|pages=86|url=http://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/31/31-1/31-1-pp081-090_JETS.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Harry G. Frankfurt]] writes that, "What philosophers have lately come to accept as analysis of the concept of a person is not actually analysis of ''that'' concept at all." He suggests that the concept of a person is intimately connected to [[free will]], and describes the structure of human [[volition (psychology)|volition]] according to first- and second-order desires:

{{quote|Besides wanting and choosing and being moved ''to do'' this or that, [humans] may also want to have (or not to have) certain desires and motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in their preferences and purposes, from what they are. Many animals appear to have the capacity for what I shall call "first-order desires" or "desires of the first order," which are simply desires to do or not to do one thing or another. No animal other than man, however, appears to have the capacity for reflective self-evaluation that is manifested in the formation of second-order desires.|&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Frankfurt, "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 68, No.1 (Jan 14, 1971), 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;P.G Ossorio, The Behavior Of Persons, Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.|Harry G. Frankfurt}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

According to [[Nikolas Kompridis]], there might also be an [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective]], or interpersonal, basis to personhood:

{{quote|What if personal identity is constituted in, and sustained through, our relations with others, such that were we to erase our relations with our significant others we would also erase the conditions of our self-intelligibility? As it turns out, this erasure... is precisely what is experimentally dramatized in the “science fiction” film, ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'', a far more philosophically sophisticated meditation on personal identity than is found in most of the contemporary literature on the topic.|&lt;ref&gt;Nikolas Kompridis, [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf "Technology's Challenge to Democracy: What of the Human?", ''Parrhesia'' 8 (2009)], 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other philosophers have defined persons in different ways. [[Boethius]] gives the definition of "person" as "an individual substance of a rational nature" ("''Naturæ rationalis individua substantia''").&lt;ref name="CathEnc"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Geddes|first=Leonard|title=Person|encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|location=New York|year=1911|volume=11|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11726a.htm|accessdate=2011-03-09|quote=The Latin word persona was originally used to denote the mask worn by an actor. From this it was applied to the role he assumed, and, finally, to any character on the stage of life, to any individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Midgley defines a “person” as being a conscious, thinking being, which knows that it is a person ([[self-awareness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-m/midgley01.htm "Persons and non-persons"], in Peter Singer (ed), ''In Defense of Animals''. Basil Blackwell, 1985, pp. 52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Thomas I. White argues that the criteria for a person are as follows: (1) is alive, (2) is aware, (3) feels positive and negative sensations, (4) has emotions, (5) has a sense of self, (6) controls its own behaviour, (7) recognises other persons and treats them appropriately, and (8) has a variety of sophisticated cognitive abilities. While many of White's criteria are somewhat [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]], some animals such as [[dolphin]]s would still be considered persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1279 |title=Dolphin people |author=Thomas I. White |date=June 2, 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animal rights groups have also championed recognition for animals as "persons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/2010/01/fellow-champions-dolphins-as-%E2%80%9Cnon-human-persons%E2%80%9D/ Fellow Champions Dolphins as “Non-Human Persons”], Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics, January 10, 2010; Midgley, Mary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to personhood, Paradigm Case Formulation, used in [[Descriptive psychology|Descriptive Psychology]] and developed by [[Peter Ossorio]], involves the four interrelated concepts of 1) The Individual Person, 2) Deliberate Action, 3) Reality and the Real World, and 4) Language or Verbal Behavior.  All four concepts require full articulation for any one of them to be fully intelligible. More specifically,  a Person is an individual whose history is, paradigmatically, a history of Deliberate Action in a Dramaturgical pattern. Deliberate Action is a form of behavior in which a person (a) engages in an Intentional Action, (b) is cognizant of that, and (c) has chosen to do that.  A person is not always engaged in a deliberate action but has the eligibility to do so.  A human being is an individual who is both a person and a specimen of Homo sapiens. Since persons are deliberate actors, they also employ hedonic, prudent, aesthetic and ethical reasons when selecting, choosing or deciding on a course of action. As part of our "social contract" we expect that the typical person can make use of all four of these motivational perspectives. Individual persons will weigh these motives in a manner that reflects their personal characteristics.  That life is lived in a “dramaturgical” pattern is to say that people make sense, that their lives have patterns of significance. The paradigm case allows for nonhuman persons, potential persons, nascent persons, manufactured persons, former persons, "deficit case" persons, and "primitive" persons. By using a paradigm case methodology, different observers can point to where they agree and where they disagree about whether an entity qualifies as a person.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Ossorio, ''The Behavior of Persons'', Ann Arbor: Descriptive Psychology Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schwartz, Wynn. (1982) The Problem of Other Possible Persons: Dolphins, Primates, and Aliens. in, Advances in Descriptive Psychology, vol 2, (eds: Davis &amp; Mitchel), Greenwich, CT: JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===American law===
{{see also|US person}}
A person is recognized by law as such, not because they are human, but because rights and duties are ascribed to them. The person is the legal subject or substance of which the rights and duties are attributes. An individual human being considered to be having such attributes is what lawyers call a "natural person."&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, First Book of Jurispr. 110. Gray, Nature and Sources of Law, ch. II. Black's Law Dictionary, 4th Edition, p 1300&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black's Law Dictionary,&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th edition, citing the National Labor Relations Act, section 2(1)&lt;/ref&gt; a person is:

{{quote|In general usage, a human being (i.e. [[natural person]]), though by statute term may include a firm, labor organizations, partnerships, associations, corporations, legal representatives, trustees, trustees in bankruptcy, or receivers.}}

In Federal law, the concept of legal personhood is formalized by statute (1 [[United_States_Code|USC]] §8) as a "member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development."

As an application of [[social psychology]] and other disciplines, phenomena such as the ''perception'' and ''attribution'' of personhood have been scientifically studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Person Perception. Second Edition |author=Schneider, Hastdorf, and Ellsworth |year=1979 |publisher=Addison Wesley |ISBN= 0-201-06768-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jls.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/99 |title=Second-Language Fluency and Person Perception in China and the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical questions addressed in social psychology are the accuracy of attribution, processes of perception and the formation of bias. Various other scientific/medical disciplines address the myriad of issues in the development of [[Personality psychology|personality]].

==Debates==

Various specific debates focus on questions about the personhood of different classes of entities.

===Humans===

====Beginning of personhood====
{{for|full article|Beginning of human personhood}}

The [[beginning of human personhood]] is a concept long debated by religion and philosophy.  With respect to [[abortion]], 'personhood' is the status of a human being having individual human rights. The term was used by Justice Blackmun in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;ref name="ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 1973"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html |title=ROE V. WADE, 410 U. S. 113 (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PersonhoodSupremeCourt.JPG|250px|thumb|Personhood protest in front of the [[United States Supreme Court]]]]

A political movement in the United States seeks to define the [[beginning of human personhood]] as starting from the moment of [[fertilisation|fertilization]] with the result being that abortion, as well as forms of birth control that act to deprive the human embryo of necessary sustenance in [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], could become illegal.&lt;ref name="Huffpo-Bassett-2011-11-08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/08/personhood-abortion-bans-_n_1082344.html|title='Personhood' Anti-Abortion Movement Gains National Momentum|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=2011-11-09|date=2011-11-08|author=Laura Bassett}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/22935.aspx|title=Numerous flaws in ‘personhood’ movement, says family law expert|date=November 7, 2011|publisher=Washington University in St. Louis|accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the movement also state that it would have some effect on the practice of [[in-vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF), but would not lead to the practice being outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will Mississippi Ban IVF?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/10/24/personhood-ballot-initiative-in-mississippi-could-ban-some-ivf-practices.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=October 24, 2011|author=Michelle Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan F. Will says that the personhood framework could produce significant restrictions on IVF to the extent that reproductive clinics find it impossible to provide the services.&lt;ref&gt;Will, Jonathan F. (2013) "Beyond Abortion: Why the personhood movement implicates reproductive choice". American Journal of Law and Medicine. (Boston: American Society of Law and Medicine) 39 (4): 601–602. {{ISSN|0098-8588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A representative organization within this movement is Personhood USA, a [[Colorado]]-based [[umbrella group]] with a number of state-level affiliates,&lt;ref name="Bloomberg-Deprez-2011-11-04"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-04/toughest-u-s-abortion-law-nears-passage-in-mississippi-vote.html|title=Toughest U.S. Abortion Law Nears Passage in Mississippi Vote|author=Esmé E. Deprez|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes itself as a nonprofit Christian ministry.&lt;ref name="CNN-Phillips-9-Nov-2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mississippi voters reject anti-abortion initiative|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/09/politics/mississippi-election/|author=Rich Phillips|publisher=CNN|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to ban abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moon|first=Patti|title=Personhood USA Launches Petition Drive To Ban Abortions|url=http://www.krdo.com/news/30685933/detail.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=News Channel 13, ABC Colorado|date=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personhood USA was co-founded by Cal Zastrow and Keith Mason&lt;ref&gt;Pro-Life Profiles, [http://prolifeprofiles.com/zastrow] Retrieved 2014-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 following the Colorado for Equal Rights campaign to enact a state constitutional personhood amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=Deal|title=Catholics and the Personhood Initiative|url=http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/hudson/07516.html|publisher=CatholiCity|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the movement regard personhood as an attempt to directly challenge the ''Roe v. Wade'' [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision, thus filling a legal void left by [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Harry Blackmun]] in the majority opinion when he wrote: “If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant’s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus’ right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.”&lt;ref name="ROE V.

Some medical organizations have described the potential effects of personhood legislation as potentially harmful to patients and the practice of medicine, particularly in the cases of [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic]] and [[molar pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57318625-503544/doctors-call-mississippi-personhood-initiative-dangerous/|title=Doctors call Mississippi "personhood" initiative dangerous|author=Rob Mank|publisher=CBS News|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Bordo]] has suggested that the focus on the issue of personhood in abortion debates has often been a means for depriving women of their rights. She writes that "the legal double standard concerning the bodily integrity of pregnant and nonpregnant bodies, the construction of women as fetal incubators, the bestowal of 'super-subject' status to the fetus, and the emergence of a father's-rights ideology" demonstrate "that the current terms of the abortion debate – as a contest between fetal claims to personhood and women's right to choose – are limited and misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bordo, "Are Mothers Persons?", ''Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body'', Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 2003, 71–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Colleen Carroll Campbell, say that the personhood movement is a natural progression of society in protecting the equal rights of all members of the human species.  She writes, “The basic philosophical premise behind these [personhood] amendments is eminently reasonable. And the alternative on offer – which severs humanity from personhood – is fraught with peril. If being human is not enough to entitle one to [[human rights]], then the very concept of human rights loses meaning. And all of us — born and unborn, strong and weak, young and old — someday will find ourselves on the wrong end of that cruel measuring stick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Colleen Carroll|title=Personhood begins when life begins|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/personhood-begins-when-life-begins/2011/11/02/gIQARCXwgM_blog.html|accessdate=23 May 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Pavone|Father Frank Pavone]] agrees, adding, “Nor is this a dispute about the state imposing a religious or philosophical view. After all, your life and mine are not protected because of some religious or philosophical belief that others are required to have about us. More accurately, the law protects us precisely in spite of the beliefs of others who, in their own [[World view|worldview]], may not value our lives. …To support Roe vs. Wade is not merely to allow a medical procedure. It is to acknowledge that the government has the power to say who is a person and who is not. Who, then, is to limit the groups to whom it is applied? This is what makes “personhood” such an important public policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pavone|first=Fr.

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]] has recently been advancing a human [[Human exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] understanding of personhood theory. Catechism 2270 reads: “Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person—among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 5, The Fifth Commandment|url=http://old.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====

In March 2007 Georgia became the first state in the nation to introduce a legislative resolution to amend the state constitution to define and recognize the personhood of the pre-born.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/en-US/display/20072008/HR/536&lt;/ref&gt; The Georgia Catholic Conference and National Right to Life supported the effort and it failed to attract a [[Supermajority|super majority]] in both chambers in order to be placed on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifeissues.net/writers/bru/bru_48mississippi.html&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia legislators have filed a personhood resolution every session since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20092010/SR/328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20112012/SR/153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20132014/SR/420&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 Georgia Right to Life hosted the first nationwide Personhood Symposium targeting pro-life activists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joniandfriends.org/help-and-resources/other-resources/personhood/&lt;/ref&gt; This symposium was instrumental in spawning the group Personhood USA and the various state personhood efforts that followed. Voters in 46 [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties approved personhood during the 2010 primary election with 75% in favor of a non-binding resolution declaring the equal rights of all human beings from conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Daniel|title=Georgia Voters Say 'YES' to Personhood Amendment|url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/391914486.html|publisher=ChristianNewsWire|accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 Republican primary a similar question was placed on the ballot statewide and passed with a super-majority (66%) of the vote in 158 of 159 counties.&lt;ref&gt;http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/40378/95366/en/vts.html?cid=93510&lt;/ref&gt;

Personhood proponents in Oklahoma sought to amend the state constitution to define personhood as beginning at conception. The state Supreme Court, citing the U.S. Supreme Court's 1992 decision in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', ruled in April 2012 that the proposed amendment was unconstitutional under the federal Constitution and blocked inclusion of the referendum question on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krehbiel|first=Randy|title=Group requests personhood appeal from U.S. Supreme Court|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/site/printerfriendlystory.aspx?articleid=20120731_16_A9_Clrdae519381|newspaper=TulsaWorld|date=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the state Supreme Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoberbrock|first=Barbara|title=U.S. Supreme Court declines to review Oklahoma personhood decision|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=336&amp;articleid=20121030_16_A1_OLHMIY34169|newspaper=TulsaWorld|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a 16-year-old girl was charged in Mississippi with murder for the still-birth of her daughter on the basis that the girl had smoked cocaine while pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;ProPublica, 18 March 2014: [https://www.propublica.org/article/stillborn-child-charge-of-murder-and-disputed-case-law-on-fetal-harm A Stillborn Child, A Charge of Murder and the Disputed Case Law on ‘Fetal Harm’]&lt;/ref&gt; These charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;The Dispatch, 3 April 2014: [http://www.cdispatch.com/news/article.asp?aid=32344 Judge dismisses Rennie Gibbs' depraved heart murder case]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====International=====

In 1983, the people of Ireland added the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] to their constitution that “acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.”

====Women====

In 1920, with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], women became protected against discrimination in their right to vote in the United States.  In 1971, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Reed v. Reed]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/resources/lp_gender_reedvreed.htm Equal Protection for Women]&lt;/ref&gt; that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] applies to [[women]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/supreme-court-drama/reed-v-reed Reed v. Reed]&lt;/ref&gt; as they are "persons" according to the US Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/corporations/ToPRaP.html Timeline of Personhood]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] argued that women do not have equal protection under the 14th amendment as "persons"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/03/scalia-women-discrimination-constitution_n_803813.html Scalia: Women Don't Have Constitutional Protection Against Discrimination]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2020667,00.html Time]&lt;/ref&gt;
saying that the Constitution's use of the gender-neutral term "Person" means that the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex, but also does not prohibit such discrimination; he said "Nobody ever thought that that's what it meant. Nobody ever voted for that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carolyn-maloney/lets-put-it-in-writing-wo_b_874759.html Let's Put It in Writing: Women Are Equal]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many others, including law professor [[Jack Balkin]] disagree with this assertion.  Balkin states that, at a minimum "the fourteenth amendment was intended to prohibit some forms of sex discrimination-- discrimination in basic civil rights against single women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Balkin|first=Jack|title=Scalia on Sex Equality|url=http://balkin.blogspot.com/2011/01/scalia-on-sex-equality.html|accessdate=27 September 2012|date=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many local marriage laws at the time the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was ratified (as well as when the original Constitution was ratified) had concepts of coverture and "head-and-master", which meant that women legally lost rights, including rights to ownership of property and other rights of adult participation in the political economy upon marriage; single women retained these rights, however, and voted in some jurisdictions.  Also, other commentators have noted that some people who ratified the Constitution in 1787 in other contemporaneous contexts ratified state level Constitutions that saw women as Persons, required to be treated as such, including in rights such as voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution of New Jersey, 1776.|year=1776|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Women's History|url=http://www.njwomenshistory.org/index.htm|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 17th and 18th Century Quaker concept of Personhood most certainly applied to women and the prevalence of Quakers in the population of several colonies, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania at the time the original Constitution was drafted and ratified likely influenced the use of the term "Person" in the Constitution rather than the term "Man" used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and in the contemporaneously drafted [[French Constitution of 1791]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvert|first=Jane|title=Quaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88436-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of personhood beginning at conception gives issues to women. Daniel Fincke states "Applying the logic to abortion she argues that an involuntarily pregnant woman has the right to refuse to let her body be used by the fetus even were we to reason that the fetus has a right to life."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2014/06/moral-and-philosophical-arguments-against-fetal-personhood/&lt;/ref&gt; The personhood movement may cause many more issues that just a women's right to choose. Some fetal homicide laws have caused women to be sentenced to jail time for suspected drug use during her pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage, like the Alabama women who was sentenced to ten years for her suspected drug use.&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/politics/94470/personhood-abortion-mississippi-roe-wade&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slaves====

[[File:Am I not a man.jpg|150px|thumb|''Am I not a man'' [[emblem]] used during the campaign to abolish [[slavery]]]]
In 1772, [[Somersett's Case]] determined that [[slavery]] was unsupported by law in [[England and Wales]], but not elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In 1868, under the 14th Amendment, [[black men]] in the United States became citizens. In 1870, under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], black men got the right to vote.

In 1853, [[Sojourner Truth]] became famous for asking ''[[Ain't I a Woman?]]'' and after slavery was abolished, black men continued to fight for personhood by claiming, ''[[I Am A Man!]]''

====Children====

The legal definition of persons may include or exclude children depending on the context.  In the US, regarding liability, children or minors are not legally persons because they do not satisfy the requirements for personhood under the law.&lt;ref name=duhaime&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duhaime|first1=Lloyd|title=Person Definition, duhaime.org, Learn Law|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/Person.aspx|website=duhaime.org|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, regarding protection under the law, the US [[Born-Alive Infants Protection Act]] of 2002 provides a legal structure that those born at any gestational stage that are either breathing,  have heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, or any voluntary muscle movement are living, individual human persons.&lt;ref Pub.L. 107-207, 116 Stat. 926, enacted August 5, 2002&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr186.107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-human animals===
{{See also|Great ape personhood}}
Some philosophers and those involved in animal welfare, [[ethology]], [[animal rights|the rights of animals]], and related subjects, consider that certain animals should also be considered to be persons and thus granted legal personhood. Commonly named species in this context include the [[great ape]]s, [[cetacean]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news181981904.html |title=Scientists say dolphins should be treated as non-human persons |publisher=Physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[elephant]]s, because of their apparent intelligence and intricate social rules. The idea of extending personhood to all animals has the support of legal scholars such as [[Alan Dershowitz]]&lt;ref name="DershowitzAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dershowitz |first=Alan |title=Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights |year=2004 |pages= 198–99 }}  and {{cite book |author=Darwin, Meet Dershowitz |title=The Animals' Advocate |date= Winter 2002 |volume= 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laurence Tribe]] of [[Harvard Law School]],&lt;ref name="AAMC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aamc.org/newsroom/reporter/oct03/animalrights.htm |title=Personhood Redefined: Animal Rights Strategy Gets at the Essence of Being Human |publisher= Association of American Medical Colleges |accessdate= July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[animal law]] courses are now{{when|date=June 2014}} taught in 92 out of 180 law schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |title=Animal law courses |publisher=[[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306074941/http://www.aldf.org/content/index.php?pid=83 |archivedate=2008-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2008, [[Columbia University Press]] published [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/cup/catalog/data/978023113/9780231139502.HTM Animals as Persons: Essays on the Abolition of Animal Exploitation] by Professor [[Gary L. Francione]] of [[Rutgers University]] School of Law, a collection of writings that summarizes his work to date and makes the case for non-human animals as persons.

Some{{who|date=April 2014}} proponents of [[human exceptionalism]] (also referred to by its critics as [[speciesism]] or human supremacism&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason
By Val Plumwood&lt;/ref&gt;) have countered that we must institute a strict demarcation of personhood based on species membership in order to avoid the horrors of [[genocide]] (based on propaganda dehumanizing one or more ethnicities) or the injustices of [[forced sterilization]] (as occurred in many countries to people with low I.Q. scores and prisoners).{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Other theorists attempt to demarcate between degrees of personhood. For example, [[Peter Singer]]'s two-tiered account distinguishes between basic sentience and the higher standard of self-consciousness which constitutes personhood.  [[Wynn Schwartz]] has offered a Paradigm Case Formulation of Persons as a format allowing judges to identify qualities of personhood in different entities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Schwartz, W, 2013  "The Problem of other possible persons" http://freedomliberationreaction.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-problem-of-other-possible-persons.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Julian Friedland has advanced a seven-tiered account based on cognitive capacity and linguistic mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedland|first=Julian|title=MINDS THAT MATTER: SEVEN DEGREES OF MORAL STANDING|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=bts|work=[[Between the Species]]|publisher=Cal Poly|volume=13|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amanda Stoel suggested that rights should be granted based on a scale of degrees of personhood, allowing entities currently denied any right to be recognized some rights, but not as many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoel|first=Amanda|title=THE MEME OF ALTRUISM AND DEGREES OF PERSONHOOD|url=http://www.terasemjournals.com/PCJournal/PC0701/Papers/Stoel.pdf|work=Journal of Personal Cyberconsciousness|publisher=Terasem Movement, Inc.|page=35|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, India's Ministry of Forests and Environment banned the importation or capture of cetaceans (whales and dolphins) for entertainment, exhibition, or interaction purposes, on the basis that "cetaceans in general are highly intelligent and sensitive" and that it "is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment." It noted that "various scientists" have argued they should be seen as "non-human persons" with commensurate rights, but did not take an official position on this, and indeed did not have the legal authority to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Ministry of Forests and Environment, Circular F.

In 2014, a hybrid, zoo-born orangutan named [[Sandra (orangutan)|Sandra]] was termed by the court in Argentina as a "non-human subject" in an unsuccessful habeas corpus case regarding the release of the orangutan from captivity at the Buenos Aires zoo. The status of the orangutan as a "non-human subject" needs to be clarified by the court. Court cases relevant to this orangutan are continuing in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;For corporations, see [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html "Justices, 5–4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit"], ''Reuters'', December 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, for the first time, two chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, were thought to be "legal persons," having been granted a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. This meant their detainer, [[Stony Brook University]], had to provide a legally sufficient reason for their imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nonhumanrightsproject.org/2015/04/20/judge-recognizes-two-chimpanzees-as-legal-persons-grants-them-writ-of-habeas-corpus|title=First Time in World History Judge Recognizes Two Chimpanzees as Legal Persons, Grants them Writ of Habeas Corpus |accessdate=2015-04-20 |date=2015-04-20 |publisher=Nonhuman Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was rejected and the writ was reversed by the officiating judge shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/21/judge-reverses-human-rights-status-for-chimpanzees/|title=Judge reverses 'human rights' status for chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothetical beings===

Speculatively, there are several other likely categories of beings where personhood is at issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Aliens====

If [[alien life]] were found to exist, under what circumstances would they be counted as "persons"? Do we have to consider any "willing and communicative (capable to register its own will) autonomous body" in the universe, no matter the species, an individual (a person)? Do they deserve equal rights with the human race?

====Artificial intelligence or life====

If [[artificial intelligence]]s, intelligent and self-aware system of hardware and software, are eventually created, what criteria would determine their personhood? Likewise, at what point would human-created biological life achieve personhood?

====Modified humans====

The theoretical landscape of personhood theory has been altered recently by controversy in the bioethics community concerning an emerging community of scholars, researchers, and activists identifying with an explicitly [[transhumanist]] position, which supports [[morphological freedom]], even if a person changed so much as to no longer be considered a member of the human [[species]]. For example, how much of a human can be [[prosthetics|artificially]] replaced before one loses their personhood? If people are considered persons because of their [[brain]], then what if the brain's thought patterns, memories and other attributes could be transposed into a device? Would the patient still be considered a person after the operation?

===Corporations===

{{Main article|Corporate personhood}}
Today, in statutory and corporate [[law]], certain [[social construct]]s are legally considered persons. In many jurisdictions, some [[corporation]]s and other [[Legal person|legal entities]] are considered [[legal person]]s with standing to sue or be sued in court. This is known as legal or [[corporate personhood]].

In 1819, the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'', that corporations have the same rights as natural persons to enforce contracts.

===Environmental entities===
====Bolivia====
In 2006, Bolivia passed a law recognizing the rights of nature "to not be affected by mega-infrastructure and development projects that affect the balance of ecosystems and the local inhabitant communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/10/bolivia-enshrines-natural-worlds-rights|title=

====Ecuador====
{{Main|Sumac Kawsay}}
In 2008, Ecuador approved a constitution to recognize that nature "...has the right to exist, persist, maintain and regenerate its vital cycles, structure, functions and its processes in evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therightsofnature.org/ecuador-rights/ |title=Ecuador Adopts Rights of Nature in Constitution |work=Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature|last= |first= |date= |accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====New Zealand====
The [[Whanganui River]] of New Zealand is revered by the local [[Māori people]] as ''Te Awa Tupua'', sometimes translated as "an integrated, living whole".  Efforts to grant it special legal protection have been pursued by the Whanganui [[iwi]] since the 1870s.  In 2012, an agreement to grant legal personhood to the river was signed between the New Zealand government and the Whanganui River Māori Trust.  One guardian from the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|Crown]] and one from the Whanganui are responsible for protecting the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10830586 |title=Agreement entitles Whanganui River to legal identity |work=The New Zealand Herald |last=Shuttleworth |first=Kate |date=Aug 30, 2012 |accessdate=Jan 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

Christianity is the first philosophical system to use the word "person" in its modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Met. John Zizioulas, ''Being As Communion: Studies in Personhood and the Church''. Crestwood: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1997, pp. 27–49&lt;/ref&gt; The word "''persona''" was transformed from its theater use into a term with strict technical theological meaning by [[Tertullian]] in his work, ''Adversus Praxean'' ("Against Praxeas"), in order to distinguish the three "persons" of the [[Trinity]]. Subsequently, [[Boethius]] refined the word to mean "an individual substance of a rational nature." This can be re-stated as "that which possesses an intellect and a will." Thus, the word "person" was originally a theological term created and defined by Christians to explain Christian theological concepts.

{{quote|The definition of Boethius as it stands can hardly be considered a satisfactory one. The words taken literally can be applied to the rational soul of man, and also the human nature of Christ. That St. Thomas accepts it is presumably due to the fact that he found it in possession, and recognized as the traditional definition. He explains it in terms that practically constitute a new definition. ''Individua substantia'' signifies, he says, ''substantia, completa, per se subsistens, separata ab aliia'', i.e., a substance, complete, subsisting per se, existing apart from others (III, Q. xvi, a. 12, ''ad 2um'').

If to this be added ''rationalis naturae'', we have a definition comprising the five notes that go to make up a person: (a) ''substantia''-- this excludes accident; (b) ''completa''-- it must form a complete nature; that which is a part, either actually or "aptitudinally" does not satisfy the definition; (c) ''per se subsistens''--the person exists in itself and for itself; he or she is ''sui juris'', the ultimate possessor of his or her nature and all its acts, the ultimate subject of predication of all his or her attributes; that which exists in another is not a person; (d) ''separata ab aliis''--this excludes the universal, ''substantia secunda'', which has no existence apart from the individual; (e) ''rationalis naturae''--excludes all non-intellectual ''supposita''.

To a person therefore belongs a threefold incommunicability, expressed in notes (b), (c), and (d). The human soul belongs to the nature as a part of it, and is therefore not a person, even when existing separately.|''Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1913|Person}}

'''Planetshine''' is the dim illumination, by [[sunlight]] reflected from a [[planet]], of all or part of the otherwise dark side of any [[natural satellite|moon]] orbiting the body. '''Planetlight''' is the [[diffuse reflection]] of sunlight from a planet, whose [[albedo]] can be measured.

The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthshine]] on the [[Moon]], which is most visible from the night side of [[Earth]] when the [[lunar phase]] is crescent or nearly [[new moon|new]],&lt;ref name="NASA earthshine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthshine |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=83782 |publisher=[[NASA]] |access-date=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the atmospheric [[diffuse sky radiation|brightness]] of the [[daytime]] sky. Typically, this results in the dark side of the Moon being bathed in a faint light.

Planetshine has also been observed elsewhere in the [[Solar System]]. In particular, the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' space probe]] used [[Saturn]]'s shine to image portions of the [[moons of Saturn|planet's moons]], even when they do not reflect direct sunlight.

Earthshine is visible [[earthlight (astronomy)|earthlight]] reflected from the [[Moon]]'s night side. It is also known as the Moon's ''ashen glow'' or as "the new Moon with the old Moon in her arm".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in the Scots ballad of [[Sir Patrick Spens]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leonardo-Earthshine.png|left|thumb|150px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s sketch of crescent Moon with earthshine as part of his ''[[Codex Leicester]]'', written between 1506 and 1510]]

Earthshine is most readily visible since a few nights before until a few nights after a [[new moon]], during the (waxing or waning) crescent phase. When the [[lunar phase]] is new as viewed from [[Earth]], Earth would appear nearly fully sunlit from the Moon. [[Sunlight]] is reflected from Earth to the night side of the Moon. The night side appears to glow faintly, and the entire disk of the Moon is dimly illuminated.

[[File:Earth illuminates.jpg|right|thumb|Earthshine reflected from the Moon, as seen through a telescope. The bright region is directly illuminated by the Sun, while the rest of the Moon is illuminated by sunlight reflected from Earth.]]

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] explained the phenomenon in the early 16th century when he realized that both Earth and the Moon reflect sunlight at the same time. Light is reflected from Earth to the Moon and back to Earth as earthshine.

Earthshine is used to help determine the current [[albedo]] of Earth. The data are used to analyze global [[cloud cover]], a climate factor. Oceans reflect the least amount of light, roughly 10%. Land reflects 10–25% of sunlight, and clouds reflect around 50%. Thus, the part of Earth where it is [[daytime]] and from where the Moon is visible determines how bright the earthshine on the Moon appears at any given time.

[[File:Earthshine.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Earthshine reflected from the Moon during [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with [[Venus]] (left)]]

Studies of earthshine can be used to show how the Earth's cloud cover varies over time.  Preliminary results show a 6.5% dip in cloud cover between 1985 and 1997 and a corresponding increase between 1997 and 2003. This has implications for climate research, especially with regards to [[global warming]]. All clouds contribute to an increased albedo, however some clouds have a net warming effect because they trap more heat than they reflect, while others have a net cooling effect because their increased [[albedo]] reflects more radiation than they trap heat. So while the Earth's albedo is measurably increasing, the uncertainty over the amount of heat trapped means the overall effect on global temperature remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1287_1.asp |last=Shiga |first=David |title=Moon Study Tracks Changes in Earth’s Cloud Cover |work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]] |date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retroreflection==
{{see also|Backscatter|Opposition surge}}

Features on [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and some other bodies have, to some extent, [[retroreflector|retroreflective]] properties. Light striking them is [[backscatter]]ed, or [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] preferentially back in the direction from which it has come rather than in other directions. If the light comes from the Sun, it is reflected preferentially back toward the Sun and in nearby directions. For example, when [[lunar phase|its phase]] is full, the Moon reflects light preferentially toward the Sun and also Earth, which is in almost the same direction. As viewed from Earth, the [[full Moon]] therefore [[opposition surge|appears brighter]] than it would if it [[scattering|scattered]] light uniformly in all directions. Similarly, near [[new moon]], sunlight that has been backscattered from Earth toward the Sun and also the Moon, which is in almost the same direction, and then backscattered again from the Moon toward Earth appears much brighter, as viewed from Earth, than it would without the retroreflective effects.

The retroreflection is produced by spheres of transparent material on the reflecting surface. When it encounters a transparent sphere, light is preferentially [[heiligenschein|reflected and refracted]] in a path, within the sphere, which exits it in the direction from which it entered. On Earth, the spheres are droplets of water in clouds. On the Moon, large numbers of solid glassy spheres are found on the surface. They are thought to have been formed from drops of molten [[ejecta]], produced by [[impact event]]s, which cooled and solidified before falling back to the surface.

[[File:PIA21055 - Pandora Up Close.jpg|thumb|Very faint ringshine can be seen on [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]]'s dark side.]]
Ringshine is when sunlight is reflected by a planet's ring system onto the planet or onto the moons of the planet. This has been observed in many of the photos from the [[Cassini orbiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassini Solstice Mission: Saturn by Ringshine|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=3236|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search for terrestrial planets==

[[File:The crescent Moon and earthshine over ESO's Paranal Observatory.jpg|thumb|Crescent Moon and earthshine over [[ESO]]'s [[Paranal Observatory]].]]

Scientists at [[NASA]]'s Navigator Program, which specializes in the detection of terrestrial planets, have backed the launch of a [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF) mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_index.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218101411/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_index.cfm |archivedate=18 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; TPF would detect light reflected by planets orbiting stars to investigate whether they could harbor life. It would use advanced telescope technologies to look for life-marks in the light reflected from the planets, including water, oxygen and methane.

The [[European Space Agency]] has a similar mission, named [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]], under consideration. This will also study the light from planets to detect the signatures of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120382_index_0_m.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many traditional astronomical challenges, the most serious challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet, but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star.  For a terrestrial planet, the contrast ratio of planet to its host stars is approximately ~10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; in the thermal infrared or ~10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;-10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; in the optical/near infrared.  For this reason, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will work in the thermal infrared.  However, searching for terrestrial planets in the optical/near infrared has the advantage that the [[diffraction limit]] corresponds to a smaller angle for a given size telescope.  Therefore, [[NASA]] is also pursuing a Terrestrial Planet Finder-C mission that will search for and study terrestrial planets using the optical (and near infrared) wavelengths.  While Terrestrial Planet Finder-C aims to study the light of extrasolar planets, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated (rather than scattered) by the planet.

In preparation for these missions, astronomers have performed detailed earthshine observations, since earthshine has the spectroscopic characteristics of light reflected by the Earth. Astronomers have paid particular attention to whether earthshine measurement can detect the [[red edge]], a spectral feature that is due to plants.  The detection of a similar spectral feature in light from an extrasolar planet would be particularly interesting, since it might be due to a light-harvesting organism.  While the [[red edge]] is almost certainly the easiest way to directly detect life on Earth via earthshine observations, it could be extremely difficult to interpret a similar feature due to life on another planet, since the wavelength of the spectral feature is not known in advance (unlike most atomic or molecular spectral features).

In [[television]] and [[film]], a '''plot point''' is a significant event within a plot that spins the action around in another direction. 

Noted screenwriting teacher [[Syd Field]] discusses plot points in his [[paradigm]], popularized in his book ''[[Screenplay (book)|Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]].''  There he proposes that a well-structured movie has two plot points within a three-act structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yardley|first1=William|title=Syd Field, Author of the Definitive Work On Writing Screenplays, Is Dead at 77|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/syd-field-author-of-the-definitive-work-on-writing-screenplays-is-dead-at-77.html|accessdate=January 13, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first plot point occurs 20 to 30 minutes into the film (assuming a standard 120-minute running time), and the second one occurs 80 to 90 minutes into the film. The first plot point ends Act I and propels the story into Act II; likewise, the second plot point ends Act II and propels the story into Act III.

{{Bayesian statistics}}

The '''principle of indifference''' (also called '''principle of insufficient reason''') is a rule for assigning [[epistemic probability|epistemic probabilities]]. Suppose that there are ''n'' &amp;gt; 1 [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]] possibilities. The principle of indifference states that if the ''n'' possibilities are indistinguishable except for their names, then each possibility should be assigned a probability equal to 1/''n''.

In [[Bayesian probability]], this is the simplest [[Prior probability#Uninformative priors|non-informative prior]]. The principle of indifference is meaningless under the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation of probability]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} in which probabilities are relative frequencies rather than degrees of belief in uncertain propositions, conditional upon state information.

==Examples==

The textbook examples for the application of the principle of indifference are [[coin]]s, [[dice]], and [[playing cards|cards]].

In a [[macroscopic]] system, at least, it must be assumed that the physical laws which govern the system are not known well enough to predict the outcome. As observed some centuries ago by [[John Arbuthnot]] (in the preface of ''Of the Laws of Chance'', 1692),

:It is impossible for a Die, with such determin'd force and direction, not to fall on such determin'd side, only I don't know the force and direction which makes it fall on such determin'd side, and therefore I call it Chance, which is nothing but the want of art....

Given enough time and resources,
there is no fundamental reason to suppose that suitably precise measurements could not be made, which would enable the prediction of the outcome of coins, dice, and cards with high accuracy: [[Persi Diaconis]]'s work with [[coin flipping#Physics|coin-flipping]] machines is a practical example of this.

===Coins===

A [[symmetry|symmetric]] coin has two sides, arbitrarily labeled ''heads'' and ''tails''. Assuming that the coin must land on one side or the other, the outcomes of a coin toss are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and interchangeable. According to the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/2.

It is implicit in this analysis that the forces acting on the coin are not known with any precision. If the momentum imparted to the coin as it is launched were known with sufficient accuracy, the flight of the coin could be predicted according to the laws of mechanics. Thus the uncertainty in the outcome of a coin toss is derived (for the most part) from the uncertainty with respect to initial conditions. This point is discussed at greater length in the article on [[Coin flipping#Physics|coin flipping]].

===Dice===

A [[symmetry|symmetric]] [[dice|die]] has ''n'' faces, arbitrarily labeled from 1 to ''n''.
An ordinary cubical die has ''n'' = 6 faces,
although a symmetric die with different numbers of faces can be constructed;
see [[dice]].
We assume that the die will land on one face or another upwards,
and there are no other possible outcomes.
Applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/''n''.
As with coins,
it is assumed that the initial conditions of throwing the dice are not known
with enough precision to predict the outcome according to the laws of mechanics.
Dice are typically thrown so as to bounce on a table or other surface.
This interaction makes prediction of the outcome much more difficult.

The assumption of symmetry is crucial here. Suppose that we are asked to bet for or against the outcome "6". We might reason that there are two relevant outcomes here "6" or "not 6", and that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. This suggests assigning the probability 1/2 to each of the two outcomes.

===Cards===

A standard deck contains 52 cards, each given a unique label in an arbitrary fashion, i.e. arbitrarily ordered. We draw a card from the deck; applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/52.

This example, more than the others, shows the difficulty of actually applying the principle of indifference in real situations. What we really mean by the phrase "arbitrarily ordered" is simply that we don't have any information that would lead us to favor a particular card. In actual practice, this is rarely the case: a new deck of cards is certainly not in arbitrary order, and neither is a deck immediately after a hand of cards. In practice, we therefore [[shuffling playing cards|shuffle]] the cards; this does not destroy the information we have, but instead (hopefully) renders our information practically unusable, although it is still usable in principle. In fact, some expert blackjack players can track aces through the deck; for them, the condition for applying the principle of indifference is not satisfied.

==Application to continuous variables==

Applying the principle of indifference incorrectly can easily lead to nonsensical results, especially in the case of multivariate, continuous variables.  A typical case of misuse is the following example.

*Suppose there is a cube hidden in a box. A label on the box says the cube has a side length between 3 and 5&amp;nbsp;cm.
* We don't know the actual side length, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 4&amp;nbsp;cm.
* The information on the label allows us to calculate that the surface area of the cube is between 54 and 150&amp;nbsp;cm². We don't know the actual surface area, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 102&amp;nbsp;cm².
* The information on the label allows us to calculate that the volume of the cube is between 27 and 125&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We don't know the actual volume, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 76&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* However, we have now reached the impossible conclusion that the cube has a side length of 4&amp;nbsp;cm, a surface area of 102&amp;nbsp;cm², and a volume of 76&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;!

In this example, mutually contradictory estimates of the length, surface area, and volume of the cube arise because we have assumed three mutually contradictory distributions for these parameters: a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] for any one of the variables implies a non-uniform distribution for the other two. (The same paradox arises if we make it discrete: the side is either exactly 3&amp;nbsp;cm, 4&amp;nbsp;cm, or 5&amp;nbsp;cm, mutatis mutandis.)  In general, the principle of indifference does not indicate which variable (e.g. in this case, length, surface area, or volume) is to have a uniform epistemic probability distribution.

Another classic example of this kind of misuse is [[Bertrand's paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox]].  [[Edwin T. Jaynes]] introduced the [[principle of transformation groups]], which can yield an epistemic probability distribution for this problem.  This generalises the principle of indifference, by saying that one is indifferent between ''equivalent problems'' rather than indifference between propositions.  This still reduces to the ordinary principle of indifference when one considers a permutation of the labels as generating equivalent problems (i.e. using the permutation transformation group).  To apply this to the above box example, we have three random variables related by geometric equations.  If we have no reason to favour one trio of values over another, then our prior probabilities must be related by the rule for changing variables in continuous distributions.  Let ''L'' be the length, and ''V'' be the volume.  Then we must have

:&lt;math&gt;f(L) = \left|{\partial V \over \partial L}\right|f(V)=3 L^{2} f(L^{3})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] (pdf) of the stated variable. This equation has a general solution: &lt;math&gt;f(L) = {K \over L}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''K'' is a normalization constant, determined by the range of ''L'', in this case equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;K^{-1}=\int_{3}^{5}{dL \over L} = \log\left({5 \over 3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

To put this "to the test", we ask for the probability that the length is less than 4.  This has probability of:

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(L&lt;4)=\int_{3}^{4}{dL \over L \log({5 \over 3})}= {\log({4 \over 3}) \over \log({5 \over 3})} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;.

For the volume, this should be equal to the probability that the volume is less than 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64.  The pdf of the volume is

:&lt;math&gt;f(V^{{1 \over 3}}) {1 \over 3} V^{-{2 \over 3}}={1 \over 3 V \log({5 \over 3})}&lt;/math&gt;.

And then probability of volume less than 64 is

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(V&lt;64)=\int_{27}^{64}{dV \over 3 V \log({5 \over 3})}={\log({64 \over 27}) \over 3 \log({5 \over 3})}={3 \log({4 \over 3}) \over 3 \log({5 \over 3})}={\log({4 \over 3}) \over \log({5 \over 3})} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we have achieved invariance with respect to volume and length.  One can also show the same invariance with respect to surface area being less than 6(4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 96.  However, note that this probability assignment is not necessarily a "correct" one.  For the exact distribution of lengths, volume, or surface area will depend on how the "experiment" is conducted.  This probability assignment is very similar to the [[maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] one, in that the frequency distribution corresponding to the above probability distribution is the most likely to be seen.  So, if one was to go to ''N'' people individually and simply say "make me a box somewhere between 3 and 5 cm, or a volume between 27 and 125 cm&amp;sup3;, or a surface area between 54 and 150 cm&amp;sup2;", then unless there is a systematic influence on how they make the boxes (e.g. they form a group, and choose one particular method of making boxes), about 56% of the boxes will be less than 4&amp;nbsp;cm - and it will get very close to this amount very quickly.  So, for large N, any deviation from this basically indicates the makers of the boxes were "systematic" in how the boxes were made.

The fundamental hypothesis of [[statistical physics]], that any two microstates of a system with the same total energy are equally probable at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], is in a sense an example of the principle of indifference. However, when the microstates are described by continuous variables (such as positions and momenta), an additional physical basis is needed in order to explain under ''which'' parameterization the probability density will be uniform.  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] justifies the use of canonically conjugate variables, such as positions and their conjugate momenta.

==History of the principle of indifference==

The original writers on probability, primarily [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], considered the principle of indifference to be intuitively obvious and did not even bother to give it a name.  Laplace wrote:

:The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.

These earlier writers, Laplace in particular, naively generalized the principle of indifference to the case of continuous parameters, giving the so-called "uniform prior probability distribution", a function which is constant over all real numbers. He used this function to express a complete lack of knowledge as to the value of a parameter.  According to Stigler (page 135), Laplace's assumption of uniform prior probabilities was not a meta-physical assumption.  It was an implicit assumption made for the ease of analysis.

The '''principle of insufficient reason''' was its first name, given to it by later writers, possibly as a play on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[principle of sufficient reason]]. These later writers ([[George Boole]], [[John Venn]], and others) objected to the use of the uniform prior for two reasons. The first reason is that the constant function is not normalizable, and thus is not a proper probability distribution. The second reason is its inapplicability to continuous variables, as described above. (However, these paradoxical issues can be resolved. In the first case, a constant, or any more general finite polynomial, ''is'' normalizable within any finite range: the range [0,1] is all that matters here. Alternatively, the function may be modified to be zero outside that range, as with a [[continuous uniform distribution]]. In the second case, there is no ambiguity provided the problem is "well-posed", so that no unwarranted assumptions can be made, or have to be made, thereby fixing the appropriate prior [[probability density function]] or prior [[moment generating function]] (with variables fixed appropriately) to be used for the probability itself. See the [[Bertrand paradox (probability)]] for an analogous case.)

The "principle of insufficient reason" was renamed the "principle of Indifference" by the economist {{harvs|first=John Maynard|last=Keynes|authorlink=John Maynard Keynes|year=1921|txt}}, who was careful to note that it applies only when there is no knowledge indicating unequal probabilities.

Attempts to put the notion on firmer [[philosophy|philosophical]] ground have generally begun with the concept of [[equipossibility]] and progressed from it to [[equiprobability]].

The principle of indifference can be given a deeper logical justification by noting that equivalent states of knowledge should be assigned equivalent epistemic probabilities.  This argument was propounded by [[E.T. Jaynes]]:  it leads to two generalizations, namely the [[principle of transformation groups]] as in the [[Jeffreys prior]], and the [[principle of maximum entropy]].

More generally, one speaks of [[non-informative prior]]s.

== Founders ==
The founders of Pro-Truth Pledge come from its mother organization, Intentional Insights. The behavior and social science methodologies behind the Pro-Truth Pledge were applied to the topic by Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, one of the founders of Intentional Insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/gleb-tsipursky-phd |title=Gleb Tsipursky Ph.D. |website=Psychology Today |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/which-politicians-should-we-trust-in-the-november-7_us_59e9b65ce4b0542ce4290cb5 |title=Which Politicians Should We Trust in the November 7 Election? |last=Tsipursky |first=Gleb |date=October 23, 2017 |website=Huffington Post |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters and impact ==
According to the project's home page, as of August 26, 2018, there are 8,374 signatories to the pledge, including 85 organizations, 625 government officials, and 850 public figures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.protruthpledge.org/ |title=Take the Pro-Truth Pledge |work=Pro-Truth Pledge |accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including [[Jonathan Haidt]], [[Michael Shermer]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Pierre Whalon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fugitive.com/2018/01/11/fugitive-watch-takes-the-pro-truth-pledge/ |title=Fugitive Watch Takes The Pro-Truth Pledge |date=January 11, 2018 |work=Fugitive Watch |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://community.cengage.com/t5/American-Government-Instructor/Tell-Students-About-the-Pro-Truth-Pledge/td-p/3089 |title=Tell Students About the Pro Truth Pledge |date=July 26, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pro-Truth Pledge has received media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/01/16/birds-the-same-feather-the-unmissable-link-between-ad-fraud-and-fake-news |title=Birds of the same feather: The unmissable link between ad fraud and fake news |work=The Drum |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
At least two peer-reviewed studies have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of taking the Pro-Truth Pledge.  

A study published in the  journal &lt;i&gt;Behavior and Social Issues&lt;/i&gt; examined the sharing of news-related content on Facebook before and after taking the pledge.  The findings "suggest that taking the PTP had a statistically significant effect on behavior change in favor of more truthful sharing on Facebook."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/bsi/article/view/9127/7551 |title=FIGHTING FAKE NEWS AND POST-TRUTH POLITICS WITH BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE: THE PRO-TRUTH PLEDGE |accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Social and Political Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, used a different methodology and reached a similar conclusion: "taking the
pledge results in a statistically significant increase in alignment with the behaviors of the pledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/856/pdf |title=A Psychological Approach to Promoting Truth in Politics: The Pro-Truth Pledge |accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations and pledge-takers by geography ==
The pledge has been translated into Spanish, Hungarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Portuguese and German, but the map of the pledge takers shows that most (above 90%) of the pledge takers live in North America, mainly in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2017/07/11/taking-pro-truth-pledge/ |title=Taking the Pro-Truth Pledge |date=July 11, 2017 |work=Dispatches From the Culture Wars |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], [[game theory]], [[decision theory]], and [[artificial intelligence]], a '''rational agent''' is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that has clear [[preferences]], models [[uncertainty]] via [[expected values]] of variables or functions of variables, and always chooses to perform the action with the [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimal]] expected outcome for itself from among all feasible actions. A rational agent can be anything that makes decisions, typically a person, firm, machine, or software.

Rational agents are also studied in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[ethics]], and philosophy, including the philosophy of [[practical reason]].

==Economics==
In reference to economics, rational agent refers to hypothetical consumers and how they make decisions in a [[free market]]. This concept is one of the assumptions made in [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]]. The concept of economic [[rationality]] arises from a tradition of [[marginal analysis]] used in neoclassical economics. The idea of a rational agent is important to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], as detailed by philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s theory of the [[felicific calculus]], also known as the hedonistic calculus.

The action a rational agent takes depends on:
* the preferences of the agent
* the agent's information of its environment, which may come from past experiences
* the actions, duties and obligations available to the agent
* the estimated or actual benefits and the chances of success of the actions.

In [[game theory]] and classical [[economics]], it is often assumed that the [[actor]]s, people, and firms are rational.  However, the extent to which people and firms behave rationally is subject to debate.  Economists often assume the models of [[rational choice theory]] and [[bounded rationality]] to formalize and predict the behavior of individuals and firms.  Rational agents sometimes behave in manners that are counter-intuitive to many people, as in the [[traveler's dilemma]].

=== Criticisms === 
Many economic theories reject [[utilitarianism]] and rational agency, especially those that might be considered [[heterodox]].

For example, [[Thorstein Veblen]], known as the father of [[institutional economics]], rejects the notion of hedonistic calculus and pure rationality saying: "The hedonistic conception of man is that of a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift him about the area, but leave him intact."

Veblen instead perceives human economic decisions as the result of multiple complex cumulative factors: "It is the characteristic of man to do something, not simply to suffer pleasures and pains through the impact of suitable forces. He is ... a coherent structure of propensities and habits which seeks realization and expression in an unfolding activity. ... They are the products of his hereditary traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions conventionalities, and material circumstances; and they afford the point of departure for the next step in the process. The economic life history of the individual is a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process."
[[Evolutionary economics]] also provides criticisms of the Rational Agent, citing the "parental bent" (the idea that biological impulses can and do frequently override rational decision making based on utility). Arguments against rational agency have also cited the enormous influence of [[marketing]] as proof that humans can be persuaded to make economic decisions that are "non-rational" in nature.

=== Alternate theories ===
[[Neuroeconomics]] is a concept that uses [[neuroscience]], social [[psychology]] and other fields of science to better understand how people make decisions.  Unlike rational agent theory, [[neuroeconomics]] does not attempt to predict large-scale human behavior but rather how individuals make decisions in case-by-case scenarios.

==Artificial intelligence==
[[Artificial intelligence]] has borrowed the term "rational agents" from economics to describe autonomous programs that are capable of goal directed behavior.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} Today there is a considerable overlap between AI research, game theory and decision theory. Rational agents in AI are closely related to ''[[intelligent agent]]s'', autonomous software programs that display intelligence.

'''Resocialization''' is the process by which one's sense of social values, beliefs, and norms are re-engineered. This process is deliberately carried out in a variety of settings such as in many single parent households and military boot-camps, through an intense social process that may take place in a [[total institution]]. An important thing to note about socialization is that what can be learned, can be unlearned. This forms the basis of resocialization: to unlearn and relearn.

Resocialization can also be defined{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} as a process wherein individuals, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution, are subjected to a dynamic redistribution of those values, attitudes and abilities which would allow them to function according to the norms of said dominant institutions. This definition relates more to a [[jail]] sentence. If individuals exhibit deviance, society delivers the offenders to a total institution where they can be rehabilitated.

Resocialization varies in its severity. A mild resocialization might be involved in moving to a different country. One who does this may need to learn new social customs and norms such as language, eating habits, dress, and talking habits. A more drastic example of resocialization is joining a military or a [[cult]], and the most severe example would be if one suffers from a loss of all memories and therefore would have to relearn society's norms over again.

The first stage of resocialization is the destruction of an individual's former beliefs and confidence.

==Resocialization institutions==
[[Image:A Look At The Life Of Prison.jpg|thumb|A prison cell]]
A total institution refers to an institution in which one is totally immersed and that controls all the day-to-day life. All activity will occur in  a single place under a single authority. Examples of a total institution can include prisons, fraternity houses, and the military.

The goal of [[total institution]]s is resocialization which radically alters residents' personalities through deliberate manipulation of their environment. Resocialization is a two-part process. First, the institutional staff try to erode the residents' identities and independence.

Strategies to erode identities include forcing individuals to surrender all personal possessions, get uniform haircuts and wear standardized clothing. Independence is eroded by subjecting residents to humiliating and degrading procedures. Examples are strip searches, fingerprinting and assigning serial numbers or code names to replace the residents' given names.

The second part of resocialization process involves the systematic attempt to build a different personality or self. This is generally done through a system of rewards and punishments. The privilege of being allowed to read a book, watch television or make a phone call can be a powerful motivator for conformity. Conformity occurs when individuals change their behaviour to fit in with the expectations of an authority figure or the expectations of the larger group.

No two people respond to resocialization programs in the same manner. While some residents are found to be "rehabilitated", others might become bitter and hostile. As well, over a long period of time, a strictly controlled environment can destroy a person's ability to make decisions and live independently. This is known as [[institutionalisation (psychology)|institutionalisation]], a negative outcome of total institution that prevents an individual from ever functioning effectively in the outside world again. (Sproule, 154-155)

Resocialization is also evident in individuals who have never been "[[socialization|socialized]]" in the first place, or who have not been required to behave socially for an extended period of time. Examples include [[feral children]] (never socialized) or inmates who have been in [[solitary confinement]].

Socialization is a lifelong process. Adult socialization often includes learning new norms and values that are very different from those associated with the culture in which the person was raised. This process can be voluntary. Currently, joining a [[volunteer military]] qualifies as an example of voluntary resocialization. The norms and values associated with military life are different from those associated with civilian life. (Riehm, 2000)

Sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] studied resocialization in mental institutions. He characterized the mental institution as a total institution—one in which virtually every aspect of the inmates’ lives was controlled by the institution and calculated to serve the institution's goals. For example, the institution requires that patients comply with certain regulations, even when compliance is not necessarily in the best interest of the individual.

== Resocializing in the military ==
Once a person joins the military they enter a new social realm where they become socialized as a military member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunivin|first1=Karen|title=Military Culture: Change and Continuity|journal=Armed Forces and Society|date=1994|volume=20|issue=4|page=531-547}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=Christopher|title=Veteran Status and Marital Aggression: Does Military Service Make a Difference?.|journal=Journal of Family Violence|date=2007|volume=22|issue=4|page=197-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resocialization is defined as a “process wherein an individual, defined as inadequate according to the norms of a dominant institution(s), is subjected to a dynamic program of behavior intervention aimed at instilling and/or rejuvenating those values, attitudes, and abilities which would allow…[her] to function according to the norms of said dominant institution(s).” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boot camp serves as an example for understanding how military members are resocialized within the total institution of the military. According to Fox and Pease (2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the purpose of military training, like boot camp, is to “promote the willing and systematic subordination of one’s own individual desires and interests to those of one’s unit and, ultimately, country." To accomplish this, all aspects of military members’ lives exist within the same military institution, are controlled by the same “institutional authorities” (drill instructors) and are done to accomplish the goals of the total institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual’s “civil[ian] identity, with its built-in restraints is eradicated, or at least undermined and set aside in favor of the warrior identity and its central focus upon killing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herbert|first1=Melissa S.|title=From Crinoline to Camouflage: Initial Entry Training and The Marginalization of Women in The Military|journal=Minerva|date=1993|volume=11|issue=1|page=1-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military training prepares individuals for combat by promoting traditional ideas of masculinity, like training individuals to disregard their bodies’ natural reactions to run from fear, have pain or show emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it also has the likelihood to create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military members, in part, find purpose and meaning through resocialization, because the institution provides access to symbolic and material resources, helping military members construct meaningful identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinojosa|first1=Ramon|title=Doing Hegemony: Military, Men, and Constructing a Hegemonic Masculinity|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2010|volume=18|issue=2|page=179-194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox and Pease &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; state, “like any social identity, military identity is always an achievement, something dependent upon conformity to others’ expectations and their acknowledgment. The centrality of performance testing in the military, and the need to ‘measure up,’ heightens this dependence. Although resocialization through military training can create a sense of purpose in military members, it also has the likelihood to create mental and emotional distress when members are unable to achieve set standards and expectations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=John|last2=Pease|first2=Bob|title=Military Deployment, Masculinity and Trauma: Reviewing the Connections|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|page=16-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first couple of days, the most important aspect of basic training is the surrender of their identity. Recruits shed their clothes and hair which are the physical representation of their old identities. These processes happen very quickly and allows no time for recruits to think over the loss of their identity, this is so the recruits don’t have a chance to regret their decisions.

The drill sergeants then give the young men and women a romanticized view on what it is to be a soldier, and how manly it is. When the training starts it is physically demanding and gets harder every week. The recruits are constantly insulted and put down; this breaks down their pride and destroys their ability to resist the change they are undergoing. The drill sergeants put up a facade that tells their recruits that finishing out basic training sets them apart from all of the others who will fail. However, almost all recruits will succeed and graduate from basic training.

The training is also set up with roles. There are three younger drill sergeants closer to the recruits in age and one senior drill sergeant who becomes a father figure to the new recruits. And the company commander plays a god-like role, that the recruits look up to. The people in these roles will become role models and authority figures, but will also help create a sense of loyalty to the entire organization.

Recruits are made to march in a formation where every person is moving the same way at the same time causes a sense of unity. It makes the recruits feel less like an individual and more like they are a part of a group. They sing in cadence to boost morale and to make the group feel important. The drill sergeants also feed the group small doses of triumphs which keep the soldiers proud and feeling accomplished.

The troop also undergoes group punishment which unifies the unit. Generally the similar hatred of something will bring everyone together. In this case, group punishment allows all the recruits to hate the drill sergeants and the punishment but find unity within their unit. They will encourage others to push themselves and create shared hardships.

== Resocializing in prisons ==
Prisons have two different types of resocialization. The first type is when the prisoner has to learn the new normal behaviors that apply to their new environment. The second type is if the prisoner has to partake in rehabilitation measures to help fix their deviant ways. When the individual violates the dominant society’s norms, the criminology system subjects them to a form of resocialization called criminal rehabilitation.

Rehabilitation aims to bring an inmate's real behavior closer to that of the majority of the individuals' behaviour that make up the dominant society. This 'ideal' societal behaviour is highly valued in many societies, mainly because it serves to protect and promote the well being of the majority of that society's members. In rehabilitation, the system will strip the criminal of his prior socialization of criminal behavior including the techniques of committing a crime and the specific motives, drives, rationalizations and attitudes. Criminal behavior is learned behavior and can therefore be unlearned.

The first step towards rehabilitation is the choice of Milieu. This is the type of interactions the deviant will have with the people around him while in custody. Usually this is determined after psychological and sociological screenings are performed on the criminal. The second step is Diagnosis. The diagnosis is a continual process influenced by feedback from the individual’s behavior. The next stage is treatment. Treatment is dependent on the diagnosis. Whether it is treating an addiction or redefining the values of a person, the treatment is what will resocialize the criminal back to societal norms.

==Background==
Richards Heuer graduated in 1950 from [[Williams College]] with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. One year later, while a graduate student at the [[University of California in Berkeley]], future CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] recruited Heuer to work at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Helms, also a graduate of Williams College, was looking for recent graduates to hire at CIA.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Heuer spent the next 24 years working with the Directorate of Operations before switching to the Directorate of Intelligence in 1975. His interest in intelligence analysis and "how we know" was rekindled by the case of [[Yuri Nosenko]] and his studies in social science methodology while a master's student at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Richards Heuer is well known for his analysis of the extremely controversial and disruptive case of Soviet KGB defector Yuri Nosenko, who was first judged to be part of a "master plot" for penetration of CIA but was later officially accepted as a legitimate defector. Heuer worked within the DI for four years, eventually retiring in 1979 after 28 years of service as the head of the methodology unit for the political analysis office. (Though retired from the DI in 1979, Heuer continued to work as a contractor on various projects until 1995.)&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; He eventually received an M.A. in international relations from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Heuer discovered his interest in cognitive psychology through reading the work of [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] subsequent to an [[International Studies Association]] (ISA) convention in 1977. His continuing interest in the field and its application to intelligence analysis led to several published works including papers, CIA training lectures and conference panels.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heuer Jr. |first1=Richards J. |date=2009 |title=The Evolution of Structured Analytic Techniques |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog885/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.geog885/files/file/Evolution_SAT_Heuer.pdf |website=e-education.psu.edu |accessdate=2018-09-10}} Presentation to the [[National Academy of Science]], [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] Committee on Behavioral and Social Science Research to Improve Intelligence Analysis for National Security, Washington, DC, December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structured analytic techniques==
{{See also|Problem structuring methods}}
===''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis'' and key concepts===
Heuer's book ''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis'', published in 2010 (second edition 2015) and co-authored with Randy H. Pherson, provides a comprehensive taxonomy of structured analytic techniques (SATs) pertaining to eight categories: decomposition and visualization, idea generation, scenarios and indicators, hypothesis generation and testing, cause and effect, challenge analysis, conflict management and decision support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The book details 50 SATs (55 in the second edition) in step-by-step processes that contextualize each technique for use within the intelligence community and business community. The book goes beyond simply categorizing the various techniques by accentuating that SATs are processes that foster effective collaboration among analysts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Structured analytic techniques as process====
In light of the increasing need for interagency analyst collaboration,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heuer Jr. |first1=Richards J. |date=2008 |title=Small Group Processes for Intelligence Analysis |website=pherson.org |url=http://www.pherson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02.-Small-Group-Processes.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020125056/http://www.pherson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02.-Small-Group-Processes.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-20 |accessdate=2018-09-10}} Prepared for the [[Sherman Kent School]], Central Intelligence Agency, 28 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Heuer and Pherson advocate SATs as "enablers" of collective and interdisciplinary intelligence products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The book is a response to problems that arise in small group collaborative situations such as [[groupthink]], [[group polarization]] and premature consensus.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Heuer's previous insight into team dynamics advocates the use of analytic techniques such as [[Nominal Group Technique]] and Starbursting for idea generation and [[prediction markets]] for aggregating opinions in response to the identified problems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The book proposes SATs as not only a means for guiding collection and analysis, but also a means for guiding group interaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Recommendations to the Director of National Intelligence====
Heuer and Pherson assert that the [[National Intelligence Council]] (NIC) needs to serve as the entity that sets the standards for the use of structured analytic techniques within the intelligence community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) could accomplish this by creating a new position to oversee the use of SATs in all NIC projects. Further, Heuer and Pherson suggest that the DNI create a "center for analytic tradecraft" responsible for testing all structured analytic techniques, developing new structured analytic techniques and managing feedback and lessons learned regarding all structured analytic techniques throughout the intelligence community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' and key concepts===
Heuer's seminal work ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' details his three fundamental points. First, human minds are ill-equipped ("poorly wired") to cope effectively with both inherent and induced uncertainty.&lt;ref name="PSY"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heuer |first=Richards J. |date=2001 |origyear=1999 |title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis |edition=2nd |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |isbn=1929667000 |oclc=53813306 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, increased knowledge of our inherent biases tends to be of little assistance to the analyst. And lastly, tools and techniques that apply higher levels of critical thinking can substantially improve analysis on complex problems.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt;

====Mental models and perceptions====
Mental models, or mind sets, are essentially the screens or lenses that people perceive information through.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; Even though every analyst sees the same piece of information, it is interpreted differently due to a variety of factors (past experience, education, and cultural values to name merely a few).&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; In essence, one's perceptions are morphed by a variety of factors that are completely out of the control of the analyst. Heuer sees mental models as potentially good and bad for the analyst. On the positive side, they tend to simplify information for the sake of comprehension but they also obscure genuine clarity of interpretation.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt;

Therefore, since all people observe the same information with inherent and different biases, Heuer believes an effective analysis system needs a few safeguards. It should: encourage products that clearly show their assumptions and chains of inferences; and it should emphasize procedures that expose alternative points of view.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; What is required of analysts is "a commitment to ''challenge, refine, and challenge again'' their own working mental models."&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; This is a key component of his [[analysis of competing hypotheses]]; by delineating all available hypotheses and refuting the least likely ones, the most likely hypothesis becomes clearer.

====Recommendations====
Heuer offers several recommendations to the intelligence community for improving intelligence analysis and avoiding consistent pitfalls. First, an environment that not only promotes but rewards critical thinking is essential.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Failure to challenge the first possible hypothesis simply because it sounds logical is unacceptable. Secondly, Heuer suggests that agencies expand funding for research on the role that cognitive processes play in decision making.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; With so much hanging on the failure of success of analytical judgments, he reasons, intelligence agencies need to stay abreast of new discoveries in this field. Thirdly, agencies should promote the continued development of new tools for assessing information.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;

===Analysis of competing hypotheses===
{{Main|Analysis of competing hypotheses}}
"Analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH) is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that is consistent and inconsistent with each hypothesis, and rejects hypotheses that contain too much inconsistent data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pherson.org/index.php/ach/|title=ACH: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses|website=pherson.org|publisher=Pherson Associates, LLC|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACH is an eight step process to enhance analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: An Eight Step Process|url=http://www.pherson.org/PDFFiles/ACH-AnEightStepProcess.pdf|website=pherson.org|publisher=Pherson Associates, LLC|accessdate=2018-09-10}} A single-page document.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Identify all possible hypotheses
#Make a list of significant evidence and arguments
#Prepare a matrix to analyze the "diagnosticity" of evidence
#Drawn tentative conclusions
#Refine the matrix
#Compare your personal conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis with the inconsistency scores
#Report your conclusions
#Identify indicators

Heuer originally developed ACH to be included as the core element in an interagency deception analysis course during the Reagan administration in 1984 concentrated on Soviet deception regarding arms deals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) in conjunction with Heuer developed the PARC ACH 2.0.5 software for use within the intelligence community in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/ach/ach.html|title=ACH2.0 Download Page|website=parc.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817031908/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/ach/ach.html|archivedate=2018-08-17|accessdate=2018-09-10}} See also: {{cite web|title=The Open Source Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Project|url=http://competinghypotheses.org/|website=competinghypotheses.org|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the Nosenko case==
During the 1980s, Richards Heuer was deeply involved in analyzing the controversial [[Yuri Nosenko]] case. His paper, ''Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment'', was originally published in 1987 in the CIA's classified journal ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'', where it remained classified for eight years. In 1995, it was then published in ''Inside CIA's Private World, Declassified Articles from the Agency's Internal Journal, 1955–1992''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heuer Jr. |first=Richards J. |date=1987 |chapter=Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment |editor-last=Westerfield |editor-first=H. Bradford |title=Inside CIA's Private World: Declassified Articles From the Agency's Internal Journal, 1955–1992 |pages=379–414 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |jstor=10.2307/j.ctt5vm5td |isbn=0300060262 |oclc=31867339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is an explanation of how and why the errors associated with the Nosenko case occurred, and has been used for teaching deception analysis to analysts.

Heuer outlines five strategies for identifying truth in deception analysis cases, employing the Nosenko case as a use case throughout in order to demonstrate how analysts on the case failed to conclude that Nosenko was legitimate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The five strategies presented in the article are:

#Motive approach: Identifying whether or not there is a motive for deception.
#Anomalies and inconsistencies approach: Searching for inconsistencies from or deviations the norm.
#Litmus test approach: Comparing the information from an unknown or new source with the information from a reliable or credible source.
#Cost accounting approach: Analyzing the opportunity cost for the enemy and the cost of conducting deception.
#Predictive test approach: Developing a tentative hypothesis and then comprehensively testing it.

Heuer states that though he was at one point a believer in "the master plot" (deep and pervasive penetration of the CIA by the Soviets) due to reasoning elaborated in the anomalies and inconsistencies approach and the motive approach, he came to discount this theory and to accept Yuri Nosenko as bona fide after exercising the predictive test approach and the cost accounting approach.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Heuer maintains that considering the master plot was not unwise as it was a theory that should have been discussed in light of the information available at the time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The conclusion of the five strategies approach is that, as demonstrated by the Nosenko case, "all five approaches are useful for complete analysis" and that an analyst should not rely on one strategy alone.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Contributions in personnel security==
During his 20 years as a consultant for the Defense Personnel Security Research Center (PERSEREC), Richards Heuer developed two encyclopedic websites: the Adjudicative Desk Reference and Customizable Security Guide and the Automated Briefing System.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/products.html|title=PERSEREC|website=dhra.mil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315225147/http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/products.html|archivedate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are free to use and available in the public domain for download.

===Adjudicative desk reference===
This large database supplements the Intelligence Community Adjudicative Guidelines which specify 13 categories of behavior that must be considered before granting a security clearance. Heuer's product provides far more detailed information about why these behaviors are a potential security concern and how to evaluate their severity. Though this background information is not official government policy, the reference has been approved by the Security Agency Executive Advisory Committee as a tool for assisting security investigators and managers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Appeals panels and lawyers have used it to deal with security clearance decisions, and it has also been proven useful to employee assistance counselors.

===Online guide to security responsibilities===
This tool provides an all-in-one source for introducing new personnel to all the various intricacies of security. Additionally, it provides a wealth of information for security professionals seeking to prepare awareness articles or briefings. The software covers a variety of topics including (but not limited to): protecting classified information, foreign espionage threats and methods, and computer vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is an updated version of the Customizable Security Guide. In hard copy format, there are over 500 pages of material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Scientific modelling''' is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to [[Understanding|understand]], [[Definition|define]], [[quantification (science)|quantify]], [[Visual system|visualize]], or [[Simulation|simulate]] by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted [[knowledge]]. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as [[conceptual model]]s to better understand, operational models to [[operational definition|operationalize]], [[mathematical model]]s to quantify, and [[graphical model]]s to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of many scientific disciplines, each of which have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Nancy. 1983. ''How the Laws of Physics Lie''. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. 1983. ''Representing and Intervening. Introductory Topics in the Philosophy of Natural Science''. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increasing attention to scientific modelling&lt;ref&gt;Frigg and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann]] (2009) state: "Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models with increasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that models play in scientific practice". Source: Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]], "Models in Science", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), ([http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/models-science/ source])&lt;/ref&gt; in fields such as [[science education]], [[philosophy of science]], [[systems theory]], and [[Visualization (graphics)#Knowledge visualization|knowledge visualization]]. There is growing collection of [[Scientific method|methods]], techniques and meta-[[theory]] about all kinds of specialized scientific modelling.

== Overview ==
[[File:MathModel.svg|right]]
A scientific model seeks to represent [[empiricism|empirical]] objects, phenomena, and physical processes in a [[logic]]al and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] way. All models are ''in simulacra'', that is, simplified reflections of reality that, despite being approximations, can be extremely useful.&lt;ref&gt;Box, George E.P. &amp; Draper, N.R. (1987). [Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces.] ''Wiley''. p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Building and disputing models is fundamental to the scientific enterprise. Complete and true representation may be impossible, but scientific debate often concerns which is the better model for a given task, e.g., which is the more accurate climate model for seasonal forecasting.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, R. ''et al.'' (2005) [http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf, http://www.ecmwf.int/staff/paco_doblas/abstr/tellus05_1.pdf]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Tellus'' 57A:219–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to [[formal language|formalize]] the [[laws of science|principle]]s of the [[empirical science]]s use an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] to model reality, in the same way logicians [[axiomatic system|axiomatize]] the [[rule of inference|principle]]s of [[logic]]. The aim of these attempts is to construct a [[formal system]] that will not produce theoretical consequences that are contrary to what is found in [[reality]]. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.&lt;ref name="tcarotmimanass"&gt;[[Leo Apostel]] (1961). "Formal study of models". In: ''The Concept and the Role of the Model in Mathematics and Natural and Social''. Edited by [[Hans Freudenthal]]. Springer. pp. 8–9 ([https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=8083fb2EuAMC&amp;dq=The+Concept+and+the+Role+of+the+Model+in+Mathematics+and+Natural+and+Social+Sciences&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bF9aEC4e6L&amp;sig=iduhMF0ektNGV87_ZkwuY5thw0U#PPA8,M1 Source])]'',&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritchey, T.  (2012) [http://www.amg.swemorph.com/pdf/amg-1-1-2012.pdf Outline for a Morphology of Modelling Methods: Contribution to a General Theory of Modelling]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the scientist, a model is also a way in which the human thought processes can be amplified.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. West Churchman]], ''The Systems Approach'', New York: Dell publishing, 1968, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, models that are rendered in software allow scientists to leverage computational power to simulate, visualize, manipulate and gain intuition about the entity, phenomenon, or process being represented. Such computer models are ''in silico''. Other types of scientific models are ''in vivo'' (living models, such as [[laboratory rat]]s) and ''in vitro'' (in glassware, such as [[tissue culture]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E. C. (2010) [https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/emily-griffiths/whatisamodel.pdf What is a model?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basics of scientific modelling ==

===Modelling as a substitute for direct measurement and experimentation===
Models are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes. Direct measurement of outcomes under [[Scientific control|controlled conditions]] (see [[Scientific method]]) will always be more reliable than modelled estimates of outcomes.

Within [[Modeling and simulation|modelling and simulation]], a model is a task-driven, purposeful simplification and abstraction of a perception of reality, shaped by physical, legal, and cognitive constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2015). Learning something right from models that are wrong – Epistemology of Simulation. In Yilmaz, L. (Ed.) ''Concepts and Methodologies in Modeling and Simulation.'' Springer–Verlag. pp. 87–106&lt;/ref&gt; It is task-driven, because a model is captured with a certain question or task in mind. Simplifications leave all the known and observed entities and their relation out that are not important for the task. Abstraction aggregates information that is important, but not needed in the same detail as the object of interest. Both activities, simplification and abstraction, are done purposefully. However, they are done based on a perception of reality. This perception is already a ''model'' in itself, as it comes with a physical constraint. There are also constraints on what we are able to legally observe with our current tools and methods, and cognitive constraints which limit what we are able to explain with our current theories. This model comprises the concepts, their behavior, and their relations in formal form and is often referred to as a [[conceptual model]]. In order to execute the model, it needs to be implemented as a [[computer simulation]]. This requires more choices, such as numerical approximations or the use of heuristics.&lt;ref&gt;Oberkampf, W. L., DeLand, S. M., Rutherford, B. M., Diegert, K. V., &amp; Alvin, K. F. (2002). Error and uncertainty in modeling and simulation. ''Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety'' 75(3): 333–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all these epistemological and computational constraints, simulation has been recognized as the third pillar of scientific methods: theory building, simulation, and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ihrig, M. (2012). A New Research Architecture For The Simulation Era. In ''European Council on Modelling and Simulation''. pp. 715–20).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation===
A [[simulation]] is the implementation of a model.  A steady state simulation provides information about the system at a specific instant in time (usually at equilibrium, if such a state exists).  A dynamic simulation provides information over time. A simulation brings a model to life and shows how a particular object or phenomenon will behave. Such a simulation can be useful for testing, analysis, or training in those cases where real-world systems or concepts can be represented by models.&lt;ref name="SEF"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203501/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
[[Structure]] is a fundamental and sometimes intangible notion covering the recognition, observation, nature, and stability of patterns and relationships of entities. From a child's verbal description of a snowflake, to the detailed [[scientific analysis]] of the properties of [[magnetic field]]s, the concept of structure is an essential foundation of nearly every mode of inquiry and discovery in science, philosophy, and art.&lt;ref name="Pullan000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pullan | first = Wendy | title = Structure | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-521-78258-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
A [[system]] is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole. In general, a system is a construct or collection of different elements that together can produce results not obtainable by the elements alone.&lt;ref&gt;Fishwick PA. (1995). Simulation Model Design and Execution: Building Digital Worlds. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of an 'integrated whole' can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships which are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime.  There are two types of system models: 1) discrete in which the variables change instantaneously at separate points in time and, 2) continuous where the state variables change continuously with respect to time.&lt;ref&gt;Sokolowski, J.A., Banks, C.M.(2009). Principles of Modelling and Simulation. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generating a model===
Modelling is the process of generating a model as a conceptual representation of some phenomenon. Typically a model will deal with only some aspects of the phenomenon in question, and two models of the same phenomenon may be essentially different—that is to say, that the differences between them comprise more than just a simple renaming of components.

Such differences may be due to differing requirements of the model's end users, or to conceptual or aesthetic differences among the modellers and to contingent decisions made during the modelling process. Considerations that may influence the [[structure]] of a model might be the modeller's preference for a reduced [[ontology]], preferences regarding [[statistical model]]s versus [[Deterministic system|deterministic models]], discrete versus continuous time, etc. In any case, users of a model need to understand the assumptions made that are pertinent to its validity for a given use.

Building a model requires [[abstraction]].  Assumptions are used in modelling in order to specify the domain of application of the model. For example, the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] assumes an [[inertial frame of reference]]. This assumption was contextualized and further explained by the [[general theory of relativity]]. A model makes accurate predictions when its assumptions are valid, and might well not make accurate predictions when its assumptions do not hold. Such assumptions are often the point with which older theories are succeeded by new ones (the [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]] works in non-inertial reference frames as well).

The term "assumption" is actually broader than its standard use, etymologically speaking. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) and online Wiktionary indicate its Latin source as ''assumere'' ("accept, to take to oneself, adopt, usurp"), which is a conjunction of ''ad-'' ("to, towards, at") and ''sumere'' (to take). The root survives, with shifted meanings, in the Italian ''sumere'' and Spanish ''sumir''.  In the OED, "assume" has the senses of (i) “investing oneself with (an attribute), ” (ii) “to undertake” (especially in Law), (iii) “to take to oneself in appearance only, to pretend to possess,” and (iv) “to suppose a thing to be.” Thus, "assumption" connotes other associations than the contemporary standard sense of “that which is assumed or taken for granted; a supposition, postulate,” and deserves a broader analysis in the philosophy of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Evaluating a model===
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
A model is evaluated first and foremost by its consistency to empirical data; any model inconsistent with reproducible observations must be modified or rejected. One way to modify the model is by restricting the domain over which it is credited with having high validity. A case in point is Newtonian physics, which is highly useful except for the very small, the very fast, and the very massive phenomena of the universe. However, a fit to empirical data alone is not sufficient for a model to be accepted as valid.  Other factors important in evaluating a model include:{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
* Ability to explain past observations
* Ability to predict future observations
* Cost of use, especially in combination with other models
* Refutability, enabling estimation of the degree of confidence in the model
* Simplicity, or even aesthetic appeal
People may attempt to quantify the evaluation of a model using a [[utility function]].

===Visualization===
[[Visualization (computer graphics)|Visualization]] is any technique for creating images, diagrams, or animations to communicate a message. Visualization through visual imagery has been an effective way to communicate both abstract and concrete ideas since the dawn of man. Examples from history include [[cave painting]]s, [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], Greek [[geometry]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s revolutionary methods of technical drawing for engineering and scientific purposes.

===Space mapping===
[[Space mapping]] refers to a methodology that employs a "quasi-global" modeling formulation to link companion "coarse" (ideal or low-fidelity) with "fine" (practical or high-fidelity) models of different complexities. In [[engineering optimization]], space mapping aligns (maps) a very fast coarse model with its related expensive-to-compute fine model so as to avoid direct expensive optimization of the fine model. The alignment process iteratively refines a "mapped" coarse model ([[surrogate model]]).

== Applications ==
===Modelling and simulation===

One application of scientific modelling is the field of [[modelling and simulation]], generally referred to as "M&amp;S".  M&amp;S has a spectrum of applications which range from concept development and analysis, through experimentation, measurement and verification, to disposal analysis.  Projects and programs may use hundreds of different simulations, simulators and model analysis tools.

The figure shows how Modelling and Simulation is used as a central part of an integrated program in a Defence capability development process.&lt;ref name="SEF"/&gt;

=== Model-based learning in education ===
[[File:Flowchart MBR.png|center|Flowchart Describing One Style of Model-based Learning]]

Model–based learning in education, particularly in relation to learning science involves students creating models for scientific concepts in order to:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lehrer|first1=Richard|last2=Schauble|first2=Leona|title=The Cambridge Handbook of Learning Sciences|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-84554-0|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gain insight of the scientific idea(s)
* Acquire deeper understanding of the subject through visualization of the model
* Improve student engagement in the course

Different types of model based learning techniques include:&lt;ref name=cambridgeref /&gt;
* Physical macrocosms
* Representational systems
* Syntactic models
* Emergent models

Model–making in education is an iterative exercise with students refining, developing and evaluating their models over time. This shifts learning from the rigidity and monotony of traditional curriculum to an exercise of students' creativity and curiosity. This approach utilizes the constructive strategy of social collaboration and learning scaffold theory. Model based learning includes cognitive reasoning skills where existing models can be improved upon by construction of newer models using the old models as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nersessian|first1=Nancy J|title=The Cognitive Basis of Science|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-01177-9|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Model–based learning entails determining target models and a learning pathway that provide realistic chances of understanding." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=JJ|last2=Rea-Ramirez|first2=Mary Anne|title=Model Based Learning and Instruction in Science|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-6493-7|page=45|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Model making can also incorporate [[blended learning]] strategies by using web based tools and simulators, thereby allowing students to:
* Familiarize themselves with on-line or digital resources
* Create different models with various virtual materials at little or no cost
* Practice model making activity any time and any place
* Refine existing models

"A well-designed simulation simplifies a real world system while heightening awareness of the complexity of the system. Students can participate in the simplified system and learn how the real system operates without spending days, weeks or years it would take to undergo this experience in the real world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumschein|first1=Patrick|last2=Hung|first2=Woei|last3=Jonassen|first3=David|last4=Strobel|first4=Johannes|title=Model-Based Approaches to Learning|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-90-8790-711-2|url=https://www.sensepublishers.com/media/659-model-based-approaches-to-learning.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teacher's role in the overall teaching and learning process is primarily that of a [[facilitator]] and arranger of the learning experience. He or she would assign the students, a model making activity for a particular concept and provide relevant information or support for the activity. For virtual model making activities, the teacher can also provide information on the usage of the digital tool and render troubleshooting support in case of glitches while using the same. The teacher can also arrange the group discussion activity between the students and provide the platform necessary for students to share their observations and knowledge extracted from the model making activity.

Model–based learning evaluation could include the use of [[Rubric (academic)|rubrics]] that assess the ingenuity and creativity of the student in the model construction and also the overall classroom participation of the student vis-a-vis the knowledge constructed through the activity.

It is important, however, to give due consideration to the following for successful model–based learning to occur:
* Use of the right tool at the right time for a particular concept
* Provision within the educational setup for model–making activity: e.g., computer room with internet facility or software installed to access simulator or digital tool

H. Freeman and Company  | series =   | volume =   | edition =   | year = 1961  | location =   | pages = 5–6  | language =   | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn =  | mr =   | zbl =   | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with [[unique (mathematics)|exactly one]] element. For example, the set {0} is a singleton.

The term is also used for a 1-[[tuple]] (a [[sequence]] with one member).

==Properties==
Within the framework of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the [[axiom of regularity]] guarantees that no set is an element of itself. This implies that a singleton is necessarily distinct from the element it contains,&lt;ref name="Stoll"/&gt; thus 1 and {1} are not the same thing, and the [[empty set]] is distinct from the set containing only the empty set. A set such as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{1, 2, 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a singleton as it contains a single element (which itself is a set, however, not a singleton).

A set is a singleton [[if and only if]] its [[cardinality]] is {{num|1}}. In [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|von Neumann's set-theoretic construction of the natural numbers]], the number 1 is ''defined'' as the singleton {0}.

In [[axiomatic set theory]], the existence of singletons is a consequence of the [[axiom of pairing]]: for any set ''A'', the axiom applied to ''A'' and ''A'' asserts the existence of {''A'', ''A''}, which is the same as the singleton {''A''} (since it contains ''A'', and no other set, as an element).

If ''A'' is any set and ''S'' is any singleton, then there exists precisely one [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to ''S'', the function sending every element of ''A'' to the single element of ''S''. Thus every singleton is a [[terminal object]] in the [[category of sets]].

A singleton has the property that every function from it to any arbitrary set is injective. The only non-singleton set with this property is the [[empty set]].

The [[Bell number]] integer sequence counts the number of [[partitions of a set]] ({{OEIS2C|A000110}}), if singletons are excluded then the numbers are smaller ({{OEIS2C|A000296}}).

Structures built on singletons often serve as [[terminal object]]s or [[zero object]]s of various [[category (category theory)|categories]]:
* The statement above shows that the singleton sets are precisely the terminal objects in the category '''[[category of sets|Set]]''' of [[set (mathematics)|set]]s. No other sets are terminal.
* Any singleton admits a unique [[topological space]] structure (both subsets are open). These singleton topological spaces are terminal objects in the category of topological spaces and [[continuous function]]s. No other spaces are terminal in that category.
* Any singleton admits a unique [[group (mathematics)|group]] structure (the unique element serving as [[identity element]]). These singleton groups are [[Initial object|zero object]]s in the category of groups and [[group homomorphism]]s. No other groups are terminal in that category.

== Definition by indicator functions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (set theory)|class]] defined by an [[indicator function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;b: X \to \{0, 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''singleton'' if and only if there is some {{math|''y'' ∈ ''X''}} such that for all {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, 
:&lt;math&gt;b(x) = (x = y) &lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition in Principia Mathematica ==
The following definition was introduced by [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alfred North | last=Whitehead |author2=Bertrand Russell  | year=1910 | title=[[Principia Mathematica]]|volume=Vol. I | page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x =\hat{y}(y = x)&lt;/math&gt; '''Df.'''
The symbol &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{x\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}(y = x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the class of objects identical with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; aka &lt;math&gt;\{y:y=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.  
This occurs as a definition in the introduction, which, in places, simplifies the argument in the main text, where it occurs as proposition 51.01 (p.357 ibid.).
The proposition is subsequently used to define the cardinal number 1 as
:&lt;math&gt;1=\hat{\alpha}((\exists x)\alpha=\iota&lt;/math&gt;'''‘'''&lt;math&gt;x)&lt;/math&gt; '''Df.'''  
That is, 1 is the class of singletons. This is definition 52.01 (p.363 ibid.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45743">'''Societal collapse''' is the fall of a complex human [[society]]. Such a disintegration may be relatively abrupt, as in the case of [[Classic Maya collapse|Maya civilization]], or gradual, as in the case of the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. 

The subject of societal collapse is of interest in such fields as [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], and, more recently,  [[complex systems|complex-systems]] science.

== Causes of collapse ==
Common factors that may contribute to societal collapse are economical, environmental, social and cultural, and disruptions in one domain sometimes cascade into others.  In some cases a natural disaster (e.g. [[tsunami]], [[earthquake]], massive fire or climate change) may precipitate a collapse. Other factors such as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] or [[resource depletion]] might be the proximate cause of collapse.  Significant inequity may combine with lack of loyalty to established political institutions and result in an oppressed lower class rising up and seizing power from a smaller wealthy elite in a [[revolution]]. The diversity of forms that societies evolve corresponds to diversity in their failures.  [[Jared Diamond]] suggests that societies have also collapsed through deforestation, loss of soil fertility, restrictions of trade and/or rising endemic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared "Collapse: Why some societies succeed and others fail"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign invasions===
The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the events traditionally marking the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Barbarian invasions]], although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for another two centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]]). This view of the collapse of the Roman Empire is challenged, however, by modern historians who see Rome as merely transforming from the Western Empire into barbarian kingdoms as the Western Emperors delegated themselves out of existence, and the East transforming into the [[Byzantine Empire]], which only fell in 1453 AD.

[[North Africa]]'s populous and flourishing civilization collapsed after exhausting its resources in internal fighting and suffering devastation from the invasion of the [[Bedouin]] tribes of [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=461 The Great Mosque of Tlemcen], MuslimHeritage.com&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by Banu Hilal invaders had become completely arid desert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm Populations Crises and Population Cycles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527170154/http://www.galtoninstitute.org.uk/Newsletters/GINL9603/PopCrises3.htm |date=2013-05-27 }}, Claire Russell and W.M.S. Russell&lt;/ref&gt;

In the brutal pillaging that followed [[Mongol invasions]], the invaders decimated the populations of China, Russia, the Middle East, and [[Islam in Central Asia|Islamic Central Asia]]. Later Mongol leaders, such as [[Timur]], though he himself became a Muslim, destroyed many cities, slaughtered thousands of people and did irreparable damage to the ancient irrigation systems of [[Mesopotamia]]. These invasions transformed a settled society to a [[nomad]]ic one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html Ibn Battuta's Trip: Part Three - Persia and Iraq (1326 - 1327)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local [[List of epidemics|epidemics]] of extraordinary virulence. [[Smallpox]] ravaged [[Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[New World]] was caused by [[Old World]] diseases&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs]&lt;/ref&gt; although new research suggests tuberculosis from seals and sea lions played a significant part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bos|first=Kirsten I.|last2=Harkins|first2=Kelly M.|last3=Herbig|first3=Alexander|last4=Coscolla|first4=Mireia|last5=Weber|first5=Nico|last6=Comas|first6=Iñaki|last7=Forrest|first7=Stephen A.|last8=Bryant|first8=Josephine M.|last9=Harris|first9=Simon R.|date=2014-10-23|title=Pre-Columbian mycobacterial genomes reveal seals as a source of New World human tuberculosis|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v514/n7523/full/nature13591.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=514|issue=7523|pages=494–497|doi=10.1038/nature13591|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4550673|pmid=25141181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live smallpox was also included in the ship inventories of the Australian first settlement, and a smallpox epidemic spread across the continent 3 years after European settlement.

Societal collapse of many indigenous cultures has occurred as a result of European [[imperialism]] in various parts of the globe, particularly in areas where European settler communities took possession of land once held by native peoples, in Latin America and North America, and in [[Australasia]].  The effects of this dispossession are still evident in many of the problems confronting indigenous cultures, including [[alcoholism]], high rates of [[incarceration]], [[suicide]] rates and fraternal violence.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Sub-replacement fertility ===

The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]], writing in [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Polybius,  Histories, book 37, Depopulation of Greece|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9|website = www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes occurring with collapse==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
There are three main types of collapse:

'''Reversion/Simplification''': A society's [[adaptive capacity]] may be reduced by either a rapid change in population or societal complexity, destabilizing its institutions and causing massive shifts in population and other social dynamics.  In cases of collapse, civilizations tend to revert to less complex, less centralized socio-political forms using simpler technology.  These are characteristics of a [[Dark Ages in history|Dark Age]].  Examples of such societal collapse are: the [[Hittite Empire]], the [[Mycenaean civilization]], the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Mauryan]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] Empires in India, the [[Mayas]], the [[Angkor]] in Cambodia, the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties in China and the [[Mali Empire]].

'''Incorporation/Absorption''': Alternately, a society may be gradually incorporated into a more dynamic, more complex inter-regional social structure.  This happened in [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant|Levantine cultures]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Delhi Sultanate]]s in India, [[Song Dynasty|Song China]], the [[Aztec]] culture in Mesoamerica, the [[Inca]] culture in South America, and the modern civilizations of China, Japan, and India, as well as many modern states in the Middle East and Africa.

'''Obliteration''': Vast numbers of people in the society die, or the birth rate plunges to a level that causes a dramatic depopulation.

Other changes that may accompany a collapse:

* '''Destratification''': Complex societies stratified on the basis of class, gender, race or some other salient factor become much more homogeneous or horizontally structured. In many cases past social stratification slowly becomes irrelevant following collapse and societies become more egalitarian.
* '''Despecialization''': One of the most characteristic features of complex civilizations (and in many cases the yardstick to measure complexity) is a high level of job specialization. The most complex societies are characterized by artisans and tradespeople who specialize intensely in a given task. Indeed, the rulers of many past societies were hyper-specialized priests or priestesses who were completely supported by the work of the lower classes. During societal collapse, the social institutions supporting such specialization are removed and people tend to become more generalized in their work and daily habits.
* '''Decentralization''': As power becomes decentralized, people tend to be more self-regimented and have many more personal freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a slackening of social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the [[Classic Maya collapse|collapse of the Maya civilization]], many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.
* '''Destructuralization''': Institutions, processes, and artifacts are all manifest in the archaeological record in abundance in large civilizations. After collapse, evidence of epiphenomena, institutions, and types of artifacts change dramatically as people are forced to adopt more self-sufficient lifestyles.
* '''Depopulation''': Societal collapse is almost always associated with a [[population decline]].  In extreme cases, the collapse in population is so severe that the society disappears entirely, such as happened with the [[History of Greenland|Greenland Vikings]], or a number of [[Polynesia]]n islands.  In less extreme cases, populations are reduced until a [[demography|demographic balance]] is re-established between human societies and the depleted [[natural environment]].  A classic example is the city of [[History of Rome|Rome]], which had a population of about 1.5 million at the peak of the [[Roman Empire]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] in the early 2nd century AD, but in the [[Early Middle Ages]] the population had declined to only around 15,000 inhabitants by the 9th century.

==Population dynamics==
In the general study of [[cultural change]] and [[population dynamics]], a whole system displays complex ecosystem changes.  Organizational [[adaptability]] relates importantly to organizational diversity.

Several key features of human societal collapse can be related to population dynamics&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm Population crises and cycles in history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405081151/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/poprus.htm |date=2011-04-05 }}, A review of the book ''Population Crises and Population cycles'' by Claire Russell and W M S Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
The coupled breakdown of economic, cultural and social institutions with ecological relationships is perhaps the most common feature of collapse. In his book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] proposes five interconnected causes of collapse that may reinforce each other: non-sustainable exploitation of resources, climate changes, diminishing support from friendly societies, hostile neighbors, and inappropriate attitudes for change.&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;[[Jared Diamond]], ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'', [[Penguin Books]], 2005 and 2011 ({{ISBN|9780241958681}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/jared_diamond_on_why_societies_collapse.html Jared Diamond on why societies collapse]  TED talk, Feb 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Tainter]] theorizes that collapsed societies essentially exhausted their own designs, and were unable to adapt to natural diminishing returns for what they knew as their method of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tainter|first1=Joseph A.|authorlink=Joseph Tainter|date=1990|title=The Collapse of Complex Societies|edition=1st paperback|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It matches closely [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] idea that "they find problems they can't solve".

===Linking social and environmental dynamics===
Modern social critics commonly interpret things like sedentary social behavior as symptomatic of societal decay, and link what appears to be laziness with the depletion of important non-renewable resources. However, many primitive cultures also have high degrees of leisure, so if that is a cause in one place it may not be in another—leisure or apparent laziness is then not a sufficient cause.

What produces modern sedentary life, unlike [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, is extraordinary modern economic productivity. Tainter argues that exceptional productivity is actually more the sign of hidden weakness, both because of a society's dependence on it, and its potential to undermine its own basis for success by not being [[Self-limiting (biology)|self limiting]] as demonstrated in Western culture's ideal of perpetual growth.

As a population grows and technology makes it easier to exploit depleting resources, the environment's [[diminishing returns]] are hidden from view. Societal [[complexity]] is then potentially threatened if it develops beyond what is actually sustainable, and a disorderly reorganization were to follow. The scissors model of [[Malthusian]] collapse, where the population grows without limit and resources do not, is the idea of great opposing environmental forces cutting into each other.

For the modern world economy, for example, the growing conflict between food and fuel, depending on many of the same finite and diminishing resources, is visible in recent major [[commodity price shocks]].  It is one of the key relationships researchers, since the early studies of the [[Club of Rome]], have been most concerned with.

[[Jared Diamond]] pursues these themes in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]''.&lt;ref name=Diamond/&gt;

===Population pressure and mineral resource exhaustion===
[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilisation itself]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen is basing his pessimistic prediction on the two following considerations:
* According to his ecological view of [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in man's economy, only transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary [[Heat death of the universe|'heat death']] of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy on Earth.
* According to his social theory of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Man's economic struggle and the social evolution of mankind (bioeconomics)|'bioeconomics']], humanity's economic struggle to work and earn a livelihood is largely a continuation and extension of the biological struggle to sustain life and survive. This struggle manifests itself as a permanent social conflict that can be eliminated neither by man's decision to do so nor by the social evolution of mankind. Consequently, we are biologically unable to restrain ourselves collectively on a permanent and voluntary basis for the benefit of unknown future generations; the pressure of population on Earth's resources will nothing but increase.
Taken together, the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the second half of the 18th century has unintentionally thrust man's economy into a long, never-to-return [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]] with regard to the [[Peak minerals|Earth's mineral stock]]. The [[world economy]] will continue growing until its inevitable and final collapse in the future. From that point on, Georgescu-Roegen conjectures, ever deepening scarcities will aggravate social conflict throughout the globe and ultimately spell the end of mankind itself.

Georgescu-Roegen was the paradigm founder of ecological economics and is also considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]]. Consequently, much work in these fields is devoted to discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168–171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546–549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–145}} &lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;

=== Theories of energy return on energy invested ===
A related economic model is proposed by Thomas Homer-Dixon&lt;ref&gt;Homer-Dixon, Thomas (2007), "The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity and the Renewal of Civilization" (Knopf, Canada)&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Hall&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Charles 2009 "What is the Minimum EROI that a Sustainable Society Must Have" ENERGIES [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/2/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to our declining productivity of energy extraction, or energy return on energy invested ([[EROEI]]).  This measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.

There would be no surplus if EROEI approaches 1:1. What Hall showed is that the real cutoff is well above that, estimated to be 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. Part of the mental equation is that the EROEI of our generally preferred energy source, [[petroleum]], has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves.  An EROEI of more than ~3, then, is what appears necessary to provide the energy for societally important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance and the life styles of the rich and poor that a society depends on.

The EROEI figure also affects the number of people needed for sustainable food production. In the pre-modern world, it was often the case that 80% of the population was employed in agriculture to feed a population of 100%, with a low energy budget. In modern times, the use of cheap fossil fuels with an exceedingly high EROEI enabled 100% of the population to be fed with only 4% of the population employed in agriculture. Diminishing EROEI making fuel more expensive relative to other things may require food to be produced using less energy, and so increases the number of people employed in food production again.

===Models of societal response===
According to [[Joseph Tainter]]&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1990), ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'' (Cambridge University Press) pp. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; (1990), too many scholars offer facile explanations of societal collapse by assuming one or more of the following three models in the face of collapse:

# The '''Dinosaur''', a large-scale society in which resources are being depleted at an exponential rate and yet nothing is done to rectify the problem because the ruling elite are unwilling or unable to adapt to those resources' reduced availability:  In this type of society, rulers tend to oppose any solutions that diverge from their present course of action.  They will favor intensification and commit an increasing number of resources to their present plans, projects, and social institutions.
# The '''Runaway Train''', a society whose continuing function depends on constant growth (''cf.'' [[Frederick Jackson Turner]]'s [[Frontier Thesis]]):  This type of society, based almost exclusively on acquisition (''e.g.'', pillage or exploitation), cannot be sustained indefinitely.  The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] Empires, for example, both fractured and collapsed when no new conquests could be achieved.
#:Tainter argues that [[capitalism]] can be seen as an example of the Runaway Train model, in that [[generally accepted accounting principles|generally accepted accounting practices]] require publicly traded companies, along with many privately held ones, to exhibit growth as measured at some fixed interval (often [[Fiscal year#United States|three months]]).  Moreover, the ethos of [[consumerism]] on the demand side and the practice of [[planned obsolescence]] on the supply side encourage the purchase of an ever-increasing number of goods and services even when resource extraction and food production are unsustainable if continued at current levels.
# The '''House of Cards''', a society that has grown to be so large and include so many complex social institutions that it is inherently unstable and prone to collapse.  This type of society has been seen with particular frequency among [[Eastern bloc]] and other [[Communism|communist]] nations, in which all social organizations are arms of the government or ruling party, such that the government must either stifle association wholesale (encouraging dissent and [[Subversive|subversion]]) or exercise less authority than it asserts (undermining its legitimacy in the public eye).
#:By contrast, as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] [[Democracy in America|observed]], when voluntary and private associations are allowed to flourish and gain legitimacy at an institutional level, they complement and often even supplant governmental functions:  They provide a "safety valve" for dissent, assist with resource allocation, provide for social experimentation without the need for governmental coercion, and enable the public to maintain confidence in society as a whole, even during periods of governmental weakness.

====Tainter's critique====
Tainter argues that these models, though superficially useful, cannot severally or jointly account for all instances of societal collapse. Often they are seen as interconnected occurrences that reinforce each other.

[[File:AhuTongariki.JPG|thumb|[[Ahu Tongariki]] near [[Rano Raraku]], a 15-moai ahu excavated and restored in the 1990s]]

For example, the failure of [[Easter Island]]'s leaders to remedy rapid ecological deterioration cannot be understood without reference to the other models above.  The islanders, who erected large statues called ''[[moai]]'' as a form of religious reverence to their ancestors, used felled trees as rollers to transport them.  Because the islanders firmly believed that their displays of reverence would lead to increased future prosperity, they had a deeply entrenched incentive to intensify ''moai'' production.  Because Easter Island's geographic isolation made its resources hard to replenish and made the balance of its overall ecosystem very delicate ("House of Cards"), deforestation led to soil erosion and insufficient resources to build boats for fishing or tools for hunting.  Competition for dwindling resources resulted in warfare and many casualties (an additional "Runaway Train" iteration).  Together these events led to the collapse of the civilization, but no single factor above provides an adequate account.

Mainstream interpretations of the history of Easter Island also include the slave raiders who abducted a large proportion of the population and epidemics that killed most of the survivors (see [[Easter Island History#Destruction of society and population]].) Again, no single point explains the collapse; only a complex and integrated view can do so.

Tainter's position is that social complexity is a recent and comparatively anomalous occurrence requiring constant support. He asserts that collapse is best understood by grasping four axioms.  In his own words (p.&amp;nbsp;194):

# human societies are problem-solving organizations;
# sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance;
# increased complexity carries with it increased costs per capita; and
# investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

With these facts in mind, collapse can simply be understood as a loss of the energy needed to maintain social complexity. Collapse is thus the sudden loss of social complexity, stratification, internal and external communication and exchange, and productivity.

===Toynbee’s theory of decay===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[historian]] [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], in his 12-volume [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[A Study of History]]'' (1961), theorized that all [[civilization]]s pass through several distinct stages: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. ([[Carroll Quigley]] would expand on and refine this theory in his "The Evolution of Civilizations".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CarrollQuigley-TheEvolutionOfCivilizations-AnIntroductionTo The Evolution of Civilizations]&lt;/ref&gt;)

Toynbee argues that the breakdown of civilizations is not caused by loss of control over the environment, over the human environment, or attacks from outside. Rather, societies that develop great expertise in problem solving become incapable of solving new problems by overdeveloping their structures for solving old ones.

The fixation on the old methods of the "Creative Minority" leads it to eventually cease to be creative and degenerates into merely a "[[dominant minority]]" (that forces the majority to obey without meriting obedience), failing to recognize new ways of thinking. He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their "former self", by which they become prideful, and fail to adequately address the next challenge they face.

He argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a [[A Study of History#Universal state|Universal State]], which stifles political creativity. He states:

{{quote|First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force - against all right and reason - a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the [[Proletariat]] repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence when it executes its acts of secession.  Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation - and this on the part of all the actors in the tragedy of disintegration.  The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.}}

He argues that, as civilizations decay, they form an "Internal Proletariat" and an "External Proletariat." The Internal proletariat is held in subjugation by the dominant minority inside the civilization, and grows bitter; the external proletariat exists outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, and grows envious. He argues that as civilizations decay, there is a "schism in the body social", whereby ''abandon'' and ''self-control'' together replace [[creativity]], and ''truancy'' and ''martyrdom'' together replace [[Apprenticeship|disciple]]ship by the creative minority.

He argues that in this environment, people resort to [[archaism]] (idealization of the past), [[Futures studies|futurism]] (idealization of the future), [[escapism|detachment]] (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, as a Prophet).  He argues that those who transcend during a period of social decay give birth to a new Church with new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form after the old has died.

Toynbee's use of the word 'church' refers to the collective spiritual bond of a common worship, or the same unity found in some kind of [[social order]].

The great irony expressed by these and others like them is that civilizations that seem ideally designed to creatively solve problems, find themselves doing so self-destructively. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===Systems science===
Researchers, as yet, have very little ability to identify internal structures of large distributed systems like human societies, which is an important scientific problem.  Genuine structural collapse seems, in many cases, the only plausible explanation supporting the idea that such structures exist.  However, until they can be concretely identified, scientific inquiry appears limited to the construction of scientific narratives,&lt;ref&gt;T.F. Allen, J.A. Tainter et al. 2001 Dragnet Ecology: The Privilege of Science in a Postmodern World. BioScience&lt;/ref&gt; using [[systems thinking]] for careful storytelling about systemic organization and change.

History includes many examples of the appearance and disappearance of human societies with no obvious explanation.  The abrupt [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the course of a few months, without any external attack, according to [[Johan Galtung]] was due to growing structural contradictions brought on by geopolitical overreach, which could not be resolved within the existing socio-political systems.

Although a societal collapse is generally an endpoint for the administration of a culture's social and economic life, societal collapse can also be seen as simply a change of administration within the same culture.  [[Russian culture]] would seem to have outlived both the society of [[Imperial Russia]] and the society of the [[Soviet Union]], for example. Frequently the societal collapse phenomenon is also a process of decentralization of authority after a 'classic' period of centralized social order, perhaps replaced by competing centers as the central authority weakens.  Societal failure may also result in a degree of empowerment for the lower levels of a former climax society, who escape from the burden of onerous taxes and control by exploitative elites. For example, the [[Black Death|black plague]] contributed to breaking the hold of [[Europe]]an [[feudal society]] on its [[underclass]] in the 15th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62692">A '''story within a story''' is a [[literary device]] in which one character within a [[narrative]] narrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=David |last=Herman|first2=Manfred |last2=Jahn|first3=Marie-Laure |last3=Ryan|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Narrative Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oX8hmVw_yXYC&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-45840-0|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mise en abyme]]'' is the [[French language|French]] term for a similar literary device (also referring to the practice in [[heraldry]] of placing the image of a small shield on a larger shield). A story within a story can be used in all types of narration: [[novel]]s, [[short stories]], [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[poem]]s, [[song]]s, and [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[essays]].  The inner stories are told either simply to entertain or more usually to act as an example to the other characters. In either case the story often has symbolic and psychological significance for the characters in the outer story. There is often some parallel between the two stories, and the fiction of the inner story is used to reveal the truth in the outer story.  Often the stories within a story are used to satirize views, not only in the outer story, but also in the real world.  When a story is told within another instead of being told as part of the plot, it allows the author to play on the reader's perceptions of the characters—the motives and the [[unreliable narrator|reliability of the storyteller]] are automatically in question. Stories within a story may disclose the background of characters or events, tell of myths and legends that influence the plot, or even seem to be extraneous diversions from the plot. In some cases, the story within a story is involved in the action of the plot of the outer story.  In others, the inner story is independent, so that it can either be skipped over or be read separately, although many subtle connections may be lost. Sometimes, the inner story serves as an outlet for discarded [[idea]]s that the author deemed to be of too much merit to leave out completely, something that is somewhat analogous to the inclusion of [[deleted scenes]] with [[DVD]] releases of films.  Often, there is more than one level of internal stories, leading to deeply-nested fiction.

==Frame stories and Anthology Works==
{{main|Frame story}}
The literary device of stories within a story dates back to a device known as a "[[frame story]]", where a supplemental story is used to help tell the main story. Typically, the outer story, or "frame" does not have much matter, and most of the bulk of the work consists of one or more complete stories told by one or more storytellers.

The earliest examples of "frame stories" and "stories within stories" were in ancient Egyptian and [[Indian literature]], such as the Egyptian [[Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=312|editor=[[John Clute]] and [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]]|title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780312198695}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Indian epics]] like the ''[[Ramayana]]'', ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', ''[[Hitopadesha]]'' and ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and the Vampire]]''. In [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', an inter-woven series of colorful animal tales are told with one narrative opening within another, sometimes three or four layers deep, and then unexpectedly snapping shut in irregular rhythms to sustain attention. In the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Kurukshetra War]] is narrated by a character in [[Vyasa]]'s ''Jaya'', which itself is narrated by a character in [[Vaisampayana]]'s ''Bharata'', which itself is narrated by a character in Ugrasrava's ''Mahabharata''.

Both ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] and ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' by [[Ovid]] extend the depths of framing to several degrees. Another early example is the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where the general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In many of Scheherazade's narrations there are also [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|stories narrated]], and even in some of these, there are some other stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Burton | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Francis Burton | title =The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1 |publisher =[[Project Gutenberg]] |date=September 2003 |location = |pages = |url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt | doi = | id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is "[[The Three Apples]]", a [[murder mystery]] narrated by Scheherazade. Within the story, after the murderer reveals himself, he narrates a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] of events leading up to the murder. Within this flashback, an [[unreliable narrator]] tells a story to mislead the would-be murderer, who later discovers that he was misled after another character narrates the truth to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992 |isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the story concludes, the "[[s:Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son|Tale of Núr al-Dín Alí and his Son]]" is narrated within it.  This perennially popular work can be traced back to [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and Indian storytelling traditions. 

[[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' has a deeply nested frame story structure, that features the narration of an Arctic explorer, who records the narration of Victor Frankenstein, who recounts the narration of his creation, who narrates the story of a cabin dwelling family he secretly observes.  Similarly, [[Roald Dahl]]'s story ''[[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar]]'' is about a rich bachelor who finds an essay written by someone who learnt to "see" playing cards from the reverse side. The full text of this essay is included in the story, and itself includes a lengthy sub-story told as a true experience by one of the essay's protagonists, Imhrat Khan.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s [[Decameron]] are also classic frame stories.  In [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the characters tell tales suited to their personalities and tell them in ways that highlight their personalities. The noble knight tells a noble story, the boring character tells a very dull tale, and the rude miller tells a smutty tale. [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' too makes use of this device; [[Odysseus]]' adventures at sea are all narrated by Odysseus to the court of king [[Alcinous]] in [[Scheria]]. Other shorter tales, many of them false, account for much of the ''Odyssey''.  Many modern children's story collections are essentially [[anthology]] works connected by this device, such as [[Arnold Lobel]]'s ''Mouse Tales'', [[Paula Fox]]'s ''The Little Swineherd'', and Phillip and Hillary Sherlock's ''Ears and Tails and Common Sense''.

A well-known modern example of framing is ''[[The Princess Bride]]'' (both the book and the movie). In the movie, a grandfather is reading the story of "The Princess Bride" to his grandson. In the book, a more detailed frame story has a father editing a much longer (but fictive) work for his son, creating his own "Good Parts Version" (as the book called it) by leaving out all the parts that would bore a young boy. Both the book and the movie assert that the central story is from a book called "The Princess Bride" by a nonexistent author named [[William_Goldman#Autobiographical_fiction|S. Morgenstern]].
 
In the Welsh novel, [[Aelwyd F'Ewythr Robert]] (1852) by [[Gwilym Hiraethog]] a visitor to a farm in north Wales tells the story of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] to those gathered around the hearth.

Sometimes a frame story exists in the same setting as the main story. On the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', each episode was framed as though it were being told by [[Indiana Jones|Indy]] when he was older (usually acted by [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]], but once by [[Harrison Ford]]).  The same device of an adult narrator representing the older version of a young protagonist is used in the films ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' and ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', and the television show ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.

====Frame Stories in Music====

In [[The Amory Wars]], a tale told through the music of [[Coheed and Cambria]], tells a story for the first two albums but reveals that the story is being actively written by a character called the Writer in the third. During the album, the Writer delves into his own story and kills one of the characters, much to the dismay of the main character.

The critically acclaimed [[Beatles]] album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' is presented as a stage show by the fictional eponymous band, and one of its songs, "A Day in the Life" is in the form of a story within a dream. Similarly, the [[Fugees]] album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' is presented as the soundtrack to a fictional movie, as are several other notable [[concept albums]], while [[Wyclef Jean]]'s ''[[Wyclef_Jean_Presents_The_Carnival|The Carnival]]'' is presented as testimony at a trial.  The majority of [[Ayreon]]'s albums outline a sprawling, loosely interconnected science fiction narrative, as do the albums of [[Janelle Monae]].

In his 1895 [[historical novel]] ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', [[Bolesław Prus]] introduces a number of stories within the story, ranging in length from [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to full-blown stories, many of them drawn from [[ancient Egypt]]ian texts, that further the plot, illuminate [[Character (arts)|characters]], and even inspire the fashioning of individual characters.  [[Jan Potocki]]'s ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa]]'' (1797–1805) has an interlocking structure with stories-within-stories reaching several levels of depth.

The [[provenance]] of the story is sometimes explained internally, as in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], which depicts the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] (a story-internal version of the book itself) as a history compiled by several of the characters. The [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ("There and Back Again") is depicted as part of a rejected title of this book within a book, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' is a part of the final title.&lt;ref name = "havens"&gt;{{ME-ref|rotk|"The Grey Havens"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an interconnected inner story is "The Mad Trist" in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher|Fall of the House of Usher]]'', where through somewhat mystical means the narrator's reading of the story within a story influences the reality of the story he has been telling, so that what happens in "The Mad Trist" begins happening in "The Fall of the House of Usher". Also, in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]], there are many stories within the story that influence the hero's actions (there are others that even the author himself admits are purely digressive).

A commonly independently [[anthology|anthologised]] story is "[[The Grand Inquisitor]]" by [[Dostoevsky]] from his long [[psychological novel]] ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is told by one brother to another to explain, in part, his view on religion and morality. It also, in a succinct way, dramatizes many of Dostoevsky's interior conflicts.

An example of a "bonus material" style inner story is the chapter "The Town Ho's Story" in [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''; that chapter tells a fully formed story of an exciting [[mutiny]] and contains many plot ideas that Melville had conceived during the early stages of writing ''Moby-Dick''—ideas originally intended to be used later in the novel—but as the writing progressed, these plot ideas eventually proved impossible to fit around the characters that Melville went on to [[Characterization|create and develop]]. Instead of discarding the ideas altogether, Melville wove them into a coherent short story and had the character Ishmael demonstrate his eloquence and intelligence by [[story telling|telling the story]] to his impressed friends. 

With the rise of [[Modernist literature|literary modernism]], writers experimented with ways in which multiple narratives might nest imperfectly within each other. A particularly ingenious example of nested narratives is [[James Merrill]]'s 1974 [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poem]] "[[Lost in Translation (poem)|Lost in Translation]]".

In [[Rabih Alameddine]]'s novel ''The Hakawati'', or ''The Storyteller'', the protagonist describes coming home to the funeral of his father, one of a long line of traditional Arabic storytellers. Throughout the narrative, the author becomes hakawati (an Arabic word for a teller of traditional tales) himself, weaving the tale of the story of his own life and that of his family with folkloric versions of tales from Qur'an, the Old Testament, Ovid, and One Thousand and One Nights. Both the tales he tells of his family (going back to his grandfather) and the embedded folk tales, themselves embed other tales, often 2 or more layers deep.

In [[Sue Townsend]]'s ''[[Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years]]'', [[Adrian Mole|Adrian]] writes a book entitled ''Lo! The Flat Hills Of My Homeland'', in which the main character, Jake Westmorland, writes a book called ''Sparg of Kronk'', whose eponymous character, Sparg, writes a book with no language.

Dreams are a common way of including stories inside stories, and can sometimes go several levels deep.  Both the book ''The Arabian Nightmare'' and the curse of "eternal waking" from the [[Neil Gaiman]] series ''The Sandman'' feature an endless series of waking from one dream into another dream.  In [[Charles Maturin]]'s novel ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', the use of vast stories-within-stories creates a sense of dream-like quality in the reader.

=====Religion and Philosophy=====

This structure is also found in classic religious and philosophical texts.  The structure of ''[[The Symposium]]'' and ''[[Phaedo]]'', attributed to [[Plato]], is of a story within a story within a story.  In the Christian [[Bible]], the [[gospels]] are retellings of stories from the life and ministry of [[Jesus]].  However, they also include within them the stories ([[parable|parables]]) that Jesus told.  In more modern philosophical work, [[Jostein Gaarder]]'s books often feature this device. Examples are ''The Solitaire Mystery'', where the protagonist receives a small book from a baker, in which the baker tells the story of a sailor who tells the story of another sailor, and ''[[Sophie's World]]'' about a girl who is actually a character in a book that is being read by Hilde, a girl in another dimension. Later on in the book Sophie questions this idea, and realizes that Hilde too could be a character in a story that in turn is being read by another.

=====Nested science fiction=====
The experimental modernist works that incorporate multiple narratives into one story are quite often science-fiction or science fiction influenced.  These include most of the various novels written by the American author [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. Vonnegut includes the recurring character [[Kilgore Trout]] in many of his novels. Trout acts as the mysterious [[science fiction]] writer who enhances the morals of the novels through plot descriptions of his stories. Books such as ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'' and ''[[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'' are sprinkled with these plot descriptions.  [[Stanisław Lem]]'s ''Tale of the Three Storytelling Machines of King Genius'' from ''[[The Cyberiad]]'' has several levels of storytelling. All levels tell stories of the same person, Trurl.  

''[[House of Leaves]]'' is the tale of a man who finds a manuscript telling the story of a documentary that may or may not have ever existed, contains multiple layers of plot. The book includes footnotes and letters that tell their own stories only vaguely related to the events in the main narrative of the book, and footnotes for fake books. 

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s later books (''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'') propose the idea that every real universe is a fiction in another universe. This [[World as Myth|hypothesis]] enables many writers who are characters in the books to interact with their own creations.  [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Blind Assassin]]'' is interspersed with excerpts from a novel written by one of the main characters; the novel-within-a-novel itself contains a [[science fiction]] story written by one of ''that'' novel's characters. 

In [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', each character comes into interaction with a book called ''The Grasshopper Lies Heavy'', which was written by the Man in the High Castle. As Dick's novel details a world in which the [[Axis Powers of World War II]] had [[Axis victory in World War II|succeeded in dominating the known world]], the novel within the novel details an alternative to this history in which the Allies overcome the Axis and bring stability to the world – a victory which itself is quite different from our history.  

In ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'' by [[Philip J. Farmer]] a doubly [[recursive method]] is used to interwine its fictional layers. This novel is part of a science-fiction series, the ''[[World of Tiers]]''. Farmer collaborated in the writing of this novel with an American psychiatrist, Dr. A. James Giannini. Dr. Giannini had previously used the World of Tiers series in treating patients in group therapy. During these therapeutic sessions, the content and process of the text and novelist was discussed rather than the lives of the patients. In this way subconscious defenses could be circumvented. Farmer took the real life case-studies and melded these with adventures of his characters in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=A. J. |last=Giannini |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56–57 |year=2001 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/use-fiction-therapy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'' novel ''[[Knights Of The Morningstar]]'' also features a character who writes a book by that name.  In [[Matthew Stover]]'s novel ''[[Shatterpoint]]'', the protagonist [[Mace Windu]] narrates the story within his journal, while the main story is being told from the [[third-person limited]] point of view.  

Several ''[[Star Trek]]'' tales are stories or events within stories, such as [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s [[novelization]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', [[J. A. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Mudd's Angels]]'', [[John M. Ford]]'s ''[[The Final Reflection]]'', [[Margaret Wander Bonanno]]'s ''[[Strangers from the Sky]]'' (which adopts the conceit that it is book from the future by an author called Gen Jaramet-Sauner), and J. R. Rasmussen's "Research" in the anthology ''[[Star Trek: Strange New Worlds]] II''. [[Steven Barnes]]'s novelization of "[[Far Beyond the Stars]]" partners with [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' (Volume Two) to tell us that the story "Far Beyond the Stars"—and, by extension, all of ''Star Trek'' itself—is the creation of 1950s writer Benny Russell.

The book ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (later adapted into a film by [[The Wachowskis|The Wachowkis]] and [[Tom Tykwer]]) consisted of six interlinked stories nested inside each other in a Russian doll fashion. The first story (that of Adam Ewing in the 1850s befriending an escaped slave) is interrupted halfway through and revealed to be part of a journal being read by composer Robert Frobisher in 1930s Belgium. His own story of working for a more famous composer is told in a series of letters to his lover Rufus Sixsmith, which are interrupted halfway through and revealed to be in the possession of an investigative journalist named Luisa Rey and so on. Each of the first five tales are interrupt in the middle, with the sixth tale being told in full, before the preceding five tales are finished in reverse order. Each layer of the story either challenges the veracity of the previous layer, or is challenged by the succeeding layer. Presuming each layer to be a true telling within the overall story, a chain of events is created linking Adam Ewing's embrace of the abolitionist movement in the 1850s to the religious redemption of a post apocalyptic tribal man over a century after the fall of modern civilization. The characters in each nested layer take inspiration or lessons from the stories of their predecessors in a manner that validates a belief stated in the sixth tale that "Our lives are not our own. We are bound to others, past and present and by each crime, and every kindness, we birth our future."

====Play or film within a book====
''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]] has several characters seeing a play called ''The Courier's Tragedy'' by the fictitious [[English Renaissance theatre|Jacobean]] [[playwright]] Richard Wharfinger. The events of the play broadly mirror those of the novel and give the main character, Oedipa Maas, a greater context with which to consider her predicament; the play concerns a feud between two rival mail distribution companies, which appears to be ongoing to the present day, and in which, if this is the case, Oedipa has found herself involved. As in ''[[Hamlet]]'', the director makes changes to the original script; in this instance, a couplet that was added, possibly by religious zealots intent on giving the play extra moral gravity, are said only on the night that Oedipa sees the play. From what Pynchon tells us, this is the only mention in the play of Thurn and Taxis' rivals' name—Trystero—and it is the seed for the conspiracy that unfurls.  A significant portion of [[Walter Moers]]' ''Labyrinth of Dreaming Books'' is an [[ekphrasis]] on the subject of an epic puppet theater presentation.  Another example is found in [[Samuel Delany]]'s ''[[Trouble on Triton]]'', which features a theater company that produces elaborate staged spectacles for randomly selected single-person audiences.  Plays produced by the "Caws of Art" theater company also feature in Russell Hoban's modern fable, [[The Mouse and His Child]].

In [[Manuel Puig]]'s ''[[Kiss of the Spider Woman (novel)| Kiss of the Spider Woman]]'', ekphrases on various old movies, some real, and some fictional, make up a substantial portion of the narrative.  In [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]]'s ''Boys of Life'', descriptions of movies by director/antihero Carlos (loosely inspired by controversial director [[Pier Paulo Pasolini]]) provide a narrative counterpoint and add a touch of surrealism to the main narrative.  They additionally raise the question of whether works of artistic genius justify or atone for the sins and crimes of their creators.

===Nested plays===
This dramatic device was probably first used by [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' around 1587, where the play is presented before an audience of two of the characters, who comment upon the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The action and characters in ''The Murder'' mirror the murder of Hamlet's father in the main action, and Prince Hamlet writes additional material to emphasize this. Hamlet wishes to provoke the murderer, his uncle, and sums this up by saying "the play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Hamlet calls this new play ''The Mouse-trap'' (a title that [[Agatha Christie]] later took for the long-running play ''[[The Mousetrap]]''). The play ''I Hate Hamlet'' and the movie ''[[A Midwinter's Tale]]'' are about a production of ''Hamlet'', which in turn includes a production of ''The Murder of Gonzago'', as does the Hamlet-based film ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' which even features a third-level puppet theatre version within their play. Similarly, in [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' there are specific allusions to ''[[Hamlet]]'': in the first act a son stages a play to impress his mother, a professional actress, and her new lover; the mother responds by comparing her son to Hamlet. Later he tries to come between them, as Hamlet had done with his mother and her new husband. The tragic developments in the plot follow in part from the scorn the mother shows for her son's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Richard|editor=Miles, Patrick|title=Chekhov on the British stage  |year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|page=220|chapter=Chekhov into English: the case of 'The Seagull'|quote=A dominant motif in the play is the recurrent Hamlet theme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare adopted the play-within-a-play device for many of his other plays as well, including ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''and ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]''. Almost the whole of ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is a play-within-a-play, presented to convince [[Christopher Sly]], a drunken tinker, that he is a nobleman watching a private performance, but the device has no relevance to the plot (unless Katharina's subservience to her "lord" in the last scene is intended to strengthen the deception against the tinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspinall|first=Dana |title=The Taming of the Shrew|publisher=Routledge|location=London|year=2001|page=19|chapter=The play and the critics|isbn=978-0-8153-3515-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is often dropped in modern productions. The musical ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' is about the production of a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]], ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' based on the [[The Taming of the Shrew|Shakespeare play of the same name]], and features several scenes from it.  ''[[Pericles Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]'' draws in part on the 14th century ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (itself a frame story) by [[John Gower]] and Shakespeare has the ghost of Gower "assume man's infirmities" to introduce his work to the contemporary audience and comment on the action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=Judith|title=Shakespeare—Four late plays|year=2001|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|location=Ware, England|isbn=1-84022-104-6|pages=5–8|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Francis Beaumont]]'s ''[[Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' (ca. 1608) a supposed common citizen from the audience, actually a "planted" actor,  condemns the play that has just started and "persuades" the players to present something about a shopkeeper. The citizen's "apprentice" then acts, pretending to extemporise,  in the rest of the play. This is a satirical tilt at Beaumont's playwright contemporaries and their current fashion for offering plays about London life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Gurr|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle|year=1968|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0050015710|pages=2–6|chapter=Critical introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera ''[[Pagliacci]]'' is about a troupe of actors who perform a play about marital infidelity that mirrors their own lives, and composer [[Richard Rodney Bennett]] and [[playwright]]-[[librettist]] [[Beverley Cross]]'s ''[[The Mines of Sulphur]]'' features a ghostly troupe of actors who perform a play about murder that similarly mirrors the lives of their hosts, from whom they depart, leaving them with the plague as nemesis. And John Adams' ''Nixon in China'' (1985-7) features a surreal version of Madam Mao's ''Red Detachment of Women'' to extraordinary effect, illuminating the ascendance of human values over the disillusionment of high politics in the meeting.

In [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]],'' a play is staged as a [[parable]] to villagers in the [[Soviet Union]] to justify the re-allocation of their farmland: the tale describes how a child is awarded to a servant-girl rather than its natural mother, an aristocrat, as the woman most likely to care for it well. This kind of play-within-a-play, which appears at the beginning of the main play and acts as a 'frame' for it, is called an ''[[Induction (play)|'induction']]''. Brecht's one-act play ''[[The Elephant Calf]]'' (1926) is a play-within-a-play performed in the foyer of the theatre during his ''[[Man Equals Man]]''.

In [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s play [[Ondine (play)|''Ondine'']], all of act two is a series of scenes within scenes, sometimes two levels deep. This increases the [[dramatic tension]] and also makes more poignant the inevitable failure of the relationship between the [[Human|mortal]] Hans and [[water sprite]] Ondine.

''[[The Two-Character Play]]'' by [[Tennessee Williams]] has a concurrent double plot with the convention of a play within a play. Felice and Clare are siblings and are both actor/producers touring ‘The Two-Character Play.’ They have supposedly been abandoned by their crew and have been left to put on the play by themselves. The characters in the play are also brother and sister and are also named Clare and Felice.

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a modern reworking of the medieval [[mystery play]]s, remains faithful to its roots by having the modern actors play the sincere, naïve tradesmen and women as they take part in the original performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a play might be about the production of a play, and include the performance of all or part of the play, as in ''[[Noises Off]]'', ''[[A Chorus of Disapproval (play)|A Chorus of Disapproval]]'' or ''[[Lilies (play)|Lilies]]''.  Similarly, the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' presents the story of Don Quixote as an impromptu play staged in prison by ''[[Don Quixote|Quixote]]'''s author, [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

In most stagings of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', which include the song "Growltiger's Last Stand" — a recollection of an old play by Gus the Theatre Cat — the character of Lady [[Griddlebone]] sings "The Ballad of Billy McCaw". (However, many productions of the show omit "Growltiger's Last Stand", and "The Ballad of Billy McCaw" has at times been replaced with a mock aria, so this metastory isn't always seen.) Depending on the production, there is another musical scene called The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollices where the Jellicles put on a show for their leader. In ''[[Lestat: The Musical]]'', there are three play within a plays. First, when Lestat visits his childhood friend, Nicolas, who works in a theater, where he discovers his love for theater; and two more when the Theater of the Vampires perform. One is used as a plot mechanism to explain the vampire god, Marius, which sparks an interest in Lestat to find him.

A play within a play also occurs in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'', where Princess Tuptim and the royal dancers give a performance of ''Small House of Uncle Thomas'' (or ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'') to their English guests. The play mirrors Tuptim's situation, as she wishes to run away from slavery to be with her lover, Lun Tha.

In stagings of [[Dina Rubina]]'s play ''Always the Same Dream'', the story is about staging a school play based on a poem by [[Pushkin]].

Joseph Heller's 1967 play ''[[We Bombed in New Haven]]'' is about actors engaged in a play about military airmen; the actors themselves become at times unsure whether they are actors or actual airmen.

The 1937 musical [[Babes in Arms]] is about a group of kids putting on a musical to raise money.  The central plot device was retained for the popular 1939 film version with [[Judy Garland]] and [[Mickey Rooney]].  A similar plot was recycled for the films [[White Christmas (film)|White Christmas]] and [[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]].

===Nested films===

[[TV Tropes]] maintains a list of feature films that feature this plot device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShowWithinAShow/LiveActionFilms |title=Live-Action Films / Show Within A Show |publisher=TV Tropes |date= |accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) is frequently listed as the earliest example, although there are antecedents in silent cinema such as ''[[Mabel's Dramatic Career]]'' (1913).

The [[François Truffaut]] film ''[[Day for Night (film)|Day for Night]]'' is about the making of a fictitious movie called ''Meet Pamela'' (''Je vous présente Pamela'') and shows the interactions of the actors as they are making this movie about a woman who falls for her husband's father. The story of ''Pamela'' involves lust, betrayal, death, sorrow, and change, events that are mirrored in the experiences of the actors portrayed in ''Day for Night''.  There are a wealth of other movies that revolve around the film industry itself, even if not centering exclusively on one nested film.  These include the darkly satirical classic ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' about an aging star and her parasitic victim, and the Coen Brothers' farce ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''

The script to [[Karel Reisz]]'s movie ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981), written by [[Harold Pinter]], is a film-within-a-film adaptation of [[John Fowles]]'s book. In addition to the Victorian love story of the book, Pinter creates a present-day background story that shows a love affair between the main actors.

In [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', Keaton's protagonist actually enters into a film while it is playing in a cinema, as does the main character in the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] children's film ''[[The Last Action Hero]]''.  A similar device is used in the seminal music video ''[[Take on me]]'' by [[A-ha]], which features a young woman entering a cartoon universe. Conversely, [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' is about a movie character exiting the movie to interact with the real world.  Allen's earlier film ''[[Play_It_Again,_Sam_(film)|Play it Again, Sam]]'' featured liberal use of characters, dialogue and clips from the film classic ''[[Casablanca_(film)|Casablanca]]'' as a central device.

The 2002 [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Talk to Her]]'' (''Hable con ella'') has the chief character Benigno tell a story called ''The Shrinking Lover'' to Alicia, a long-term comatose patient whom Benigno, a male nurse, is assigned to care for. The film presents ''The Shrinking Lover'' in the form of a black-and-white silent melodrama. To prove his love to a scientist girlfriend, ''The Shrinking Lover'' protagonist drinks a potion that makes him progressively smaller. The resulting seven-minute scene, which is readily intelligible and enjoyable as a stand-alone short subject, is considerably more overtly comic than the rest of ''Talk to Her''—the protagonist climbs giant breasts as if they were rock formations and even ventures his way inside a (compared to him) gigantic vagina. Critics have noted that ''The Shrinking Lover'' essentially is a sex metaphor. Later in ''Talk to Her,'' the comatose Alicia is discovered to be pregnant and Benigno is sentenced to jail for rape. ''The Shrinking Lover'' was named [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025551/http://skandies.org/skandies02.html Best Scene of 2002] in the ''Skandies'', an annual survey of online cinephiles and critics invited each year by critic Mike D'Angelo.

''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' (2008) is a [[comedy film]] revolving around a group of [[prima donna]] actors making a [[Vietnam War]] film (itself also named "Tropic Thunder") when their fed-up writer and director decide to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.  The concept was perhaps inspired by the 1986 comedy [[Three Amigos]], where three washed-up silent film stars are expected to live out a real-life version of their old hit movies.  The same idea of life being forced to imitate art was also reprised in the [[Star Trek]] parody [[Galaxy Quest]].

The first episode of the [[anime]] series ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' consists almost entirely of a poorly made film that the protagonists created, complete with [[Kyon]]'s typical, sarcastic commentary.

[[Chuck Jones]]'s 1953 [[cartoon]] ''[[Duck Amuck]]'' shows [[Daffy Duck]] trapped in a cartoon that an unseen animator repeatedly manipulates. At the end, it is revealed that the whole cartoon was being controlled by [[Bugs Bunny]]. The ''Duck Amuck'' plot was essentially replicated in one of Jones' later cartoons, ''[[Rabbit Rampage]]'' (1955), in which Bugs Bunny turns out to be the victim of the sadistic animator ([[Elmer Fudd]]). A similar plot was also included in an episode of ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', in which Bugs was the victim, Daffy was the animator, and it was made on a computer instead of a pencil and paper. In 2007, the ''Duck Amuck'' sequence was parodied on ''[[Drawn Together]]'' ("Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care").

All feature-length films by [[Jörg Buttgereit]] except ''[[Schramm (film)|Schramm]]'' feature a film within the film. In ''[[Nekromantik]]'', the protagonist goes to the cinema to see the fictional slasher film ''Vera''. In ''[[Der Todesking]]'' one of the character watches a video of the fictional Nazi exploitation film ''Vera - Todesengel der Gestapo'' and in ''[[Nekromantik 2]]'', the characters go to see a movie called ''Mon dejeuner avec Vera'' which is a parody of [[Louis Malle]]'s ''[[My Dinner with André]]''

[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' depicts a [[Nazi propaganda]] film called ''[[Nation's Pride]]'', which glorifies a soldier in the German army.  ''Nation's Pride'' is directed by [[Eli Roth]].

[[Joe Dante]]'s ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' depicts ''Mant'', an early-'60s sci-fi/horror movie about a man who turns into an [[ant]].  In one scene, the protagonists see a [[Disney]]-style family movie called ''The Shook-Up Shopping Cart''.

====Story within a Film====
The 2002 martial arts epic [[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]] presented the same narrative several different times, as recounted by different storytellers, but with both factual and aesthetic differences.  Similarly, in the whimsical 1988 [[Terry Gilliam]] film [[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]], and the 2003 [[Tim Burton]] film [[Big Fish]], the bulk of the film is a series of stories told by an (extremely) unreliable narrator.  In the 2006 Tarsem film ''[[The Fall (2006 film)|The Fall]]'', an injured silent-movie stuntman tells [[heroic fantasy]] stories to a little girl with a broken arm to pass time in the hospital, which the film visualizes and presents with the stuntman's voice becoming voiceover narration. The fantasy tale bleeds back into and comments on the film's "present-tense" story. There are often incongruities based on the fact that the stuntman is an American and the girl Persian—the stuntman's voiceover refers to "Indians," “a squaw” and “a teepee,” but the visuals show a Bollywood-style devi and a Taj Mahal-like castle.  The same conceit of an unreliable narrator was used to very different effect in the 1995 crime drama [[The Usual Suspects]] (which garnered an Oscar for [[Kevin Spacey]]'s performance).

The seminal 1950 Japanese film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', based on the Japanese short story "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), utilizes the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-within-a-flashback technique. The story unfolds in flashback as the four witnesses in the story—the bandit, the murdered [[samurai]], his wife, and the nameless woodcutter—recount the events of one afternoon in a grove. But it is also a flashback within a flashback, because the accounts of the witnesses are being retold by a woodcutter and a priest to a ribald commoner as they wait out a rainstorm in a ruined gatehouse.

The movie ''[[Inception]]'' has a deeply nested structure that is itself part of the setting, as the characters travel deeper and deeper into layers of dreams within dreams.  Similarly, in the beginning of the music video for the [[Michael Jackson]] song "[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]", the heroine is terrorized by her monster boyfriend in what turns out to be a movie within a dream.  The film ''[[Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' has four layers of narration; starting with a young girl at the author's memorial reading his book, it cuts to the old author in 1985 telling of an incident in 1968 when he, as a young author, stayed at the hotel and met the owner, old Zero. He was then told the story of young Zero and M Gustave, from 1932, which makes up most of the narrative.

====Play within a film====
The 2001 film ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' features a [[List of Fictional Musicals|fictitious musical]] within a film, called "Spectacular Spectacular". The 1942 [[Ernst Lubitsch]] comedy ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' confuses the audience in the opening scenes with a play, "The Naughty Nazis", about Adolf Hitler which appears to be taking place within the actual plot of the film. Thereafter, the acting company players serve as the protagonists of the film and frequently use acting/costumes to deceive various characters in the film. ''[[Hamlet]]'' also serves as an important throughline in the film, as suggested by the title. [[Laurence Olivier]] sets the opening scene of his 1944 film of ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' in the [[Green room|tiring room]] of the old [[Globe Theatre]] as the actors prepare for their roles on stage. The early part of the film follows the actors in these "stage" performances and only later does the action almost imperceptibly expand to the full realism of the [[Battle of Agincourt]]. By way of increasingly more artificial sets (based on mediaeval paintings) the film finally returns to The Globe.  Mel Brook's film, ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'', revolves around a scheme to make money by producing a disastrously bad Broadway musical, ''Springtime For Hitler.''  Ironically the film itself was later made into its own Broadway musical (although a more intentionally successful one). The [[Outkast]] music video for the song "Roses" is a short film about a high school musical.

The main plot device in ''[[Repo! The Genetic Opera]]'' is an opera which is going to be held the night of the events of the movie. All of the principal characters of the film play a role in the opera, though the audience watching the opera is unaware that some of the events portrayed are more than drama.

In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'',  the middle-schoolers put on a play of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The 1990 biopic [[Korczak (film)|Korczak]], about the last days of a Jewish children's orphanage in Nazi occupied Poland, features an amateur production of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s ''The Post Office'', which was selected by the orphanage's visionary leader as a way of preparing his charges for their own impending death.  That same production is also featured in the stage play ''Korczak's Children,'' also inspired by the same historical events.

====TV Show within a Film====
The 1973 film adaptation&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (film)|''The National Health'' (film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Peter Nichols]]'s 1969 play,&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Health (play)]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The National Health (play)|The National Health]]'' features a send-up of a typical American hospital [[soap-opera]] being shown on a television situated in an underfunded, unmistakably [[United Kingdom|British]] [[National Health Service|NHS]] hospital.

The Jim Carey film [[The Truman Show]] is about a person who grows to adulthood without ever realizing that he is the unwitting hero of the immersive eponymous television show.

===Nested video games===
{{main|Minigame}}

The first example of a video game within a video game is almost certainly [[Tim Stryker]]'s 80s era text-only game Fazuul (also the world's first online multiplayer game), in which one of the objects that the player can create is a minigame.  Another early use of this trope was in [[Cliff Johnson (game designer)|Cliff Johnson]]'s 1987 hit [[The Fool's Errand]], a thematically linked narrative puzzle game, in which several of the puzzles were semi-independent games played against NPCs.

''[[Power Factor (video game)|Power Factor]]'' has been cited as a rare example of a video game in which the entire concept is a video game within a video game: The player takes on the role of a character who is playing a "Virtual Reality Simulator", in which he in turn takes on the role of the hero Redd Ace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=ProReview: Power Factor |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=55|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1993 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[.hack]]'' franchise also gives the concept a central role. It features a narrative in which internet advancements have created an MMORPG franchise called The World. Protagonists Kite and [[Haseo]] try to uncover the mysteries of the events surrounding The World. Characters in .hack are self-aware that they are video game characters.

More commonly, however, the video game within a video game device takes the form of mini-games that are non-plot oriented, and optional to the completion of the game. For example, in the ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' and ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' franchises, there are playable arcade machines featuring other Sega games that are scattered throughout the game world.

In ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' there are several video games that can be played in an arcade in the Gold Saucer theme park. In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', the player can acquire individual NES emulations through various means and place them within their house, where they are playable in their entirety. When placed in the house, the games take the form of a [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In ''[[Fallout 4]]'', the protagonist can find several cartridges throughout the wasteland that can be played on his pip-boy (an electronic device that exists only in the world of the game) or any terminal computer.

====TV show within a video game====
In the [[Remedy Entertainment|Remedy]] video game title ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' players can chance upon a number of ongoing television shows when activating or happening upon various television sets within the game environs, depending on where / when they are within the unfolding game narrative will dictate which episode of what show is found. Among them are ''[[Lords &amp; Ladies]]'', ''[[Captain Baseball Bat Boy]]'', ''[[Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne|Dick Justice]]'' and the pinnacle television serial ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Address Unknown]]'' -heavily inspired by David Lynch style film narrative, particularly ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', Address Unknown sometimes prophesies events or character motives yet to occur in the Max Payne narrative.

In ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', the player can watch several TV channels which include many programs: reality shows, cartoons, and even game shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2008/04/watching-tv-and/ Grand Theft Auto IV Shifts Into Media Overdrive].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nested TV shows===
''[[Terrance &amp; Phillip]]'' from ''[[South Park]]'' comments on the levels of violence and acceptable behaviour in the media and allow criticism of the outer cartoon to be addressed in the cartoon itself. Similarly, on the long running animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', Bart's favorite cartoon, ''[[Itchy and Scratchy]]'' (a parody of ''[[Tom &amp; Jerry]]''), often echoes the plotlines of the main show.  ''[[The Simpsons]]'' also parodied this structure with numerous 'layers' of sub-stories in the Season 17 episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]".

On the show ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', the ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' parody ''Defamation'' offers a ironic commentary on the main show's theme of interracial relationships.  Similarly, on the HBO show ''[[Insecure (TV series)|Insecure]]'' the slavery-era soap opera ''Due North'' is an obsession for the show's main characters.

The [[Ireland|Irish]] television series ''[[Father Ted]]'' features a television show, ''Father Ben'', which has characters and storylines almost identical to that of Father Ted.

The television shows ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'', and ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' feature a sketch show within the TV show.

An extended plotline on the semi-autobiographical sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' dealt with the main characters developing a sitcom about their lives.  The gag was reprised on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', another semi-autobiographical show by and about ''Seinfeld'' co-creator Larry David, when the long-anticipated ''Seinfeld'' reunion was staged entirely inside the new show.

The ''[[USS Callister]]'' episode of the ''[[Black Mirror]]'' anthology television series is about a man obsessed with a Star-Trek like show, who recreates it as part of a virtual reality game.

The concept of a film within a television series is employed in the [[Macross]] universe. ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' (1984) was originally intended as an alternative theatrical re-telling of the television series ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' (1982), but was later "[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]" into the Macross [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] as a popular movie within the television series ''[[Macross 7]]'' (1994).

====Film within a TV show====

''Seinfeld'' had a number of reoccurring fictional films, most notably ''Rochelle, Rochelle'', a parody of artsy but exploitative foreign films, while the trippy, metaphysically loopy thriller ''Death Castle'' is a central element of the ''[[Master of None]]'' episode ''New York, I Love You.''

==Fantasy within Realism==

Stories inside stories can allow for genre changes.  [[Arthur Ransome]] uses the device to let his young characters in the ''[[Swallows and Amazons series]]'' of children's books, set in the recognisable everyday world, take part in fantastic adventures of piracy in distant lands: two of the twelve books, ''[[Peter Duck]]'' and ''[[Missee Lee]]'' (and some would include ''[[Great Northern?]]'' as a third), are adventures supposedly made up by the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' does the same thing by making its inner story into a dream.  Lewis Carroll's celebrated ''[[Alice_(Alice's_Adventures_in_Wonderland)|Alice]]'' books use the same device of a dream as an excuse for fantasy, while Carroll's less well-known ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'' subverts the trope by allowing the dream figures to enter and interact with the "real" world.
==Fractal Fiction==
Some stories feature what might be called a literary version of the [[Droste effect]], where an image contains a smaller version of itself (also a common feature in many [[fractals]]).  Among the stories that include versions of themselves are [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman: Worlds' End]]'' which contains several instances of multiple storytelling levels, including ''Cerements'' (issue #55) where one of the inmost levels corresponds to one of the outer levels, turning the story-within-a-story structure into an infinite regression. Similarly, in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s 2008 film ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'', the main character Caden Cotard is a skilled director of plays who receives a grant, and ends up creating a remarkable theater piece intended as a carbon copy of the outside world.  The layers of copies of the world ends up several layers deep.

The long-running musical [[A Chorus Line]] dramatizes its own creation, and the life stories of its own original cast members.  The famous final number does double duty as the showstopper for both the musical the audience is watching and the one the characters are appearing in.

Michael Ende's classic children's novel [[The Neverending Story]] prominently features a book of the same title.  This is later revealed to be the same book the audience is reading, when it begins to be retold again from the beginning, thus creating an infinite regression that features as a plot element.  Similarly, in the Will Ferrell comedy [[Stranger_than_Fiction_(2006_film)|Stranger than Fiction]] the main character discovers he is a character in a book that (along with its author) also exists in the same universe.

In [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', there is a narrative between [[Achilles and the Tortoise]] (characters borrowed from [[Lewis Carroll]], who in turn borrowed them from [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]]), and within this story they find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of the Tortoise, and Achilles taking the part of Achilles. Within this narrative, which itself is somewhat self-referential, the two characters find a book entitled "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and the Tortoise Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, the Tortoise taking the part of Achilles, and Achilles taking the part of the Tortoise.

The music video for the [[Björk]] song "[[Bachelorette (song)|Bachelorette]]" features a musical that is about, in part, the creation of that musical. A mini-theater and small audience appear on stage to watch the musical-within-a-musical, and at some point, within that second musical a yet-smaller theater and audience appear.

Episode 14 of the [[anime]] series ''[[Martian Successor Nadesico]]'' is essentially a clip show, but has several newly animated segments based on ''[[Gekigangar III]]'', an anime that exists within its universe and that many characters are fans of, that involves the characters of that show watching Nadesico. The episode ends with the crew of the Nadesico watching the very same episode of Gekigangar, causing a [[paradox]].

''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' begins with an action film opening, which turns out to be a sequence being filmed by [[Steven Spielberg]].  Near the ending, the events of the film itself are revealed to be a movie being enjoyed by the characters. The 1985 Tim Burton film [[Pee-Wee's Big Adventure]] ends with the main characters watching a film version of their own adventures, but as reimagined as a Hollywood blockbuster action film, with [[James Brolin]] as a more stereotypically manly version of the [[Paul Reubens]] title character.  [[Mel Brooks]]'s 1974 comedy ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' leaves its Western setting when the climactic fight scene breaks out, revealing the setting to have been a set in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio lot; the fight spills out onto an adjacent musical set, then into the studio canteen, and finally onto the streets. The two protagonists arrive at [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]], which is showing the "premiere" of ''Blazing Saddles''; they enter the cinema to watch the conclusion of their own film.  Brooks recycled the gag in his 1987 ''[[Star Wars]]'' parody, ''[[Spaceballs]]'', where the villains are able to locate the heroes by watching a copy of the movie they are in on VHS video tape (a comic exaggeration of the phenomenon of films being available on video before their theatrical release).  Brooks also made the 1976 parody ''[[Silent Movie]]'' about a buffoonish team of filmmakers trying to make the first Hollywood silent film in forty years --which is essentially that film itself (another forty years later, life imitated art imitating art, when an actual modern silent movie became a hit, the Oscar nominated ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'').

In the latter two films of the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' horror trilogy, a film-within-a-film format is used when the events of the first film spawn their own horror trilogy within the films themselves. In ''[[Scream 2]]'', characters get killed while watching a film version of the events in the first ''Scream'' film, while in ''[[Scream 3]]'' the actors playing the trilogy's characters end up getting killed, much in the same way as the characters they are playing on screen. In the latest ''Scream'' movie, ''[[Scream 4]]'', in the opening sequence, two characters are watching Stab 7 before they get killed. Also, the characters of Stab 7 are watching Stab 6. There's also a party in which all seven Stab movies were going to be shown. References are also made to Stab 5 involving [[time travel]] as a plot device.

Director [[Spike Jonze]]'s ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'' is a fictionalized version of screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s struggles to adapt the non-cinematic book ''[[The Orchid Thief]]'' into a Hollywood blockbuster.  As his onscreen self succumbs to the temptation to commercialize the narrative, Kaufman incorporates those techniques into the script, including tropes such as an invented romance, a car chase, a drug-running sequence, and an imaginary identical twin for the protagonist. (The movie also features scenes about the making of ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', previously written by Kaufman and directed by Jonze.)  Robert Altman's satirical noir ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' about Hollywood ends with the antihero being pitched a movie version of his own story, complete with an unlikely happy ending.

==From story within a story to separate story==
Occasionally a story within a story becomes such a popular element that the producer(s) decide to develop it autonomously as a separate and distinct work. This is an example of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]].

In the fictional world of the ''[[Toy Story]]'' movies, [[Buzz Lightyear]] is an animated toy action figure, which was based on a fictitious cartoon series, ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'', which did not exist in the real world except for snippets seen within ''Toy Story''. Later, ''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' was produced in the real world.

''[[Kujibiki Unbalance]]'', a series in the ''[[Genshiken]]'' universe, has spawned merchandise of its own, and been remade into a series on its own.

Such spin-offs may be produced as a way of providing additional information on the fictional world for fans. In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, three such supplemental books have been produced. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' is a textbook used by the main character, and ''[[Quidditch Through the Ages]]'' is a book from the library at his school. ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]'' provides an additional layer of fiction, the 'tales' being instructional stories told to children in the characters' world.

In the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Kilgore Trout]] has written a novel called ''[[Venus on the Half-Shell]]''. In 1975 real-world author [[Philip José Farmer]] wrote a science-fiction novel called ''Venus on the Half-Shell'', published under the name Kilgore Trout.

In ''[[Homestuck]]'' by [[Andrew Hussie]], there is a comic called [[Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff]], created by one of the characters, Dave Strider. It was later adapted to its own ongoing series.

''Captain Proton: Defender of the Earth'', a story by [[Dean Wesley Smith]], was adapted from the holonovel ''[[Captain Proton]]'' in the [[Star Trek]] universe.

In the animated online franchise ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' many of the best-known features were spun off from each other.  The best known was "Strong Bad Emails," which depicted the villain of the original story giving snarky answers to fan emails, but that in turn spawned several other long-running features which started out as figments of Strong Bad's imagination, including the teen-oriented cartoon parody "Teen Girl Squad" and the anime parody "20X6."

One unique example is the [[Tyler Perry]] comedy/horror hit ''[[Boo! A Madea Halloween]]'' which originated as a parody of Tyler Perry films in the [[Chris Rock]] film ''[[Top 5]]''.

In [[mathematics]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is a '''subset''' of a set ''B'', or equivalently ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', if ''A'' is "contained" inside ''B'', that is, all [[Element_(mathematics)|elements]] of ''A'' are also elements of ''B''. ''A'' and ''B'' may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called '''inclusion''' or sometimes '''containment'''. ''A'' is a subset of ''B'' may also be expressed as ''B'' includes ''A''; or ''A'' is included in ''B''.

The subset relation defines a [[partial order]] on sets.

The [[algebraic structure|algebra]] of subsets forms a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] in which the subset relation is called [[inclusion (Boolean algebra)|inclusion]].

==Definitions==
If ''A'' and ''B'' are sets and every [[element (mathematics)|element]] of ''A'' is also an element of ''B'', then:
:* ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B,&lt;/math&gt;
:or equivalently
:* ''B'' is a '''superset''' of ''A'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;B \supseteq A.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|proper subset}}
If ''A'' is a subset of ''B'', but ''A'' is not [[equal (math)|equal]] to ''B'' (i.e. [[there exists]] at least one element of B which is not an element of ''A''), then 
:* ''A'' is also a '''proper''' (or '''strict''') '''subset''' of ''B''; this is written as &lt;math&gt;A \subsetneq B.&lt;/math&gt;
:or equivalently
:* ''B'' is a '''proper superset''' of ''A''; this is written as &lt;math&gt;B \supsetneq A.&lt;/math&gt;

For any set ''S'', the inclusion [[binary relation|relation]] ⊆ is a [[partial order]] on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; of all subsets of ''S'' (the [[power set]] of ''S'') defined by &lt;math&gt;A \leq B \iff A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;. We may also partially order &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; by reverse set inclusion by defining &lt;math&gt;A \leq B \iff B \subseteq A.&lt;/math&gt; 

When quantified, {{math|A ⊆ B}} is represented as: {{math|∀x{x∈A → x∈B}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Kenneth H.|title=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-338309-5|page=119|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="SYMBOLS"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;!-- to allow easy linking to this section which contains math in its name --&gt;

==Properties==
* A  set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' [[if and only if]] their intersection is equal to A.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cap B = A. &lt;/math&gt;

* A  set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' if and only if their union is equal to B.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow A \cup B = B. &lt;/math&gt;

* A '''finite''' set ''A'' is a '''subset''' of ''B'' if and only if the [[cardinality]] of their intersection is equal to the cardinality of A.
:Formally:
:&lt;math&gt; A \subseteq B \Leftrightarrow |A \cap B| = |A|. &lt;/math&gt;

==⊂ and ⊃ symbols==
[[File:Venn A subset B.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Euler diagram]] showing&lt;br&gt; ''A'' is a proper subset of ''B'', &amp;nbsp;''A''⊂''B'',&amp;nbsp; and conversely ''B'' is a proper superset of ''A''.]]
Some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate ''subset'' and ''superset'' respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊆ and ⊇.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Rudin | first1=Walter | author1-link=Walter Rudin | title=Real and complex analysis | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-07-054234-1 | mr=924157  | year=1987|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; So for example, for these authors, it is true of every set ''A'' that {{nowrap|''A'' ⊂ ''A''}}.

Other authors prefer to use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate ''proper''(also called strict) subset and ''proper'' superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊊ and ⊋.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Subsets and Proper Subsets | url=http://it.edgecombe.edu/homepage/killorant/MAT140/Module1/Subsets.pdf | accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage makes ⊆ and ⊂ analogous to the [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] symbols ≤ and &lt;. For example, if {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} then ''x'' may or may not equal ''y'', but if {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}}, then ''x'' definitely does not equal ''y'', and ''is'' less than ''y''. Similarly, using the convention that ⊂ is proper subset, if {{nowrap|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}}, then ''A'' may or may not equal ''B'', but if {{nowrap|''A'' ⊂ ''B''}}, then ''A'' definitely does not equal ''B''.

== Examples ==
[[File:PolygonsSet EN.svg|thumb|The regular polygons form a subset of the polygons]]
* The set A = {1, 2} is a proper subset of B = {1, 2, 3}, thus both expressions A ⊆ B and A ⊊ B are true.
* The set D = {1, 2, 3} is a subset (but ''not'' a proper subset) of E = {1, 2, 3}, thus D ⊆ E is true, and D ⊊ E is not true (false).
* Any set is a subset of itself, but not a proper subset. (X ⊆ X is true, and X ⊊ X is false for any set X.)
* The [[empty set]] {&amp;nbsp;}, denoted by ∅, is also a subset of any given set ''X''. It is also always a proper subset of any set except itself.
* The set {''x'': ''x'' is a [[prime number]] greater than 10} is a proper subset of {''x'': ''x'' is an odd number greater than 10}
* The set of [[natural number]]s is a proper subset of the set of [[rational number]]s; likewise, the set of points in a [[line segment]] is a proper subset of the set of points in a [[line (mathematics)|line]]. These are two examples in which both the subset and the whole set are infinite, and the subset has the same [[cardinality#Infinite sets|cardinality]] (the concept that corresponds to size, that is, the number of elements, of a finite set) as the whole; such cases can run counter to one's initial intuition.
* The set of rational numbers is a proper subset of the set of [[real number]]s. In this example, both sets are infinite but the latter set has a larger cardinality (or ''power'') than the former set.

Another example in an [[Euler diagram]]:

&lt;gallery widths="270"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Other properties of inclusion ==
[[File:Subset with expansion.svg|thumb|A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C imply A ⊆ C]]
Inclusion is the canonical [[partial order]] in the sense that every partially ordered set (''X'', &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is [[isomorphic]] to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The [[ordinal number]]s are a simple example—if each ordinal ''n'' is identified with the set [''n''] of all ordinals less than or equal to ''n'', then ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if [''a''] ⊆ [''b''].

For the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; of a set ''S'', the inclusion partial order is (up to an [[order isomorphism]]) the [[Cartesian product]] of ''k'' = |''S''| (the [[cardinality]] of ''S'') copies of the partial order on {0,1} for which 0 &amp;lt; 1. This can be illustrated by enumerating ''S'' = {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} and associating with each subset ''T'' ⊆ ''S'' (which is to say with each element of 2&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;) the ''k''-tuple from {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of which the ''i''th coordinate is 1 if and only if ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a member of ''T''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8082">'''"The Centipede's Dilemma"''' is a short poem that has lent its name to a psychological effect called the '''centipede effect''' or '''centipede syndrome'''. The centipede effect occurs when a normally automatic or unconscious activity is disrupted by consciousness of it or reflection on it. For example, a golfer thinking too closely about her swing or someone thinking too much about how he knots his tie may find his performance of the task impaired. The effect is also known as '''hyper-reflection''' or '''Humphrey's law'''&lt;ref name=colman&gt;{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=A Dictionary of Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-953406-7|pages=120|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the English psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] (1889–1966), who propounded it in 1923. As he wrote of the poem, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us". The effect is the reverse of a [[solvitur ambulando]].

==The poem==
The poem, a short rhyme, is usually attributed to Katherine Craster (1841–1874)&lt;ref name="colman"/&gt; in ''Pinafore Poems'', 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Connolly|first=Kevin|title=Psychologically Speaking: A Book of Quotations|year=1999|publisher=BPS Books|location=Leicester|isbn=978-1-85433-302-5|page=220|author2=Martlew, Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1881 it had begun appearing in journals such as ''The Spectator''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Spectator|volume=54|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Living Age''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Littell|first1=Eliakim|last2=Littell|first2=Robert S.|work=The Living Age|volume=150|publisher=The Living Age Co. Inc.|year=1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem later appeared in an article by British zoologist [[Ray Lankester|E.&amp;nbsp;Ray Lankester]], published in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on May 23, 1889,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lankester|first=E.&amp;nbsp;Ray|title=Muybridge Photographs|journal=Nature|date=23 May 1889|pages=78–80|url=https://archive.org/stream/naturejournal40londuoft/naturejournal40londuoft_djvu.txt | volume=40|doi=10.1038/040078b0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which discussed the work of the photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] in capturing the motion of animals: "For my own part," wrote Lankester, "I should greatly like to apply Mr. Muybridge's cameras, or a similar set of batteries, to the investigation of a phenomenon more puzzling even than that of 'the galloping horse'. I allude to the problem of 'the running centipede{{' "}}. Lankester finished the article on a fanciful note by imagining the "disastrous results in the way of perplexity" that could result from such an investigation, quoting the poem and mentioning that the author was unknown to him or to the friend who sent it to him. It has since been variously attributed to specific authors but without convincing evidence, and often appears under the title "The Centipede's Dilemma".

The version in the article is as follows:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg moves after which?"
:This raised her doubts to such a pitch,
:She fell exhausted in the ditch
:Not knowing how to run.

Another version of the Centipede's Dilemma:

:A centipede was happy – quite!
:Until a toad in fun
:Said, "Pray, which leg comes after which?"
:Which threw her mind in such a pitch,
:She laid bewildered in the ditch
:Considering how to run.

Modern versions of the poem often recast it in verse as a fable of a spider (or other protagonist) who found a clever way to avoid being eaten.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Another rhyme goes:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

:A spider met a centipede while hurrying down the street,
:"How do you move at such a speed, with all so many feet?"
:"I do not have to contemplate to keep them all in line,
:But if I start to concentrate they're tangled all the time!"

==In psychology and philosophy==
The psychologist [[George Humphrey (psychologist)|George Humphrey]] referred to the tale in his 1923 book ''The Story of Man's Mind'':&lt;ref name=humphrey&gt;{{cite book|last=Humphrey|first=George|title=The Story of Man's Mind|year=1923|publisher=Small, Maynard and company|location=Boston|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No man skilled at a trade needs to put his constant attention on the routine work", he wrote. "If he does, the job is apt to be spoiled". He went on to recount the centipede's story, commenting, "This is a most psychological rhyme. It contains a profound truth which is illustrated daily in the lives of all of us, for exactly the same thing happens if we pay conscious attention to any well-formed habit, such as walking". Thus, the eponymous "Humphrey's law" states that once performance of a task has become automatized, conscious thought about the task, while performing it, impairs performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roeckelein|first=Jon&amp;nbsp;E.|title=Dictionary of Theories, Laws, and Concepts in Psychology|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=978-0-313-30460-6|page=447|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas habit diminishes and then eliminates the attention required for routine tasks, this [[automaticity]] is disrupted by attention to a normally [[unconscious competence]].

The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] referred to the centipede effect in his book ''Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction'':&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl R.|editor-last=Notturno|editor-first=M.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=Knowledge and the Body-Mind Problem: In Defence of Interaction|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcjnmyRhQwsC&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;ots=tLMilPiJvv&amp;dq=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q=%22centipede%20effect%22&amp;f=false|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-11504-9|pages=116|edition=1st. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "if we have learnt certain movements so that they have sunk below the level of conscious control, then if we try to follow them consciously we very often interfere with them so badly that we stop them". He gives the example of the violinist [[Adolf Busch]] who was asked by fellow-violinist [[Bronisław Huberman]] how he played a certain passage of [[Violin Concerto (Beethoven)|Beethoven's violin concerto]]. Busch told Huberman that it was quite simple—and then found that he could no longer play the passage.

The psychiatric psychoanalyst [[Theo L. Dorpat]] compares questions and interventions irrelevant to the patient's current thought process during [[psychotherapy]] in his book ''Gaslighting'' to "the story of the centipede who became disorganized and unable to walk after he was asked, 'What's wrong with your 34th left foot?'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dorpat|first=Theo&amp;nbsp;L.|title=Gaslighting, the Double-Whammy, Interrogation and Other Methods of Convert Control in Psychotherapy &amp; Analysis|year=1996|publisher=Aronson|location=Northvale, New Jersey|isbn=978-1-568-21828-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'' magazine printed an adaptation of the story by the Austrian author [[Gustav Meyrink]], "The Curse of The Toad" (''Der Fluch der Kröte''). The fable was also published in Meyrink's 1903 collection of tales, ''The Hot Soldier and Other Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Zipes|editor-first=Jack|title=The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860115-9|page=318|edition=1st published.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spider Robinson]]'s short story "The Centipede's Dilemma" concerns a psychic who uses instinctive telekinetic powers to cheat at darts, and is foiled when another character triggers hyper-reflection in him.

[[File:Coa_Illustration_Cross_Triquetra.svg|right|thumb|Interlaced triquetra which is a [[trefoil knot]]]]
'''Triquetra''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|aɪ|ˈ|k|w|ɛ|t|r|ə}}; from the Latin adjective ''triquetrus'', three-cornered) denotes a particular complicated shape formed of three ''[[Vesica piscis|vesicae piscis]]'' (the leaf-like shape in between two equal diameter circles each centered on the circumference of the other), sometimes with an added circle in or around the three lobes. Also known as a "trinity knot" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to Odin's symbol, the [[valknut]].

==Ancient usage==

===Celtic art===
The triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Stephen (2001). "[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]", ''Dalriada Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese use===
The triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Germanic paganism===
The triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Odin]].

===Christian use===
The symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. 
It has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.

A very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of three forces. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.

==Modern use==
In contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a "trinity knot", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Seán (1999). ''Story of the Claddagh Ring''. Mercier Press. {{ISBN|9781856351898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page missing|date=October 2018}}

===Neopaganism===
It is difficult to date the exact origin of the Irish triquetra, and whether it was first used in a Christian or [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] context; the distinctive interlace/knotwork artistic style did not fully develop until ca. the 7th century AD, but the triquetra is the [[trefoil knot|simplest possible knot]]. [[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.

Due to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),&lt;ref name="Mac Mathúna"&gt;Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf "Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].

[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.

The symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.&lt;ref name="scott-cunningham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
&lt;!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject. Other additions will be deleted as spam. --&gt;

The triquetra is often used artistically as a design element when [[Celtic knotwork]] is used. Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].
