In [[computer science]], the '''abstract syntax''' of data is its structure described as a [[data type]] (possibly, but not necessarily, an [[abstract data type]]), independent of any particular representation or encoding. This is particularly used in the representation of text in [[computer language]]s, which are generally stored in a tree structure as an [[abstract syntax tree]]. Abstract syntax, which only consists of the structure of data, is contrasted with [[concrete syntax]], which also includes information about the representation. For example, concrete syntax includes features like parentheses (for grouping) or commas (for lists) which are not included in the abstract syntax, as they are implicit in the structure.

Abstract syntaxes are classified as '''first-order abstract syntax''' (FOAS), if the structure is abstract but names (identifiers) are still concrete (and thus requires [[Name resolution (programming languages)|name resolution]]), and ''[[higher-order abstract syntax]],'' if the names themselves are abstract.

==Uses==
To be implemented either for computation or communications, a mapping from the abstract syntax to specific machine representations and encodings must be defined; these may be called the "[[concrete syntax]]" (in language implementation) or the "transfer syntax" (in communications).

A [[compiler]]'s internal representation of a program will typically be specified by an abstract syntax in terms of categories such as "statement", "expression" and "identifier". This is independent of the source syntax ('''concrete syntax''') of the language being compiled (though it will often be very similar). A [[parse tree]] is similar to an [[abstract syntax tree]] but it will typically also contain features such as parentheses which are syntactically significant but which are implicit in the structure of the abstract syntax tree.

[[Algebraic data type]]s are particularly well-suited to the implementation of abstract syntax.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2413">The '''Affleck–Dine mechanism''' ('''AD mechanism''') is a postulated mechanism for explaining [[baryogenesis]] during the primordial Universe immediately following the [[Big Bang]]. Thus, the AD mechanism may explain the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the current Universe. It was proposed in 1985 by [[Ian Affleck]] and [[Michael Dine]] of Princeton University.&lt;ref name=npbppB249_2_361/&gt;

In the [[supersymmetry]] theory of [[particle physics]], ordinary [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s have scalar partners that carry [[Baryon number|baryon]] and [[lepton number]]s. As the latter decay into [[fermion]]s during the early Universe, the net baryon number that they carry can then form the currently observed excess of ordinary baryons. This occurs due to interactions of the scalars with the [[inflaton]] field, resulting in [[CP violation]]s.&lt;ref name=muelmenstaedt2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

The AD mechanism must have occurred during or after the reheating event that followed [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]]. This may explain why the net mass of normal matter and [[dark matter]] are apparently so close to each other, rather than being widely different.&lt;ref name=rmp76_1_1/&gt;

'''Audio noise measurement''' is carried out to assess the quality of [[audio equipment]], such as is used in [[recording studio]]s, [[broadcast engineering]], and in-home [[high fidelity]].

In general, [[noise]] refers to unwanted [[sound]], but in audio systems it is the low-level hiss or buzz that intrudes on quiet passages that is of most interest. All recordings will contain some background noise that was picked up by microphones, such as the rumble of air conditioning, or the shuffling of an audience, but in addition to this, every piece of equipment which the recorded signal subsequently passes through will add a certain amount of electronic noise, which ideally should be so low as possible to contribute insignificantly to what is heard.

== Origins of noise - the need for Weighting ==
[[Microphones]], amplifiers and recording systems all add some [[electronic noise]] to the signals passing through them, generally described as hum, buzz or hiss. All buildings have low-level magnetic and electrostatic fields in and around them emanating from [[mains supply]] wiring, and these can induce hum into signal paths, typically 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz (depending on the country's electrical supply standard) and lower harmonics. Shielded cables help to prevent this, and on professional equipment where longer interconnections are common, balanced signal connections (most often with [[XLR connector|XLR]] or [[Phone connector (audio)|phone connectors]]) are usually employed. Hiss is the result of random signals, often arising from the random motion of electrons in transistors and other electronic components, or the random distribution of oxide particles on analog magnetic tape. It is predominantly heard at high frequencies, sounding like steam or compressed air.

Attempts to measure noise in audio equipment as RMS voltage, using a simple level meter or voltmeter, do not produce useful results; a special noise-measuring instrument is required. This is because noise contains energy spread over a wide range of frequencies and levels, and different sources of noise have different spectral content. For measurements to allow fair comparison of different systems they must be made using a measuring instrument that responds in a way that corresponds to how we hear sounds. From this, three requirements follow. Firstly, it is important that frequencies above or below those that can be heard by even the best ears are filtered out and ignored by bandwidth limiting (usually 22&amp;nbsp;Hz to 22&amp;nbsp;kHz). Secondly, the measuring instrument should give varying emphasis to different frequency components of the noise in the same way that our ears do, a process referred to as ‘weighting’. Thirdly, the rectifier or detector that is used to convert the varying alternating noise signal into a steady positive representation of level should take time to respond fully to brief peaks to the same extent that our ears do; it should have the correct ‘dynamics’.

The proper measurement of noise therefore requires the use of a specified method, with defined measurement bandwidth and weighting curve, and rectifier dynamics. The two main methods defined by current standards are '''A-weighting''' and '''ITU-R 468'''(formerly known as '''CCIR weighting''').

== A-weighting ==

[[A-weighting]] uses a weighting curve based on ‘[[equal-loudness contours]]’ that describe our hearing sensitivity to pure tones, but it turns out that the assumption that such contours would be valid for noise components was wrong.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} While the A-weighting curve peaks by about 2dB around 2&amp;nbsp;kHz, it turns out that our sensitivity to noise peaks by some 12dB at 6&amp;nbsp;kHz.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Another weakness of A-weighting is that it is usually combined with an rms (root mean square) rectifier, which measures mean power, with no attempt made to account for proper hearing dynamics.{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}

== ITU-R 468 weighting ==
[[Image:Lindos3.svg|400px|right]]

When measurements started to be used in reviews of consumer equipment in the late 1960s it became apparent that they did not always correlate with what was heard. In particular, the introduction of Dolby B noise-reduction on cassette recorders was found to make them sound a full 10dB less noisy, yet they did not measure 10dB better. Various new methods were then devised, including one which used a harsher weighting filter and a quasi-peak rectifier, defined as part of the German DIN45 500 ‘Hi Fi’ standard. This standard, no longer in use, attempted to lay down minimum performance requirements in all areas for ‘High Fidelity’ reproduction.

The introduction of [[FM radio]], which also generates predominantly high-frequency hiss, also showed up the unsatisfactory nature of A-weighting, and the [[BBC Research Department]] undertook a research project to determine which of several weighting filter and rectifier characteristics gave results that were most in line with the judgment of panel of listeners, using a wide variety of different types of noise. BBC Research Department Report EL-17 formed the basis of what became known as CCIR recommendation 468, which specified both a new weighting curve and a [[quasi-peak]] rectifier. This became the standard of choice for broadcasters worldwide, and it was also adopted by [[Dolby]], for measurements on its noise-reduction systems which were rapidly becoming the standard in cinema sound, as well as in recording studios and the home.

Though they represent what we truly hear, [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] gives figures that are typically some 11dB worse than A-weighted, a fact that brought resistance from marketing departments{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}{{Dubious|date=April 2010}} reluctant to put worse specifications on their equipment than the public had been used to. Dolby tried to get round this by introducing a version of their own called CCIR-Dolby which incorporated a 6dB shift into the result (and a cheaper average reading rectifier), but this only confused matters, and was very much disapproved of by the CCIR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the demise of the CCIR, the 468 standard is now maintained as [[Standard:ITU-R 468|ITU-R 468]], by the International Telecommunications Union, and forms part of many national and international standards, in particular by the IEC (International Electrotechnical commission), and the BSI (British Standards Institute). It is the only way to measure noise, that allows fair comparisons; and yet the flawed A-weighting has made a comeback in the consumer field recently, for the simple reason that it gives the lower figures that are considered more impressive by marketing departments.{{POV-statement|date=April 2010}}{{Dubious|date=April 2010}}

== Signal to noise ratio and Dynamic range ==

Audio equipment specifications tend to include the terms ‘[[signal to noise ratio]]’ and ‘[[dynamic range]]’, both of which have multiple definitions, sometimes treated as synonyms.  The exact meaning must be specified along with the measurement.

=== Analog ===

Dynamic range used to mean{{Specify|date=May 2010}} the difference between maximum level and noise level, with maximum level defined as a clipping signal with a specified THD+N.  The term has become corrupted by a tendency{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} to refer to the dynamic range of CD players as meaning the noise level on a blank recording with no dither, (in other words, just the analog noise content at the output). This is not particularly useful; especially since many CD players incorporate automatic muting in the absence of signal.

Since the early 1990s various writers such as Julian Dunn have suggested that dynamic range be measured in the presence of a low-level test signal. Thus, any spurious signals caused by the test signal or distortion will not degrade the signal-to-noise ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5330A-31A_F5.pdf |title=8-Pin, Stereo A/D Converter for Digital Audio |publisher=[[Cirrus Logic]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119140453/http://www.cirrus.com/en/pubs/proDatasheet/CS5330A-31A_F5.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-19}} "Dynamic range is a signal-to-noise measurement over the specified bandwidth made with a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is then added to the resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full scale. This technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the measurement."&lt;/ref&gt; This also addresses concerns about muting circuits.

=== Digital ===

In 1999, Dr. Steven Harris &amp; Clif Sanchez Cirrus Logic published a white paper titled "Personal Computer Audio Quality Measurements" stating:

{{quote|Dynamic Range is the ratio of the full scale signal level to the RMS noise floor{{definition|what is the RMS noise floor in a digital signal?|date=November 2010}}, in the presence of signal, expressed in dB FS. This specification is given as an absolute number and is sometimes referred to as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in the presence of a signal. The label SNR should not be used due to industry confusion over the exact definition. DR can be measured using the THD+N measurement with a -60 dB FS signal. This low amplitude is small enough to minimize any large signal non-linearity, but large enough to ensure that the system under test is being exercised. Other test signal amplitudes may be used, provided that the signal level is such that no distortion components are generated.}}

In 2000 the AES released AES Information Document 6id-2000 which defined dynamic range as "20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the full-scale signal to the r.m.s. noise floor in the presence of signal, expressed in dB FS" with the following note:

{{quote|This specification is sometimes referred to as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the presence of a signal. The label SNR should not be used due to industry confusion over the exact definition. SNR is often used to indicate signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise level being measured with no signal. This can often give an optimistic result because of muting circuits, which mute the noise when no signal is present.}}

'''Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)''' is an autonomous organization under the [[Ministry of agriculture]], that conducts research on all crops except rice, [[jute]], sugarcane, and tea for which there are separate institutes. The central research station of the institute is at [[Joydebpur]] about {{convert|35|km}} north of [[Dhaka]].

The research compound of the central station is spread over 176 hectares of land of which 126 hectares are experiment fields. The institute has established six regional research stations in six regions of Bangladesh to develop new technologies. These research stations are located at Ishurdi, [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]], [[Jessore]], [[Hathazari]], Rahmatpur, and [[Akbarpur, Ramabai Nagar|Akbarpur]]. It also has 28 research stations including three hill research stations ([[Khagrachari]], [[Ramgarh Upazila|Ramgarh]] and Raikhali). Besides these, ''BARI'' has seven crop research centers, four of which are at the central research station at Joydebpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bari.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=58|title=Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) |work=Bangladesh National Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biantitropical''' (or '''amphitropical''') '''distribution''' refers to the pattern of [[species]] that exist at comparable [[latitude]]s across the [[equator]] but not in the [[tropics]].  For example, a species may be found north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], but not in between.  This usually has to do with the optimal temperature for the species existing at both latitudes.  How the life forms distribute themselves to the opposite hemisphere when they can't normally survive in the middle depends on the species; plants may have their seed spread through wind, animal, or other methods ([[Seed dispersal|dispersal]]) and then germinate upon reaching the appropriate climate, while sea life may be able to travel through the tropical regions in a larval state or by going through deep ocean currents with much colder temperatures than on the surface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''Campaign plan''' is a plan to achieve an objective, usually of a large-scale over an extended period of time.  It usually coordinates many activities and uses of resources involving multiple organizations.  A campaign plan could also have subordinate objectives or intermediate milestones and is often broken down by phases.  They often begin with an assessment of the situation to put the plan in context.  Campaign plans are often created in [[business marketing]], [[Political campaign|political campaigning]] and [[Military campaign|military campaigning]]. 

==Examples==
An example of a military campaign plan is [[Noble Resolve]].

==Official definitions==
The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines campaign plan as:

[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|300px|right|thumb|Geocentric celestial spheres; [[Petrus Apianus|Peter Apian's]] ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539)]]

The '''celestial spheres''', or '''celestial orbs''', were the fundamental entities of the [[cosmology|cosmological]] models developed by [[Plato]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Copernicus]], and others. In these celestial models, the [[diurnal motion|apparent motions]] of the [[fixed stars]] and [[classical planet|planets]] are accounted for by treating them as embedded in rotating spheres made of an aetherial, transparent fifth element ([[aether (classical element)|quintessence]]), like jewels set in orbs.  Since it was believed that the fixed stars did not change their positions relative to one another, it was argued that they must be on the surface of a single starry sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern thought, the [[Orbit#Planetary orbits|orbits of the planets]] are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly empty space. Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, considered the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; When scholars applied Ptolemy's [[epicycles]], they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="Lindberg, p. 251"/&gt; By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at the time for the distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and to the edge of the universe (about 73 million miles).&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 28–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 437–8.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[size of the universe]] is now known to be inconceivably large and continuously [[Metric expansion of space|expanding]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Van Helden has suggested that from about 1250 until the 17th century, virtually all educated Europeans were familiar with the Ptolemaic model of "nesting spheres and the cosmic dimensions derived from it".&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even following the adoption of Copernicus's heliocentric model of the universe, new versions of the celestial sphere model were introduced, with the planetary spheres following this sequence from the central Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth-Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Mainstream belief in the theory of celestial spheres did not survive the [[Scientific Revolution]].  In the early 1600s, Kepler continued to discuss celestial spheres, although he did not consider that the planets were carried by the spheres but held that they moved in elliptical paths described by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].  In the late 1600s, Greek and medieval theories concerning the motion of terrestrial and celestial objects were replaced by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] and [[Newtonian mechanics]], which explain how Kepler's laws arise from the gravitational attraction between bodies.

==History==
{{details|topic=the causes of the motions of the celestial spheres|Dynamics of the celestial spheres}}

===Early ideas of spheres and circles===

In [[Ancient Greece|Greek antiquity]] the ideas of celestial spheres and rings first appeared in the cosmology of [[Anaximander]] in the early 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 4 of Heath's ''Aristarchus of Samos'' 1913/97 Oxford University Press/Sandpiper Books Ltd; see p.11 of Popper's ''The World of Parmenides'' Routledge 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In his cosmology both the Sun and Moon are circular open vents in tubular rings of fire enclosed in tubes of condensed air; these rings constitute the rims of rotating chariot-like wheels pivoting on the Earth at their centre. The fixed stars are also open vents in such wheel rims, but there are so many such wheels for the stars that their contiguous rims all together form a continuous spherical shell encompassing the Earth. All these wheel rims had originally been formed out of an original [[sphere of fire]] wholly encompassing the Earth, which had disintegrated into many individual rings.&lt;ref&gt;Heath  ''ibid'' pp26–8&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in Anaximanders's cosmogony, in the beginning was the sphere, out of which celestial rings were formed, from some of which the stellar sphere was in turn composed. As viewed from the Earth, the ring of the Sun was highest, that of the Moon was lower, and the sphere of the stars was lowest.

Following Anaximander, his pupil [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (c. 585–528/4) held that the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire. But whilst the stars are fastened on a revolving crystal sphere like nails or studs, the Sun, Moon, and planets, and also the Earth, all just ride on air like leaves because of their breadth.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter 5 of Heath’s 1913 ''Aristarchus of Samos''&lt;/ref&gt;  And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere, the Sun, Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do, but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again. And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth. The most enduring feature of Anaximenes' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame, which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler.

After Anaximenes, [[Pythagoras]], [[Xenophanes]] and [[Parmenides]] all held that the universe was spherical.&lt;ref&gt;For Xenophanes' and Parmenides' spherist cosmologies see Heath ''ibid'' chapter 7 and chapter 9 respectively, and Popper ''ibid'' Essays 2 &amp; 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And much later in the fourth century BC Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' proposed that the body of the cosmos was made in the most perfect and uniform shape, that of a sphere containing the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Cornford, ''Plato's Cosmology: The Timaeus of Plato'', pp. 54–7&lt;/ref&gt;  But it posited that the planets were spherical bodies set in rotating bands or rings rather than wheel rims as in Anaximander's cosmology.

===Emergence of the planetary spheres===

Instead of bands, Plato's student Eudoxus developed a [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Eudoxan planetary models|planetary model]] using [[concentric spheres]] for all the planets, with three spheres each for his models of the Moon and the Sun and four each for the models of the other five planets, thus making 26 spheres in all.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy, vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"&gt;Lloyd, "Heavenly aberrations," p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Callippus]] modified this system, using five spheres for his models of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars and retaining four spheres for the models of Jupiter and Saturn, thus making 33 spheres in all.&lt;ref name="Lloyd p. 173"/&gt;  Each planet is attached to the innermost of its own particular set of spheres.  Although the models of Eudoxus and Callippus qualitatively describe the major features of the motion of the planets, they fail to account exactly for these motions and therefore cannot provide quantitative predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,'' vol. 2, pp. 677–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Although historians of Greek science have traditionally considered these models to be merely geometrical representations,&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, ''History of the Planetary Systems'', pp. 90–1, 121–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, ''Aristotle,'' p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; recent studies have proposed that they were also intended to be physically real&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wright, "The Astronomy of Eudoxus: Geometry or Physics," ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'', 4 (1973): 165–72.&lt;/ref&gt; or have withheld judgment, noting the limited evidence to resolve the question.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. R. Lloyd, "Saving the Phenomena," ''Classical Quarterly,'' 28 (1978): 202–222, at p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', [[Aristotle]] developed a physical cosmology of spheres, based on the mathematical models of Eudoxus.  In Aristotle's fully developed celestial model, the spherical Earth is at the centre of the universe and the planets are moved by either 47 or 55 interconnected spheres that form a unified planetary system,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' 1073b1–1074a13, pp. 882–883 in ''The Basic Works of Aristotle'' Richard McKeon, ed., The Modern Library 2001&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in the models of Eudoxus and Callippus each planet's individual set of spheres were not connected to those of the next planet.  Aristotle says the exact number of spheres, and hence the number of movers, is to be determined by astronomical investigation, but he added additional spheres to those proposed by Eudoxus and Callippus, to counteract the motion of the outer spheres.  Aristotle considers that these spheres are made of an unchanging fifth element, the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. Each of these concentric spheres is moved by its own god—an unchanging [[Unmoved mover|divine unmoved mover]], and who moves its sphere simply by virtue of being loved by it.&lt;ref&gt;"The final cause, then, produces motion by being loved, but all other things move by being moved" Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1072b4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|225px|right|thumb|Ptolemaic model of the spheres for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn with [[epicycle]], eccentric [[deferent]] and [[equant]] point.  [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum'', 1474.]]

In his ''[[Almagest]]'', the astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (fl. ca. 150 AD) developed geometrical predictive models of the motions of the stars and planets and extended them to a unified physical model of the [[cosmos]] in his ''Planetary hypotheses''.&lt;ref&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy,''  pp. 111–12, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, ''[[#Pederson-1993|Early Physics and Astronomy]]'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=z7M8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowe, ''[[#Reference-Crowe-1990|Theories of the World]]'', pp.45, 49–50, 72,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linton, ''[[#Reference-Linton-2004|From Eudoxus to Einstein]]'', pp.63–64, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  By using eccentrics and [[epicycles]], his geometrical model achieved greater mathematical detail and predictive accuracy than had been exhibited by earlier concentric spherical models of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Catesby Taliaferro|Taliaferro]], ''[[#taliaferro-1946|Translator's Introduction to the Almagest]]'', p,1; Dreyer, ''[[#dreyer-2007|History of the Planetary Systems]]'', [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/160/mode/1up/ pp.160], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/167/mode/1up/ 167].&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ptolemy's physical model, each planet is contained in two or more spheres,&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"&gt;Neugebauer, ''History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'', vol. 2, pp. 917–926.&lt;/ref&gt; but in Book 2 of his ''Planetary Hypotheses'' Ptolemy depicted thick circular slices rather than spheres as in its Book 1.  One sphere/slice is the [[deferent]], with a centre offset somewhat from the Earth; the other sphere/slice is an [[epicycle]] embedded in the deferent, with the planet embedded in the epicyclical sphere/slice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Murschel, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995JHA....26...33M "The Structure and Function of Ptolemy's Physical Hypotheses of Planetary Motion,"] ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 26(1995): 33–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ptolemy's model of nesting spheres provided the general dimensions of the cosmos, the greatest distance of Saturn being 19,865 times the radius of the Earth and the distance of the fixed stars being at least 20,000 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Neugebauer, pp. 917"/&gt;

The planetary spheres were arranged outwards from the spherical, stationary Earth at the centre of the universe in this order: the spheres of the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Sun]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]].  In more detailed models the seven planetary spheres contained other secondary spheres within them.  The planetary spheres were followed by the stellar sphere containing the fixed stars; other scholars added a ninth sphere to account for the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of the equinoxes]], a tenth to account for the supposed [[Trepidation (astronomy)|trepidation of the equinoxes]], and even an eleventh to account for the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis  R. Johnson, "Marlowe's "Imperiall Heaven," ''ELH'', 12 (1945): 35–44, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  In antiquity the order of the lower planets was not universally agreed. Plato and his followers ordered them Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, and then followed the standard model for the upper spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce S. Eastwood, ''Ordering the Heavens: Roman Astronomy and Cosmology in the Carolingian Renaissance,'' (Leiden: Brill) 2007, pp. 36–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his ''De Revolutionibus'' Bk1.10 Copernicus claimed the empirical reason why Plato's followers put the orbits of Mercury and Venus above the Sun's was that if they were sub-solar, then by the Sun's reflected light they would only ever appear as hemispheres at most and would also sometimes eclipse the Sun, but they do neither. (See p521 ''Great Books of the Western World 16 Ptolemy–Copernicus–Kepler'')&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagreed about the relative place of the spheres of Mercury and Venus: Ptolemy placed both of them beneath the Sun with Venus above Mercury, but noted others placed them both above the Sun; some medieval thinkers, such as [[al-Bitruji]], placed the sphere of Venus above the Sun and that of Mercury below it.&lt;ref&gt;al-Biţrūjī. (1971) ''On the Principles of Astronomy'', 7.159–65, trans. Bernard R. Goldstein, vol. 1, pp. 123–5.  New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr.  {{ISBN|0-300-01387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

====Astronomical discussions====
[[File:Mappa Mundi 2 from Bede, De natura rerum.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Earth within seven celestial spheres, from [[Bede]], ''De natura rerum'', late 11th century]]
A series of astronomers, beginning with the Muslim astronomer [[Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī|al-Farghānī]], used the Ptolemaic model of nesting spheres to compute distances to the stars and planetary spheres.  Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars was 20,110 Earth radii which, on the assumption that the radius of the Earth was 3,250 miles, came to 65,357,500 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  An introduction to Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', the ''Tashil al-Majisti'', believed to be written by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]], presented minor variations of Ptolemy's distances to the celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Zij]]'', [[Muḥammad ibn Jābir al-Ḥarrānī al-Battānī|Al-Battānī]] presented independent calculations of the distances to the planets on the model of nesting spheres, which he thought was due to scholars writing after Ptolemy.  His calculations yielded a distance of 19,000 Earth radii to the stars.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the turn of the millennium, the [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomer]] and polymath [[Ibn al-Haytham#Astronomy|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses'', al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it has been argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Tzvi Langermann (1990), ''Ibn al Haytham's On the Configuration of the World'', p. 11–25, New York: Garland Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In chapters 15–16 of his ''[[Book of Optics]]'', Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of [[solid]] matter.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Rosen (1985), "The Dissolution of the Solid Celestial Spheres", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''46''' (1), p. 13–31 [19–20, 21].&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the twelfth century, the [[Al-Andalus|Spanish Muslim]] astronomer [[Nur Ed-Din Al Betrugi|al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius)]] sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model,&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein, ''Al-Bitrūjī: On the Principles of Astronomy,'' New Haven: Yale Univ. Pr., 1971, vol. 1, pp. 40–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 563–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thirteenth century the astronomer, [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi|al-'Urḍi]], proposed a radical change to Ptolemy's system of nesting spheres.  In his ''Kitāb al-Hayáh'', he recalculated the distance of the planets using parameters which he redetermined.  Taking the distance of the Sun as 1,266 Earth radii, he was forced to place the sphere of Venus above the sphere of the Sun; as a further refinement, he added the planet's diameters to the thickness of their spheres.  As a consequence, his version of the nesting spheres model had the sphere of the stars at a distance of 140,177 Earth radii.&lt;ref name="Van Helden pp. 31-2"/&gt;

About the same time, scholars in European [[medieval universities|universities]] began to address the implications of the rediscovered philosophy of Aristotle and astronomy of Ptolemy.  Both astronomical scholars and popular writers considered the implications of the nested sphere model for the dimensions of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 433–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Campanus of Novara]]'s introductory astronomical text, the ''Theorica planetarum'', used the model of nesting spheres to compute the distances of the various planets from the Earth, which he gave as 22,612 Earth radii or 73,387,747 100/660 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs'', pp. 434–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 33–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Opus Majus]]'', [[Roger Bacon]] cited Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars of 20,110 Earth radii, or 65,357,700 miles, from which he computed the circumference of the universe to be 410,818,517 3/7 miles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clear evidence that this model was thought to represent physical reality is the accounts found in Bacon's ''Opus Majus'' of the time needed to walk to the Moon&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the popular [[Middle English]] ''[[South English Legendary]]'', that it would take 8,000 years to reach the highest starry heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''The Discarded Image'', pp. 97–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; General understanding of the dimensions of the universe derived from the nested sphere model reached wider audiences through the presentations in Hebrew by [[Moses Maimonides]], in French by Gossuin of Metz, and in Italian by [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Helden, ''Measuring the Universe'', pp. 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philosophical and theological discussions====

Philosophers were less concerned with such mathematical calculations than with the nature of the celestial spheres, their relation to revealed accounts of created nature, and the causes of their motion.

Adi Setia describes the debate among Islamic scholars in the twelfth century, based on the commentary of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] about whether the celestial spheres are real, concrete physical bodies or "merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out… by the various stars and planets." Setia points out that most of the learned, and the astronomers, said they were solid spheres "on which the stars turn… and this view is closer to the apparent sense of the Qur'anic verses regarding the celestial orbits." However, al-Razi mentions that some, such as the Islamic scholar Dahhak, considered them to be abstract. Al-Razi himself, was undecided, he said: "In truth, there is no way to ascertain the characteristics of the heavens except by authority [of divine revelation or prophetic traditions]." Setia concludes: "Thus it seems that for al-Razi (and for others before and after him), astronomical models, whatever their utility or lack thereof for ordering the heavens, are not founded on sound rational proofs, and so no intellectual commitment can be made to them insofar as description and explanation of celestial realities are concerned."&lt;ref name=Setia&gt;{{citation|title=Fakhr Al-Din Al-Razi on Physics and the Nature of the Physical World: A Preliminary Survey|author=Adi Setia|journal=Islam &amp; Science|volume=2|year=2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0QYQ/is_2_2/ai_n9532826/|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian and Muslim philosophers modified Ptolemy's system to include an unmoved outermost region, the [[empyrean]] heaven, which came to be identified as the dwelling place of [[God]] and all the elect.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 382–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval Christians identified the sphere of stars with the Biblical [[firmament]] and sometimes posited an invisible layer of water above the firmament, to accord with [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; An outer sphere, inhabited by [[angels]], appeared in some accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, ''Beginnings of Western Science'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Grant]], a historian of science, has provided evidence that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid in the sense of three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 328–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the [[mutakallim]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281–1355) rejected the principle of uniform and circular motion, following the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[atomism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will rather than by natural causes.&lt;ref name=Huff-175&gt;{{Cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".&lt;ref name=Ragep&gt;pp.&amp;nbsp;55–57 of {{Cite journal| doi = 10.1086/649338| issn = 0369-7827| last = Ragep| first = F.

Medieval astronomers and philosophers developed diverse theories about the causes of the celestial spheres' motions. They attempted to explain the spheres' motions in terms of the materials of which they were thought to be made, external movers such as celestial intelligences, and internal movers such as motive souls or impressed forces. Most of these models were qualitative, although a few  incorporated quantitative analyses that related speed, motive force and resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 541.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the Middle Ages, the common opinion in Europe was that celestial bodies were moved by external intelligences, identified with the [[angel]]s of [[revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Primum Mobile|outermost moving sphere]], which moved with the daily motion affecting all subordinate spheres, was moved by an [[unmoved mover]], the [[Cosmological argument#History|Prime Mover]], who was identified with God. Each of the lower spheres was moved by a subordinate spiritual mover (a replacement for Aristotle's multiple divine movers), called an intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 526–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

[[Image:ThomasDiggesmap.JPG|225px|right|thumb|Thomas Digges' 1576 Copernican heliocentric model of the celestial orbs]]

Early in the sixteenth century [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] drastically reformed the model of astronomy by displacing the Earth from its central place in favour of the Sun, yet he called his great work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''). Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Jardine, "The Significance of the Copernican Orbs," ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 13(1982): 168–194, esp. pp. 177–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth and moved the Sun from its orb to the center of the world.  The planetary orbs circled the center of the world in the order Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  Finally he retained the eighth starry sphere, which he held to be unmoving.&lt;ref&gt;Hilderich von Varel ([[:de:Edo Hildericus|Edo Hildericus]]), ''Propositiones Cosmographicae de Globi Terreni Dimensione,'' (Frankfurt a. d. Oder, 1576), quoted in Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, "Realism and Instrumentalism in Sixteenth Century Astronomy: A Reappraisal, ''Perspectives on Science'' 6.3 (1998): 232–258, pp. 242–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English almanac maker, [[Thomas Digges]], delineated the spheres of the new cosmological system in his ''Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes…'' (1576).  Here he arranged the "orbes" in the new Copernican order, expanding one sphere to carry "the globe of mortalitye", the Earth, the [[Classical element#Classical elements in Greece|four elements]], and the Moon; and expanding the starry sphere infinitely upward to encompass all the stars, and also to serve as "the court of the Great God, the habitacle of the elect, and of the coelestiall angelles."&lt;ref&gt;Koyre, ''From the Closed World'', pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler Celestial Spheres.jpg|thumb|left|Johannes Kepler's diagram of the celestial spheres, and of the spaces between them, following the opinion of Copernicus (''Mysterium Cosmographicum'', 2nd ed., 1621)]]
In the course of the sixteenth century, a number of philosophers, theologians, and astronomers—among them [[Franciscus Patricius|Francesco Patrizi]], Andrea Cisalpino, [[Petrus Ramus|Peter Ramus]], [[Robert Bellarmine]], [[Giordano Bruno]], Jerónimo Muñoz, [[Michael Neander]], Jean Pena, and [[Christoph Rothmann]]—abandoned the concept of celestial spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 127–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothmann argued from the observations of the comet of 1585 that the lack of observed parallax indicated that the comet was beyond Saturn, while the absence of observed refraction indicated the celestial region was of the same material as air, hence there were no planetary spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard R. Goldstein and Peter Barker, "The Role of Rothmann in the Dissolution of the Celestial Spheres," ''The British Journal for the History of Science'', 28 (1995): 385–403, pp. 390–1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tycho Brahe]]'s investigations of a series of comets from 1577 to 1585, aided by Rothmann's discussion of the comet of 1585 and [[Michael Maestlin]]'s tabulated distances of the comet of 1577, which passed through the planetary orbs, led Tycho to conclude&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Granada, "Did Tycho Eliminate the Celestial Spheres before 1586?" ''Journal for the History of Astronomy,'' 37 (2006): 126–145, pp. 132–8.&lt;/ref&gt; that "the structure of the heavens was very fluid and simple." Tycho opposed his view to that of "very many modern philosophers" who divided the heavens into "various orbs made of hard and impervious matter." Edward Grant found relatively few believers in hard celestial spheres before Copernicus, and concluded that the idea first became common sometime between the publication of Copernicus's ''De revolutionibus'' in 1542 and Tycho Brahe's publication of his cometary research in 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, "Celestial Orbs," 2000, pp. 185–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Planets, Stars, and Orbs,'' pp. 345–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Johannes Kepler]]'s early ''Mysterium cosmographicum'', he considered the distances of the planets, and the consequent gaps required between the planetary spheres implied by the Copernican system, which had been noted by his former teacher, Michael Maestlin.&lt;ref&gt;Grasshoff, "Michael Maestlin's Mystery".&lt;/ref&gt;  Kepler's Platonic cosmology filled the large gaps with the five Platonic polyhedra, which accounted for the spheres' measured astronomical distance.&lt;ref&gt;See Judith Field, ''Kepler's geometric cosmology'' for details of Kepler's cosmology&lt;/ref&gt;  In his mature celestial physics, the spheres were regarded as the purely geometrical spatial regions containing each planetary orbit rather than as the rotating physical orbs of the earlier Aristotelian celestial physics. The eccentricity of each planet's orbit thereby defined the lengths of the radii of the inner and outer limits of its celestial sphere and thus its thickness. In Kepler's [[Celestial mechanics#Johannes Kepler|celestial mechanics]] the cause of planetary motion became the rotating Sun, itself rotated by its own motive soul.&lt;ref&gt;See p514–5 of Kepler's 1630 ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' Vol.1 Bk4.2.3 for his arguments that the Sun has a driving soul on p896 of the Encyclopædia Britannica edition&lt;/ref&gt; However, an immobile stellar sphere was a lasting remnant of physical celestial spheres in Kepler's cosmology.

In [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]],'' the elder [[Scipio Africanus]] describes an ascent through the celestial spheres, compared to which the Earth and the Roman Empire dwindle into insignificance. A commentary on the ''Dream of Scipio'' by the Roman writer [[Macrobius]], which included a discussion of the various schools of thought on the order of the spheres, did much to spread the idea of the celestial spheres through the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio,'' transl. by William Harris Stahl, New York: Columbia Univ. Pr., 1952; on the order of the spheres see pp. 162–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|right|thumb|Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde,'' Paris, BnF, Manuscrits, Fr. 565, f. 69, (1377)]]
Some late medieval figures noted that the celestial spheres' physical order was inverse to their order on the spiritual plane, where God was at the center and the Earth at the periphery. Near the beginning of the fourteenth century [[Dante]], in the ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' of his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', described God as a light at the center of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature,'' Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1964, p. 116. {{ISBN|0-521-09450-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the poet ascends beyond physical existence to the [[Empyrean]] Heaven, where he comes face to face with God himself and is granted understanding of both divine and human nature. Later in the century, the illuminator of [[Nicole Oresme]]'s ''Le livre du Ciel et du Monde'', a translation of and commentary on Aristotle's [[On the Heavens|''De caelo'']] produced for Oresme's patron, [[Charles V of France|King Charles V]], employed the same motif. He drew the spheres in the conventional order, with the Moon closest to the Earth and the stars highest, but the spheres were concave upwards, centered on God, rather than concave downwards, centered on the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Oreseme, "Le livre du Ciel et du Monde", 1377, retrieved 2 June 2007.[http://expositions.bnf.fr/ciel/grand/1-025.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Below this figure Oresme quotes the [[Psalms]] that "The heavens declare the Glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork."&lt;ref&gt;Ps. 18: 2; quoted in Nicole Oresme, ''Le livre du ciel et du monde,'' edited and translated by A, D. Menut and A. J. Denomy, Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1968, pp. 282–3.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

The late-16th-century Portuguese epic ''[[The Lusiads]]'' vividly portrays the celestial spheres as a "great machine of the universe" constructed by God.&lt;ref&gt;Luiz vaz de Camões, ''The Lusiads,'' translated by Landeg White. Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The explorer Vasco da Gama is shown the celestial spheres in the form of a mechanical model. Contrary to Cicero's representation, da Gama's tour of the spheres begins with the Empyrean, then descends inward toward Earth, culminating in a survey of the domains and divisions of earthly kingdoms, thus magnifying the importance of human deeds in the divine plan.

The '''Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology''' (CEH) is the [[United Kingdom]]'s Centre of Excellence for integrated research in [[hydrology]], terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their interaction with the atmosphere. As part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC), it provides services based on innovative, independent and interdisciplinary science and long-term environmental monitoring, forming an integral part of NERC's strategy.

The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology is one of four environmental research organisations wholly owned by NERC, along with the [[British Geological Survey]], the [[British Antarctic Survey]] and the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The single organisation CEH was established in 2000 from the combination of four existing NERC research centres. &lt;ref name="peer.eu1" /&gt;

The Centre operates from four sites across the UK: [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] (headquarters), [[Edinburgh]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] (jointly with the [[Lancaster Environment Centre]]) and [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] (jointly with [[Bangor University]]).

The current director is Mark J. Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=How CEH operates |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=18 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319192933/http://ceh.ac.uk/science/operate.html |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past directors include [[Pat Nuttall]] (2001–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= |title=Professor Mark Bailey becomes acting Director of the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology |url=http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] |work=Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology website |accessdate=16 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723165002/http://ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/acting-director-ceh_2011_07.html |archivedate=23 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Composite construction''' is a generic term to describe any building construction involving multiple dissimilar materials.  Composite construction is often used in building [[aircraft]], [[watercraft]], and [[building construction]]. There are several reasons to use [[composite materials]] including increased strength, [[aesthetics]], and environmental [[sustainability]].

== Structural engineering ==
In [[structural engineering]], composite construction exists when two different materials are bound together so strongly that they act together as a single unit from a [[structural]] point of view.  When this occurs, it is called composite action.  One common example involves [[steel]] beams supporting [[concrete]] floor slabs.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman, N. A., &amp; Booth, M. (2006, August). Innovative Mid Rise Construction. Retrieved from Structure Magazine: http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2006/August-2006/C-CI-Innovative-Mid-Rise-Aug-06.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930050801/http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2006/August-2006/C-CI-Innovative-Mid-Rise-Aug-06.pdf |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the beam is not connected firmly to the slab, then the slab transfers all of its weight to the beam and the slab contributes nothing to the load carrying capability of the beam.  However, if the slab is connected positively to the beam with studs, then a portion of the slab can be assumed to act compositely with the beam.  In effect, this composite creates a larger and stronger beam than would be provided by the steel beam alone.  The structural engineer may calculate a [[transformed section]] as one step in analyzing the load carry capability of the composite beam.

== House building ==
A [[flitch beam]] is a simple form of composite construction sometimes used in North American [[light frame construction]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2007/June%202007/D-From%20Exp%20Flitch%20Plates%20DeStefano-pac-5-10-07.pdf Structure Magazine  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013822/http://www.structuremag.org/archives/2007/June%202007/D-From%20Exp%20Flitch%20Plates%20DeStefano-pac-5-10-07.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs when a steel plate is sandwiched between two wood joists and bolted together.  A flitch beam can typically support heavier loads over a longer [[Span (architecture)|span]] than an all-wood beam of the same [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].

== Deck Construction ==
===Composite Wood Decking===
The traditional decking material is pressure treated wood. The current material many contractors choose to use is [[composite decking]]. This material is typically made from [[wood-plastic composite]] or Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP). Such materials do not warp, crack, or split and are as versatile as traditional pressure treated wood. Composite decking is made through several different processes, and there are a multitude of sizes, shapes, and strengths available. Depending on the type of composite selected the decking materials can be used for a number of other construction projects including fences and sheds.&lt;ref&gt;Composite Decking. (n.d.).

Retrieved April 07, 2012, from Trex Company, Inc: http://www.trex.com/plan/why-trex/environmentally-friendly/recycling-facts/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
===Composite Steel Deck===
In a composite steel deck, the dissimilar materials in question are steel and concrete. A composite steel deck combines the tensile strength of steel with the compressive strength of concrete to improve design efficiency and reduce the material necessary to cover a given area. Additionally, composite steel decks supported by [[Open_web_steel_joist|composite steel joists]] can span greater distances between supporting elements and have reduced live load deflection in comparison to previous construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steelconstruction.info/Composite_construction|title=Composite Construction - Steelconstruction.info|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steeljoist.org/composite_steel_joist|title=Composite Steel Joist - Steel Joist Institute (SJI)|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionknowledge.net/metal/metal_structural_steel.php#6|title=Structural Steel in Construction from Construction Knowledge.net|accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cement-Polymer Composites ==
Cement-polymer composites are being developed and tested as a replacement for traditional cement. The traditional cement used as stucco rapidly deteriorates. The deterioration causes the material to easily crack due to thermo-processes becoming permeable to water and no longer structurally sound. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in conjunction with  Materials and Electrochemical Research Corporation tested a cement-polymer composite material consisting of [[crumb rubber]] made from [[tire recycling|recycled]] [[scrap tires|rubber tires]] and [[cement]]. It was found that 20% crumb rubber can be added to the cement mixture without affecting the appearance of the cement.  This new material was tested for strength and durability using American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International]]) standards.&lt;ref&gt;Loutfy, R. O. (2005, April 25). National Center For Environmental Research, US EPA. Retrieved June 14, 2010, from Final Report: Cement-Polymer Composites From Recycled Polymers for Construction: http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.abstractDetail/abstract/6970/report/F&lt;/ref&gt;

== High Performance Composites ==
A newer but growing sector in the composite construction sector is the high performance decking that comes from companies like [[Trex Company, Inc.|Trex Decking]] and Fiberon. High performance composite decking has emerged in recent years to combat earlier generations of composite decking like wood plastic composite (WPCs) that were struggling to maintain credibility in the marketplace.&lt;ref name=GreenExpo365.com&gt;{{cite web|last=Gwatney|first=Brent|title=Two Decades of Composite Decking: Where the Industry Has Been and What’s Next|url=http://www.greenexpo365.com/en/app/blog/2013/02/two-decades-of-composite-decking-where-the-industr_hdf6mdsv.html|publisher=GreenExpo365.com|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is showing now, however, that consumers are choosing composite decking products over wood 11 times to 1.  Initial concerns regarding moisture intrusion in composite decks has led to the rise of high performance decking products with protective shells, often referred to as “[[capped composite decking]].”&lt;ref name="Decks of Distinction"&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Tom|title=10 Things You Should Know About Composite Decking|url=http://www.decksofdistinction.com/?p=128|publisher=Decks of Distinction|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capped composite decks have a high performance finish with the addition of the shell that is often called a “cap-stock.” This shell covers either all four sides of the composite board or just the top and sides, depending on the brand. Manufacturers apply the cap to the board using a process called co-extrusion. Most capped composite decking comes with some kind of warranty against stains and fading.&lt;ref name="Decks of Distinction"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34449">'''Darwinian literary studies''' (also known as '''literary Darwinism''') is a branch of [[literary criticism]] that studies [[literature]] in the context of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]], including [[gene-culture coevolution]].  It represents an emerging trend of [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] thought in intellectual disciplines beyond those traditionally considered as [[evolutionary biology]]: [[evolutionary psychology]], [[evolutionary anthropology]], [[behavioral ecology]], [[evolutionary developmental psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[affective neuroscience]], [[behavioural genetics]], [[evolutionary epistemology]], and other such disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of evolutionary research in the human sciences, see [http://www.hbes.com/ Human Behavior and Evolution Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and scope==

Interest in the relationship between Darwinism and the study of literature began in the nineteenth century, for example, among Italian literary critics.&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elena Canadelli|author2=Paolo Coccia|author3=Telmo Pievani|editor1-last=Glick|editor1-first=Thomas F.|editor2-last=Shaffer|editor2-first=Elinor|title=The Literary and Cultural Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe|date=2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781780937120|pages=483–509|chapter=Darwin and Literature in Italy: A Profitable Relationship}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ugo Angelo Canello]] argued that literature was the history of the human psyche, and as such, played a part in the struggle for natural selection, while [[Francesco de Sanctis]] argued that [[Emile Zola]] "brought the concepts of natural selection, struggle for existence, adaptation and environment to bear in his novels".&lt;ref name="Canadelli 2014" /&gt;

Modern Darwinian literary studies arose in part as a result of its proponents' dissatisfaction with the [[poststructuralism|poststructuralist]] and [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] philosophies that had come to dominate literary study during the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, the Darwinists took issue with the argument that [[discourse]] constructs reality. The Darwinists argue that biologically grounded dispositions constrain and inform discourse. This argument runs counter to what evolutionary psychologists assert is the central idea in the "[[Standard Social Science Model]]": that [[culture]] wholly constitutes human values and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;On the conceptual character of poststructuralism, see [[Terry Eagleton]], "Post-structuralism" in ''Literary Theory: An Introduction'', (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1983); [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20027411 M. H. Abrams, "The Transformation of English Studies: 1930-1995"], ''Daedalus''; and [[Jonathan Culler]], ''Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford UP, 1997). For Darwinist critiques of "cultural constructivism," see [http://www.theamericanscholar.org/getting-it-all-wrong/ Brian Boyd, "Getting It All Wrong"]; and [http://www.umsl.edu/~carrolljc/Documents%20linked%20to%20indiex/IN_LIT_DAR/poststructuralism_cultural_criticism_and.pdf Joseph Carroll, "Pluralism, Poststructuralism, and Evolutionary Theory,"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary Darwinists use concepts from evolutionary biology and the evolutionary human sciences to formulate principles of literary theory and interpret literary texts. They investigate interactions between [[human nature]] and the forms of cultural imagination, including literature and its oral antecedents. By "human nature", they mean a pan-human, genetically transmitted set of dispositions: motives, emotions, features of personality, and forms of cognition. Because the Darwinists concentrate on relations between genetically transmitted dispositions and specific cultural configurations, they often describe their work as "biocultural critique".&lt;ref&gt;For introductory commentaries on evolutionary studies in the humanities, see [http://hfromm.net/professional/DarwinBoth.html Harold Fromm, "The New Darwinism in the Humanities"], ''Hudson Review''; [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/magazine/the-literary-darwinists.html?pagewanted=2 D. T. Max, "The Literary Darwinists"], ''The New York Times''; [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/439388a.html John Whitfield, "Literary Darwinism: Textual Selection"], ''Nature''; [http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2008.09-the-other-darwin-mark-czarnecki-creationism-origin-of-the-species-evolution/ Mark Czarnecki, "The Other Darwin"], ''Walrus Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many literary Darwinists aim not just at creating another "approach" or "movement" in literary theory; they aim at fundamentally altering the paradigm within which literary study is now conducted. They want to establish a new alignment among the disciplines and ultimately to encompass all other possible approaches to literary study. They rally to Edward O. Wilson's cry for "consilience" among all the branches of learning. Like Wilson, they envision nature as an integrated set of elements and forces extending in an unbroken chain of material causation from the lowest level of subatomic particles to the highest levels of cultural imagination. And like Wilson, they regard evolutionary biology as the pivotal discipline uniting the hard sciences with the social sciences and the humanities. They believe that humans have evolved in an adaptive relation to their environment. They argue that for humans, as for all other species, evolution has shaped the anatomical, physiological, and neurological characteristics of the species, and they think that human behavior, feeling, and thought are fundamentally shaped by those characteristics. They make it their business to consult evolutionary biology and evolutionary social science in order to determine what those characteristics are, and they bring that information to bear on their understanding of the products of the human imagination.&lt;ref&gt;For general statements about the aims of scholars in this field, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v029/29.1boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Evolution: A Bio-Cultural Approach"]; [http://neuronarrative.wordpress.com/2009/02/27/what-is-literary-darwinism-an-interview-with-joseph-carroll/ Interview with Joseph Carroll, "What Is Literary Darwinism?"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v027/27.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "The Tree of Knowledge and Darwinian Literary Study"]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tx00yV_qNQ Maya Lessov, A Filmed Interview with Joseph Carroll, Brian Boyd, and Jonathan Gottschall]; and [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v026/26.2nordlund.html Marcus Nordlund, "Consilient Literary Interpretation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary literary criticism of a minimalist kind consists in identifying basic, common human needs—survival, sex, and status, for instance—and using those categories to describe the behavior of characters depicted in literary texts. Others pose for themselves a form of criticism involving an overarching interpretive challenge: to construct continuous explanatory sequences linking the highest level of causal evolutionary explanation to the most particular effects in individual works of literature. Within evolutionary biology, the highest level of causal explanation involves adaptation by means of natural selection. Starting from the premise that the human mind has evolved in an adaptive relation to its environment, literary Darwinists undertake to characterize the phenomenal qualities of a literary work (tone, style, theme, and formal organization), locate the work in a cultural context, explain that cultural context as a particular organization of the elements of human nature within a specific set of environmental conditions (including cultural traditions), identify an implied author and an implied reader, examine the responses of actual readers (for instance, other literary critics), describe the socio-cultural, political, and psychological functions the work fulfills, locate those functions in relation to the evolved needs of human nature, and link the work comparatively with other artistic works, using a taxonomy of themes, formal elements, affective elements, and functions derived from a comprehensive model of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;For an analysis of the topics and approaches in this field, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=usZR5aXFmiUC&amp;pg=PA637&amp;lpg=PA637&amp;dq=joseph+carroll+evolutionary+approaches+to+literature+and+drama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=StMHaB_3yO&amp;sig=KJxvcQcepCmXJYqvd9cJQA4jIEw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LbWqS7X1M5OYsgOq0_HMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=joseph%20carroll%20evolutionary%20approaches%20to%20literature%20and%20drama&amp;f=false Joseph Carroll, "Evolutionary Approaches to Literature and Drama"].

Contributors to evolutionary studies in literature have included humanists, biologists, and social scientists. Some of the biologists and social scientists have adopted primarily discursive methods for discussing literary subjects, and some of the humanists have adopted the empirical, quantitative methods typical of research in the sciences.  Literary scholars and scientists have also collaborated in research that combines the methods typical of work in the humanities with methods typical of work in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;For examples of evolutionary criticism making use of empirical, quantitative methodology, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v033/33.1.carroll.html Carroll, Gottschall, Johnson, and Kruger, "Agonistic Structure in Nineteenth-Century British Novels: Doing the Math"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/greater%20emphasis%20on%20female%20attract.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "Greater Emphasis on Female Attractiveness in ''Homo sapiens'': A Revised Solution to an Old Evolutionary Riddle"]; [http://www.washjeff.edu/users/jgottschall/Papers,%20etc/proofs_manifesto_feminist.pdf Jonathan Gottschall, "A Modest Manifesto and Testing the Hypotheses of Feminist Fairy Tale Studies"]; [http://www.muse.uq.edu.au/journals/marvels_and_tales/v023/23.2.gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall, "Response to Kathleen Ragan's 'What Happened to the Heroines in Folktales?'"]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v030/30.2gottschall.html Jonathan Gottschall and Marcus Nordlund, "Romantic Love: A Literary Universal?"]; [http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep06715738.pdf Johnson, Carroll, Gottschall, and Kruger, "Hierarchy in the Library: Egalitarian Dynamics in Victorian Novels]; and [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/daniel.nettle/shakespeare.pdf Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, "The Small World of Shakespeare's Plays"].

==Adaptive function of literature and the arts==

The most hotly debated issue in evolutionary literary study concerns the adaptive functions of literature and other arts—whether there are any adaptive functions, and if so, what they might be.   Proposed functions include transmitting information, including about kin relations, and by providing the audience with a model and rehearsal for how to behave in similar situations that may arise in the future.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 Evolutionary approaches of literature and drama by Joseph Carrol&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Pinker (''How the Mind Works'', 1997) suggests that aesthetic responsiveness is merely a side effect of cognitive powers that evolved to fulfill more practical functions,  but Pinker also suggests that narratives can provide information for adaptively relevant problems. Geoffrey Miller (''The Mating Mind'', 2000) argues that artistic productions in the ancestral environment served as forms of sexual display in order to demonstrate fitness and attract mates, similarly to the function of the [[peacock]]'s tail. Brian Boyd (''On the Origin of Stories'', 2009) argues that the arts are forms of cognitive "play" that enhance pattern recognition. In company with Ellen Dissanayake (''Art and Intimacy'', 2000), Boyd also argues that the arts provide means of creating shared social identity and help create and maintain [[human bonding]]. Dissanayake, [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]] (''Literary Darwinism'' 2004), and [[Denis Dutton]] (''The Art Instinct'', 2009) all argue that the arts help organize the human mind by giving emotionally and aesthetically modulated models of reality. By participating in the simulated life of other people one gains a greater understanding of the motivations of oneself and other people. The idea that the arts function as means of psychological organization subsumes the ideas that the arts provide adaptively relevant information, enable us to consider alternative behavioral scenarios, enhance pattern recognition, and serve as means for creating shared social identity. And of course, the arts can be used for sexual display. In that respect, the arts are like most other human products—clothing, jewelry, shelter, means of transportation, etc. The hypothesis that the arts help organize the mind is not incompatible with the hypothesis of sexual display, but it subordinates sexual display to a more primary adaptive function.&lt;ref&gt;For commentaries on the adaptive (or non-adaptive) functions of the arts, see [http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/staff/files/bboy001/boyd_ev_theories_of_art.pdf Brian Boyd, "Evolutionary Theories of Art,"] in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', ed.

==Hypotheses about formal literary features==

Some Darwinists have proposed explanations for formal literary features, including genres. [[Meter (poetry)|Poetic meter]] has been attributed to a biologically based three-second metric. Gender preferences for [[pornography]] and [[romance novel]]s have been explained by [[sexual selection]]. Different genres have been conjectured to correspond to different [[basic emotions]]: [[tragedy]] corresponding to sadness, fear, and anger; comedy to joy and surprise; and satire to anger, disgust, and contempt. Tragedy has also been associated with status conflict and comedy with mate selection. The satiric [[dystopian]] novel has been explained by contrasting universal human needs and oppressive state organization.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

==Distinguishing literary Darwinism==

''Cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism:'' Literary Theorists who would call themselves "literary Darwinists" or claim some close alignment with the literary Darwinists share one central idea: that the adapted mind produces literature and that literature reflects the structure and character of the adapted mind. There are at least two other ways of integrating evolution into literary theory: cosmic evolutionism and evolutionary analogism. Cosmic evolutionists identify some universal process of development or progress and identify literary structures as microcosmic versions of that process. Proponents of cosmic evolution include [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]], Alex Argyros, and Richard Cureton. Evolutionary analogists take the process of Darwinian evolution—blind variation and selective retention—as a widely applicable model for all development. The psychologist Donald Campbell advances the idea that all intellectual creativity can be conceived as a form of random variation and selective retention. Rabkin and Simon offer an instance in literary study. They argue that cultural creations "evolve in the same way as do biological organisms, that is, as complex adaptive systems that succeed or fail according to their fitness to their environment."&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Rabkin, and C. P. Simon, "Age, Sex, and Evolution in the Science Fiction Marketplace." ''Interdisciplinary Literary Studies'', 2 (2001): 45-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics or theorists who have some affiliation with evolutionary biology but who would not identify themselves as literary Darwinists include William Benzon (''Beethoven's Anvil'') and William Flesch (''Comeuppance'').

''Cognitive rhetoric:'' Practitioners of "cognitive rhetoric" or [[cognitive poetics]] affiliate themselves with certain language-centered areas of cognitive psychology. The chief theorists in this school argue that language is based in metaphors, and they claim that metaphors are themselves rooted in biology or the body, but they do not argue that human nature consists in a highly structured set of motivational and cognitive dispositions that have evolved through an adaptive process regulated by natural selection. Cognitive rhetoricians are generally more anxious than literary Darwinists to associate themselves with postmodern theories of "discourse," but some cognitive rhetoricians make gestures toward evolutionary psychology, and some critics closely affiliated with evolutionary psychology have found common ground with the cognitive rhetoricians.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v023/23.2boyd.html Brian Boyd, "Literature and Discovery," ''Philosophy and Literature'', 23 (1999): 313-33]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v025/25.3sacks.html Nancy Easterlin, "Romanticism's Gray Matter," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 26 (2002): 443-55.]&lt;/ref&gt; The seminal authorities in cognitive rhetoric are the language philosophers [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]] and [[George Lakoff]]. The most prominent literary theorist in the field is [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]]. Other literary scholars associated with cognitive rhetoric include Mary Thomas Crane, F. Elizabeth Hart, Tony Jackson, Alan Richardson, Ellen Spolsky, [[Francis Steen]], and [[Lisa Zunshine]].&lt;ref&gt;On the relations between cognitive rhetoric and literary Darwinism, see [http://www.style.niu.edu/ Joseph Carroll, "An Evolutionary Paradigm for Literary Study," ''Style'' 42 (2008): 105-108]; [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v025/25.2hart.html F. Elizabeth Hart, "The epistemology of cognitive literary studies, ''Philosophy and Literature'' 25 (2001): 314-34]; Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky, eds., ''The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity'', Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentaries==
Some of the commentaries included in the [http://www.style.niu.edu/ special double issue of ''Style''] are critical of literary Darwinism. Other critical commentaries include those of [http://www.entelechyjournal.com/billbenzon.html William Benzon, "Signposts for a Naturalist Criticism,"] (''Entelechy: Mind &amp; Culture,'' Fall 2005/Winter 2006); [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090608/deresiewicz William Deresiewicz, "Adaptation: On Literary Darwinism,"] ''The Nation'' June 8, 2009: 26-31; [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0674032284/ William Flesch, ''Comeuppance: Costly Signaling, Altruistic Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction'',] (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2008); [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1412811473/ Eugene Goodheart, ''Darwinian Misadventures in the Humanities'',] (New Brunswick: NJ: Transaction, 2007); Jonathan Kramnick, "Against Literary Darwinism," in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2011; "Debating Literary Darwinism," a set of responses to Jonathan Kramnick's essay, along with Kramnick's rejoinder, in ''Critical Inquiry'', Winter 2012; Alan Richardson, "Studies in Literature and Cognition: A Field Map," in [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0754638499/ ''The Work of Fiction: Cognition, Culture, and Complexity''], ed. Alan Richardson and Ellen Spolsky (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004 1-29); and Lisa Zunshine, "What is Cognitive Cultural Studies?," in ''Introduction to Cognitive Cultural Studies'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 2010 1-33). Goodheart and Deresiewicz, adopting a traditional humanist perspective, reject efforts to ground literary study in biology. Richardson disavows the Darwinists' tendency to attack poststructuralism. Richardson and Benzon both align themselves with cognitive science and distinguish that alignment from an alignment with evolutionary psychology. Flesch makes use of evolutionary research on game theory, costly signaling, and altruistic punishment but, like [[Stephen Jay Gould]], professes himself hostile to evolutionary psychology. For a commentary that is sympathetic to evolutionary psychology but skeptical about the possibilities of using it for literary study, see [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_and_literature/v031/31.1pinker.html Steven Pinker, "Toward a Consilient Study of Literature,"] a review of ''The Literary Animal'', ''Philosophy and Literature'' 31 (2007): 162-178.[[David Fishelov]] has argued that the attempt to link Darwinism to literary studies has failed "to produce compelling evidence to support some of its basic assumptions (notably that literature is an [[adaptation]])" and has called on literary scholars to be more conceptually rigorous when they pursue "empirical research into different aspects of literary evolution." &lt;ref&gt; David Fishelov, "Evolution and Literary Studies: Time to Evolve," ''Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 2 (October 2017): 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial shock wave is visible on the water surface, and a shock condensation cloud is visible overhead.]]

'''Detonation''' ({{ety|la|detonare|to thunder down}}) is a type of [[combustion]] involving a [[supersonic]] exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a [[shock front]] propagating directly in front of it.  Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fickett|last2= Davis|title=Detonation|publisher= Univ. California Press|year=1979|isbn= 978-0-486-41456-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in reactive gases.  The [[detonation velocity|velocity of detonation]] in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher [[Image resolution|resolution]]).

A very wide variety of fuels may occur as gases, droplet fogs, or dust suspensions.  Oxidants include halogens, ozone, hydrogen peroxide and oxides of nitrogen.  Gaseous detonations are often associated with a mixture of fuel and oxidant in a composition somewhat below conventional flammability ratios.  They happen most often in confined systems, but they sometimes occur in large vapor clouds.  Other materials, such as [[acetylene]], [[ozone]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]] are detonable in the absence of [[dioxygen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stull|title=Fundamentals of fire and explosion|publisher=A.I.Chem.E.|series=Monograph Series|volume=10|page=73|year=1977|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcBTAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards|publisher=Butterworths|location=London|year=2006|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123725639|isbn=978-0-12-372563-9|first1=Peter |last1=Urben |first2= Leslie|last2= Bretherick|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detonation was discovered in 1881 by two pairs of French scientists [[Marcellin Berthelot]] and P. Vieille&lt;ref&gt;6 M. Berthelot and P. Vieille, “On the velocity of propagation of explosive processes in gases,” Comp. Rend. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci., Vol. 93, pp. 18-21, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ernest-François Mallard]] and [[Henry Louis Le Chatelier]].&lt;ref&gt;5 E. Mallard and H. L. Le Chatelier, “On the propagation velocity of burning in gaseous explosive mixtures,” Comp. Rend. Hebd. Séances Acad. Sci., Vol. 93, pp. 145-148, 1881&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical predictions of propagation were carried out first by [[David Chapman (chemist)|David Chapman]] in 1899&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, D. L. (1899). VI. On the rate of explosion in gases. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 47(284), 90-104.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Émile Jouguet]] in 1905&lt;ref&gt;Jouguet, E. (1905).

And 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Jouguet, É. (1917). L'œuvre scientifique de Pierre Duhem. Doin.&lt;/ref&gt; The next advance in understanding detonation was made by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]] in the early 1940s.

== Theories ==
The simplest theory to predict the behaviour of detonations in gases is known as [[Chapman-Jouguet condition|Chapman-Jouguet]] (CJ) theory, developed around the turn of the 20th century.  This theory, described by a relatively simple set of algebraic equations, models the detonation as a propagating shock wave accompanied by exothermic heat release.  Such a theory confines the chemistry and diffusive transport processes to an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin zone.

A more complex theory was advanced during World War II independently by [[Zel'dovich]], [[von Neumann]], and [[W. Doering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zel'dovich |last2= Kompaneets|title=Theory of Detonation|publisher=Academic Press|location= New York|year=1960|asin= B000WB4XGE|oclc=974679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|year=1942|last=von Neumann|first=John|title=Progress report on "Theory of Detonation Waves"|id= OSRD Report No. 549.

With a reference frame of a stationary shock, the following flow is subsonic, so that an acoustic reaction zone follows immediately behind the lead front, the [[Chapman-Jouguet condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chapman |first=David Leonard |title=On the rate of explosion in gases |journal=Philosophical Magazine |location=London |series=Series 5 |volume=47 |issue=284 |pages=90–104 |date=January 1899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4u8y0Kf8NQC&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;f=false |issn=1941-5982 |lccn=sn86025845 |doi=10.1080/14786449908621243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jouguet|url=http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1905_6_1_A9_0.pdf|first=Jacques Charles Emile|title=Sur la propagation des réactions chimiques dans les gaz|journal=Journal des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|series=6|volume=1|pages=347–425|year=1905|trans-title=On the propagation of chemical reactions in gases|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171453/http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1905_6_1_A9_0.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-19|df=}} Continued in Continued in {{cite journal|last=Jouguet|first=Jacques Charles Emile|journal=Journal des Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées|series=6|volume=2|pages=5–85|year=1906|url=http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1906_6_2_A1_0.pdf|title=Sur la propagation des réactions chimiques dans les gaz|trans-title=On the propagation of chemical reactions in gases|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016140100/http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1906_6_2_A1_0.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also some evidence that the reaction zone is semi-metallic in some explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys806 | title = A transient semimetallic layer in detonating nitromethane | year = 2007 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Evan J. | last2 = Riad Manaa | first2 = M. | last3 = Fried | first3 = Laurence E. | last4 = Glaesemann | first4 = Kurt R. | last5 = Joannopoulos | first5 = J.

Both theories describe one-dimensional and steady wave fronts.  However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

Experimental studies have revealed some of the conditions needed for the propagation of such fronts.

== Applications ==

When used in explosive devices, the main cause of damage from a detonation is the supersonic blast front (a powerful [[shock wave]]) in the surrounding area. This is a significant distinction from [[deflagration]]s where the exothermic wave is subsonic and maximum pressures are at most one eighth{{Citation needed|date = February 2010}} as great. Therefore, detonation is most often used for explosives and the acceleration of projectiles.  However, detonation waves may also be used for less destructive purposes, including deposition of coatings to a surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nikolaev, Yu.A. |author2=Vasil'ev, A.A. |author3=Ul'yanitskii |author4=B.Yu. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Gas Detonation and its Application in Engineering and Technologies (Review)|journal=Combustion, Explosion, and Shock Waves|volume= 39|issue= 4|pages=382–410|year= 2003|doi=10.1023/A:1024726619703}}&lt;/ref&gt; or cleaning of equipment (e.g. slag removal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Huque, Z. |author2=Ali, M.R. |author3=Kommalapati, R. |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Application of pulse detonation technology for boiler slag removal|journal=Fuel Processing Technology|volume= 90|issue= 4|pages=558–569|year= 2009|doi=10.1016/j.fuproc.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and even [[explosive welding|explosively welding]] together metals that would otherwise fail to fuse.

== In engines and firearms ==
Unintentional detonation when [[deflagration]] is desired is a problem in some devices.  In internal combustion engines it is called [[engine knocking]] or pinging or pinking, and it causes a loss of power, excessive heating, and eventual engine failure in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Engine knocking#Abnormal combustion]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hpacademy.com/technical-articles/dont-waste-your-time-listening-for-knock/&lt;/ref&gt; In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.

== Etymology ==
In classical Latin, ''detonare'' means "to stop thundering", as in weather. The modern meaning developed later.

[[File:Jean Mignon - The Transformation of Actaeon - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Print by [[Jean Mignon]], ''The Transformation of Actaeon'', with his pursuit and death shown in the background]] 
The myth of '''Diana and Actaeon''' can be found within Ovid’s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The tale recounts the unfortunate fate of a young hunter named [[Actaeon]], who was a grandson of [[Cadmus]], and his encounter with chaste [[Artemis]], known to the Romans as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the hunt. The latter is nude and enjoying a bath in a spring with help from her escort of nymphs when the mortal man unwittingly stumbles upon the scene. The nymphs scream in surprise and attempt to cover Diana, who, in a fit of embarrassed fury, splashes water upon Actaeon. He is transformed into a deer with a dappled hide and long antlers, robbed of his ability to speak, and thereafter promptly flees in fear. It is not long, however, before his own hounds track him down and kill him, failing to recognize their master.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''Metamorphoses'', translated by A.D. Melville (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The story became very popular in the Renaissance. The most common scene shown was Actaeon surprising Diana, but his transformation and his death were also sometimes shown. [[Titian]] painted the first two scenes in two of his greatest late ''poesies'' for [[Philip II of Spain]], in [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] and ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]''.  The latter actually shows the transformation still in progress; like many depictions the head is shown transformed, but most of the body remains human. Less often Actaeon is fully transformed when caught by his dogs.  The story was popular on Italian Renaissance [[maiolica]].

== Ballet == 
The origins of the ''Diana and Actaeon Pas de Deux,'' a ''divertissement'' created for a 1935 version of ''La Esmeralda,'' lie in two earlier ballet productions. The first of these was ''Tsar Kandavl'' (aka ''Le Roi Candaule''), premiered in 1868 by the Imperial Russian Ballet in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Koegler, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet'' (Oxford University Press, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a story told by Herodotus in his ''Histories,''&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories,'' translated by Robin Waterfield (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; this four-act ballet, choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]] to music by [[Cesare Pugni]], included a ''pas de trois'' for dancers portraying Diana, the Roman goddess of the moon, the hunt, and chastity; Endymion, a beautiful shepherd, and a Satyr. This ''divertissement'' told of a poetic encounter in which Diana (or Selene, another name for the moon goddess) looked down upon the sleeping youth, descended to earth, kissed him, and fell in love.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Bulfinch, ''Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable,'' edited by Norma Lorre Goodrich (New York: Plume Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In a production mounted in the early twentieth century, Anna Pavlova was among those who danced Diana, and Vaslav Nijinsky appeared as the Satyr.&lt;ref&gt;Bronislava Nijinska, ''Bronislava Nijinska: Early Memoirs'' (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, George Balanchine, then Balanchivadze, also danced the role of the Satyr, with Lydia Ivanova as Diana and Nicholas Efimov as Endymion.&lt;ref&gt;George Balanchine Foundation, "Roles Performed by Balanchine" at Balanchine Catalogue online, http://balanchine.org. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Petipa incorporated a new ''pas de deux,'' set to music by Riccardo Drigo, into his production of Pugni's ''La Esmeralda'' for the Maryinsky Ballet,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln Kirstein, "La Esmeralda," in ''Movement and Metaphor: Four Centuries of Ballet'' (New York: Pitman, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marius Petipa, ''The Diaries of Marius Petipa,'' translated and edited by Lynn Garafola, "Studies in Dance History," vol. 3.1 (Spring, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; as the Imperial Russian Ballet had come to be called. This ''pas de deux'' was based on the Greek myth of Artemis (predecessor to the Roman Diana), in her aspect of virgin goddess of the hunt, and Actaeon, a Theban hero. According to Ovid's ''Metamorphoses,'' Actaeon, out on a hunt, stumbled upon Artemis while she was bathing at a spring. Outraged and embarrassed that he had seen her naked, she punished him by destroying his power of speech and turning him into a stag, with antlers and a shaggy coat. In deer form, he was torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs, whipped into a raging fury by Artemis.

In 1935, [[Agrippina Vaganova]] staged a new production of ''La Esmeralda'' for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad,&lt;ref&gt;Vera Krasovskaya, ''Agrippina Iakovlevna Vaganova'' (Leningrad, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirstein, "La Esmeralda" (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; as the company and the city were then known. She created a new, bravura ''pas de deux'' for Diana and Actaeon, joining the names of the modest Roman goddess and the hapless Greek hunter. She included a few spectacular "stag leaps" for the male dancer, but she largely abandoned the well-known story of Actaeon in creating this ''divertissement'' and made instead a rapturous dance for two lovers, set to music by Pugni. Diana is seen as the beautiful goddess of the moon and the hunt, usually wearing a wispy red chiton and carrying a small golden bow; Actaeon is portrayed as a strong, handsome, mortal youth, clad in a short chiton or loincloth. At the premiere, Diana was danced by Galina Ulanova and Actaeon by Vaktang Chabukiani.&lt;ref&gt;"Diana and Actaeon pas de deux," American Ballet Theater website, http://www.abt.org/performanes. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Vaganova's popular ''pas de deux,'' which might have been better called ''Diana and Endymion,'' is still performed today as a spectacular showpiece for a ballerina and her partner.

{{POV check| reason= the last section in this article contains several subjective, unsubstantiated claims about a particular brand of Digital PCR machine. These should be made more neutral and/or backed up with valid references.|date=June 2012}}'''Digital polymerase chain reaction''' (digital PCR, DigitalPCR, dPCR, or dePCR) is a [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] refinement of conventional [[polymerase chain reaction]] methods that can be used to directly quantify and clonally amplify nucleic acids strands including [[DNA]], [[cDNA]] or [[RNA]]. The key difference between dPCR and traditional PCR lies in the method of measuring nucleic acids amounts, with the former being a more precise method than PCR, though also more prone to error in the hands of inexperienced users.&lt;ref name="perkel2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perkel J | title = Guiding our PCR experiments | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 58 | issue = 5 | pages = 217–21 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25967899 | doi = 10.2144/000114283 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A "digital" measurement quantitatively and discretely measures a certain variable, whereas an “analog” measurement extrapolates certain measurements based on measured patterns. PCR carries out one reaction per single sample. dPCR also carries out a single reaction within a sample, however the sample is separated into a large number of partitions and the reaction is carried out in each partition individually. This separation allows a more reliable collection and sensitive measurement of nucleic acid amounts. The method has been demonstrated as useful for studying variations in gene sequences — such as copy number variants and point mutations — and it is routinely used for clonal amplification of samples for [[next-generation sequencing]].

== Principles ==
{{main|Polymerase chain reaction}}
The polymerase chain reaction method is used to quantify [[nucleic acids]] by amplifying a nucleic acid molecule with the enzyme [[DNA polymerase]]. Conventional [[PCR]] is based on the theory that amplification is exponential. Therefore, nucleic acids may be quantified by comparing the number of amplification cycles and amount of PCR end-product to those of a reference sample. However, many factors complicate this calculation, creating uncertainties and inaccuracies. These factors include the following: initial amplification cycles may not be exponential; PCR amplification eventually plateaus after an uncertain number of cycles; and low initial concentrations of target nucleic acid molecules may not amplify to detectable levels. However, the most significant limitation of PCR is that PCR amplification efficiency in a sample of interest may be different from that of reference samples. Since PCR is an exponential process, only twofold differences in amplification can be observed, greatly impacting the validity and precision of the results.

[[File:Oil droplets containing fluorescent PCR target molecule.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Oil droplets containing fluorescent PCR target molecule]]
[[File:Poisson Distribution Curve.jpg|thumb|Figure 2. Fraction of positive droplets predict number of target copies per droplet modeled by the Poisson distribution]]
dPCR improves upon the current PCR practices by dividing up the reaction into multiple, smaller reactions. A sample is partitioned so that individual nucleic acid molecules within the sample are localized and concentrated within many separate regions. Micro well plates, capillaries, oil emulsion, and arrays of miniaturized chambers with nucleic acid binding surfaces can be used to partition the samples. A PCR solution is made similarly to a [[TaqMan]] assay, which consists of template DNA (or RNA), fluorescence-quencher probes, primers, and a PCR master mix, which contains [[DNA polymerase]], [[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTPs]], MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reaction buffers at optimal concentrations. The PCR solution is divided into smaller reactions and are then made to run PCR individually. After multiple PCR amplification cycles, the samples are checked for fluorescence with a binary readout of “0” or “1”. The fraction of fluorescing droplets is recorded. The partitioning of the sample allows one to estimate the number of different molecules by assuming that the molecule population follows the [[Poisson distribution]], thus accounting for the possibility of multiple target molecules inhabiting a single droplet. Using Poisson's law of small numbers, the distribution of target molecule within the sample can be accurately approximated allowing for a quantification of the target strand in the PCR product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Prediger |first1=Ellen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Digital PCR (dPCR)—What is it and why use it? |url=http://www.idtdna.com/pages/decoded/decoded-articles/core-concepts/decoded/2013/10/21/digital-pcr-(dpcr)-what-is-it-and-why-use-it- |publisher=[[Integrated DNA Technologies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure 2 shows the Poisson distribution of the copies of target molecule per droplet (CPD) based on the fraction of fluorescent droplets (p), represented by the function CPD=-ln(1-p).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/absolute-quantification-pcr-targets-with-droplet-digital-pcr-system |title=Absolute Quantification of PCR Targets with the Droplet Digital™ PCR System |publisher=[[Bio-Rad]] |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model simply predicts that as the number of samples containing at least one target molecule increases, the probability of the samples containing more than one target molecule increases. In conventional PCR, the number of PCR amplification cycles is proportional to the starting copy number. dPCR, however, is not dependent on the number of amplification cycles to determine the initial sample amount, eliminating the reliance on uncertain exponential data to quantify target nucleic acids and therefore provides absolute quantification.

The benefits of dPCR include increased precision through massive sample partitioning, which ensures reliable measurements in the desired DNA sequence due to reproducibility. With basic PCR, error rates are larger when detecting small fold-change differences, however, with dPCR the error rate decreases because smaller fold-change differences can be detected in DNA sequence. The technique itself reduces the use of a larger volume of reagent needed, which inevitably will lower experiment cost. Also, dPCR is highly quantitative as it does not rely on relative fluorescence of the solution to determine the amount of amplified target DNA.

===Droplet Digital PCR===
[[File:Oil Emulsion Technique.png|thumb|Figure 3. Representation of oil emulsion technique used in digital droplet PCR]]
In Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR) the PCR solution is divided into smaller reactions through a water oil emulsion technique, which are then made to run PCR individually. As shown in Figure 3, the PCR sample is partitioned into nanoliter-size samples and encapsulated into oil droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/droplet-digital-pcr-ddpcr-technology |title= Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR™) Technology|publisher=[[Bio-Rad]] |access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil droplets are made using a droplet generator that applies a vacuum to each of the wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro LB, Coleman VA, Hindson CM, Herrmann J, Hindson BJ, Bhat S, Emslie KR | title = Evaluation of a droplet digital polymerase chain reaction format for DNA copy number quantification | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 84 | issue = 2 | pages = 1003–11 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22122760 | pmc = 3260738 | doi = 10.1021/ac202578x | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20,000 oil droplets are made from each 20 μL sample.

== Comparison between dPCR and Real-Time PCR (qPCR) ==

dPCR measures the actual number of molecules (target DNA) as each molecule is in one droplet, thus making it a discrete “digital” measurement. It provides absolute quantification because dPCR measures the positive fraction of samples, which is the number of droplets that are fluorescing due to proper amplification. This positive fraction accurately indicates the initial amount of template nucleic acid. Similarly, [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|qPCR]] utilizes fluorescence; however, it measures the intensity of fluorescence at specific times (generally after every amplification cycle) to determine the relative amount of target molecule (DNA), but cannot specify the exact amount without constructing a standard curve using different amounts of a defined standard. It gives the threshold per cycle (CT) and the difference in CT is used to calculate the amount of initial nucleic acid. As such, qPCR is an analog measurement, which may not be as precise due to the extrapolation required to attain a measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindson BJ, Ness KD, Masquelier DA, Belgrader P, Heredia NJ, Makarewicz AJ, Bright IJ, Lucero MY, Hiddessen AL, Legler TC, Kitano TK, Hodel MR, Petersen JF, Wyatt PW, Steenblock ER, Shah PH, Bousse LJ, Troup CB, Mellen JC, Wittmann DK, Erndt NG, Cauley TH, Koehler RT, So AP, Dube S, Rose KA, Montesclaros L, Wang S, Stumbo DP, Hodges SP, Romine S, Milanovich FP, White HE, Regan JF, Karlin-Neumann GA, Hindson CM, Saxonov S, Colston BW | display-authors = 6 | title = High-throughput droplet digital PCR system for absolute quantitation of DNA copy number | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 83 | issue = 22 | pages = 8604–10 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22035192 | pmc = 3216358 | doi = 10.1021/ac202028g | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that the previous reference was authored by employees of [[Bio-Rad]], which provides commercial kits and reagents for dPCR, and therefore stands to profit from their promotion and sale.

dPCR measures the amount of DNA after amplification is complete and then determines the fraction of replicates. This is representative of an endpoint measurement as it requires the observation of the data after the experiment is completed. In contrast, qPCR records the relative fluorescence of the DNA at specific points during the amplification process, which requires stops in the experimental process. This “real-time” aspect of qPCR may theoretically affect results due to the stopping of the experiment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} In practice, however, most qPCR [[thermal cycler]]s read each sample's fluorescence very quickly at the end of the annealing/extension step before proceeding to the next melting step, meaning this hypothetical concern is not actually relevant or applicable for the vast majority of researchers.

qPCR is unable to distinguish differences in gene expression or copy number variations that are smaller than twofold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ledger, et al |title=Resolution of differences in gene expression using qPCR: a review of techniques |journal=Journal of Biomolecular Technology |date=2016 |volume=42 |issue=23 |pages=230-245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to identify alleles with frequencies of less than 1% because highly abundant, common alleles would be matched with similar sequences.{{clarify|date=February 2017}} On the other hand, dPCR has been shown to detect a differences of less than 30% in gene expression, distinguish between copy number variations of that differ by only 1 copy, and identify alleles that occur at frequencies less than 0.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baker |first=Monya |date=2012-06-01 |title=Digital PCR hits its stride |journal=[[Nature Methods]] |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=541–544 |doi=10.1038/nmeth.2027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

{{Advert|section|date=February 2017}}

dPCR applications largely include, detection of mutant alleles; for example, dPCR can be used to quantitate mutant alleles in circulating tumor DNA. This technique can also be used for genetic prenatal diagnostics. In a research paper conducted by White et al., a dPCR assay was able to detect an L1 insertion event in as few as 0.01% to 0.1% of cells, which indicates the precision of this device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White TB, McCoy AM, Streva VA, Fenrich J, Deininger PL | title = A droplet digital PCR detection method for rare L1 insertions in tumors | journal = Mobile DNA | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 30 | date = 31 December 2014 | pmid = 25598847 | doi = 10.1186/s13100-014-0030-4 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; dPCR has proved useful for quantitation of DNA methylation including the analysis of heterogeneous methylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mikeska T, Candiloro IL, Dobrovic A | title = The implications of heterogeneous DNA methylation for the accurate quantification of methylation | journal = Epigenomics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 561–73 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 22121974 | doi = 10.2217/epi.10.32 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

dPCR provides quantification of gene expression levels, especially with low-abundance miRNA due to the technique's sensitivity and precision. dPCR can be used for amplification of different types of RNA such as siRNA, mRNA, etc. Due to the high degree of cell-cell variation in gene expression, dPCR enable low copy number quantification in order to perform single cell analysis. Following variations among cells, dPCR enables an increased detection of differences in gene copy number in order to analyze complex behavioral traits, phenotypic variability, and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Droplet Digital PCR Applications Guide |url=http://cgrb.oregonstate.edu/sites/cgrb.oregonstate.edu/files/files/CoreLab/ddpcr_application_guide_bulletin_6407.pdf |publisher=Bio-Rad |access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development &amp; Commercialization of dPCR Methods==

The first paper on dPCR was published by Dr Alec Morley and Pamela Sykes in 1992. The purpose was to quantify PCR targets in an attempt to track and measure the absolute lowest number of leukemic cells in a patient with leukemia. The purpose was to monitor residual disease in leukemia patients, and thereby treat the patients at the earliest possible moment of detection of disease recurrence. Further evolutions of the technology allowed for more widespread distribution of this technique, with small partitions created by emulsion droplets and/or microfluidics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sykes PJ, Neoh SH, Brisco MJ, Hughes E, Condon J, Morley AA | title = Quantitation of targets for PCR by use of limiting dilution | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 444–9 | date = September 1992 | pmid = 1389177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Brown at [[Cytonix]] and Silver [[National Institutes of Health]] coinvented single-step quantitization and sequencing methods employing nano-scale physical containment arrays (Brown, Silver),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalinina O, Lebedeva I, Brown J, Silver J | title = Nanoliter scale PCR with TaqMan detection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1999–2004 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9115368 | pmc = 146692 | doi = 10.1093/nar/25.10.1999 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; and open chambers (Brown) using localized clonal colonies in 1D and 2D capillaries, macro volumes, gels, free chambers, and affinity surfaces/particles.{{technical statement | reason= these are not self-explanatory terms, with meaning only to specialized audiences. They should be clarified or linked to the appropriate articles or citations |date=June 2012}} resulting in a 1997 U. S. Patent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=6143496 |title=Method of sampling, amplifying and quantifying segment of nucleic acid, polymerase chain reaction assembly having nanoliter-sized sample chambers, and method of filling assembly |invent = Brown JF, Silver JE, Kalinina OV |assign1=Cytonix |assign2=US Department of Health and Human Services |class=G01N33/543; G01N33/68 |status=patent |gdate=2000-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent divisional and continuation patents. The concepts of [[electrowetting]] and [[digital microfluidics]] were further introduced (Brown) as one means of manipulating nano fluid volumes.

Digital PCR has been shown to be a possible surveillance tool for illnesses such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong L, Meng Y, Sui Z, Wang J, Wu L, Fu B | title = Comparison of four digital PCR platforms for accurate quantification of DNA copy number of a certified plasmid DNA reference material | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | issue = 13174 | pages = 13174 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26302947 | pmc = 4548226 | doi = 10.1038/srep13174 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogelstein and Kinzler developed a technology called [[BEAMing]] based on digital PCR (Beads, Emulsion, Amplification, Magnetics) and quantified KRAS mutations in stool DNA from colorectal cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vogelstein B, Kinzler KW | title = Digital PCR | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 16 | pages = 9236–41 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10430926 | pmc = 17763 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.16.9236 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pohl G, Shih I | title = Principle and applications of digital PCR | journal = Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14711348 | doi = 10.1586/14737159.4.1.41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FreeHand MusicPad Pro + Roland Fantom G8 (clipped).jpg|thumb|'''Digital sheet music''' used by &lt;br/&gt;[[Jordan Rudess]]&lt;br/&gt; (''FreeHand MusicPad Pro'')]]

'''Digital sheet music''' is technology for representing and displaying sheet music in a computer-readable format. With the emergence of several technological innovations, sheet music evolved in several stages into what was to be termed digital sheet music.

==Music Notation Software==
With the increased use of professional and personal computers during the 1980s, different programmers{{Who|date=January 2016}} started working on desktop publishing music notation software. Various boxed music notation software applications appeared on the market, allowing users to input and edit sheet music digitally. In the beginning, the software only permitted printing on paper. It took some time before other virtual formats became possible (e.g. standard [[MIDI]] file, audio (wav, [[MP3|mp3]]) and [[MusicXML]] export). These files allowed manipulation such as instrument changes, transposition and even MIDI playback. In particular, software projects [[Finale (software)|Finale]] and [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] grew to become successful commercial products and to define certain standards in digital music notation. Many free software projects also appeared (see [[list of scorewriters]]). Consequently, computer keyboard entry in combination with synthesizer keyboard entry became the most common method for music data entry in current digital use.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30204846?uid=3737592&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103426321863 |last=Bainbridge |first=D. |last2=Bell |first2=T. |year=2001 |title=The Challenge of Optical Music Recognition |journal=Computers and the Humanities |volume=35 |issue= |pages=95–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OMR==
[[Optical music recognition]] (OMR) is software to “read” scanned sheet music. Although OMR contributed to the evolution of digital sheet music, it is currently still a complex problem.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While the earliest attempts of OMR were made in the early 1970s, the first commercial products appeared in the early 90s. Currently, many commercial OMR tools are  available: SharpEye2, SmartScore, Photoscore, CapellaScan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1245321 |last1=Bellini |first1=P. |last2=Bruno |first2=I. |last3=Nesi |first3=P. |year=2007 |title=Assessing optical music recognition tools |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=68–93 |doi=10.1162/comj.2007.31.1.68}}&lt;/ref&gt; OMR can be simplified into four smaller tasks: staff line identification, musical object location, musical feature classification and musical semantics (Bainbridge &amp; Bell, 2001). However, in most cases,s these systems operate only properly with well-scanned documents of high quality. When it comes to precision and reliability, none of the commercial OMR systems solve the problem in a satisfactory way.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Especially since the tradition of notating music is quite diffuse and varied, it remains difficult to reduce its aesthetics to a few principles for a machine to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220961410_Musical_interaction_patterns_communicating_computer_music_knowledge_in_a_multidisciplinary_project |last1=Brandorff |first1=S. |last2=Lindholm |first2=M. |last3=Christensen |first3=H. B. |year=2005 |title=A tutorial on design patterns for music notation software |journal=Computer Music Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=42–54 |doi=10.1162/0148926054798179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New commercial possibilities==
With the emergence of electronic commerce in the 2000s, some traditional sheet publishers, as well as new entrants, developed online retailer websites to offer sheet music in an electronic manner. The first to offer the service online was Sheet Music Direct (1997) but quickly followed by MusicNotes and Sheet Music Score who were able to offer interactive features like transposition and change of instrument using scorch (Avid) technology. New comer [[Sheet Music Plus]] only recently (2011) entered the market, offering PDF files only. Those commercial services started as worldwide retailers with a large base of licensed sheet music and fast delivery, but progressively offered digital print, ranging from PDF-files to more dynamic offerings such as Scorch technology (Avid) which allowed for midi accompaniment, and on-the-fly change of keys and instruments. In addition, the popular use of digital sheet music required interchangeable digital formats. As such, [[MusicXML]] became a common format to share sheet music files between applications and to archive sheet music files for future use.

==Apps==
The digital revolution of the 2010s introduced widespread use of mobile networked devices, mobile telephony and tablet computers. Tablet computers, in particular, introduced new opportunities for digital sheet music through their usable digital display (IBISWorld, 2011, 2013). Consequently, many [[iOS]] and [[Android app]]s were introduced in the sheet music market, offering digital sheet music on various mobile platforms. The first generation viewers displayed [[PDF]]-files with features such as basic annotations, exportation of those annotations to other PDF readers and printing scores. PDFs are “static” files: you can read the music as it appears on the page, and you can only modify the notes by drawing digital ink markings or by typing text on the page (Hugh, 2013).

==Cloud-based Apps==
Most recently, the rise of cloud computing is further pushing the development of digital sheet music and enables creating and sharing written music online. A cloud-based application is immediately available on the web on any type of computer and does not need to be installed. [[HTML5]] in particular spurs cloud computing, allowing development of device independent web applications and making digital sheet music responsive and appropriate on large as well as on small screens. Cloud-based music notation applications facilitate the creation and sharing of written music. Additionally, other cloud-based applications focus more on the practice and consumption side of music learning. These latter cloud-based applications integrate audio-output such as playback with a variety of tempi (speeds) and with different instrumentation for multi-part scores and make the viewing and playing more interactive by adding personal annotations, automatic page turning, or set lists.

==Reading digital sheet music==

Overall, four factors appear to facilitate digital sheet reading: computer, content, containers and controllers (Hugh, 2013):
# Computer: depending on the musical work or performance, different form factors might facilitate the digital sheet music consumption
# Content: a choice of static content versus dynamic content, and a choice of open content versus proprietary content. 
# Containers: hardware accessories used to hold or mount your computer
# Controllers: hardware accessories that enable you to work with your digital sheet music in a variety of ways, ranging from digital pens to draw annotations, to pedals and other switches that allow you to turn the pages without using your hands.

[[File:Wolves Kill.jpg|thumb|right|320px|One wolf (right) asserting dominance over another (left) with a threat display – the teeth are bared, the ears are flattened against the body and the hackles are raised, whereas the submissive wolf lowers its head and turns away to appease the dominant individual.]]
'''Dominance in ethology''' is an "individual's preferential access to resources over another."&lt;ref&gt;Bland J. (2002) About Gender: Dominance and Male Behaviour http://www.gender.org.uk/about/10ethol/a4_mldom.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance in the context of [[biology]] and [[anthropology]] is the state of having high [[social status]] relative to one or more other individuals, who react [[submission|submissively]] to dominant individuals.  This enables the dominant individual to obtain access to resources such as food or potential mates at the expense of the submissive individual, without active aggression.  The absence or reduction of aggression means unnecessary energy expenditure and the risk of injury are reduced for both.  The opposite of dominance is [[Deference|submissiveness]].

Dominance may be a purely dyadic relationship, i.e. individual A is dominant over individual B, but this has no implications for whether either of these is dominant over a third individual C.  Alternatively, dominance may be hierarchical, with a [[transitive relation]]ship, so that if A dominates B and B dominates C, A always dominates C.  This is called a linear [[dominance hierarchy]].  Some animal societies have [[despotism|despots]], i.e. a single dominant individual with little or no hierarchical structure amongst the rest of the group. Horses use coalitions so that affiliated pairs in a herd have an accumulative dominance to displace a third horse that normally out-ranks both of them on an individual basis.&lt;ref name="Blackshaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/23945615/Ethology-Book| title=Notes on Some Topics in Applied Animal Behaviour by Judith Blackshaw.|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and maintenance==
Dominance may initially be established by fighting, or simply by threatening displays or interchanges.  Once established, however, dominance is usually maintained by agonistic (competitive) behaviours with aggression considerably reduced or sometimes absent.  In the maintenance of dominance relationships, the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal is critical.  If a dominant animal perceives its status is being threatened, it will likely threaten the sub-dominant individual.  The sub-dominant must then either escalate the intensity of the interaction to challenge the dominant, or defer.  In this way, it is often the behaviour of the sub-dominant animal that maintains the dominance relationship, rather than the dominant.

==Functions==

The ultimate function of a dominance hierarchy is to increase the [[Fitness (biology)|individual]] or [[inclusive fitness]] of the animals involved in its formation.  Fighting to acquire resources such as food and mates is expensive in terms of time, energy and the risk of injury.  By developing a dominance hierarchy, animals determine which individuals will get priority of access to resources, particularly when they are limited; there is a reduction in aggression once a pecking order has been developed.  Therefore, the proximate functions of a pecking order are to reduce the costs of time, energy and risk of injury incurred during resource acquisition and defense.

A dominant animal is one whose [[animal sexual behavior|sexual]], feeding, aggressive and other behavior patterns subsequently occur with relatively little influence of the other group members. Subordinate animals are opposite; their behavior can be relatively easily influenced or inhibited by other group members.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, J., Johnson, M., &amp; Koch, P. (1998). The nature and measurement of interpersonal dominance. (Volume 65 ed., Vol. Issue 4, pp. 308-335). Communication monograph. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/rcmm20.&lt;/ref&gt; For many animal societies, an individual's position in the dominance hierarchy corresponds with their opportunities to reproduce,&lt;ref&gt;Researchers from University of Washington publish findings in ethology. (2009, August 11). Science Letter, 1136. Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA205165916&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=utoronto_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&lt;/ref&gt; however, in other animal societies, the dominance hierarchy may be unrelated to (potential) opportunities to reproduce, e.g. [[naked mole-rat]], [[bees]] and many farm, laboratory, zoo and companion animals. Studies have shown there is a strong association between high testosterone levels and dominance behaviors that help enhance mating success in men.&lt;ref&gt;Slatcher, R., Mehta, P., &amp; Joseph, R. (2011). Testosterone and Self-Reported Dominance Interact to Influence Human Mating Behavior. ''Social Psychological and Personality Science'' 531-539.&lt;/ref&gt;

In hierarchical societies, dominant individuals may exert control over others.  For example, in a herd of feral goats it is a large male that is dominant and maintains discipline and coherence of the flock. He leads the group but shares leadership on a foraging expedition with an old she-goat who will normally outlast a succession of

Faber and Faber, London and Boston. p.66-85.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, earlier work showed that leadership orders in goats was not related to age or dominance.&lt;ref name="Stewart and Scott, (1947)"&gt;Stewart, J.C. and Scott, J.P. (1947). Lack of correlation between leadership and dominance relationships in a herd of goats. Journal Comparative Physiological Psychology, 40:255-264&lt;/ref&gt;

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definite study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"&gt;Squires, V.R. and Daws, G.T. (1975). Leadership and dominance relationships in Merino and Border Leicester sheep. Applied Animal Ethology, 1:263-274&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, dominant individuals will preferentially select higher perches to put themselves in the best position to detect and avoid predators, as well as to display their dominance to con-specifics.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Portugal, S.

It has been suggested, however, that more commonly, decision-taking about the actions of the group is dissociated from social dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, T.E. (1974).  The concept of social dominance.  ''Behavioral Biology, 11'', 131-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
The first published systematic study of dominance in animals was by [[Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe]] who described in his Ph.D. dissertation of 1921, the social behaviour and priority of access to food by [[Chicken|hens]].
&lt;ref name="Schjelderup-Ebbe, (1922)"&gt;Schjelderup-Ebbe, T. 1922. Beitrage zurSozialpsycholgie des Haushuhns. Zeitschrift Psychologie 88: 225-252. Reprinted in Benchmark Papers in Animal Behaviour/3. Ed. M.W.Schein. 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the [[colloquial]] term "[[pecking order]]"&lt;ref&gt;Porter G. Perrin (1955) 'Pecking Order' 1927-54 American Speech, 30(4):265-268&lt;/ref&gt; describing the hierarchical system of social organization in chickens, although it is sometimes loosely applied to other animals.

Dominance can be measured by the number of times that individuals defer to one another in social interactions, by the length of time that resources are preferentially accessed, by the number/intensity of threats given or other agonistic (competitive) behaviours.  The measurement of dominance is only applicable within the group it is measured since it is a function of the individual members of the group.

==Context dependency==
[[File:Vache herens.jpg|thumb|right|Eringer cattle competing for dominance.]]

Dominance and its organisation can be highly variable depending on the context or individuals involved.

In [[European badgers]], dominance relationships may vary with time as individuals age, gain or lose social status, or change their reproductive condition.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, S.E., Macdonald, D.W. and Dugdale, H.L. (2009). Context-dependent linear dominance hierarchies in social groups of European badgers, ''Meles meles''. Animal Behaviour, 77: 161-169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dominance may also vary across space in [[territory (animal)|territorial]] animals as territory owners are often dominant over all others in their own territory but submissive elsewhere, or dependent on the resource. Even with these factors held constant, perfect dominance hierarchies are rarely found in groups of any great size,&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; at least in the wild. Dominance hierarchies may be more frequently found in captivity, since hierarchies tend to be induced by focused resources such as limited supplies of food supplied in a fixed place.

Dominance hierarchies in small herds of domestic horses are generally linear hierarchies whereas in large herds the relationships are triangular.&lt;ref name="Houpt et al., (1978)"&gt;Houpt, K.A., Law, K. and Martinisi, V. (1978). Dominance hierarchies in domestic horses. Applied Animal Ethology, 4:273–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance hierarchies can be formed at a very early age. [[Domestic pig]]lets are highly [[wiktionary:precocious|precocious]] and within minutes of being born, or sometimes seconds, will attempt to suckle.  The piglets are born with sharp teeth and fight to develop a teat order as the [[anterior]] teats produce a greater quantity of milk. Once established, this [[Domestic pig#Teat order|teat order]] remains stable with each piglet tending to feed from a particular teat or group of teats.&lt;ref name="CluttonBrock, (1987)"&gt;Clutton-Brock, J., (1987). A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge pp.73-74&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominance–subordination relationships can vary markedly between breeds of the same species. Studies on [[Merino]]s and [[Border Leicester sheep|Border Leicesters]] revealed an almost linear hierarchy in the Merinos but a less rigid structure in the Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation was created.&lt;ref name="Squires and Daws, (1975)"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="984">In [[automotive engineering]], '''drawbar pull''' is the amount of horizontal force available to a vehicle at the [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] for [[acceleration|accelerating]] or pulling a load.

Drawbar pull is a function of [[velocity]], and in general decreases as the speed of the vehicle increases (due both to increasing resistance and decreasing [[transmission_(mechanics)|transmission]] [[gear ratio]]s).  Drawbar pull is the difference between [[tractive effort]] available and tractive effort required to overcome resistance at a specified speed.

Drawbar pull data for a vehicle is usually determined by measuring the amount of available [[tractive force]] using a [[dynamometer]], and then combining that data with coastdown&lt;ref&gt;SAE J1263, Road Load measurement and Dynamometer Simulation Using Coastdown Techniques, dated January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; data to obtain the available drawbar pull force at each speed.

{{Tanakh OT |Ketuvim |WP}}

'''Ecclesiastes ''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˌ|k|l|iː|z|i|ˈ|æ|s|t|iː|z}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἐκκλησιαστής, ''Ekklēsiastēs'', {{lang-he-n|קֹהֶלֶת}}, ''qōheleṯ'') is one of 24 books of the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]], where it is classified as one of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (or "Writings"). Originally written c. 450–200 BCE, it is also among the canonical [[Sapiential books|Wisdom Books]] in the [[Old Testament]] of most [[Christian denominations|denominations of Christianity]]. The title ''Ecclesiastes'' is a Latin [[transliteration]] of the Greek translation of the Hebrew '''Kohelet''', the [[pseudonym]] used by the author of the book.

In traditional Jewish texts, [[King Solomon]] is named as the author, although modern scholars reject this. Textually, the book is the musings of a King of Jerusalem as he relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, who is not named anywhere in the book, or in the whole of the Bible, introduces a "teacher" whom he identifies as the son of David (1:1). The author does not use his own "voice" throughout the book again until the final verses (12:9–14), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises what "the teacher" has spoken.

The teacher discusses the [[meaning of life]] and the best way to live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently ''[[wikt:הבל|hevel]]'', meaning "vain" or "futile", ("mere breath"), as both the wise and the foolish end their lives in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: "Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone" (12:13).

Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by [[Abraham Lincoln]] addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]] wrote:
{{quotation | "[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."{{sfn|Christianson|2007|p=70}} }}

==Structure==
Ecclesiastes is presented as biography of "Kohelet" (or "Qoheleth", meaning "Gatherer", but traditionally translated as "Teacher" or "Preacher"{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}}). Kohelet's story is framed by voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought. His journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete. The reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}}

Few of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvi}}
* Title (1:1)
* Initial poem (1:2–11)
* I: Kohelet's investigation of life (1:12–6:9)
* II: Kohelet's conclusions (6:10–11:6)
** Introduction (6:10–12)
** A: Man cannot discover what is good for him to do (7:1–8:17)
** B: Man does not know what will come after him (9:1–11:6)
* Concluding poem (11:7–12:8)
* Epilogue (12:9–14)
Verse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as "the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem."{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57–59}}

Most, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9–14) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xvii}}

==Summary==
The ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2–11 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow: Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.{{sfn|Longman|1998|pp=57–59}}

After the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=946–57}}

The frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The original ending of the book was probably the words: "The end of the matter" (12:13) but the text we have continues: "Fear God" (a phrase used often in Kohelet's speech) "and keep his commandments" (which he never uses), "for God will bring every deed to judgement."{{sfn|Seow|2007|pp=957–58}}

==Composition==

===Title, date and author===
The book takes its name from the Greek ''ekklesiastes'', a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: ''Kohelet'', meaning something like "one who convenes or addresses an assembly".{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|pp=124–25}} According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by [[Solomon]] in his old age.{{sfn|Brown|2011|p=11}} (An alternative tradition that "[[Hezekiah]] and his colleagues wrote [[Isaiah]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], the [[Song of Songs]] and Ecclesiastes" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah.){{sfn|Smith|2007|p=692}} Nevertheless, critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=x}}{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=50–52}} The presence of [[Old Persian|Persian]] loan-words and [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaisms]] points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE,{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when another Jewish writer, [[Ben Sira]], quotes from it.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiv}} The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] or the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of [[Hellenization]] (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450–330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence;{{sfn|Seow|2007|p=944}} those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330–180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|pp=54–55}}

Also unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet’s words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet’s parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of [[Uncle Remus]], although the description of the Teacher in 12:8–14 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} The question, however, has no theological importance,{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=48}} and one scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as "one more example of the [[fatalism|futility of human effort]]".{{sfn|Ingram|2006|p=45}}

===Genre and setting===
Ecclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=xiii}} It belongs to the category of [[wisdom literature]], the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings—other examples include the [[Book of Job]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], and some of the [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]]. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself.{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=721}} Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the [[deuterocanonical]] works, [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Sirach]], both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.

Wisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia.{{sfn|Fox|2004|pp=x–xi}} He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of [[Stoicism]], which held that all things are fated, and [[Epicureanism]], which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}

===Canonicity===
The presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon—a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people—are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced then was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Canon|date=1752|pages=601–04|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.did2222.0000.566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book which would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the [[Book of Job]]. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. "In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company," summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book ''The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes''{{sfn|Shields|2006|pp=1-5}}

==Themes==
Scholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes. Is it positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic?{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} Is Kohelet coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox? Is the ultimate message of the book to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors?{{sfn|Enns|2011|p=21}} At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he "doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doubt: A History|last=Hecht|first=Jennifer Michael|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-009795-0|location=New York|pages=75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself.{{sfn|Bartholomew|2009|p=17}} One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., "the dead are better off than the living" (4:2) vs. "a living dog is better off than a dead lion" (9:4)) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11–12:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.{{sfn|Brown|2011|pp=17–18}}

The subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase "under the sun" appears thirty times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign.{{sfn|Fox|2004|p=ix}} History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent ("Fear God"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.{{sfn|Gilbert|2009|p=125}}

==Judaism==
In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (by Yemenites, Italians, some [[Sepharadim]], and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the [[Shabbat]] of the Intermediate Days of [[Sukkot]] (by [[Ashkenazim]]). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of [[Sukkot]], even the Ashkenazim read it on [[Shemini Atzeret]] (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first [[Shabbat]] of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder to not get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless. When the listeners take this to heart, then true happiness can be achieved throughout the year.

The final poem of Kohelet ({{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|12:1–8|HE}}) has been interpreted in the [[Targum]], Talmud and [[Midrash]], and by the rabbis [[Rashi]], [[Rashbam]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra|ibn Ezra]], as an allegory of old age.

==Catholicism==
Ecclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] leaders. For example, [[doctors of the Church]] have cited Ecclesiastes. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] cited Ecclesiastes in Book XX of ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120120.htm The City of God, Book XX]. Accessed 2015-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Jerome]] wrote a commentary on Ecclesiastes.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, [http://www.paulistpress.com/Products/0601-1/66-st-jerome-commentary-on-ecclesiastes.aspx Commentary on Ecclesiastes]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] cited Ecclesiastes ("The number of fools is infinite.") in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/aquinas/summa/sum071.htm#FP_Q63_A9-p3.1 Summa Theologica]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twentieth-century Catholic theologian and cardinal-elect [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] discusses Ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, ''The Glory of the Lord''. He describes Qoheleth as "a [[transcendental idealism|critical transcendentalist]] ''avant la lettre''", whose God is distant from the world, and whose ''[[kairos]]'' is a "form of time which is itself empty of meaning". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the "final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Balthasar|first=Hans Urs|title=The Glory of the Lord. Volume VI: Theology: The Old Covenant|year=1991|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=Edinburgh|translator=Brian McNeil and Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis|pages=137–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book continues to be cited by recent [[pope]]s, including [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Pope Francis]]. Pope John Paul II, in his general audience of October 20, 2004, called the author of Ecclesiastes "an ancient biblical sage" whose description of death "makes frantic clinging to earthly things completely pointless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manhardt|first=Laurie|title=Come and See: Wisdom of the Bible|year=2009|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T6g1uStpp4kC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781931018555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis cited Ecclesiastes on his address on September 9, 2014. Speaking of vain people, he said, "How many Christians live for appearances? Their life seems like a [[soap bubble]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Francis, [http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/09/25/pope_francis_vain_christians_are_like_soap_bubbles/1107284 "Pope Francis: Vain Christians are like soap bubbles"]. Accessed 2015-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Western literature==
Ecclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as "eat, drink and be merry," "nothing new under the sun," "a time to be born and a time to die," and "vanity of vanities; all is [[vanity]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=E.D.|title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy|year=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAzOg4eQl2YC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=0618226478}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]] wrote: "[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound."{{sfn|Christianson|2007|p=70}}

'''Environmental consulting''' is often a form of [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] [[Consultant|consulting]], in which the consultant ensures that the client maintains an appropriate measure of compliance with [[environmental regulation]]s. There are many types of environmental consultants, but the two main groups are those who enter the field from the industry side, and those who enter the field from the [[environmentalist]] side.

Environmental consultants work in a very wide variety of fields. Whether it be providing [[construction]] services such as [[Asbestos]] Hazard Assessments or Lead Hazard Assessments or conducting due [[diligence]] reports for customers to rid them of possible sanctions. Consultancies may generalize across a wide range of disciplines or specialize in certain areas of environmental consultancy such as [[waste management]].

Environmental consultants usually have an [[undergraduate degree]] and sometimes even [[master's degree]] in [[Environmental Engineering]], [[Environmental Science]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[Geology]], or some other science discipline. They should have deep knowledge on environmental regulations, which they can advise particular clients in the private industry or public government institutions to help them steer clear of possible fines, legal action or misguided transactions.

Environmental consulting spans a wide spectrum of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in escrow in order to resolve the environmental impact.

With increasing numbers of construction, [[agriculture]], and scientific companies employing environmental consultancies, the industry can expect growth in the vicinity of 9.7 percent in 2008, amidst mounting public concern over [[environmental degradation]] and climate change. And while some companies are genuinely motivated by concern for the environment, for others, hiring consultants to appear to be "going green" has proven to be a useful marketing tool. Growing government funding into renewable energy and technologies producing low emissions is also helping growth, as organizations investing in research and development in these areas are often major employers of environmental consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-4/ The Recession List - Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl... (or growth together with growth inNorth A...)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

There are numerous areas in which environmental consultants might work (in no particular order):

'''Contaminated Land''' is one area as mentioned above. [[Contaminated land|Contaminated Land]] this may well involve a [[Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment]]

'''Energy''' may entail feasibility studies for renewable energy projects. For example, a study may attempt to answer the question: Would a micro-hydro-generation scheme pay for itself over the course of its operational life?

'''Geotechnical''' may also be covered by Environmental Consultants, this might include activities such as [[site investigation]]s, geotechnical engineering (foundation design, slope stability), and restoration [[quality assurance]].

'''Environmental Management Systems''' such as [[ISO 14001]] are large complicated systems that are often not implemented using internal man/woman power. This work is usually outsourced to consultants.

'''Green Claims''' Environmental Consultants may be employed to substantiate green claims, such as eco labels, which may involve work on supply chain or embodied carbon.

'''Compliance''' As governments become more and more environmental in their thinking, so does their legal framework. In the UK, businesses are covered by numerous pieces of legislation such as oil storage regulations and The Environment Act. If they are found to be in breach of these regulations they may face severe civil or criminal actions. Environmental Consultants can check to see that the business in question is in compliance with current legislation.

'''Impact Assessment''' see [[Environmental impact statement]]

'''[[Flood risk assessment|Flood Risk]]''', the most common of which may be a Phase 1 Screening Study.

'''[[Asbestos]] Management'''

'''[[Radon]]'''

'''Carbon''' there are various aspects of a company's carbon foot print that may be managed by consultants. They may have internal reduction strategies, or they may be tied in with national targets. Emissions trading is also an important aspect of Carbon Management.

'''Ethnocinema''', from [[Jean Rouch]]’s ''cine-ethnography'' and ''ethno-fictions'',&lt;ref&gt;Rouch, Jean. 2003. ''Cine-Ethnography''. Translated and edited by Steven Feld. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is an emerging practice of [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] filmmaking being defined and extended by [[Melbourne, Australia]]-based writer and arts educator, [[Anne Harris (educator)|Anne Harris]], and others. Originally derived from the discipline of [[anthropology]], ethnocinema is one form of ethnographic filmmaking that prioritises mutuality, collaboration and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Race and Refugeity: Ethnocinema as Radical Pedagogy" in ''Qualitative Inquiry'' (ERA=B) Nov 1, 2010:16, pp. 768-777. http://qix.sagepub.com/content/16/9/768.short&lt;/ref&gt; The practice's ethos claims that the role of anthropologists, and other cultural, media and educational researchers, must adapt to changing communities, transnational identities and new notions of representation for the 21st century.

Ethno-cinematographers have also been associated with American historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] who has asserted that “all ethnographic representations are partial truths”.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus, (eds). 1986. ''Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography''. Berkeley, CA: Univ of California Press., pg 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative ethnographic film and video projects are created with the intention of going beyond "preserving", "empowering" or "giving voice" to [[Marginalization|marginalised]] cultures, [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]], communities or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "‘You Could Do With A Little More Gucci’: Ethnographic Documentary Talks Back" in ''Creative Approaches to Research'', Vol 2:1, July 2009. Melbourne: RMIT Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; According to theorists, such voices already have [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and share community or agendas with ethnocinematic filmmakers. Ethnocinematic films primarily document "relationships"&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne and Nyuon, Nyadol: "Working It Both Ways: Intercultural Collaboration and the Performativity of Identity" ''The Australasian Review of African Studies'', Vol 31:1, June 2010. Pp 62-81. {{cite web |url=http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216144841/http://www.afsaap.org.au/ARAS/ARAS.htm |archivedate=2011-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; between filmmakers from different cultures, or subcultures, who now share common space of a [[Politics|political]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[Geography|geographical]] or [[Virtual world|virtual]] nature.
 
Ethno-cinematographers include [[Jean Rouch]], [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and, indigenous filmmakers such as Australian [[Essie Coffey]] who collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works.

== History ==

Tobing Rony identifies three modalities in early ethnographic representation&lt;ref&gt;Tobing Rony, Fatimah. 1996. ''The Third Eye: Race, Cinema and Ethnographic Spectacle''. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, pg 195.&lt;/ref&gt; including “ethnographic inscription” (Regnault), “taxidermic mode” (Flaherty’s ''Nanook''), and “self-reflexive” (Rouch’s films of the 1950s){{Clarify|date=July 2012}}. Of these, Rouch’s films are closest to being the forerunners of contemporary ethnocinema. Many film theorists and ethnohistorians have helped to define an evolving ethnographic film in the late 20th century, among them American [[Bill Nichols]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Bill. 1994. ''Blurred Boundaries: questions of meaning in contemporary culture''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema is typical{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} of a shift toward destabilizing traditional notions of representation, both in the West/North and in cultures and communities which had historically been the subjects of such films, and in which indigenous and diasporic peoples are taking control of their own representations, or working (as in ethnocinema) in intercultural collaboration. In addition to Rouch, this includes the work of such ethnographers and intercultural filmmakers as [[Trinh T. Minh-ha]],&lt;ref&gt;Minh-Ha, Trinh T, (ed) ''The Digital Film Event'', Routledge, New York, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harald Prins]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins. 2004. "Visual Anthropology". in ''A Companion to the Anthropology of American Indians'', edited by T. Bilosi. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. Pp 506-525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David MacDougall|David]] and [[Judith MacDougall]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David, ''Transcultural Cinema'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faye Ginsburg]], [[Timothy Asch]] and others.  More recently, indigenous filmmakers such as [[Essie Coffey]] (Australia) are collaborating interculturally to create ethnocinematic works. Working against the [[observational cinema]] tradition, these filmmakers are all acknowledging and deconstructing Minh-ha’s observation that “Everywhere we go, we become someone’s private zoo”,&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, T. (1996) "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist literary theory: a reader''. (ed.) Eagleton, Mary. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pg 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and theorists like Harris continue to draw on her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Anne | year = | title = Someone's Private Zoo: Ethnocinema and the Other | url = | journal = Qualitative Research Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 1| page = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of early attempts to define ethnocinema include the 1972 "ethnocinematic experiment" of Sol Worth and John Adair documented in "American Indians and the ethnocinematic complex: From native participation to production control",&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L. 1989. "American Indians and the Ethnocinematic Complex: From Native Participation to Production Control". in ''Eyes Across the Water'', edited by R. M. Boonzajer Flaes. Amsterdam: Het Spinhuis. Pp 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; in which seven co-participants of [[Navajo people|Navajo]] heritage were given video cameras and asked to make films which were ‘Indian’; these films, however, were framed by essentialising notions of Other and did not seek to go beyond the researcher/researched [[dichotomy]]. Tobing Rony (1996) and Sam Pack (2000) consider developments in Indigenous media in relation to the anthropological notion of “native authenticity”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pack | first1 = Sam | year = 2000 | title = Indigenous media then and now: Situating the Navajo film project | doi = 10.1080/10509200009361497 | journal = Quarterly Review of Film and Video | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 273–286 [274] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and why such essentialising notions are increasingly irrelevant in the 21st century’s ethnocinematic context. Yet the ability to truly collaborate in ethnographic research remains a contentious notion in anthropological and other circles, as ethnographic documentary scholar [[Jay Ruby]] asserts; what he calls ''Ethnographic Cinema'' must, he claims “be the work of academically educated and academically employed socio-cultural anthropologists”.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, J. ''Ethnographic Cinema (EC) - A Manifesto / A Provocation''  (n.d.)   {{cite web |url=http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195720/http://astro.ocis.temple.edu/~ruby/manifesto.html |archivedate=2008-07-08 |df= }}. (Retrieved on: 17 May 2009), para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; By Ruby’s reckoning, what is emerging as ethnocinema has almost nothing to do with ethnographic films. By this definition, even Jean Rouch doesn’t qualify.

Conversely, Rouch encouraged the potential of ethnographic film as a “celebration of a relationship” between filmmaker and imaged, in which the “rapport and participation”&lt;ref&gt;Rouch 2003, pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; between both parties enhances any end-product that is collectively achieved. Loizos’s{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} claim (like Ruby’s) that contemporary filmmakers blur the lines between "authentic" ethnography and general [[documentary]] seems increasingly out of place. Traditional ethnographic filmmaking as a tool of anthropological researchers seeking to bring the stories of “distant peoples to audiences in North America and Europe”&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Karl G. 2006. ''Ethnographic Film''. Austin: University of Texas Press, pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly outmoded in a culture of [[YouTube]] and [[social networking]] sites screaming for video content.{{Why|date=July 2012}}

=== Toward a contemporary ethnocinema: some contradictions ===
The confusion continues. By 2006, there are still scant references to ethnocinema and they frequently conflict. One online [[blog]] characterises a Burmese festival as “a surrealist anti-documentary, with no voice-over, odd visual juxtapositions, and none of the quasi-academic tone that afflicts so much ''official ethno cinema''”.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. 2006. "Burmese Daze". Originally published in ''The Strange Attractor Journal'', No. 4. http://www.techgnosis.com/chunkshow-single.php?chunk=chunkfrom-2007-04-01-1746-0.txt. (Retrieved on: 19 September 2009), para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  An abstract for an academic paper on the ritual branding of [[Andean cattle]] in [[Peru]] refers to the paper as an “ethnocinematographical study in which we reinterpret, with and in the film” the acts which they have recorded filmically, using the video cameras as “observation instruments”,&lt;ref&gt;Reyna, Carlos. 2005. ''Cinema e Antropologia: Novos diálogos metodológicos na interpretação de um ritual andino''. Biblioteca online de ciências da comunicação. http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/reyna-carlos-cinema-antropologia.pdf. (Retrieved on: 10 September 2009), pg 1.&lt;/ref&gt; none of which characterizes contemporary ethnocinematic work.

Several recent European [[film festival]]s list among their offerings the category of ethnocinema, without giving examples or defining the term. Still other contemporary film festivals appear to use the terms ''ethnographic'' and ''ethnocinematic'' interchangeably, which only adds to the confusion. In 2001, ''Notes From the Underground'', [[Goran Gocić]]’s insider look at the filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], appeared in which he discusses what he alternatively calls ''ethno-cinema'' and then just "''ethno''". A ''[[Modern Language Association Review]]'' article opined, "The appeal of Kusturica's films … is that of "ethno" cinema, a cinema rooted in local traditions but expressed in "Western" form. This liberal political engagement with exotic subject matter is nonetheless, argues Gocić, an empowerment of the marginal."&lt;ref&gt;Haymes, Peter. 2004. "Review of ''Notes from the Underground: The Cinema of Emir Kusturica''". ''The Modern Language Review'', January. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7026/is_1_99/ai_n28245389/. (Retrieved on: 9 September 2009), pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

and from a far less favourable online book review:
he invests considerably more time to embracing instead his own recurring but vague references to 'ethno-cinema' as a base context from which Kusturica is operating (and by which Gocic seems to mean to have it both ways: indulging in [[exoticism]] and critiquing others' supposed essentializing). The only specific examples he offers to define this category are a handful of big budget Hollywood films involving Native Americans.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl, Brian Bernard. 2004. "Capturing Kusturica: On Gocić’s ''The Cinema of Kusturica''", ''Film Philosophy'', vol. 8, no. 12, 2004, para 24. http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol8-2004/n12karl. (Retrieved on: 20 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gocić himself says that, “inside film history itself, ethno cinema is the most exciting cinematic concept that the world has had to offer in the past two decades: aesthetically, it is difficult to argue against”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, Goran. 2001. ''The Cinema of Emir Kusturica: Notes from the Underground''. London: Wallflower Press, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, throughout the text his attempts to define ethnocinema contradict and obscure any practical working definition.  Gocić identifies "ethno" as having been around since the 1950s and as being typified by a sense of the “local”, including local motifs, but frequently made for a Western audience.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, only nine pages later he locates the birth of "ethno cinema" “in the late 1970s and early 1980s solely judging by the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] winners, which were Italian at the end of the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gocić does attempt to characterise and define his version of ''ethno cinema'' with the following: “nostalgia,” (as a search for the “‘lost ‘authenticity’ of primitivism”), “intertextuality, openness and subjectivity (as postmodern characteristics), incredulity (or denial of ideology), and ‘double coding' or unexpected, surrealist, incongruous elements”.&lt;ref&gt;Gocić, 2001, pg 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnocinema, then, suggests that the voices/images of "women/natives/others"&lt;ref&gt;Minh-ha, Trinh T. 1996. "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism". in ''Feminist Literary Theory: A Reader'', edited by M. Eagleton. Cambridge MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; have something in common, and have agency in contributing to ethnographic film, whether independently or collaboratively, interculturally or intra-culturally. Current attempts to offer a working definition of ethnocinema may share more with the more recent movement of intercultural cinema which emerged around 1990. [[Laura Marks]] identifies this emergence as connected to three main factors: “the rise of multiculturalism … availability of funding … and an intellectual climate characterised by the disintegration of master narratives and a growing conceptualisation of knowledge as partial and contested”.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Laura U. 2000. ''The skin of the film: intercultural cinema, embodiment, and the senses''. Durham NC: Duke University Press, pg 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whatever its filmic and academic antecedents, ethnocinema is emerging, and – as Rouch has repeatedly shown us – "the other cannot be denied" as his/her image and means of production transforms.

In ethnocinema there is the belief that in the relationship which emerges through the shared project, both self and Other are understood and represented in newly constructed ways.  One way of disrupting traditional ethnographic documentary [[voyeurism]] is in making transparent the intercultural relationship normally shrouded behind the scenes. [[Gwendolyn A. Foster|Foster’s]] contention that controlling the means of production is "foregrounding subjectivity",&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Gwendolyn A. 1997. ''Women Filmmakers of the African and Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity''. Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is limited.  It presumes a one-way relationship between the content and construction of all ethnographic films (including ethnocinematic ones), and assumes that by creating the films the subject is empowered and the gaze is recast.  It ignores the complex relationship between reception and production, and classifies films created by marginalised filmmakers as more authentic, or even automatically transgressive in a dominant culture.   This cannot be assumed, either in content or reception.  We have moved well beyond [[orientalism]] and the temporary inability of the Other to represent her or himself, so that "they must therefore be represented by others",&lt;ref&gt;Said, E. 2000. ''Reflections on exile and other essays''. Boston: Harvard University Press, pg 206.&lt;/ref&gt; but similarly it cannot be assumed that self-representation is automatically "authentic" or an end in itself. In ethnocinema, relationship and process always take precedence over formal considerations.  Obviously, to achieve a wide viewing audience, formal concerns cannot be completely ignored, but these aesthetic concerns are addressed ''together'' in the co-creation of the films. In ethnocinema, there is no perception of a conflict between its ethnographic and [[popular culture]] characteristics. It remains ethnographic because it is grounded in cultural specificity, which is not essentialist and can be always-changing.  It does not seek to "document" a culture, as in ethnocinema culture is understood to be varied, diverse and always emerging.

=== Ethnocinema: new directions ===

In ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology'', Ruby calls for places where “critical standards are debated and canons develop”,&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2000. ''Picturing Culture: Explorations of Film and Anthropology''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pg 23. Original edition, 1975 article.&lt;/ref&gt; and the need for ethnographic filmmakers to generate a set of critical standards analogous to those for written ethnographies. Harris agrees, and says that standards are needed, but diverges from Ruby’s definition in two important ways: firstly as a call to ethnocinematic filmmakers (whether academic or non-academic) that films included in this category must prioritise a post-colonial collaborative relationship between makers and imaged; and secondly, that Ruby’s so-called “marketplace considerations”&lt;ref&gt;Ruby 2000, pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt; need not pollute the product which is made. Ruby proposed in 2008 that “anthropologists should simply relinquish the term ethnographic to professional documentary filmmakers and seek another term to characterize their efforts”;&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Jay. 2008. "Towards an Anthropological Cinema": a talk given at the 2008 Nordic Anthropological Film Association Meetings in Ísafjörur, Iceland, June 6, 2008 (pg 3). www.media-anthropology.net/ruby_anthrocinema.pdf. (Retrieved on 10 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; while Harris proposes that ethnographic is being superseded by ''ethnocinematic'' filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Anne. "Too Tall, Too Dark, Too Something: New Racism in Australian Schools" in ''Trauma, Media, Art: New Perspectives'' (Eds) Broderick, M &amp; Traverso, A.  Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4438-2283-3}}, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Money Week (GMW)''' is a global money awareness celebration that takes place in March every year.&lt;ref name="newsandevents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=Global Money Week|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is coordinated by the [[Child and Youth Finance International]] (CYFI) Secretariat to raise awareness on [[Economic Citizenship]] and directly engage children and youth worldwide on the issue. The celebration of Global Money Week consists of a series of activities held at the regional, national and local level by the partners and stakeholders of the Child and Youth Finance Movement, and are geared toward engaging children, youth and their communities in learning about financial education and financial inclusion.&lt;ref name="newsandevents" /&gt;

According to the Global Money Week website, “GMW is an annual global celebration, initiated by Child &amp; Youth Finance International (CYFI), with local and regional events and activities aimed at inspiring children and youth to learn about money, saving, creating livelihoods, gaining employment and becoming an entrepreneur.” &lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalmoneyweek.org/about/about-global-money-week.html|title=About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GMW in previous years==
In 2013, GMW involved approximately 1 million children in 80 countries ranging across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Over 1000 activities were organized by 403 organizations, such as NGOs, central banks, Ministries of Finance, corporations and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/global_money_week_report_2013/1?e=7128000/2518812|title=Global Money Week Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Childfinanceinternational.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMW 2014 saw the participation of 3 million children, 118 countries, over 2000 activities and 490 organizations involved in the theme of enterprise: among those, central banks, governmental bodies, educational institutions.&lt;ref name="globalmoneyweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalmoneyweek.org/civil-society |title=Civil Society |publisher=Globalmoneyweek.org |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 event saw a number of multi-sectoral organizations working together for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/2014_gmw_report_2014_8589ec3f401824|title=Global Money Week Report 2014|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ISSUU.com|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During GMW 2015 the theme was, “Save Today, Safe Tomorrow.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2015/1?e=7128000/14165258|title=Global Money Week Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|format=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 5.6 million children &amp; youth took part in the celebrations in 124 countries.

In 2016, GMW expanded even further, reaching over 7 million children and young people across 132 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/childfinanceinternational/docs/gmw_report_2016/1?e=7128000/38177764|title=Global Money Week Report 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ever increasing number of countries and organizations were involved in supporting the millions of young people taking part in money awareness, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship activities during the 2016 Global Money Week celebrations, which focused on the theme 'Take Part, Save Smart'.

The 2017 edition of GMW will take place from 27 March - 2 April, with the theme 'Learn Save Earn':
* Learn: Educating children and young people about their social and economic rights and responsibilities is key to creating a generation of capable adults who can make wise decisions for their future
* Save: It is important for children and youth to build clever savings habits from an early age in order to cultivate key money-managing skills for later in life
* Earn: Developing livelihoods skills or receiving entrepreneurial training supports children and young people with getting a job or building their own business and developing their careers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].

Homeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes.  Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for.  Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

The '''Institute for Astronomy''' ('''IfA''') is a research unit within the [[University of Hawaii]] system, led by Robert McLaren as Acting Director. IfA main headquarters are located at 2680 Woodlawn Drive in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], {{coord| 21|18|27|N| 157|48|41|W| type:landmark_region:US-HI |display=inline, title}}, adjacent to the [[University of Hawaii at Mānoa]] campus. Additional facilities are located at [[Pukalani, Hawaii|Pukalani]], [[Maui]] and [[Hilo]] on [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i island]] (the Big Island). IfA employs over 150 astronomers and support staff. IfA astronomers perform research into Solar System objects, stars, galaxies and [[cosmology]].

The Institute for Astronomy was founded in 1967 to conduct research and to manage the observatory complexes at [[Haleakalā]], Maui and the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] on the summit of [[Mauna Kea]]. It has approximately 55 faculty and employs over 300 people.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/ifa2/about_ifa.shtml |title=About the Institute for Astronomy |publisher=Institute for Astronomy-University of Hawaii |accessdate=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''invasive species''' is a species that is not native to a specific location (an [[introduced species]]), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecosystem Consequences of Biological Invasions |author=Joan G.

The term is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for [[noxious weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kudzu|kudzu vine]] (''Pueraria lobata''), [[Cortaderia jubata|Andean pampas grass]] (''Cortaderia jubata''), and [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis'') are examples.

Dispersal and subsequent proliferation of species is not solely an anthropogenic phenomenon. There are many mechanisms by which species from all Kingdoms have been able to travel across continents in short periods of time such as via floating rafts, or on wind currents. Charles Darwin performed many experiments to better understand long distance seed dispersal, and was able to germinate seeds from insect frass, faeces of waterfowl, dirt clods on the feet of birds, all of which may have traveled significant distances under their own power, or be blown off course by thousands of miles.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions is a natural phenomenon, which has likely been accelerated via hominid-assisted migration although this has not been adequately directly measured.

The definition of "native" is controversial in that there is no way to precisely determine nativity. For example, the ancestors of Equus ferus (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in 1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

==Causes==
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that, when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species based mechanisms===
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete [[native species]]. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.

Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.&lt;ref name="kolar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |author2=D.M.

Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high [[propagule pressure]]).&lt;ref name="verl"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |author2=G.M.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as [[nutrient]]s, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[predation]], then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as [[zero-sum]] systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such [[unilateral]] competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.&lt;ref name="stoh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |author2= D.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long [[taproot]], or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (''[[Aegilops triuncialis]]'') was introduced to [[California]] on [[serpentine soil]]s, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high [[magnesium]]/[[calcium]] ratio, and possible [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |author2=S.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying [[abiotic]] factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Kalanchoe daigremontana]]'', produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic compounds]], that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="HERRERAFERRER-PARIS2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERRERA|first1=Ileana|last2=FERRER-PARIS|first2=José R.|last3=BENZO|first3=Diana|last4=FLORES|first4=Saúl|last5=GARCÍA|first5=Belkis|last6=NASSAR|first6=Jafet M.|title=An Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone|journal=Pedosphere|volume=28|issue=4|year=2018|pages=632–643|issn=1002-0160|doi=10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species like ''[[Stapelia gigantea]]'' [[ecological facilitation|facilitates]] the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Ileana|last2=Ferrer-Paris|first2=José R.|last3=Hernández-Rosas|first3=José I.|last4=Nassar|first4=Jafet M.|title=Impact of two invasive succulents on native-seedling recruitment in Neotropical arid environments|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=2016|volume=132|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.04.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301927334|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'' (yellow starthistle) and ''Centaurea diffusa'' ([[diffuse knapweed]]). These [[Eastern Europe]]an [[noxious weed]]s have spread through the [[Western United States|western]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast states]]. Experiments show that [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], a chemical produced at the root of ''C. diffusa'', has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. ''C. diffusa'' and ''C. solstitialis'' do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |author2=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |last2=Bais |first2=H.P. |last3=Stermitz |first3=F.R. |last4=Thelen |first4=G.C. |last5=Callaway |first5=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry [[detritus]] during the fire season in western North America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing ''B. tectorum'' to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt; |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=42480&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, [[zebra mussel]]s increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which [[invertebrate]]s live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]], increases the density and diversity of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrate communities.&lt;ref name="silv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |last2=Patterson |first2=B.A. |last3=Schlosser |first3=D. |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===
In [[ecosystem]]s, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When changes such as a [[forest fire]] occur, normal succession favors native [[grass]]es and [[forb]]s. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are often the limiting factors in these situations.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |last2=Grime |first2=J.P. |last3=Thompson |first3=K. |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every species occupies a ''[[Ecological niche|niche]]'' in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=Fath|first=Brian D.|publisher=Elsevier Science; 1 edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0444520333|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type can be found within the ''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'' species of skink.

Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, [[edge effect]]s describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alverson|first=William S.|last2=Waller|first2=Donald M.|last3=Solheim|first3=Stephen L.|date=1988|title=Forests Too Deer: Edge Effects in Northern Wisconsin|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00199.x|jstor=2386294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments.

Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment.

Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment.

This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.

==Ecology==
===Traits of invaded ecosystems===
In 1958, Charles S. Elton&lt;ref name="elton"&gt;{{cite book |last= Elton|first=C.S. |others=Foreword by Daniel Simberloff |title=The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants |origyear=1958 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-20638-7 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that ecosystems with higher [[species diversity]] were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches. Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |last2=Binkley |first2=D. |last3=Chong |first3=G.W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=M.A. |last5=Schell |first5=L.D. |last6=Bull |first6=K.A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Y. |last8=Newman |first8=G. |last9=Bashkin |first9=M. |last10=Son |first10=Y. |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate hinged on the [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scale]] at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |author2=E.G.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.&lt;ref name="tilm"/&gt;

===Vectors===
Non-native species have many ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s'', including biogenic vectors,&lt;!--what is a biogenic vector?--&gt; but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural [[Range (biology)|range]] extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |author2=T.M.

An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the [[Pacific rat]] (''Rattus exulans'') to Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matisoo-Smith |first=E. |author2=R.M.

[[File:EriocheirSinensis1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis'')]]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for [[horticulture]]. The [[pet trade]] moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.

The arrival of invasive [[propagule]]s to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |author2=N.E. Mandrak  |year=2007 |title= The risk of establishment of aquatic invasive species: joining invasibility and propagule pressure |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274 |pages=2733–2739|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2007.0841 |pmid=17711834 |issue=1625 |pmc=2275890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home," American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles. [[Agricultural Research Service]] entomologists identified them as [[rhinoceros beetle]], [[hercules beetle]], and [[Phalacrognathus muelleri|king stag beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems.&lt;!--were they actually invasive or just non-native?--&gt; To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] programs such as [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance]] (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be harmful to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zavaleta|first1=Erika|last2=Hobbs|first2=Richard|last3=Mooney|first3=Harold|title=Viewing invasive species removal in a whole-ecosystem context|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=August 2001|volume=16|issue=8|page=458|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Zavaleta_etal_2001.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable [[Chinese mitten crab]] is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Pollution and Climate Change|last=Seinfeld|first=John H.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==== Within the Aquatic Environment ====
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar|first=Jennifer L|last2=Gamboa|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Revenga|first3=Carmen|last4=Spalding|first4=Mark D|date=2008|title=Assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=485–492|doi=10.1890/070064|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1010 Discharging ballast water.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship de-ballasting]]
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls. Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=John|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Aquatic Invasions|volume=2|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.2.7|issn=1818-5487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/24305557/biofouling-moves-up-the-regulatory-agenda.|title=Biofouling moves up the regulatory agenda - GARD|website=www.gard.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is ballast water. [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Invasive species#cite%20note-MolnarGamboa2008-43|[47]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Xu|first=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|date=2014-08-24|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623330.2623364|publisher=ACM|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364|isbn=9781450329569}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Streftaris|first=N|last2=Zenetos|first2=Argyro|last3=Papathanassiou|first3=Enangelos|date=2005|title=Globalisation in marine ecosystems: The story of non-indigenous marine species across European seas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253862066|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=43|pages=419–453|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their new environment. For example, freshwater [[zebra mussel]]s, native to the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov seas]], most likely reached the [[Great Lakes]] via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached the [[St. Lawrence Seaway|Seaway]] were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98880204.html/|title=Noxious cargo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current regulations for the Great Lakes rely on ‘salinity shock’ to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/5ps/NVIC/2018/NVIC-01_18.pdf|title=Ballast Water Management for Control of Non-Indigenous Species in Waters of the United States|last=USCG|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually, only one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid, a neurotoxin. If toxic ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' spp. are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their “new environment” they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish, marine mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trainer|first=Vera L.|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen S.|last3=Lundholm|first3=Nina|last4=Thessen|first4=Anne E.|last5=Cochlan|first5=William P.|last6=Adams|first6=Nicolaus G.|last7=Trick|first7=Charles G.|date=2012|title=Pseudo-nitzschia physiological ecology, phylogeny, toxicity, monitoring and impacts on ecosystem health|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=14|pages=271–300|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2011.10.025|issn=1568-9883|hdl=1912/5118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton.

Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role of environmental changes associated with climate change, such as an increase in ocean temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Occhipinti-Ambrogi|first=Anna|date=2007|title=Global change and marine communities: Alien species and climate change|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=55|issue=7–9|pages=342–352|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.014|pmid=17239404|issn=0025-326X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahel|first=Frank J.|last2=Olden|first2=Julian D.|date=2008|title=Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge. For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=J.|last2=Hwang|first2=W.H.|date=2012|title=Effects of voyage routing on the survival of microbes in ballast water|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=42|pages=165–175|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.01.013|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further examine the effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Mark|last2=Ahmed|first2=Yasser|last3=Canning-Clode|first3=João|last4=Díaz|first4=Eliecer|last5=Eichhorn|first5=Sandra|last6=Fabritzek|first6=Armin G.|last7=da Gama|first7=Bernardo A.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of “hijackers” on ships’ hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.

===Impacts of wildfire and firefighting===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"/&gt;  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"/&gt;

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Effects==
[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]

===Ecological===
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in Hawaii (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |author2=D.

===Geomorphological===
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion.  While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |author2=J.

===Economic===
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area. For example, in the Great Lakes Region the [[sea lamprey]] is an invasive species that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host organism. However, in the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-18  month feeding period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glfc.org/sea-lamprey.php|title=Great Lakes Fishery Commission - Sea Lamprey|website=www.glfc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the population of some economy dependent species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Economic opportunities====
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, [[silver carp]] and [[common carp]] can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product, or processed into [[pet food]]s, or [[mink]] feed. [[Water hyacinth]] can be turned into fuel by [[methane digesters]],&lt;ref name = wolv&gt;''Energy from vascular plant wastewater treatment systems – Eichhornia crassipes, Spirodela lemna, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Pueraria lobata, [[biomass]] harvested for fuel production''.

Duke.&lt;/ref&gt; and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of [[bioenergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomass of invasive plant species as a potential feedstock for bioenergy production|first1=Koenraad|last1=Van Meerbeek|first2=Lise|last2=Appels|first3=Raf|last3=Dewil|first4=Annelies|last4=Calmeyn|first5=Pieter|last5=Lemmens|first6=Bart|last6=Muys|first7=Martin|last7=Hermy|date=1 May 2015|journal=Biofuels, Bioprod.

=====Benefits=====
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases. Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody plant, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored. The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species. Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the Aldabra giant tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services. There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American Honey bee was introduced in the rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of non-native species to control agricultural pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHLAEPFER|first=MARTIN A.|last2=SAX|first2=DOV F.|last3=OLDEN|first3=JULIAN D.|date=2011-02-22|title=The Potential Conservation Value of Non-Native Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01646.x|pmid=21342267|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-native species can have other benefits. [[Chesapeake Bay#Depletion of oysters|Asian oysters]], for example, filter water pollutants better than native{{clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012}} oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this [[mollusk]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pelton, ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- does the asian threaten the local?--&gt; Additionally, some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment, a term referred to as [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]]. For example, ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium|L. leucozonium]]'', shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-09-12|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 1964518|pmid = 17848999|volume = 2|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000868|first = Amro|last = Zayed|first2 = Şerban A.|last2 = Constantin|first3 = Laurence|last3 = Packer|pages=e868}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become an important pollinator of [[Rubus|caneberry]] as well as [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]], [[apple trees]], and blueberry bushes.&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee.

=====Invasivorism=====
''See also [[:Category:Edible invasive species]]''

Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients. [[Miya's]] of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] created the first invasive species menu in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invasive-species-menu-of-a-world-class-chef/|title=Invasive Species Menu of a World-Class Chef|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=3|pages=40–43|date=September 1, 2013|author= Bun Lai |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0913-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2015/feb/06/cooking-cant-solve-the-invasive-threat|title=Cooking can't solve the threat of invasive species|author=Emma Bryce|date=6 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida]]
Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the [[Dodo]] bird, the [[Caribbean monk seal]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. Proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of [[lionfish]] by encouraging the consumption of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/invasive-lionfish-kings-caribbean-may-met-match-011600208.html|title=Invasive Lionfish, the Kings of the Caribbean, May Have Met Their Match|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costs====
Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="pimental"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |last2= R. |first2= Zuniga  |last3= Morrison |first3= D |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.&lt;ref name="simb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of [[ecosystem services]], costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan.|last=|first=|publisher=National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC.|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant industry====
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see [[dynamic accumulator]]) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., [[yellow starthistle]]). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by [[Western honeybee|honey bees]] infected by the invasive [[varroa mite]]. Introduced rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]'' and ''[[Rattus norvegicus|R. norvegicus]]'') have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Citrus Greening."

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquaculture====
[[Aquaculture]] is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., ''[[Oreochromis niloticus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |author2=O.

====Forestry====

[[File:Firewoodposter white web.pdf|thumb|right|Poster asking campers to not move firewood around, avoiding the spread of invasive species.]]
The unintentional introduction of forest pest species and plant pathogens can change [[forest ecology]] and damage the timber industry.

The Asian long-horned beetle (''[[Anoplophora glabripennis]]'') was first introduced into the U.S. in 1996, and was expected to infect and damage millions of acres of hardwood trees.

====Tourism and recreation====
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1614/WS-04-022R |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds".

===Health===
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and [[tsetse fly]] pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions.

For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global [[biodiversity loss]] and is increasing because of tourism and [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated [[fresh water]] systems, though [[quarantine]]s and [[ballast water]] rules have improved the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] exclusion, [[Ecological niche|niche]] displacement, or [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odendaal | first1 = L.

Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the potential risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of diversity and discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing; 1st Unabridged edition|date=March 1, 2013|isbn=978-1443844536|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, ''Spartina alterniflora'' was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native ''Spartina foliosa.'' The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in [[introgression]] that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12469817|title=Anttila CK, King RA, Ferris C, Ayres DR, Strong DR.

== Invasive exotic diseases ==
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of [[smallpox]] into the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the Spanish, where it obliterated entire [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|populations of indigenous civilizations]] before they were ever even seen by Europeans.

Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the [[chestnut blight]] which has almost eliminated the [[American chestnut]] tree from its forest habitat.  Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.

Another example is the [[Dutch elm disease]], which has severely reduced the [[American elm]] trees in forests and cities.

Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]] and the bacterial disease [[Citrus greening disease|citrus greening]].&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Pest Alert: Citrus Greening." Clemson University Invasive Species Program. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/Pest%20Alerts/citrus_greening.html. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in recent years some argue that some introduced species may have a positive ecological impact on an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211095555.htm|title=Invasive plants can create positive ecological change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of [[ecology]] and [[geography]] where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Martha F. Hoopes |author3=Michael P. Marchetti |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology".&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on [[biogeography]] rather than on [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |author2=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

=== Introduced species on islands ===
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].

An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.

The field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Invasive species in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] the largest commercial crop is ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', the [[California native plants|native Californian]] Monterey pine tree, which grows as well in New Zealand as in [[California]]. However, the pine forests are also occupied by [[deer]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. They are exotic species and have thrived in the New Zealand environment. The pines are seen as beneficial while the deer are regarded as serious pests.

Common [[gorse]], originally a hedge plant in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], was introduced to New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.

[[Rabbit]]s, introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island. The [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] was illegally imported and illegally released, but it had little lasting effect upon the rabbit population other than to make it more resistant to the virus.

Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand birds are flightless. Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including natives.

[[Sparrows]], which were brought to control insects upon the introduced [[grain]] crops, have displaced native birds as have [[rainbow lorikeet]]s and [[cockatoos]] (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of [[Auckland]] City such as the [[Waitakere Ranges]].

In much of New Zealand, the Australian [[black swan]] has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced [[mute swan]].

Two notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the [[white tail spider]] and the [[redback spider]]. Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit. Until then,  the only spider (and the only venomous animal) dangerous to humans was the native [[katipo]], which is very similar to the redback and  interbreed with the more aggressive Australian variety.

==== South Georgia Island ====

In 2018, the [[South Georgia Island]] was declared free of invasive [[rodent]]s after a multi-year extermination effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/rat-begone-record-eradication-effort-rids-sub-antarctic-island-invasive-rodents|title=Rat begone: Record eradication effort rids sub-Antarctic island of invasive rodents|last=Warren|first=Matt|date=2018-05-08|work=Science|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-exterminate-rats-on-an-island&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical symbols''' are the marks and symbols, used since about the 13th century in the [[musical notation]] of musical scores, styles, and instruments to describe [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], [[tempo]] and, to some degree, its [[articulation (music)|articulation]] (a composition in its fundamentals).

==Lines==
{| style="vertical-align: middle     ;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word "stave" is often used.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''&lt;br /&gt; These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"|&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''&lt;br /&gt;These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]].  Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as keyboard, harp, and conductor scores, but are omitted for other types of music, such as vocal scores.
|-
| width=12.5%''' | [[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]

|'''Bracket'''&lt;br /&gt;Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously.  In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).

== Clefs ==
{{main|Clef}}
Clefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''&lt;br /&gt;The centre of the spiral defines the line on which it rests as the pitch G above middle C.&lt;ref name=Gerou1996&gt;{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |location=USA |publisher=Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. |isbn=0-88284-768-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positioned here, it assigns G above middle C to the ''second line from the bottom'' of the staff, and is referred to as the "treble clef". This is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. The shape of the clef comes from a stylised upper-case-G.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''&lt;br /&gt;These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the "alto clef". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a "movable" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a "tenor clef". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.&lt;br /&gt; Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]
|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''&lt;br /&gt;The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.&lt;ref name=Gerou1996/&gt; Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a "bass clef". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here.  In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.  The shape of the clef comes from a stylised upper-case-F (which used to be written the reverse of the modern F)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]
|'''Neutral clef'''&lt;br /&gt;Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.

| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]
|'''Octave clef'''&lt;br /&gt;Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]
|'''Tablature'''&lt;br /&gt;For stringed instruments it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.

== Notes and rests ==

{{main|Note value}}
[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values. The whole note is the reference value, and the other notes are named (in American usage) in comparison; i.e., a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a whole note.

| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-beam.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Beam (music)|Beamed notes]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Beams connect eighth notes (quavers) and notes of shorter value and are equivalent in value to flags. In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text – [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Dotted note]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' × (2 − 2&lt;sup&gt;''−n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Ghost note.png]]

|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation. Also called ''gathered rest'' or ''multi-bar rest''.
|}

Durations shorter than the 64th are rare but not unknown. [[Hundred twenty-eighth note|128th notes]] are used by many composers, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]; [[256th note]]s occur in works by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven. An extreme case is the Toccata Grande Cromatica by early-19th-century American composer [[Anthony Philip Heinrich]], which uses note values as short as 2,048ths; however, the context shows clearly that these notes have one beam more than intended, so they should really be 1,024th notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm |title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation |last=Byrd |first=Donald |date=16 December 2014 |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of very short notes can be formed as {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 2&lt;/sup&gt;th}} note, where ''n'' is the number of flags on the note.

== Breaks ==
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-breath.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Breath mark]]'''&lt;br /&gt;In a score, this symbol tells the performer to take a breath (or make a slight pause for non-wind instruments). This pause usually does not affect the overall tempo. For bowed instruments, it indicates to lift the bow and play the next note with a downward (or upward, if marked) bow.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-caesura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Caesura]]''' &lt;br /&gt;Indicates a brief, silent pause, during which time is not counted. In ensemble playing, time resumes when the conductor or leader indicates. For piano this usually means that the player should release all keys and pedals.

== Accidentals and key signatures ==
{{main|Accidental (music)|Key signature}}

=== Common accidentals ===
[[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] modify the pitch of the notes that follow them on the same staff position within a measure, unless cancelled by an additional accidental.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-flat.svg|100px]]

|'''[[Natural sign|Natural]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Cancels a previous accidental, or modifies the pitch of a sharp or flat as defined by the prevailing key signature (such as F-sharp in the key of G major, for example).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-doubleflat.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Double flat]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by two chromatic semitones. Usually used when the note to modify is already flatted by the key signature.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-doublesharp.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Double sharp]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by two chromatic semitones. Usually used when the note to modify is already sharpened by the key signature.
|}

===Key signatures===
[[Key signature]]s define the prevailing [[Key (music)|key]] of the music that follows, thus avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]
|'''Flat key signature'''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|♭}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|♭}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are "flatted" (US) or "flattened" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|♭}} and E{{music|♭}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958.  I,24 "at least one note has to be sharpened or flattened"&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:C-sharp-major a-sharp-minor.svg|100px]]
|'''Sharp key signature'''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Raises''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|♯}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.
|}

=== [[Quarter tone]]s ===
There is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for quarter tones involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:

{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]
|'''Demiflat'''&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]
|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)&lt;br /&gt;Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]
|'''Demisharp'''&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]
|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)&lt;br /&gt;Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.
|}

A symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.

In [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.

== Time signatures ==
{{main|Time signature}}
[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is "marked off" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]
|'''Specific time – simple time signatures'''&lt;br /&gt;The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as "three-four time" or "three-quarter time".
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]
|'''Specific time – compound time signatures'''&lt;br /&gt;The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as "Six-Eight Time".
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Common time]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented "imperfect" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''&lt;br /&gt;Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters "'''M.M.'''", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].
|}

== Note relationships ==
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical – that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.

Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.

A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tuplet]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Several notes sounded simultaneously ("solid" or "block"), or in succession ("broken"). Two-note chords are called '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]'''; three-note chords are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''&lt;br /&gt;A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a "broken chord".

== Dynamics ==
{{main|Dynamics (music)}}
Dynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]
|'''Pianississimo'''&lt;ref name=ppp group=D&gt;Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra "iss" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo''). This is improper Italian and would translate literally to "softestest" in English, but acceptable as a musical term; such a dynamic can also be described as ''molto pianissimo'', ''piano pianissimo'' or ''molto fortissimo'' and ''forte fortissimo'' in somewhat more proper Italian.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely soft. Very infrequently does one see softer dynamics than this, which are specified with additional {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic pianissimo.svg|51px]]
|'''Pianissimo'''&lt;br /&gt;Very soft. Usually the softest indication in a piece of music, though softer dynamics are often specified with additional {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic piano.svg|29px]]
|'''Piano'''&lt;br /&gt;Soft; louder than ''pianissimo''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic mezzo piano.svg|50px]]
|'''Mezzo piano'''&lt;br /&gt;Moderately soft; louder than ''piano''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic mezzo forte.svg|50px]]
|'''Mezzo forte'''&lt;br /&gt;Moderately loud; softer than ''forte.'' If no dynamic appears, ''mezzo-forte'' is assumed to be the prevailing dynamic level.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic forte.svg|29px]]
|'''Forte'''&lt;br /&gt;Loud. Used as often as ''piano'' to indicate contrast.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic fortissimo.svg|46px]]
|'''Fortissimo'''&lt;br /&gt;Very loud. Usually the loudest indication in a piece, though louder dynamics are often specified with additional {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s (such as fortississimo – seen below).
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music dynamic fortississimo.svg|53px]]
|'''Fortississimo'''&lt;ref group=D name=ppp /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely loud. Very infrequently does one see louder dynamics than this, which are specified with additional {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music expression sforzando sfz.svg|42px]]
|'''Sforzando'''&lt;br /&gt;Literally "forced", denotes an abrupt, fierce accent on a single sound or chord. When written out in full, it applies to the sequence of sounds or chords under or over which it is placed.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-crescendo.svg|50px]]
|'''Crescendo'''&lt;br /&gt;A gradual increase in volume.&lt;br /&gt;Can be extended under many notes to indicate that the volume steadily increases during the passage.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|50px]]
|'''Diminuendo'''&lt;br /&gt;Also '''decrescendo'''&lt;br /&gt;A gradual decrease in volume. Can be extended in the same manner as crescendo.
|}
&lt;references group=D /&gt;
Other commonly used dynamics build upon these values. For example, "pianississimo" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) meaning so softly as to be almost inaudible, and fortississimo, ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) meaning extremely loud. In some European countries, use of the loudest dynamics has been strongly discouraged as endangering the hearing of the performers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html "No Fortissimo? Symphony Told to Keep It Down"] by [[Sarah Lyall]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (20 April 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; A small {{serif|'''''s'''''}} in front of the dynamic notations means ''subito'', and means that the dynamic is to change to the new notation rapidly. Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).

{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]
|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (forte), then immediately softly (piano).
|}

Another value that rarely appears is ''[[Niente (musical dynamic)|niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means "nothing". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate "fade out to nothing".

== Articulation marks ==
[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staccato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking’s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''&lt;br /&gt;Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Tenuto]]'''&lt;br /&gt;This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a slight dynamic emphasis or be combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').

|'''[[Marcato]]'''&lt;br /&gt;''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge). In organ notation, this means ''play a pedal note with the toe''. Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''&lt;br /&gt;A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires.

== Ornaments ==
Ornaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a "shake". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill.  In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn.  In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.&lt;ref&gt;''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29&lt;/ref&gt;  In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a tremolo (q.v.).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-mordent.svg|100px]]
|'''Upper [[mordent]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly play the principal note, the next higher note (according to key signature) then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a "shake" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]
|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''&lt;br /&gt;Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration. In much music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended.
|}
{|
| style="width:20%;"|{{nowrap|[[File:Music-turn-2.svg|60px]][[File:Music-turn (inverted).png|60px]][[File:Music-inverted turn.png|60px]]}}
|'''[[Turn (music)|Turn]]'''&lt;br /&gt;When placed directly above the note, the turn (also known as a ''gruppetto'') indicates a sequence of upper auxiliary note, principal note, lower auxiliary note, and a return to the principal note. When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.
|}
{|
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''&lt;br /&gt;The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged.  Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).
|}

== Octave signs ==
{|
|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]
|style="padding-left:1em;"|'''Ottava'''&lt;br /&gt;The ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to ''play the passage one [[octave]] higher''.
An ''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' or, as alternative in modern music, an ''8&lt;sup&gt;vb&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign (both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed ''below'' the staff meaning ''play the passage one octave lower''.&lt;ref&gt;George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W. W. Norton &amp; Company), p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Donato, ''Preparing Music Manuscript'' (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.), pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|-
|[[File:Music-quindicesimaalta.svg|100px]]
|style="padding-left:1em;"|'''Quindicesima'''&lt;br /&gt;The ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign is placed ''above'' the staff (as shown) to mean ''play the passage two octaves higher''. A ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' sign ''below'' the staff indicates ''play the passage two octaves lower''.
|}
''8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''15&lt;sup&gt;ma&lt;/sup&gt;'' are sometimes abbreviated further to ''8'' and ''15''. When they appear below the staff, the word ''bassa'' is sometimes added.

== Repetition and codas ==
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-tremolo.svg|100px]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Music Tremolo shortcut.jpg|100px]]
|'''[[Tremolo]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A rapidly repeated note. If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as "as fast as possible", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.

In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussions and some untuned percussion instrument such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.

The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''&lt;br /&gt;Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once. If there is no left repeat sign, the right repeat sign sends the performer back to the start of the piece or the nearest double bar.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-simile.svg|100px]]
|'''Simile marks'''&lt;br /&gt;Denote that preceding groups of beats or measures are to be repeated. In the examples here, the first usually means to repeat the previous measure, and the second usually means to repeat the previous two measures.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-volte.svg|100px]]
|'''Volta brackets''' ('''1st and 2nd endings''', or '''1st- and 2nd-time bars''')&lt;br /&gt;A repeated passage is to be played with different endings on different playings; it is possible to have more than two endings (1st, 2nd, 3rd ...).
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-dacapo.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Da capo]]'''&lt;br /&gt; (lit. "From top") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music from its beginning. This is usually followed by ''al fine'' (lit. "to the end"), which means to repeat to the word ''fine'' and stop, or ''al coda'' (lit. "to the coda (sign)"), which means repeat to the coda sign and then jump forward.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-dalsegno.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Dal segno]]'''&lt;br /&gt; (lit. "From the sign") Tells the performer to repeat playing of the music starting at the nearest ''segno''. This is followed by ''al fine'' or ''al coda'' just as with ''da capo''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:SegnoTeken.svg|50px]]
|'''Segno'''&lt;br /&gt;Mark used with ''dal segno''.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Coda sign.svg|50px]]
|'''[[Coda (music)|Coda]]'''&lt;br /&gt;Indicates a forward jump in the music to its ending passage, marked with the same sign. Only used after playing through a ''D.S. al coda'' (Dal segno al coda) or ''D.C. al coda'' (Da capo al coda).
|}

== Instrument-specific notation ==
=== Bowed string instruments ===
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Bartók pizzicato|Left-hand pizzicato]]''' or '''[[Stopped note]]'''&lt;br /&gt;A note on a stringed instrument where the string is plucked with the left hand (the hand that usually stops the strings) rather than bowed. On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a "stopped note" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn).  In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be "choked" (muted with the hand).
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]
|'''Snap pizzicato'''&lt;br /&gt;On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it "snap" against the frame. Also known as a [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] pizzicato.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-harmonic.svg|100px]]
|'''[[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|Natural harmonic]]''' or '''Open note'''&lt;br /&gt;On a stringed instrument, means to play a natural harmonic (also called '''flageolet'''). On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note "open" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]
|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''&lt;br /&gt;On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.
|-
| style="width:12.5%;"| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]
|'''Down bow''' or '''Giù arco'''&lt;br /&gt;Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.
|}

=== Guitar ===

The guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin. They are written above, below, or beside the note to which they are attached. 
They read as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol !! Spanish !! Latin !! English
|-
| p || pulgar || pollex || thumb
|-
| i || índice || index || index
|-
| m || medio || media || middle

=== Piano ===

==== Pedal marks ====
Pedal marks appear in music for instruments with [[sustain pedal]]s, such as the [[piano]], [[vibraphone]] and [[Tubular bell|chimes]].
{| style="vertical-align: middle;"
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Pedal Mark 1.svg|50px]]
|'''Engage pedal'''&lt;br /&gt;Tells the player to put the [[sustaining pedal]] down.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-pedalup.svg|25px]]
|'''Release pedal'''&lt;br /&gt;Tells the player to let the sustain pedal up.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"| [[File:Music-pedal.svg|50px]]
|'''Variable pedal mark'''&lt;br /&gt;More accurately indicates the precise use of the sustain pedal. The extended lower line tells the player to keep the sustain pedal depressed for all notes below which it appears. The '''∧''' shape indicates the pedal is to be momentarily released, then depressed again.
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"|[[Image:Mute on1.JPG|50px]]
|'''Con sordino''', '''Una corda'''&lt;br/&gt; Tells the player to put the [[soft pedal]] down or, in other instruments, apply the [[mute (music)|mute]].
|-
|  style="width:12.5%; text-align:center;"|[[Image:Mute off1.JPG|50px]]
|'''Senza sordino''', '''Tre corde'''&lt;br/&gt; Tells the player to let the soft pedal up or, in other instruments, remove the mute.

In [[civil engineering]], the '''middle-third rule''' states that no tension is developed in a [[wall]] or [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] if the [[resultant force]] lies within the middle third of the structure.

The rule is covered by various standard texts in the field of civil engineering, for instance ''Principles of Foundation Engineering'' by B.M. Das.&lt;ref&gt;Das, B.M. Principles of Foundation Engineering 3rd Ed. PWS Publishing (1995) p.153&lt;/ref&gt;   The application of this rule is limited to foundations that are square or rectangular in [[Plan view|plan]].  (For circular foundations a different rule, known as the Middle Quarter Rule applies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5614">'''Moderation theory''' is a set of interrelated hypotheses that explain the process through which political groups eschew radical platforms in favour of more moderate policies and prefer electoral, compromising and non-confrontational strategies over non-electoral, exclusive, and confrontational strategies. Moderation can take place at both ideological and behavioural levels that mutually reinforce each other.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The origins of the theory go back to the work of [[Robert Michels]] who offers a classical study of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in his book ''[[Political Parties]]''.{{sfn|Alidina|2014|p=1}} The theory offers insights into the transformation of party politics in a great range of cultural and historical cases including socialist{{sfn|Przeworski|Sprague|1986}} and [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties{{sfn|Kalyvas|1996}} in Western Europe and more recently Islamic political groups.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010}} In particular, the evolution of Islamic [[political parties]] in Turkey since the early 1970s that culminated in the rise of the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] in the 2002 parliamentary elections exemplifies the dynamics highlighted by moderation theory.

The theory is composed of three causal mechanisms.{{sfn|Tezcür|2010|pp=27–32}} First, once radical political groups are organized as vote-seeking parties, electoral considerations prevail and these groups abandon revolutionary agendas in favour of vote-maximizing strategies. This expectation is based on the [[median voter theorem]]. A second mechanism concerns the vulnerability of radical political groups participating in electoral contest to state repression. The logic of political survival necessitates that these groups avoid openly confronting state elites. The final mechanism involves the effects of organizational resources on group behaviour and suggests that the maintenance of electoral organization is prioritized over original political goals. Once radicals are organized as electoral parties, their original projects of revolutionizing the 
political system becomes unachievable simply because of the lack of organizational resources. While moderation of radicals is generally thought to be conducive to [[democratization]], it can also hamper and even hinder democratic progress as radicals are co-opted into the ruling political system and lose their reformist characteristics.

In contemporary times, moderation theory is further developed and critically refined to understand the evolution of Islamic political parties in Muslim majority countries as diverse as Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Iran, and [[Güneş Murat Tezcür|Turkey]]. The [[Al-Wasat Party|Center Party]] (''Hizb al-Wasat'') of Egypt is example of a moderate Islamic organization that was not given license by the ruling regime.{{sfn|Wickham|2004}} Moreover, [[Muslim Brotherhood]] of Egypt has transformed into an organization that is responsive to the logic of political competition and survival in an authoritarian regime at the cost of its original ideological commitments.{{sfn|El-Ghobashy|2005}} Similarly, the [[Islamic Action Front]] of Jordan shows that Islamists can be moderate as a result of participation in pluralistic political process as long as this participation can be justified in Islamic terms.{{sfn|Schwedler|2006}}

'''México Indígena''' is a project of the [[American Geographical Society]] to organize teams of geographers to research the geography of indigenous populations in Mexico. The project's stated objective is to map "changes in the cultural landscape and conservation of natural resources" that result from large scale land privatization initiatives underway in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prmapping.res.ku.edu/Mexico_Indigena/ |accessdate=5 December 2016 |title=México Indígena |publisher=University of Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is led by Peter Herlihy at the [[University of Kansas]] and is funded by the U.S. Department of Defense through its Foreign Military Studies Office. The project has been the subject of criticism by various groups including groups representing indigenous peoples. Critics allege that the project was not forthcoming about its U.S. military funding, and that the project has various ulterior motives besides gathering information for research purposes. The project began in 2005, and lasted through 2008.

==Project and objectives==
The México Indígena was the first in a series of planned projects to enhance United States government geographical data around the world.&lt;ref name=Herlihy/&gt; The stated objective is to produce maps of the "digital human terrain," of the region's indigenous peoples. To accomplish this, the American Geographical Society sent geographers to several regions to gather cultural and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data and build relationships with local institutions.&lt;ref name=Herlihy&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320023846/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8184655/A-digital-geography-of-indigenous.html |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |title=A Digital Geography of Indigenous Mexico: Prototype for the American Geographical Society's Bowman Expeditions |journal=Geographical Review |vauthors=Herlihy PH, Dobson JE, Robledo MA, Smith DA, Kelly JH, Viera AR |date=July 2008 |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=395–415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

México Indígena was led by a team of [[geographer]]s who specialize in [[Latin American]], including [[Peter Herlihy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |title=KU Geography Department |publisher=.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916213109/http://www2.ku.edu/~geography/peoplepages/Herlihy_P.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~latamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516044624/http://www2.ku.edu/%7Elatamst/facultybyaffiliation.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Jeremy Dobson and Miguel Aguilar Robledo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609110554/http://www.uaslp.mx/PDF/1337_384.pdf |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project methods==
México Indígena's primary method for obtaining and understanding geographic data is [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] mapping (PRM). In PRM, local investigators, chosen by the communities, are trained by the formal researcher in geographic data gathering techniques. Cognitive mental (individual) maps are converted to consensual (community) maps, including only features whose nature, name, and coordinates have been verified. These are then converted to standardized maps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedlanguage.com/maps_of_the_world/map_of_mexico.shtml |title=410 « « CapitaCapita |publisher=Appliedlanguage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the communities may choose to use for educational, political, legal, or other, purposes. Participatory maps of resource-use areas, for example, have been used successfully for indigenous territorial claims in Panama (Herlihy 2003) and elsewhere.  México Indígena's primary tool for joining data from different sources to produce maps and to analyze trends is [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

Sponsoring and collaborating institutions and participants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/MI_people_new.JPG |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004082243/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/MI_people_new.JPG |archivedate=October 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the México Indígena research project have included the [[University of Kansas]] (US), the [[Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí]] (Mexico), the [[Foreign Military Studies Office]], Radiance Technologies (US),&lt;ref name="Radiancetech.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiancetech.com/ |title=Radiance Technologies, Inc. - Systems Engineering, Technology Development, Production and Fielding Support |publisher=Radiancetech.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] federal environmental ministry [[SEMARNAT]].

In many respects the México Indígena project is an example of [[military geography]]. "FMSO's goal is to help increase an understanding of the world's cultural terrain." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108191619/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/clear_up_misconceptions.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges' International Development Project Database Survey notes that the México Indígena research project has received between $751,000-$1,000,000 from all sources external funds, including: U.S. Department of Defense, Foreign Military Studies Office; U.S. Department of State, Fulbright-Garcia Robles; the American Geographical Society; the University of Kansas' Center of Latin American Studies; Mexico's Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales; and the Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |title=Nasulgc |publisher=Nasulgc.advcomp.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610063120/http://nasulgc.advcomp.com/survey/surveyresponses.cfm?evtsurkey=IDPDS-2639 |archivedate=2012-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
'''Imperial Geography: Geopiratería'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mibug.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/geopirateria/ |title=GEOPIRATERÍA &amp;#124; BREVARIO 2013 |publisher=Mibug.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The false attribution of location in the [[visual arts]] has been deemed "geopiracy" by Vogel (2006) and rigorously defined  in Vogel et al. (2008). México Indígena raises consequential questions when humans are ''not'' [[falsity|falsely]] situated (located) in digitally-generated topographies of the human terrain. The [[ethical]] questions generated by the moral quagmire associated with efforts such as the México Indígena project have yet to be adequately addressed. While México Indígena's ethical guidelines explicitly assert "No information will be acquired through [[deception]] or misrepresentation" &lt;ref name="web.ku.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |accessdate=October 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513151717/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; significant concerns have arisen regarding the nature of the research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciudadania-express.com/?s=Bowman&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 |title=Bowman |publisher=Ciudadania Express |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the project's embrace of a putatively [[Community-based participatory research|participatory research]] [[methodology]] that ostensibly "empowers" the local community in geographic knowledge generation and manipulation. Naïve statements by team leaders of Mexico Indígena's controversial [[land titling]] project designed to produce "digital human terrains," (for example, "Experience has proven that, when communities themselves give the world their understandings of their land, the world is better equipped to respect these alternative understandings"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510030525/http://web.ku.edu/%7Emexind/ethics_statement_prototype.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; underscore legitimate and deeply troubling questions that have emerged surrounding the ethical conduct of the US-based researchers involved in México Indígena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:ua2De7IgJ9oJ:https://us.indymedia.org/us/servlet/OpenMir%3Fdo%3Dgetpdf%26id%3D28825%26forIE%3D.pdf+%22Peter+Herlihy%22+AND+Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; México Indígena project leader Peter Herlihy and the editor of "Participatory Mapping of Indigenous Lands in Latin America" a special Issue of  the journal ''Human Organization'' of the [[Applied Anthropology Association]] initially explained to the Union of Organizations of the [[Sierra Juárez, Oaxaca|Sierra Juarez]] of [[Oaxaca]] (UNOSJO, S.C.) that the proposed research objective was to assess the influence that the Mexican Government's PROCEDE program has had on indigenous people's communities. Nevertheless, Herlihy did not explain that the research initiative he led was financed by [[United States]] [[Army]]'s Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO), nor did he mention that research findings would be given directly to FMSO. As the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]'s indigenous organization, the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of [[Oaxaca]] notes, "Herlihy neglected to mention this despite being expressly asked to clarify the eventual use of the data obtained through research." Similarly, he failed "to acknowledge [to UNOSJO, S.C] the participation of Radiance Technologies, a company that specializes in arms development and military intelligence" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter N. Jones |url=http://indigenousissuestoday.blogspot.com/2009/02/zapotec-indigenous-people-demand.html |title=Zapotec Indigenous People Demand Transparency: Oaxaca, Mexico - Indigenous People's Issues Today |publisher=Indigenousissuestoday.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-07 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a statement released at the end of January 2009 by the Project leader, Peter Herlihy, "FMSO has financed the expedition to Mexico, as well as others to Colombia, the Antilles and Jordan, through the Radiance Corporation,&lt;ref name="Radiancetech.com"/&gt; that administers the contracts between FMSO, AGS, and the universities" [http://www.dgroups.org/groups/ppgis/index.cfm?op=message&amp;msgid=935678&amp;cat_id=7144&amp;setlang=3 ("The American Geographical Society's Bowman Expeditions seek to improve geographic understanding at home and abroad: Spotlight on México Indígena")]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Managed under contract by Radiance Technologies, an Alabama-based military contractor specializing in intelligence and logistical services, Herlihy's research has been financed through FMSO, indicating for some that "the Mexico Indígena project is involved in gathering intelligence for the US Army."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_5722_s09/SelectedResponsestoAGS.pdf ]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Independent Media Center &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/it/2009/01/920151.shtml |title=Independent Media Center &amp;#124; http://www.indymedia.org &amp;#124; ((( i ))) |publisher=www.indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The researched [Oaxaca] communities knew nothing of this involvement and are left feeling like victims of geopiracy."

The [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] based SmartPort Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcsmartport.com/ |title=Supply-Chain Centered |publisher=KC SmartPort |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is pushing forward with its [[project]] to convert Kansas City into what is called an inland [[port]] for Mexican [[shipment]]s, and facilitating the free passage of goods across the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[border]]. One may question why Kansas City merchants may have an interest in maps of Mexico. Yet as SmartPort Inc. observes, "Located in the heart of America at the hub of the transcontinental and NAFTA trade corridors, Kansas City is a center of choice for warehousing, manufacturing and distribution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_corridors/corridors.htm |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129104336/http://kcsmartport.com/sec_corridors/corridors.htm |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Herlihy has commented that his research in Mexico can benefit SmartPort Inc. planners by offering them with information about the regions along Mexico's railways. He said, "They can take this information and use it for all kinds of things to really understand what they call the cultural terrain," Herlihy is reported to have also said. "You can't even predict all the uses" &lt;ref name="amergeog.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/newsrelease/Bowmanexpeditions-mex.pdf |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016175042/http://amergeog.org/newsrelease/Bowmanexpeditions-mex.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the [[American Geography Society]]'s long and intimate association with imperial agendas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amergeog.org/ubiquedec2006.pdf |accessdate=February 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202222128/http://www.amergeog.org/ubiquedec2006.pdf |archivedate=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is perhaps no surprise that the AGS sponsored México Indígena project has been the source of fierce criticism from indigenous organizations in Mexico, not to mention from a student-based group at the [[University of Kansas]]—the academic home of Mexico Indígena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuwatch.org/DOD.Presentation.pdf |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905122050/http://www.kuwatch.org/DOD.Presentation.pdf |archivedate=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Student supporters of KU Watch's critique of México Indígena demonstrated at the University of Kansas to enhance awareness about research conducted at the University funded by the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name="kansan1"&gt;[https://archive.is/20100521023606/http://www.kansan.com/stories/2008/mar/25/student_activists_seek_open_discussion_government_/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticisms raised by the [[University of Kansas]] student group KU Watch, Peter Herlihy, a leader of the Bowman Expedition, said that he was "proud to raise the flag and say look at what the government is funding," In addition, Herlihy reported that his research project "empowers indigenous people by putting intellectual property where it belongs." Moreover, he noted that "Geographical intelligence is needed for peace and prosperity just like it is needed for war and destruction,".&lt;ref name="kansan1"/&gt; Recently, a number of geographers have written to the AAG requesting that it conduct its own inquiry into the nature and consequences of Peter Herlihy's research in Mexico, which they "feel violated the ethical norms of our profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_5722_s09/SelectedResponsestoAGS.pdf ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Esteban Ortiz Rodea, the Mexican State representative for the Secretary for the Environment and Natural Recourses (SEMARNAT) has publicly acknowledged that no Federal funds were used to support the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in the communities of the Sierra Juárez. Moreover, Aldo González, the leader of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSOJO) apparently only became aware of "México Indígena's" ties to FMSO very recently. González has since joined other Zapotec leaders and expressed grave concern regarding the actual intentions of the [[United States Department of Defense]]-funded project.&lt;ref name="imparcialenlinea1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=71668 |accessdate=February 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122022828/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/getPrint.php?id=71668 |archivedate=January 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nssoaxaca.com/index.php/ciudad/10-oaxaca/6526-alertan-organizaciones-de-la-sierra-sur-sobre-presuntas-investigaciones-en-esa-region- |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120904180537/http://www.nssoaxaca.com/index.php/ciudad/10-oaxaca/6526-alertan-organizaciones-de-la-sierra-sur-sobre-presuntas-investigaciones-en-esa-region- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern culminated in mid January, 2009, when Juan Pérez Luna y Aldo González of the Union of Organizations of the Sierra Juarez of Oaxaca (UNOSJO) released a press statement denouncing the México Indígena's lack of full disclosure regarding funding procured from the [[United States Army]] [[Foreign Military Studies Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elenemigocomun.net/2059 |accessdate=January 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412013508/http://elenemigocomun.net/2059 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Co-chair of the Indigenous Peoples' Specialty Group (IPSG) of the Association of American Geographers (AAG) and Secretary of the [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] [[People]]s' [[Knowledge]]s and [[Rights]] [[Committee|Commission]] (IPKRC) of the International Geographical Union (IGU), Renee Pualani Louis, lamented the release of UNOSOJO's declaration by noting how it was such a "sad day for geographers and anyone doing research with Indigenous communities especially in Meso-America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgroups.org/groups/ppgis/index.cfm?op=dsp_showmsg&amp;listname=ppgis&amp;msgid=935179&amp;cat_id=7144&amp;setlang=3 ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca's press release indicates, Zapotec Indigenous Peoples in Mexico are demanding full transparency from the U.S. scholar leading the [[United States Department of Defense]] funded project. In their words, "Prof. Herlihy failed to mention that he received funding from the Foreign Military Studies Office of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The failure to obtain full, free and prior [[informed consent]] is a violation of the rights of indigenous communities as codified in the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 2007." (according to UN Declaration Article 11/2, research must be conducted with free prior and informed consent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Robert |url=http://www.mensjournal.com/new-war-for-hearts-and-minds |title=U.S. Military's New Afghanistan Strategy from the Front Lines |publisher=MensJournal.com |date=2010-08-15 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by the website ''El Enemigo Común'' in their essay 'A Road to Hell', "The role of the Foreign Military Studies Office in identifying 'emerging and asymmetric' threats in Oaxaca, Mexico is chilling to say the least. Fort Leavenworth has a vast array of knowledge with regards to how neo-liberal changes in Mexico's property regime will affect indigenous culture and land use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |accessdate=February 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018211205/http://elenemigocomun.net/1368 |archivedate=October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the "México Indígena" project are disseminated monthly at Fort Leavenworth's Foreign Military Studies Office. It is reported that during a conversation between Gen. [[Petraeus]] and the project leaders of México Indígena, Petraeus observed that, "knowledge of the cultures is a multiplier of [military] forces…the knowledge of cultural ` terrain' can be as important, and at times more, than the knowledge of the geographic terrain". Accordingly, the project heads of México Indígena are reported to have stated that "the culture and local residents are then the 'decisive terrain'".&lt;ref name="narconews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narconews.com/Issue55/article3382.html |title=Geo-Piracy in Oaxaca... and Much More |publisher=Narco News |date=2000-04-18 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called-participatory mapping (PRM) is a [[Scientific technique|technique]] that fully capitalizes on local [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[knowledge]] in the creation of "formalized" [[map]]s necessary for the creation of [[neo-liberal]] [[property]] regimes. According to an excerpt from 2006 ''Methodological Approaches'' Report of México Indígena: "The participatory mapping, or PM, methodology rests on the philosophy that local populations have some of the best and most detailed knowledge of their surrounding lands and resources and that can be collected and interpreted geographically."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |accessdate=February 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207021145/http://web.ku.edu/~mexind/methods_text.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |title=Geographical Review July 2008 |publisher=Amergeog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215034151/http://www.amergeog.org/gr/jul08/herlihy.html |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neglecting to disclose funding sources to research participants violate the ethical principles of both the Association of American Geographers (AAG) as well as the [[Belmont Report]]. Failure to inform participants about the potential [[risk]]s or unintended consequences associated with the study abrogates the principal of informed consent, and hence violates the rights of the project participant's. México Indígena's military-funded investigations do in fact pose a risk in Oaxaca for individuals and communities, especially in light of the fractious and divisive  nature of village and inter-village politics in Southern Mexico, not to mention the socio-political turmoil in this region that has been fragmented by international migration, political factionalism and economic marginalization.

Notwithstanding such critiques, in Peter Herlihy's estimation, ''México Indígena'' is a concerted effort to renew "society's commitment to inform the public and the United States government about world geography".&lt;ref&gt;[http://communicate.aag.org/eseries/aag_org/program/AbstractDetail.cfm?AbstractID=19562]{{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Geographical Society]] has been clear about the potential sanctions accompanying a breach of ethical conduct. According to an AGS document released on the  ''México Indígena'' web site called "Developing Guidelines for Ethical Conduct of Foreign Field Research":
"''Lead scholars and other members of AGS-sponsored expeditions must comport themselves in a manner that respects cultures in the host country while simultaneously adhering to widely held values of American culture. Their actions must not adversely affect the people or natural environments of host countries. A significant breach of this provision may result in recall of individuals or entire expeditions''." &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca (UNOSJO) has reiterated its rejection of the [[University of Kansas]] [[geographers]] associated with the ''México Indígena'' Project for [[fail]]ing to obtain [[informed consent]] from the communities involved in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricada.blogcindario.com/2009/02/01354-ii-congreso-appo.html |title=II CONGRESO APPO. - Barricada de Oaxaca |publisher=Barricada.blogcindario.com |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/XStatic/excelsior/template/content.aspx?se=nota&amp;id=514195 |accessdate=February 21, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicadas por JA |url=http://dechivolostamales.blogspot.com/2009/02/la-geopirateria-estrategia-del.html |title=De chivo, los tamales (v2.0): La geopiratería, estrategia del Pentágono: el caso de Oaxaca |publisher=Dechivolostamales.blogspot.com |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNOSJO continues to maintain that research was conducted in a [[covert]] fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com/2009/02/congreso-de-la-appo.html |title=la_barricada_oaxaqueña: CONGRESO DE LA APPO |publisher=Barricadaoaxaca.blogspot.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the coordinator of the Unión de Organizaciones de la Sierra Juárez de Oaxaca Aldo González Rojas is reported to have said in Spanish that "the looting of traditional Zapotec knowledge about land and territoriality is tantamount to geopiracy (geopiratería), which is being conducted through the work of México Indígena in the indigenous communities of the Sierra. This in turn has generated an international debate over the ethical nature of social research conducted in indigenous communities." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225073702/http://www.exonline.com.mx/diario/noticia/primera/pulsonacional/acusan_a_eu_de_geopirata/514195 |archivedate=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldo González Rojas, speaking on behalf of UNOSJO, has indicated that it is necessary to determine if the information collected by "México Indígena" is for U.S. military or counter-insurgency purposes.  As such, UNOSJO has called for complete disclosure of the institutions and corporations with privileged [[access control|access]] to the data collected by México Indigena. UNOSJO holds that the [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] funded [[Isaiah Bowman|Bowman]] expedition in [[Mexico]] is dedicated to developing [[military]] [[Military tactics|tactics]] for application in zones of armed conflict.  UNOSJO continues to claim that Mexico's Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) has financed the work of México Indígena through its support of the University of San Luis. SEMARNAT has previously disputed UNOSJO's claim, saying they have not funded the implementation of the "México Indígena" project in indigenous or mestizo communities in the Sierra Juárez. According to Esteban Ortiz Rodea, reports from the indigenous communities of Tiltepec, Yagavila, Ixtlán, Yagila and Guelatao suggest few indications of the actual communal collection of zapping information, despite "México Indígena" project's championing of PRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |title=Imparcial en Línea |publisher=Imparcialenlinea.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126161856/http://www.imparcialenlinea.com/?mod=leer&amp;id=74764&amp;sec=primera&amp;titulo=Insisten_en_aclarar_investigaci%C3%B3n_en_Sierra_Ju%C3%A1rez |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

database that includes the names of community members, the location of their plot(s) of land, the formal and informal use of their territories, as well as other data that is not accessible via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://todoelpoderalpueblo.blogspot.com/2009/02/maiz-transgenico-en-mexico.html |title=OAXACA DE JUAREZ, MAGON Y ZAPATA CIUDAD DE LA RESISTENCIA- APPO 2011 |publisher=Todoelpoderalpueblo.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An egregious [[human rights]] concern that emanates from the ''México Indígena'' project is the alleged [[deception]] [[research]], not to mention the privileged knowledge associated with "[[Digital data|digitally]]" tying people to place and then releasing this critical [[cultural]] [[terrain]] [[intelligence]] [[information]] to [[immigration]] and other [[border]] [[security]] personnel. To date, this vital [[ethical]] concern has not been addressed by the ''México Indígena'' team, while  this concern was lauded by a recent apologetic analysis of  the project which notes that, "PROCEDE's effects on the Mexican populace is a perfect example of salient [[GIS]] information untapped by the IC. The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]]'s [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]], based on hometowns or origins of detained [[illegal immigrant]]s where PROCEDE has been enacted, could identify out-migration trends from [[Mexico]] and enhance the deployment and effectiveness of border protection resources" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.mil/college/pubs/pdf/10279.pdf |accessdate=February 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827060207/http://www.dia.mil/college/pubs/pdf/10279.pdf |archivedate=August 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See the description of ''México Indígena'' in Batson, Douglas 2009 ''Registering The Human Terrain: A Valuation of Cadastre''.

The '''National Agricultural Law Center'''  at the [[University of Arkansas]] is a federally funded, nonpartisan research and information center that serves as the nation's leading source of agricultural and food law research and information. The Center is the only institution of its kind in the United States and serves the nation's vast agricultural community, which includes attorneys, farmers, federal and state policymakers, extension personnel, academics, students, consumers, and others.

The Center operates in conjunction with the [[United States National Agricultural Library]], an entity within the [[USDA]] Agricultural Research Service.  
In addition, the Center enjoys an institutional cooperative partnership with the Drake Agricultural Law Center directed by [[Neil Hamilton (lawyer)|Neil D. Hamilton]].

The Center's website is the primary means by which it disseminates its agricultural and food law research and information products. The website is a clearinghouse for legal information that spans nearly four dozen agricultural and food law topics both in the United States and around the world. As such, the website incorporates unique components that cannot be found elsewhere and provides an invaluable resource to those needing information on legal issues surrounding food and agriculture.

The Center is a nonpartisan entity and takes no position on the views expressed in any articles or writings published on the website. All such articles and writings are included for their legal or practical discussions of agricultural or food law topics rather than any particular viewpoint. Furthermore, while every effort is made to supply accurate and up-to-date information, the website is not meant as a source of legal advice, nor is it a substitute for a competent legal professional.

To make the vast store of information provided by this website more user-friendly, the site is divided into sections to help focus the researcher on a particular task at hand.

== About the center ==
This section provides a description of the National Agricultural Law Center, its mission, its history, and its affiliations. Also included are contact information for the Center, biographical and contact information for Center staff, a list of contributors to the website's publications, multi-lingual translations of the Center's brochure, and links to the Center's bi-monthly e-Newsletter and [[The United States Agricultural &amp; Food Law and Policy Blog]].

== Reading rooms ==
One of the most important services provided by the National Agricultural Law Center is the construction and maintenance of its Reading Rooms. A Reading Room is a compilation of electronic resources that provides readers with a way to access extensive agricultural and food law research and information.

At the beginning of each Reading Room is an Overview article designed to familiarize the reader with the particular subject area, followed by a listing of major federal statutes affecting the area, links to applicable federal regulations, and a case law index of citations to recent common-law authority.

Secondary sources relevant to the Reading Room, including Center research publications, Congressional Research Service reports addressing agricultural and food law issues, governmental and non-governmental reference resources, and other publications are included in each Reading Room.

For example, the Agritourism Reading Room defines the term "agritourism" and briefly outlines some potential legal issues inherent in the topic, lists the relevant state and federal statutes that affect this area of the law, provides a case law index of precedential cases, and supplies links to various publications from the federal government, state governments, interested organizations, and experts in the field.

== Publications ==
This section contains articles researched and written by the Center's staff, leading agricultural and food law scholars, and legal practitioners throughout the country and the world. The publications are grouped by topic and listed in alphabetical order.

As a nonpartisan entity, the Center does not advocate for or against any particular viewpoint. While many articles may espouse an author's position on any given issue, the Center publishes the articles for the background and legal analysis on the subject. As such, the publications are provided to assist researchers in understanding the complex web of agricultural and food law issues that confront all components of the agricultural sector.

== The AgLaw Reporter ==
This section includes all issues of the Agricultural Law Update, the professional monthly newsletter of the American Agricultural Law Association (AALA). The Agricultural Law Update Newsletters contain useful and timely articles on a variety of agricultural topics ranging from conservation programs to taxation issues. In addition, the newsletters cover recent cases and laws that affect the nation's agricultural community and the attorneys and policymakers who represent them.

Also included in the area updates to the Federal Register Digest since January, 2002 that provide a brief summary of agricultural and food law regulatory changes published in the Federal Register.

Judicial Officer Decisions on cases heard by those delegated authority by the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to act as the final deciding officer in USDA adjudicatory proceedings are also contained on this page. Case Law Indexes and Case Summaries compiled and written by Center staff and the ever-expanding are also included in the AgLaw Reporter. The case law indexes and the summaries of these cases provide an extensive annotation of the common law surrounding agricultural and food law issues throughout the country and around the world.

The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural and food law issues such as states' biofuels statutes, recreational use statutes, animal cruelty laws, alternative dispute statutes, and climate change legislation. Many issues pertaining to agriculture are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture and food.

== Farm bills ==
Another important service provided by the National Agricultural Law Center, and one of the most popular, is the complete collection of digitized farm bills from the original legislation in 1933 to the most recently enacted 2008 Farm Bill, technically known as the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008]]. Legislative history of each [[U.S. Farm Bill]], research articles, and links to outside sources concerning the farm bills are included also included in this section of the Center's website.

The depth and breadth of material provided in this area of the website surpasses anything else currently available, making it one of the most complete reference collections anywhere for United States Farm Bills.

== Glossary ==
Agriculture and food law contains thousands of words, definitions, and acronyms not commonly understood by laypersons or many attorneys. To remedy that problem Chuck Culver, Director for Development for the Division of Agriculture at the University of Arkansas, has created and published the Glossary of Agricultural Production, Programs, and Policy—Fourth Edition, an extensive list of legal and non-legal definitions of terms and acronyms used in the food and agricultural fields.

== Agricultural law bibliography ==
Professor Drew Kershen, Earl Sneed Centennial Professor of Law at the [[University of Oklahoma College of Law]], created the Agricultural Law Bibliography, which is a bibliography of agricultural law that spans over 50 years of law journals, law reviews, and legal periodicals that publish articles, comments, notes, and developments that comprise the body of published research in agricultural and food law. The Agricultural Law Bibliography is updated quarterly and published on the Center web site.

Center staff are currently contacting authors and publications listed in the bibliography in an effort to provide digitized copies of as many of the listed articles as possible. More than 1000 articles have been digitized to date.

== Congressional Research Service Reports ==
The Center provides an extensive database of Congressional Research Service Reports pertinent to agricultural and food law and policy issues. The [[Congressional Research Service]] reports are a non-partisan objective analysis of a question posed by a congressman or woman and commonly range in length from 5 to around 30 pages. The reports are grouped according to topic and subtopic, including areas such as animal agriculture, international trade, climate change, and environmental law. The Center continuously publishes new Congressional Research Service reports as they become available.

== Reference desk ==
This section contains the links to many different organizations that have some focus on agriculture or agricultural law. Links on this page include government websites, universities, law reviews and journals, associations, practice groups, libraries, and publications.

== State compilations ==
The State Law Clearinghouse provides readers with access to state statutes and administrative codes that regulate agricultural issues. Many issues pertaining to agriculture and food are administered on the state or local level, and this resource is geared towards providing the statutory language of state laws and regulations that affect agriculture.

The '''National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration''' ('''NOAA''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|.|ə}} like ''[[Noah (name)|Noah]]'') is an American scientific agency within the [[United States Department of Commerce]] that focuses on the conditions of the [[oceans]], major waterways, and the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. 

NOAA warns of dangerous [[weather]], charts seas, guides the use and protection of ocean and coastal resources, and conducts research to provide understanding and improve stewardship of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

NOAA was officially formed in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/noaa.html|title=Our history {{!}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=NOAA.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 had over 11,000 civilian employees.&lt;ref name="BestPlacesToWork.org Agency Report"/&gt; Its research and operations are further supported by 321 [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed service]] members who make up the [[NOAA Commissioned Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.omao.noaa.gov/learn/noaa-corps/about|title=About {{!}} Office of Marine and Aviation Operations|website=NOAA.gov|language=en|access-date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since October 2017, NOAA has been headed by [[Timothy Gallaudet]], as acting [[Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere]] and NOAA interim administrator.

==Purpose and function==
[[File:NOAA WP-3D Orions.jpg|thumb|250px|Two NOAA [[Lockheed WP-3D Orion|WP-3D Orions]]]]
NOAA plays several specific roles in society, the benefits of which extend beyond the US economy and into the larger global community:
* ''A Supplier of Environmental Information Products''. NOAA supplies to its customers and partners information pertaining to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clear through the production of weather warnings and forecasts via the [[National Weather Service]], but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well.
* ''A Provider of Environmental Stewardship Services''. NOAA is a steward of U.S. coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.
* ''A Leader in Applied Scientific Research''. NOAA is intended to be a source of accurate and objective scientific information in the four particular areas of national and global importance identified above: ecosystems, climate, weather and water, and commerce and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/our-mission-and-vision|title=About the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|first=|date=|website=|author=|accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five "fundamental activities" are:
* Monitoring and observing Earth systems with instruments and data collection networks.
* Understanding and describing Earth systems through research and analysis of that data.
* Assessing and predicting the changes of these systems over time.
* Engaging, advising, and informing the public and partner organizations with important information.
* Managing resources for the betterment of society, economy and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/noaa_strat_plan_2005_2010.pdf#page=8|title=New Priorities for the 21st Century NOAA STRATEGIC PLAN FY 2005 – FY 2010|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Program Planning and Integration, NOAA Strategic Planning|accessdate=30 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610163225/http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/noaa_strat_plan_2005_2010.pdf#page=8|archivedate=10 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
NOAA traces its history back to multiple agencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/noaa.html|title=Our history {{!}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=Noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were among the oldest in the federal government:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|title=Reorganization Plan 4 - 197 - NOAA Central Library|website=Lib.noaa.gov|date=|accessdate=2016-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051421/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], formed in 1807
* [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau of the United States]], formed in 1870
* [[United States Fish Commission|Bureau of Commercial Fisheries]], formed in 1871 (research fleet only)
* [[NOAA Commissioned Corps|Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps]], formed in 1917

Another direct predecessor of NOAA was the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA), into which several existing scientific agencies such as the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey|United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], the [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau]] and the [[NOAA Commissioned Corps|uniformed Corps]] were absorbed in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|title=Reorganization Plan 4 - 197 - NOAA Central Library|website=Lib.noaa.gov|date=|accessdate=2016-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051421/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

NOAA was established within the Department of Commerce via the Reorganization Plan No. 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|title=Reorganization Plan 4 - 197 - NOAA Central Library|website=Lib.noaa.gov|date=|accessdate=2016-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051421/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed on October 3, 1970 after U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] proposed creating a new agency to serve a national need for "better protection of life and property from natural hazards …for a better understanding of the total environment…[and] for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources." 

In 2007, NOAA celebrated 200 years of service in its role as successor to the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey|United States Survey of the Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Eileen|title=A History of NOAA|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/noaahistory_1.html|publisher=Department of Commerce Historical Council|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, NOAA closed 600 weather stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lott |first=Maxim |date=13 August 2013 |title=Distorted data?

==Organizational structure==
[[File:2016-05-09 17 23 45 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration headquarters at the intersection of Colesville Road (Maryland State Route 384) and East-West Highway (Maryland State Route 410) in Silver Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|NOAA Headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland]]

===NOAA Administrator===
Since October 25, 2017 [[Timothy Gallaudet]], Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, has served as acting [[Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere]] at the US Department of Commerce and NOAA's interim administrator. 

Gallaudet succeeded Benjamin Friedman, who served as NOAA's interim administrator since the end of the [[Obama Administration]] on January&amp;nbsp;20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/leadership/benjamin-friedman|title=Benjamin Friedman {{!}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=Noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Barry Lee Myers]], CEO of [[AccuWeather]], was proposed to be the agency's administrator by the [[Trump Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geospatialworld.net/news/trump-administration-nominates-accuweather-ceo-barry-myers-head-noaa/|title=Trump administration nominates AccuWeather CEO Barry Myers to head NOAA - Geospatial World|date=2017-10-25|work=Geospatial World|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NOAA Services===
NOAA works toward its mission through six major line offices, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS), the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS), the [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS), the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS), the [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR) and the Office of Marine &amp; Aviation Operations (OMAO).&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/organizations.html |title=Organization &amp;#124; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |website=Noaa.gov |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in addition more than a dozen staff offices, including the Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology, the [[NOAA Central Library]], the Office of Program Planning and Integration (PPI).&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt;

====National Weather Service====
[[File:US-NationalWeatherService-Logo.svg|thumb|200px|Seal of the National Weather Service]]
The [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) is tasked with providing "weather, hydrologic and climate forecasts and warnings for the [[United States]], its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy." This is done through a collection of national and regional centers, 13 river forecast centers (RFCs), and more than 120 local weather forecast offices (WFOs). They are charged with issuing weather and river [[weather forecasting|forecasts]], [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|advisories, watches, and warnings]] on a daily basis. They issue more than 734,000 weather and 850,000 river forecasts, and more than 45,000 [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|severe weather warnings]] annually. NOAA data is also relevant to the issues of [[global warming]] and [[ozone depletion]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The NWS operates [[NEXRAD]], a nationwide network of Doppler [[weather radar]]s which can detect [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and their velocities. Many of their products are broadcast on [[NOAA Weather Radio]], a network of radio [[transmitter]]s that broadcasts weather forecasts, severe weather statements, watches and warnings 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/nwr/|title=NOAA Weather Radio|last=Service|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|website=Weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Ocean Service====
The [[National Ocean Service]] (NOS) focuses on ensuring that ocean and coastal areas are safe, healthy, and productive. NOS scientists, natural resource managers, and specialists serve America by ensuring safe and efficient marine transportation, promoting innovative solutions to protect coastal communities, and conserving marine and coastal places.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The National Ocean Service is composed of eight program offices: the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/|title=NOAA Tides &amp; Currents|website=tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Coastal Services Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NOAA Office for Coastal Management ADS Group |url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/ |title=NOAA Office for Coastal Management |website=Csc.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov |title=Home - NOAA Tides &amp; Currents |website=Tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Office of Coast Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov |title=Nautical Charts &amp; Pubs |website=Nauticalcharts.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Office of [[National Geodetic Survey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodesy.noaa.gov/ |title=National Geodetic Survey - Home |website=Geodesy.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Office of [[National Marine Sanctuaries]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/ |title=NOAA National Marine Sanctuaries |website=Sanctuaries.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027170914/http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/ |archivedate=October 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Office of Response and Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/ |title=Our role is stewardship; our product is science |website=Response.restoration.noaa.gov |date=1989-03-24 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two NOS programs, namely the [[Mussel Watch Program|Mussel Watch Contaminant Monitoring Program]] and the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) and two staff offices, the International Program Office and the Management and Budget Office.

====National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service====
[[File:NOAAEngineerAtWork.jpg|thumb|upright|NOAA engineer at work]]
The [[National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service]] (NESDIS) was created by NOAA to operate and manage the US environmental satellite programs, and manage NWS data and those of other government agencies and departments.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} NESDIS's [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] (NCEI) archives data collected by the NOAA, [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Air Force]], the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and meteorological services around the world and comprises the Center for Weather and Climate (previously NOAA's [[National Climatic Data Center]]) and the Center for Coasts, Oceans, and Geophysics (created by a merger of NOAA's National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC), [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] (NODC) and the [[National Geophysical Data Center]] (NGDC)).
 
In 1960 [[TIROS-1]], NOAA's first owned and operated geostationary satellite was launched. 
Since 1966 NESDIS has managed polar orbiting satellites (POES) and since 1974 it has operated [[geosynchronous satellites]] (GOES) . In 1979 NOAA's first [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|polar-orbiting environmental satellite]] was launched. Current operational satellites include [[NOAA-15]], [[NOAA-18]], [[NOAA-19]], [[GOES 13]], [[GOES 14]], [[GOES 15]], [[Jason-2]] and [[DSCOVR]]. In 1983, NOAA assumed operational responsibility for [[Landsat program|Landsat]] satellite system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/fs08497|title=Landsat Data Data Sheet|last=|first=|date=1997|website=usgs.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Since 2001, the organization has hosted the senior staff and recent chair, [[Susan Solomon]], of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s working group on climate science.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, p. XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flag==
[[File:NOAA Flag.svg|thumb|260px|The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration flag, flown as a distinguishing mark by all commissioned NOAA ships.]]
The NOAA flag is a modification of the flag of one of its predecessor organizations, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]]. The Coast and Geodetic Survey's flag, authorized in 1899 and in use until 1970, was blue, with a white circle centered in it and a red triangle centered within the circle. It symbolized the use of [[triangulation]] in [[surveying]], and was flown by ships of the Survey.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

When NOAA was established in 1970 and the Coast and Geodetic Survey's assets became a part of NOAA, NOAA based its own flag on that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The NOAA flag is in essence the Coast and Geodetic Survey flag, with the NOAA logo—a circle divided by the silhouette of a seabird into an upper dark blue and a lower light blue section, but with the "NOAA" legend omitted—centered within the red triangle. NOAA ships in [[Ship commissioning|commission]] display the NOAA flag; those with only one [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] fly it immediately beneath the ship's [[commissioning pennant]] or the personal flag of a civilian official or [[flag officer]] if one is aboard the ship, while multimasted vessels fly it at the masthead of the forwardmost mast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/noaa/noaa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224142440/http://mysite.verizon.net/vzeohzt4/Seaflags/noaa/noaa.html |archivedate=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA ships fly the same [[ensign]] as [[United States Navy]] ships but fly the NOAA flag as a distinguishing mark to differentiate themselves from Navy ships.

In [[pathology]], '''perineural invasion''', abbreviated '''PNI''', refers to the [[invasion (cancer)|invasion]] of [[cancer]] to the space surrounding a [[nerve]]. It is common in head and neck cancer, prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. 

==Significance==
Cancers with PNI usually have a poorer prognosis,&lt;ref name=pmid16985741&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Potter | first1 = SR. | last2 = Partin | first2 = AW. | title = The significance of perineural invasion found on needle biopsy of the prostate: implications for definitive therapy. | journal = Rev Urol | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–90 | month =  | year = 2000 | doi =  | PMID = 16985741 | pmc=1476100}}&lt;/ref&gt; as PNI is thought to be indicative of perineural spread, which can make resection of malignant lesions more difficult.

===Prostate cancer===
In prostate cancer, PNI in needle biopsies is poor prognosticator;&lt;ref name=pmid16985741/&gt; however, in [[prostatectomy]] specimens it is unclear whether it carries a worse prognosis.&lt;ref name=pmid10632123&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Bostwick | first1 = DG. | last2 = Foster | first2 = CS. | title = Predictive factors in prostate cancer: current concepts from the 1999 College of American Pathologists Conference on Solid Tumor Prognostic Factors and the 1999 World Health Organization Second International Consultation on Prostate Cancer. | journal = Semin Urol Oncol | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 222–72 |date=Nov 1999 | doi =  | PMID = 10632123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one study, PNI was found in approximately 90% of radical prostatectomy specimens, and PNI outside of the prostate, especially, was associated with a poorer prognosis.&lt;ref name=pmid18500264&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Merrilees | first1 = AD. | last2 = Bethwaite | first2 = PB. | last3 = Russell | first3 = GL. | last4 = Robinson | first4 = RG. | last5 = Delahunt | first5 = B. | title = Parameters of perineural invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens lack prognostic significance. | journal = Mod Pathol | volume = 21 | issue = 9 | pages = 1095–100 |date=Sep 2008 | doi = 10.1038/modpathol.2008.81 | PMID = 18500264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exists controversies about whether PNI has prognostic significance toward cancer malignancy.

== Unruh radiation and horizon mechanics ==
There is an [[event horizon]]  in the universe where [[light]] (and therefore any information) cannot and will never be able to reach an object, because the cosmic acceleration outpaces the [[speed of light]]: the [[Cosmological horizon#Particle horizon|cosmological comoving horizon]]. If the object accelerates in one direction, a similar event horizon is produced: the [[Rindler coordinates#The Rindler horizon|Rindler horizon]]. Anything beyond these horizons is outside the [[observable universe]], and therefore can't affect the object at the center of the [[Rindler coordinates|Rindler space]].

The Rindler event horizon is effectively the same as the event horizon of a [[black hole]], where [[Vacuum polarization|quantum virtual particle pairs]] are occasionally separated by [[gravity]], resulting in particle emissions known as the [[Hawking radiation]]. For a Rindler horizon produced by an accelerating object, a similar radiation is predicted by [[quantum field theory]]: the [[Unruh effect#Unruh radiation|Unruh radiation]]. Due to the difficulty to measure such tiny quantum background radiation seen only from the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of an accelerated object, Unruh radiation has never been proven to be observed for sure, although some evidence may exist.&lt;ref name="Smolyaninov 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

 |arxiv=cond-mat/0510743
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantized inertia posits that Unruh radiation is the origin of inertia: as a particle accelerates, the Rindler information horizon expands in the direction of acceleration, and contracts behind it. Although being different in essence, this is a macroscopic analogy of the [[Casimir effect]]: a non-fitting partial wave would allow an observer to infer what lies beyond the event horizon, so it would not be a horizon anymore. This logical assumption disallows Unruh waves that don't fit behind an accelerating object. As a result, more Unruh radiation pressure (which acts through the volume of the mass, not only on its surface like the electromagnetic [[radiation pressure]]) hits the object coming from the front than from the rear and this imbalance pushes it back against its acceleration, resulting in the effect observed as inertia.&lt;ref name="EPL 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal

 |doi= 10.1209/0295-5075/101/59001
 |arxiv=1302.2775
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another event horizon much further away: the [[Cosmological horizon#Hubble horizon|Hubble horizon]]. So even in front of an accelerating object, some of the Unruh waves are disallowed, especially the very long Unruh waves that exist if the object has a very low acceleration. Therefore, quantized inertia predicts that such an object with very low acceleration would lose [[Mass#Inertial vs. gravitational mass|inertial mass]] in a new way.&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt;

This loss of inertia occurs more gradually than the [[Empirical_relationship|empirical]] relation proposed by [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]]. In quantized inertia, the inertial mass is modified according to the relation:&lt;ref name="MNRAS 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MNRAS 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; m_i \; = \; m_g \left( 1 - \frac{ \beta \, \pi^2 c^2 }{ |a| \, \Theta} \right) \; \approx \; m_g \left( 1 - \frac{ 2 c^2 }{ |a| \, \Theta} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_i&lt;/math&gt; is the inertial mass, &lt;math&gt;m_g&lt;/math&gt; the gravitational mass, &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0.2&lt;/math&gt; part of [[Wien's displacement law]], &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the speed of light, &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; the [[Absolute value|modulus]] of the acceleration, and &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; the diameter of the cosmological comoving horizon.

The minimum acceleration threshold allowed for any object in the universe is then:&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a' \; = \; \frac{2 \, c^2}{\Theta} \; = \;  2  \; \pm 0.2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m.s}^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;

An uncertainty of about 0.18 arises from uncertainties in the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] of 9%.&lt;ref name="Freedman 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal

Using the constant &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt;, quantized inertia predicts the empirical [[Tully–Fisher relation]], the rotational velocity of galaxies being:&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v^4 \; = \; \frac{2 \, G \, M \ c^2}{\Theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the [[Baryon|baryonic]] mass of the galaxy (the sum of its mass in stars and gas).

This relation is in good agreement with available observational data at various scales, without the need to introduce dark matter. Quantized inertia indeed reduces the inertial mass of outlying stars (whose acceleration &lt;math&gt;a = v^2/r&lt;/math&gt; becomes low enough) and allows them to be bound by the gravitational attraction from visible matter only.&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

== Comparison with related theories ==

Quantized inertia is an alternative to the Lambda-CDM model. Among the main differences, QI has no [[free parameter]] and explains the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|cosmic acceleration]] without [[dark energy]],&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt; and [[galaxy rotation curve]]s as well as residual velocities in [[galaxy cluster]]s without resorting to [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt; As of 2018, two kinds of observations have been shown to be incompatible with dark matter but can be explained by quantized inertia:

* '''Globular clusters''': in 2006, [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] researchers confirmed [[Mordehai Milgrom]]'s main point, i.e. that the dynamics of stars becomes non-Newtonian when their gravitational acceleration drops below a critical threshold of about &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;, however they also showed that such peculiar behavior does not only occur at the periphery of large galaxies but also in much smaller structures such as [[globular cluster]]s, a phenomenon impossible to explain by dark matter (which has a large and smooth distribution over the whole galaxy).&lt;ref name="Scarpa 2006"&gt;{{cite journal

 |arxiv=astro-ph/0601581
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Wide binaries''': in 2012 and 2014, [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]] researchers published results of the study of a particular type of wide [[Binary star|binaries]]. When such couple of stars is separated by more than 7000&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], so their gravitational acceleration drops below the threshold of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;, their behavior also becomes non-Newtonian, i.e. their observed orbital speed becomes so large that the [[Acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] should produce [[centrifugal force]]s overcoming their gravitational attraction, so they should separate, which is not the case. The behavior of such a small system remains unexplainable by dark matter.&lt;ref name="Hernandez 2012"&gt;{{cite journal

Quantized inertia is directly related to other theories of [[Alternatives to general relativity|modified gravity]]. [[Modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND) for example modifies [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's law]] with an adjustable parameter &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; whose value is tuned arbitrarily to fit observed intermediate sized systems such as average galaxies (MOND typically implies different values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; in the range of &lt;math&gt;1.2 \times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;), an empirical relation that however fails with smaller or bigger systems like [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] or [[galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]]s. Unlike MOND, the inertial law of quantized inertia is not a tunable parameter, and better explains the anomalous behavior of globular and galaxy clusters, wide binaries and dwarf galaxies.&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

The [[holographic principle]] in [[quantum gravity]] has also been shown to provide a link between quantized inertia and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name="Gine 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Reactor Institute Delft''' ({{lang-nl|Reactor Instituut Delft}}), or RID, is a nuclear research institute at [[Delft University of Technology]] in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. 

The institute features the '''Hoger Onderwijs Reactor''' ('''HOR''', {{lang-nl|Higher Education Reactor}}), a 2&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; pool-type [[research reactor]]. Neutron research instruments are developed using several neutron beam lines leading from the core. One of the most intense positron beam lines in the world is powered by [[Pair production|gamma-pair production]] near the reactor core.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rid.tudelft.nl/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The institute is part of the Faculty of Applied Sciences since its name change to Reactor Institute. Previously, it was a separate part of the university and known as the '''Interfacultair Reactor Instituut''' (IRI, {{lang-nl|Interfacultary Reactor Institute}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17579">{{Italic title}}{{canon law}}'''''{{lang|la|Regulæ Juris}}''''', also spelled as '''''{{lang|la|Regulae}} -''''' and '''''- {{lang|la|Iuris}}''''' ({{Language with name/for||2=Latin|3=Rules of Law|links=no}}) is a generic term for general rules or principles serving chiefly for the interpretation of canon laws.

==Canonical use==
{{see also|Interpretation (canon law)}}
In a specific sense, however, ''{{lang|la|regulæ juris}}'' are certain fundamental laws in the form of [[axiom]]s found in the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]'', eleven inserted by [[Pope Gregory IX]] at the end of the fifth Book of [[Decretals]], eighty-eight by [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in the last title of ''Liber Sextus Decretalium''.

These rules are an exposition of several laws on the same subject, conclusions or deductions, rather than principles of law drawn from constitutions or decisions, and consequently reserved to the last title of the two books mentioned, in imitation of [[Justinian]] in the "Digest" (L, l, tit. 17).

While these rules are of great importance, it must be stated that few general statements are without exception. Some of the axioms are applicable in all matters, others are confined to judicial trials, benefices, etc. As examples the following are taken from the Liber Sextus: No one can be held to the impossible (6); Time does not heal what was invalid from the beginning (18); What is not allowed to the defendant, is denied to the plaintiff (32); What one is not permitted to do in his own name, he may not do through another (47).

== The Eighty-Eight by Boniface VIII ==
These 88 legal dicta or maxims known as ''{{lang|la|De Regulis Juris}}'' were promulgated in 1298 by [[Boniface VIII]].

'''Semiotics of culture''' is a research field within [[semiotics]] that attempts to define [[culture]] from semiotic perspective and as a type of human symbolic activity, creation of [[sign]]s and a way of giving meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a [[system]] of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as '''semiotics of culture and language'''. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.

The research field was of particular interest for the [[Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School]] ([[USSR]]). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central.

The study received a research ground also in [[Japan]] where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed.

[[File:Mikro020.jpg|thumb|''Mikrokosmos'' emblem book, 1579: "Venus is left shivering in front of a makeshift fire while Bacchus and Ceres wander away".&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus''', [[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Without [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] and [[Bacchus]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] freezes'',&lt;ref&gt;Or "grows cold" "chills" etc&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Liber]] was an alternative Roman name for Bacchus, as the older local wine god for Rome&lt;/ref&gt;  is a quotation from the Roman comedian [[Terence]] (c. 195/185 – c. 159 BC) that became a proverb in the [[Early Modern period]].  Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive.  It was sometimes shown in art, especially in the period 1550–1630, in [[Northern Mannerism]] in [[Prague]] and the [[Low Countries]], as well as by [[Rubens]].&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the concentration of images by the [[Haarlem Mannerists]] reflects the patronage of the powerful brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proverb==
The phrase derives from Terence's comedy ''[[Eunuchus]]'', in which Chremes says to Pythias in the fifth scene of the fourth act (732), ''verbum hercle hoc verum erit "sine Cerere et Libero friget Venus"'' (That saying, "Without Ceres and [[Liber]], Venus freezes" is absolutely true!"). Thus the phrase was probably a well-known proverb at the time as well. Chremes makes use of it to declare how Pythias seems even more beautiful than usual to him during the rowdy partying after a large meal.&lt;ref&gt;Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt; Liber, the son of Ceres and god of human prosperity (and also of wine), was later replaced with Bacchus. The phrase is found in a similar form in [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' 4.32.43&lt;/ref&gt; who quotes it as an example of the stylistic device of [[metonymy]].&lt;ref&gt;''De nat. deor.'' 2.23.60, cited after Gerd Hagenow: [http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/121/Hagenow.pdf ''Der nicht ausgekehrte Speisesaal''] (PDF; 3,5&amp;nbsp;MB), note 7&lt;/ref&gt; In later times it was universally attributed to Terence.

In the Middle Ages, [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] used it in his work, ''Dialogus miraculorum'' to warn against luxury and frivolty and to advocate an ascetic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;''Dialogus miraculorum'' 112&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] quoted it in this sense as well, in a 1518 sermon against the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;WA 1,519&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of [[Renaissance humanism]], the proverb was included with a broader sense in various compilations, such as the ''[[Adagia]]'' of [[Erasmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Adagia 1297 = II.3.97&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest German use is in a compilation from Klagenfurt dating to 1468: ''An wein und brot Leidet Venus not'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is not in good stead).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, pp. 453f.&lt;/ref&gt; Further German variants include:
* ''Ohne Wein und Brot ist Venus tot.'' (Without wine and bread, Venus is dead)
* ''Ohn Speis und Trank ist Venus krank.'' (Without cheer and ale, Venus is frail)
* ''Ohne Kost und ohne Wein kann die Liebe nicht gedeihn.'' (Without food and without wine, love cannot shine)&lt;ref&gt;Publius Terentius Afer: ''Lustspiele'', translated by Christian Victor Kindervater. Leipzig: Frommann, 1799, p. 175 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=znw9AAAAcAAJ Digitised])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shakespeare]]'s line in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "Dost thou think because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale", may be an inverted reference.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Twelfth Night]]'' 2.1.123, [[Sir Toby Belch]] to [[Malvolio]]; see Erasmus, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject in art ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Venus frigida (KMSKA).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Venus Frigida]]'', Rubens 1615, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten, Antwerp. Venus and Cupid are freezing, as a [[satyr]] arrives with a fruit bowl]]
Depictions in art divide into those showing Venus, typically with an accompanying [[Cupid]], either "freezing", without food and drink (or much in the way of clothing), or more comfortable when supplied with them, usually by the other gods in person.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter type is more common, but [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] are among the artists who used both types.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218–219&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''[[Feast of the Gods (art)|Feast of the Gods]]'', another subject popular among the Northern Mannerists, the subject offers the combination of a relatively obscure classical reference and the opportunity for plentiful nudity.  The subject appears in paintings, drawings and prints, and compositions are often copied between these media, and between artists.

Initially the depiction of this motif were closely tied to text and was found mostly in [[emblem book]]s, with the first appearance in the ''Picta poesis'' of 1552, by [[Barthélémy Aneau]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, fig. 3, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Mikrokosmos'', an emblem book of 1579 by the Dutch poet [[Laurentius Haechtanus]] may be the first depiction of the shivering Venus, as Ceres and Bacchus walk away.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin text makes clear that the motif is to be understood as a warning against excessive feasting and drinking because they stimulate sexual desire.

''Explain, [[Cythera (island)|Cytheran]] Venus, and Cupid too:''
''Why do you warm your own feet, warm your own hands?''
''Perhaps because eloquent [[Iacchos]] is not helping you?''
''Isn't dusty Ceres around either?''
''Where sobriety reigns, harmful lust freezes''
''and no war is waged against the curier.''&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the moderate man&lt;/ref&gt;
''Wherever powerful drunkeness and excess reign,''
''the mother of adultery begins her ruthless war.''

[[File:Abraham Bloemaert Sine Baccho et Cenere friget Venus.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Bloemaert]], early 17th century]] 
The motif was especially favoured in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in the Netherlands and in the circle of [[mannerist]] artists at the court of [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of the motif as the subject of an independent painting are Spranger's pair of paintings of about 1590,&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, 126-129&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hans von Aachen]]'s ''Bacchus, Ceres und Amor'' (1598), all painted for Rudolf II.  The Spranger was turned into a print in Amsterdam in about 1597 by [[Jan Harmensz Muller]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1508822&amp;partId=1 British Museum], ''Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus'' (Without Bacchus and Ceres, Venus grows cold), object listing&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hendrik Goltzius]] produced at least 10 versions of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; including a monumental work in the unusual technique of pen and limited colour on canvas, here highly effective (illustrated here).  This was also (probably) in Rudolf's collection, then in the royal collections of Sweden and England, and is now in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/85733.html Phildalephia  Museum of Art]; [http://articles.philly.com/1991-11-24/news/25768376_1_art-museum-engraving-european-art "The Picture That Spurred A Splendid Exhibition"], by Edward J. Sozanski, Inquirer Art Critic, November 24, 1991, philly.com (''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; A different work on the subject in the same technique is in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], which includes a self-portrait by Goltzius in the background.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/05/arts/art-view-in-those-days-it-paid-to-be-clever.html Review in ''New York Times''] of exhibition in Philadelphia in 1992; Santos, 34–35, fig. 28&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wtewael Sine Cerere.jpg|thumb|left| [[Cabinet painting]], about 1605, by [[Joachim Wtewael]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08404.html/f/3/N08404-3.pdf lot notes], [[Sotheby's]], New York. Sale "Important Old Master Paintings Including European Works of Art", 24 Jan 2008, Lot 3&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Especially in Goltzius' version, the undertones of danger and the moral point of the [[allegory]] are still clear, although the motif later moved far from a narrow moral message about personal moderation.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, pp. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the print versions carry the proverb text, which it was presumably felt needed stating for a wider public.  Reference to the motif is uncertain in some works, or groups of works,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 20&lt;/ref&gt; but it is at least arguable that any combination of the three gods, with or without Amor, carries a reference to it, as there is no other context that brings this particular group together.  Two different sets of prints by Goltzius showed each of the three gods in turn; in one set, engraved by [[Jan Saenredam]], each is surrounded by worshippers.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 16–18, figs 8–10 and 15–17; Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Two late paintings by [[Joachim Wtewael]] show half-length portraits of Bacchus and Ceres, and it is presumed that a Venus is missing to complete the set; another small painting by Wtewael shows the three gods, and Amor, together.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, J.; Helmus, L.  &amp; Wheelock Jr. A.  (2015) ''Pleasure and Piety: The Art of Joachim Wtewael'', last two entries, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|9780691166063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens employed the motif repeatedly in different ways, including the visibly freezing ''[[Venus frigida]]'', a version with [[Cupid|Amor]] who desperately attempts to start a fire, and one with Venus at the ''Moment maßvollen Erwärmens und ruhigen Erwachens'' (Moment of modestly warming and quietly waking) in which she hesitantly accepts a wine cup from Bacchus.&lt;ref&gt;Hinz, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; Italian artists rarely depicted it, whether because it came from the mainly northern tradition of emblem books or because the subject had less resonance in a warmer climate.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 219&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions are a painting by [[Pietro Liberi]] and a print by [[Agostino Carracci]] after one by Goltzius.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1459994&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Sine+Cerere+et+Baccho+friget+Venus&amp;page=1 British Museum, object page]; Santos, fig. 5, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[baroque]] period the motif no longer appears often.

===Haarlem brewers' propaganda===
[[File:RubensVenusCupidBacchusandCeres.jpg|thumb|Rubens 1612/13, Staatliche Museen, [[Kassel]]]]
The [[Calvinist]] [[Dutch Republic]] had complex and conflicted attitudes to both sex and alcohol.  Several prominent painters had problems with drink, and the issues were discussed by the biographer and artist [[Karel van Mander]], as part of much wider discussions in Dutch culture.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially 21–28&lt;/ref&gt;  A paper of 2012 by R. de Mambro Santos discusses the motif in this context, and proposes that the depiction of the subject was greatly affected by the big brewers of [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;Santos, especially p. 21 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, van Mander can be seen to connect excessive drinking with wine, while beer is presented in his writings and art as a safer and more wholesome product.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Bacchus, as by extension the god of all alcoholic drinks, and Ceres, as the goddess covering the raw materials, were symbolic of [[beer]], and a metaphor used by van Mander placed Venus and Cupid as representing the transformative process of actual brewing, by boiling the ingredients; the fire appearing in many images was a further necessity for brewing.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 30–36&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Santos, at the period when the subject is found in the art of the [[Haarlem Mannerists]], "the economic life of Haarlem was mainly based on the production of beer", and brewers dominated the government of the city, having "assumed the role previously played by the nobility as a leading group in the administration of the town".&lt;ref&gt;Santos, pp. 27–28, each quoted in turn&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brouwershofje]],  an [[almshouse]] complex in the city, has more information on the Haarlem brewers' guild.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular Jan Mathijsz Ban was a leading brewer, a friend of artists and a significant collector, spending many weeks touring Italy with Goltzius.  With another brewer, he was the dedicatee of the central part of van Manders' ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''.  Van Mander praises the taste and knowledge of the Haarlem brewers at various points,&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; and "Both Van Mander’s text and Goltzius’ images present Bacchus as a sober, elegant divinity, a gentle and polite god not associated at all with excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages", contrary to much previous imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Santos, 29&lt;/ref&gt;

:''While Venus fills the heart (without heart really''
:''Love, though good always, is not quite so good),''
:''Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli, &amp;ndash;''

'''Single colour reflectometry''' ('''SCORE'''), formerly known as '''imaging Reflectometric Interferometry''' ('''iRIf''') and '''1-lambda Reflectometry''', is a physical method based on interference of monochromatic light at thin films, which is used to investigate (bio-)molecular interactions. The obtained binding curves using SCORE provide detailed information on [[Receptor–ligand kinetics|kinetics]] and [[Equilibrium constant|thermodynamics]] of the observed interaction(s) as well as on concentrations of the used analytes. These data can be relevant for pharmaceutical screening and [[drug design]], [[biosensor]]s and other biomedical applications, diagnostics, and cell-based assays.

[[File:SCORE Principle.png|thumb|Principle of spectral reflectometry|Reflectometry can be either realised by '''1:''' monitoring the shift of an extremum in x-direction via a spectrometer ([[Bio-layer interferometry|BLI]], [[Reflectometric interference spectroscopy|RIfS]]), or '''2:''' monitoring the change in intensity of one wavelength in y-direction via a photodiode or camera (SCORE)]]

== Principle ==
The underlying principle corresponds to that of the [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|Fabry-Pérot interferometer]], which is also the underlying principle for the [[Reflectometric interference spectroscopy|white-light interferometry]].

== Realisation / setup ==
Monochromatic light is illuminated vertically on the rear side of a transparent multi-layer substrate. The partial beams of the monochromatic light are [[Transmittance|transmitted]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] at each interphase of the multi-layer system. Superimposition of the reflected beams result in destructive or constructive [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] (depending on wavelength of the used light and the used substrate/multi-layer system materials) that can be detected in an intensity change of the reflected light using a [[photodiode]], [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]], or [[Active pixel sensor|CMOS]] element.

The sensitive layer on top of the multi-layer system can be (bio-)chemically modified with receptor molecules, e.g. antibodies. Binding of specific ligands to the immobilised receptor molecules results in a change [[refractive index]] n and physical thickness d of the sensitive layer. The product of n and d results in the optical thickness (n*d) of the sensitive layer.

[[File:SCORE Binding.png|thumb|Change of reflectance upon analyte binding.|'''1:''' Monochromatic light is reflected at a biolayer interface, '''2:''' upon binding the reflection conditions change, resulting in  '''3:''' a higher reflected intensity due to positive interference]]
[[File:SCORE Binding Curve.png|thumb|Example binding curve in an intensity vs time diagram]]

Monitoring the change of the reflected intensity of the used light over time results in binding curves that provide information on:
* concentration of used ligand
* binding kinetics (association and dissociation rate constants) between receptor and ligand
* binding strength (affinity) between receptor and ligand
* specificity of the interaction between receptor and ligand

Compared to [[bio-layer interferometry]], which monitors the change of the interference pattern of reflected white light, SCORE only monitors the intensity change of the reflected light using a photodiode, CCD, or CMOS element. Thus, it is possible to analyse not only a single interaction but [[Microarray|high-density arrays]] with up to 10,000 interactions per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://biametrics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/20170617_APS-Mueller-et-al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Compared to [[Surface plasmon resonance|surface plasmon resonance (SPR)]], which penetration depth is limited by the [[evanescent field]], SCORE is limited by the [[coherence length]] of the light source, which is typically a few micrometers. This is especially relevant when investigating whole cell assays. Also, SCORE (as well as BLI) is not influenced by temperature fluctuations during the measurement, while SPR needs thermostabilisation.

[[File:SCORE Multiplex.png|thumb|Multiplexed binding curves using an array format]]

== Application ==
SCORE is especially used as detection method in bio- and chemosensors. It is a label-free technique like Reflectometric interference spectroscopy (RIfS), Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) and Surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which allows time-resolved observation of binding events on the sensor surface without the use of [[fluorescence]] or [[Radioactivity|radioactive]] labels.

The SCORE technology is commercialised by Biametrics GmbH, a service provider and instrument manufacturer with headquarters in [[Tübingen]], Germany.

'''Statistical geography''' is the study and practice of collecting, analysing and presenting data that has a geographic or areal dimension, such as census or demographics data. It uses techniques from [[spatial analysis]], but also encompasses geographical activities such as the defining and naming of geographical regions for statistical purposes. For example, for the purposes of statistical geography, the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] uses the Australian Standard Geographical Classification, a hierarchical regionalisation that divides [[Australia]] up into [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]], then statistical divisions, statistical subdivisions, statistical local areas, and finally census collection districts.

==Background==
[[File:Devils Punchbowl Waterfall, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Devil's Punchbowl Waterfall, [[New Zealand]] may be studied using geostatistics]]

[[Geography|Geographers]] study how and why elements differ from place to place, as well as how spatial patterns change through time. Geographers begin with the question 'Where?', exploring how features are distributed on a physical or cultural landscape, observing spatial patterns and the variation of phenomena. Contemporary geographical analysis has shifted to 'Why?', determining why a specific spatial pattern exists, what spatial or ecological processes may have affected a pattern, and why such processes operate. Only by approaching the 'why?' questions can social scientists begin to appreciate the mechanisms of change, which are infinite in their complexity.

===Role of statistics in geography===

Statistical techniques and procedures are applied in all fields of academic research; wherever data are collected and summarized or wherever any numerical information is analyzed or research is conducted, statistics are needed for sound analysis and interpretation of results. 

Geographers use statistics in numerous ways:{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

* To describe and summarize spatial data.
* To make generalizations concerning complex spatial patterns.
* To estimate the probability of outcomes for an event at a given location.
* To use samples of geographic data to infer characteristics for a larger set of geographic data (population).
* To determine if the magnitude or frequency of some phenomenon differs from one location to another.
* To learn whether an actual spatial pattern matches some expected pattern.

==Spatial data and descriptive statistics==
There are several potential difficulties associated with the analysis of spatial data, among these are boundary delineation, modifiable areal units, and the level of spatial aggregation or scale. In each of these cases, the absolute descriptive statistics of an area - the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variation - are changed through the manipulation of these spatial problems.

===Boundary delineation===
The location of a study area boundary and the positioning of internal boundaries affect various descriptive statistics. With respect to measures such as the mean or standard deviation, the study area size alone may have large implications; consider a study of per capita income within a city, if confined to the inner city, income levels are likely to be lower because of a less affluent population, if expanded to include the suburbs or surrounding communities, income levels will become greater with the influence of homeowner populations. Because of this problem, absolute descriptive statistics such as the mean, standard deviation, and variance should be evaluated comparatively only in relation to a particular study area. In the determination of internal boundaries this is also true, as these statistics may only have valid interpretations for the area and subarea configuration over which they are calculated.

===Modifiable areal units===
''See also'': [[Modifiable areal unit problem]]

In many cases the subdivision of spatial data has already been determined, this is evident in demographic datasets, as the available information will be grouped into their respective counties or municipalities. For this type of data, analysts must use the same county or municipal boundaries delineated in the collected data for their subsequent analysis. When alternate boundaries are possible, an analyst must take into account that any new subdivision model may create different results.
;;

===Spatial aggregation/scale problem===
Socio-economic data may be available at a variety of scales, for example: municipalities, regional districts, census tracts, enumeration districts, or at the provincial/state level. When this data is aggregated at different scales, the resulting descriptive statistics may exhibit variations, either in a systematic, predictable way, or in a more uncertain fashion. If we are observing economic data, we may notice a distinct reduction in manufacturing productivity for a country (the USA) over a certain period; since this is a general model, individual states may experience these effects differently. The result of this aggregation is that the standard deviation of the data in question is increased due to the variability among states.'''

==Descriptive spatial statistics==
:''See main article'' [[Spatial descriptive statistics]]

For summarizing point pattern analysis, a set of descriptive spatial statistics has been developed that are areal equivalents to nonspatial measures. Since geographers are particularly concerned with the analysis of locational data, these descriptive spatial statistics (geostatistics) are often applied to summarize point patterns and to describe the degree of spatial variability of some phenomena.

===Spatial measures of central tendency===
An example here is the idea of a [[center of population]], of which a particular example is the [[mean center of U.S. population]]. Several different ways of defining a center are available:
*Mean center: The mean is an important measure of central tendency, which when extended to a set of points, located on a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the average location, [[centroid]] or mean center, can be determined.
*The weighted mean center is analogous to frequencies in the calculation of grouped statistics, such as the weighted mean. A point may represent a retail outlet, while its frequency will represent the volume of sales within the particular store. 
*Median center or Euclidean center and in the [[median center of United States population]]. This is related to the [[Manhattan distance]].

===Spatial measures of dispersion===
*Standard distance
Just as the [[standard deviation]] indicates how closely the values in a data set are clustered around the mean, so standard distance in a spatial distribution indicates how closely the points are clustered around the mean centre.

*Relative distance

==Topology==
{{Main|Topology}} [[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|right|The Seven Bridges of Königsberg, one of the most famous problems in topology]]

The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the "way they are connected together". One of the first papers in topology was the demonstration, by [[Leonhard Euler]], that it was impossible to find a route through the town of Königsberg (now [[Kaliningrad]]) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges are connected to which islands or riverbanks. This problem, the ''[[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]'', is now a famous problem in introductory mathematics, and led to the branch of mathematics known as [[graph theory]].

===Topology rules===

Topology rules are particularly important within [[GIS]], and are used for a variety of correction and analytical procedures. The primary shapes in GIS are the [[Point (geometry)|point]], [[Line (geometry)|line]], and [[polygon]], each of which implies different spatial characteristics; for instance, the only shape which has a distinguishable inside and outside is the polygon. Principles of connectivity associated with topology lead to applications in [[hydrology]], [[urban planning]], and [[logistics]], as well as other fields; as such, topological analyses offer unique modelling capabilities, defining the vector nature of topological features and correcting spatial data errors from digitizing.

Due to the devolved nature of the United Kingdom, responsibility for managing statistical geographies often falls to the National Statistical Institute with jurisdiction for that devolved administration. For England and Wales this is the [[Office for National Statistics]], for Scotland [[National Records of Scotland]] and for Northern Ireland the [[NISRA|Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency]].

====England and Wales====
The lowest form of statistical geography in England and Wales is the [[Output_area#Geography_of_the_UK_Census|Output Area]]. These are small geographies of approximately 300 people and 100 households for which Census data is published. By containing roughly the same number of people and households it is possible to compare statistics for any two Output Areas in the country, and know that this is being done in a consistent way (unlike comparing statistics for Administrative geographies).

The Output Areas form the smallest part of a hierarchy that consists of [[ONS_Coding_System|Output Areas, Lower Layer Super Output Areas and Middle Layer Super Output Areas]].

England and Wales also have a statistical geography designed specifically for the publication of workplace statistics. This is because Output Areas are built around residential populations and make analysing workplace statistics difficult. Workplace Zones have been released as part of the 2011 Census.

====Scotland====
Like England and Wales, the lowest level of statistical geography in Scotland is the Output Area. Scottish OAs are smaller than those for England and Wales because smaller thresholds are applied, but the methodology for their creation is broadly similar to that used by ONS.

The higher levels are again similar to England and Wales but operate as Data Zones and Intermediate Zones rather than Lower and Middle Layer Super Output Areas.

There are no Workplace Zones for Scotland.

'''The Hague Institute for Global Justice''', or simply '''The Hague Institute''', was an international [[think tank]] based in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Albright-crowns-city-with-new-peace-institute.htm |title=Albright crowns city with new peace institute|accessdate=August 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144443/http://www.denhaag.nl/en/residents/to/Albright-crowns-city-with-new-peace-institute.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was established in 2011 by a consortium of partners including the Municipality of The Hague, an academic coalition of Hague-based organizations and with support from the [[Dutch government]]. Independent and non-partisan, The Hague Institute focused on interdisciplinary research in three perspectives:  [[conflict prevention]], [[rule of law]], and [[global governance]].

[[Abiodun Williams]], former Senior Vice President at the [[U.S. Institute of Peace]] and former Director of Strategic Planning for UN Secretaries-General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Ban Ki-moon]], was the president of The Hague Institute.

Former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine K. Albright]] chaired the Institute’s Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxPjuObF-W8&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Madeleine Albright |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Hague Institute worked at the intersection of peace, security and justice and according to its website, “aims to contribute to, and further strengthen, the global framework for preventing and resolving conflict and promoting international peace.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-About_us&amp;pid=145 |title=About us |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The work of The Hague Institute was organized around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-Our_Work&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and covered a wide range of issues including [[R2P]], education and conflict, climate change, water diplomacy, cyber security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), [[transitional justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs&amp;pid=180 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provided policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=About_Us-Organization-About_us&amp;pid=147 |title=Our Work |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projects===

====Commission on Global Security, Justice &amp; Governance====

The Hague Institute and the [[Stimson Center]], based in Washington, DC gathered "a select group of eminent statespersons and public intellectuals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=43&amp;progid=3&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the cyber-economy. The Commission, later renamed as the [[Albright-Gambari Commission]], convened consultations online and around the world to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in [[Paris]].

====The Hague Approach====

The Hague Approach was intended a flagship project of The Hague Institute. It comprises "six guiding principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Approach:__What_is_it&amp;pid=138&amp;id=121#.UkGfdsanovQ |title=The Hague Approach: What is it? &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the Institute presented The Hague Approach Principles during the [[Peace Palace]] centenary to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-News_Archives-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=159&amp;id=124&amp;jaar=2013 |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; News Archives |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Governance Reform Initiative====

The Global Governance Reform Initiative tackled issues in cyberspace, migration, and oceans. The initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors (government, civil society, international organizations, and business) and geographical regions to address pressing issues in global governance collectively. A three-day conference titled ''The Future of Cyber Governance'' convened in May 2014 and launched the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Future_of_Cyber_Governance&amp;pid=138&amp;id=236 |title=The Future of Cyber Governance &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-05-19 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Diplomacy Consortium (WDC)====

The Water Diplomacy Consortium combined expertise from five Netherlands-based organizations to serve as a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dutchwatersector.com/news-events/news/7134-stockholm-water-week-new-platform-addresses-conflicting-claims-over-fresh-water-use.html |title=Stockholm water week: New platform addresses conflicting claims over fresh water use |publisher=Dutchwatersector.com |date=2013-09-06 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute served as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes [[Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael]], Water Governance Centre, [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, and [[UPEACE]].

====Knowledge Platform Security &amp; Rule of Law====

Consisting of a network of experts and practitioners, the Knowledge Platform focused on building “security and rule of law” in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |title=Our Work|accessdate=September 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927124228/http://www.kpsrl.org/about/our-work |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was originally launched in late spring 2012 by [[Ben Knapen]], former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and International Cooperation. The Hague Institute served as the primary facilitator for the platform’s partners including the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]].

===Public Discussions===
[[File:Hague Institute Flag.jpg|thumb|left|The Hague Institute for Global Justice flag.]]

The Institute organized events and conferences to analyze a broad scope of issues related to conflict prevention, transitional justice, global security and international relations. Expert round tables aim to facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing. The Institute has welcomed Deputy Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] [[Jan Eliasson]], Jurist [[James Crawford (jurist)|James Crawford]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Navi Pillay]], [[Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court|Chief Prosecutor of the ICC]] [[Fatou Bensouda]] and United Nations Special Adviser on the [[Responsibility to Protect]] (R2P) [[Jennifer Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-Whats_Next_for_R2P_Dr_Jennifer_Welsh_on_the_Responsibility_to_Protect&amp;pid=138&amp;id=303 |title=What's Next for R2P?

In November 2013, the Institute launched the "Distinguished Speaker Series." The lecture series invites high-level international experts to discuss topics affecting global progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Programs-&amp;pid=180&amp;id=33&amp;progid=4&amp;fromHome=1 |title=Programs |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers included [[Joschka Fischer]], [[Jim Stavridis]], [[Jan Peter Balkenende]], [[Edi Rama]] and [[Miroslav Lajčák]].

To "stimulate debate about the current course and future trajectory of Dutch foreign policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Effectiveness_of_Dutch_Foreign_Policy:__Defense_and_Development&amp;pid=138&amp;id=204 |title=The Effectiveness of Dutch Foreign Policy: Defense and Development &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Institute gathered leading officials in Dutch government for a series of "Inside View" debates focused on the effectiveness of Dutch foreign policy. On September 10, 2013, the series launched with former Dutch political directors from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands]] exploring the Netherlands' role in international relations, within the EU and at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkingpolitics.org/2013/09/13/part-i-panel-discussion-on-the-effectiveness-of-dutch-foreign-policy/ |title=Part I: Herman Schaper: The loss of domestic consensus on foreign policy and its consequences |publisher=Thinkingpolitics.org |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series continued with former Permanent Representatives to the United Nations on October 24, 2013 and concluded on December 11, 2013 with former Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands addressing present and future challenges of Dutch international relations.

In June 2014, the Institute, in cooperation with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the National Security Archive at [[George Washington University]], convened 35 officials and eyewitnesses for a multi-day conference on the Rwanda Genocide. The event was based on the 'critical oral history' approach. Participants included [[Ibrahim Gambari]], [[Henry Kwami Anyidoho]], Lord [[David Hannay, Baron Hannay of Chiswick|David Hannay]], [[Prudence Bushnell]], [[Michael N. Barnett]] and Lieutenant-General [[Roméo Dallaire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/world/africa/un-cables-reveal-a-turning-point-in-rwanda-crisis.html|title=UN cables Reveal a Turning Point in Rwanda Crisis|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Hague Institute's experts and programs produced a variety publications based on research and analysis on a scope of issues affecting global justice. These publications aimed to inform policymakers, academics, experts and the general public. In June 2014, the Institute launched a working paper series to complement its existing publication series of Policy Briefs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179#policybriefs |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Commentary&amp;pid=174 |title=Recent Commentary |doi=10.1017/S0020589314000438 |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working paper series aimed to "contribute original research of the highest quality to scholarly and policy debates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=Publications&amp;pid=179 |title=Publications |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working papers addressed [[just war theory]], sanctions against [[Iran]] and the relationship between constitutional law and [[global governance]].

In August 2013, the Institute published ''The Hague Approach Principles,'' six principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations, and a comparative study of rule of law efforts in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] titled, ''Promoting the Rule of Law in Peacebuilding: Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq''. Both publications, based on empirical evidence, were presented at the centennial celebrations of the [[Peace Palace]] in The Hague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org/index.php?page=News-News_Articles-Recent_News-The_Hague_Institute_Commemorates_Peace_Palace_Centenary&amp;pid=138&amp;id=124#.UjmtQsanovQ |title=The Hague Institute Commemorates Peace Palace Centenary &amp;#124; Recent News |publisher=Thehagueinstituteforglobaljustice.org |accessdate=2015-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hague Approach Principles have subsequently been endorsed by current and former UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and [[Jan Eliasson]].

The Hague Institute produced a biannual magazine called ''Intersections'', which highlighted activities of the Institute and featured columns from public figures working at the intersection of peace, security and global justice issues. Previous contributors to the magazine include, [[Madeleine Albright]], [[Michael Kirby (judge)]], [[Fatou Bensouda]] and [[Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert]]. The magazine was published biannually.

== Alleged mismanagement at The Hague Institute for Global Justice ==
On January 1, 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor [[Willem van Genugten]] who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine [[De Groene Amsterdammer]] (4th April 2018), sources told the magazine that Williams insisted that the position of 'international dean' had to be restyled as 'president', in addition to a very high financial compensation package in order to lend him greater authority and benefits. &lt;ref name="groene"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/he-just-didn-t-seem-to-care|title=Hoe het Haagse Institute for Global Justice 20 miljoen subsidie verspeelde|work=De Groene Amsterdammer|access-date=2018-04-04|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch government granted up to 20 million Euros in subsidies for the Institute. According to staff members, Williams neglected fund raising, and spent considerable amounts of Institute funds on questionable expenses such as first class airfare, 5-star hotel rooms and long taxi rides not visibly related to the Institute's business, a claim confirmed by accounting firms. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krant.volkskrant.nl/?code=ST-725912-lg2Pi2ZtUBH224zGAop3-caps.volkskrant.nl&amp;state=paperId(90247),zone(NL)#/paper|title=de Volkskrant Krant Online|website=krant.volkskrant.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher citied, Williams distanced himself from staff whenever he felt challenged: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.'&lt;ref name="groene" /&gt; 

Reports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016.  In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he also took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.&lt;ref&gt;Irene van der Linde and Tjitske Lingsma, "The Death of a White Elephant," International Justice Tribune, 6 April 2018, https://www.justicetribune.com/articles/death-white-elephant-hague&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear.&lt;ref name="vk1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/geldnood-nekt-prestigieuze-haagse-denktank-toezichthouder-greep-te-laat-in~a4588737/|title=Geldnood nekt prestigieuze Haagse denktank, toezichthouder greep te laat in|last=Koelé|first=Theo|website=De Volkskrant|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which last year already moved into the spacious building in The Hague where the last researcher of the Hague Institute for Global Justice left just before Easter. Williams’ mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute.&lt;ref name="vk1" /&gt;

Following the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties posed questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, [[Eric Wiebes]]. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/kamervragen/detail?id=2018Z06289&amp;did=2018D23370|title=De frauduleuze ondergang van het The Hague Institute for Global Justice|website=www.tweedekamer.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum voor Democratie]] (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kv-tk-2018Z06381.html|title=Het financiële fiasco rondom het Haagse Institute for Global Justice (IGJ)|last=Staten-Generaal|first=Tweede Kamer der|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Paternotte from the social liberal [[Democrats 66|D66]] asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse Coopers]] exposed the financial mismanagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/algemeen/5206955/d66-pvda-en-fvd-willen-opheldering-geldverkwisting-haagse-denktank.html|title=D66, PvdA en FvD willen opheldering over 'geldverkwisting' Haagse denktank {{!}} NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=www.nu.nl|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In April 2018, The Hague Institute for Global Justice closed down after becoming insolvent, reportedly caused by poor leadership from President Abiodun Williams, serious mismanagement, and lack of proper oversight of President Williams by the Advisory Board led by Dick Benschop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2018/04/the-hague-global-justice-institute-closes-due-to-lack-of-funding/ The Hague global justice institute closes due to lack of funding]; Dutchnews.nl; 4 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of New Hampshire''' ('''UNH''') is a [[public research university]] in the [[University System of New Hampshire]], in the United States. The university's [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] campus, comprising six colleges, is located in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast region]] of the state. A seventh college, the [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]], occupies the university's campus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], the state's largest city. The [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], known as the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] until 2010, is located in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], the state's capital.

The University of New Hampshire was founded and incorporated in 1866, as a [[land grant college]]  in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]] in connection with [[Dartmouth College]]. In 1893, UNH moved to [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]].

With over 15,000 students between its Durham, Manchester, and Concord campuses, UNH is the largest university in the state. UNH is one of only a few universities that is designated a [[Land-grant university|land-]], [[Sea grant colleges|sea-]], and [[Space grant college|space-grant]] institution. The university's current President is [[James W. Dean Jr.]], the 20th President of the University, who took over from [[Mark Huddleston]] on June 30, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2018/04/04/james-w-dean-jr-named-20th-president-university-new-hampshire|title=James W.

== History ==
[[File:Thompson Hall, UNH Sunset.jpg|thumb|[[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], built in 1892, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].]] 
[[File:Morrill Hall, UNH.jpg|thumb|right|Morrill Hall c. 1920]]
[[File:Durham NH 001.jpg|thumb|Pettee Hall c. 2005]]
The [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 granted federal lands to New Hampshire for the establishment of an agricultural-mechanical college. In 1866, the university was first incorporated as the '''[[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]]''' in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in association with [[Dartmouth College]]. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth College and was directed by Dartmouth's president. Durham resident [[Benjamin Thompson (farmer)|Benjamin Thompson]] left his farm and assets to the state for the establishment of an agricultural college. On January 30, 1890, Benjamin Thompson died and his will became public. On March 5, 1891 Gov. Hiram Americus Tuttle signed an act accepting the conditions of Thompson's will. On April 10, 1891, Gov. Tuttle signed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] authorizing the college's move to [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

In 1892, the Board of Trustees hired [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] to draw a site plan for the first five campus buildings: Thompson, Conant, Nesmith, and Hewitt Shops (now called Halls) and the Dairy Barn. Eliot visited Durham and worked for three months to create a plan prior to the move to Durham. The Class of 1892, excited about the pending move to Durham, held commencement exercises in an unfinished barn on the Durham campus. On April 18, 1892, the Board of Trustees voted to "authorize the faculty to make all the arrangements for the packing and removal of college property at Hanover to Durham." The Class of 1893, followed the previous class and held commencement exercises in unfinished [[Thompson Hall (University of New Hampshire)|Thompson Hall]], the [[Romanesque Revival]] campus centerpiece designed by the prominent [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architectural firm of [[Edward Dow (architect)|Dow &amp; Randlett]].

In fall 1893, classes officially began in Durham with 51 [[First year|freshmen]] and 13 upperclassmen, which was three times the projected enrollment. Graduate study was also established in fall 1893 for the first time. The number of students and the lack of state funds for dormitories caused a housing crunch and forced students to find housing in town. The lack of housing caused difficulty for attracting women to the university. In 1908, construction on Smith Hall, the first women's dorm, was completed using private and state funds. Prior to the construction of Fairchild Hall in 1915 for male students, 50 freshmen lived in the basement of DeMerritt Hall. With the continuing housing shortage for men, the administration encouraged the growth of the UNH [[Greek system]]. From the late 1910s through the 1930s, the fraternity system expanded and provided room and board for male students.

In 1923, Gov. Fred Herbert Brown signed a bill changing the name of the college to '''University of New Hampshire'''.

In the spring of 2015, the university was given $4 million from the estate of [[Robert Morin (librarian)|Robert Morin]], who had been a librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unh.edu/unhtoday/news/release/2016/08/30/long-time-librarian-surprises-unh-4-million-gift|title=Long-Time Librarian Surprises UNH with $4 Million Gift|date=August 30, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/15/494134464/-1-million-of-frugal-librarians-bequest-to-n-h-school-goes-to-football-scoreboar|title=$1 Million Of Frugal Librarian's Bequest To N.H.

[[File:UNHGrad.jpg|thumb|right|[[Graduation|Commencement]] ceremonies at the University of New Hampshire, on May 19, 2007]]
The University of New Hampshire is the flagship of the University System of New Hampshire. UNH is composed of eleven [[college]]s and graduate schools, offering 2,000 courses in over 100 majors. The eight colleges of UNH are:

* College of [[Engineering]] and [[Physical science|Physical Sciences]] (CEPS)
* College of [[Liberal Arts]] (COLA)
* College of [[Life Sciences]] and [[Agriculture]] (COLSA)
* Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS)
* College of [[Health]] and Human Services (CHHS)
* [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] (UNHM)
* UNH Graduate School
* [[Whittemore School of Business and Economics|Peter T. Paul College of Business and Economics]] (PCBE), formerly the Whittemore School of Business and Economics (WSBE)
* [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]]
* Carsey School of Public Policy
* School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering

The university is a member of the [[New England Board of Higher Education]]'s New England Regional Student Program (NERSP) where New England public universities and colleges offer a number of undergraduate curricula with special considerations to students from other New England states. If an out-of-state student's home state school does not offer a certain degree program offered by UNH, that student can receive the in-state tuition rate, plus 75 percent if enrolled in the program.

The Thompson School of [[Applied Science]] (TSAS), first established in 1895 and now a division of COLSA, confers an [[associate degree]] in applied science in seven different programs: Applied Animal Science, Applied Business Management, Civil Technology, Community Leadership, Food Service Management, Forest Technology, and Horticultural Technology.

The coastal proximity of the university affords excellent programs in [[marine biology]] and [[oceanography]]. Facilities include the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory at Adams Point in Durham, and the [[Shoals Marine Laboratory]] jointly operated with [[Cornell University]] on [[Appledore Island]] in the [[Isles of Shoals]].

The [[University of New Hampshire Observatory]] is operated by the Department of Physics for educational purposes.

There are three main university-wide undergraduate research programs: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF), and International Research Opportunities Program (IROP).

The university offers many opportunities for students to study abroad through managed programs, exchange programs and approved programs.

== Presidential commissions ==

As with many other universities, the office of the President at UNH has tasked several commissions to gather facts and propose solutions to various issues on campus. Many of these commissions deal with social issues on campus, such as the status of People of Color, People with Disabilities, and LGBTQ. These various commissions are staffed by administrators, faculty, and community members. The commissions meet monthly and report to the President, providing updates on the campus environment, suggesting and improving programs, and working with students, faculty, and outside organizations to improve the quality of life on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unh.edu/inclusive/presidents-commissions/wc|title=Status of Women|date=2017-07-13|work=Community, Equity and Diversity|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326022216/https://www.unh.edu/inclusive/presidents-commissions/wc|archive-date=March 26, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underrepresented students==
===Diversity Support Coalition===

The student led Diversity Support Coalition (DSC) mission aims to offer resources to groups “affected by institutionalized oppression based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and expression, age, ability, native language, national origin, and/or religion at UNH”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diversity Support Coalition|url=https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|website=WildcatLink|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427044531/https://wildcatlink.unh.edu/organization/DSC|archive-date=April 27, 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSC promotes, educates, and supports multiculturalism, diversity, and equality at UNH through programming efforts and support of the six student organizations within the DSC. The six member groups are Alliance, The Black Student Union, Hillel, Mosaico, The Native American Cultural Association, and The United Asian Coalition. Participation in the DSC is open to all UNH students. The DSC encourages student organizations with similar needs be recognized under the Diversity Support Coalition and may due so by submitting a petition within the guidelines for the DSC constitution. The total membership of the DSC is 200 individuals.

In addition to the six organizations within the DSC, UNH students run over a dozen groups for the purpose of multiculturalism and peer reference groups. Groups include women in professional fields, country or geographic specific cultural clubs, and international student clubs.

=== Women ===

Multiple organizations on campus are focused on providing women in professional fields access to relational and ideational resources promoting success. Women focused groups on campus include Her Campus, UNH Data Driven Women, Women in Business, Society of Woman Engineers, and Women in Science.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/career/career-resources-women&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural clubs ===

Culturally focused groups on campus include Desi Student Association, Japanese Cultural Club, Indonesian Student Association, International Student Organization Middle Eastern Cultural Association, Russian Cultural Club and Vietnamese Student Association. These groups often host events to educate the student body on their cultures and to welcome experts of ancestral crafts. Conversely, the Committee on Rights and Justice (CORAJ) partners UNH student's with local immigrant families, helping them with the naturalization process.

=== International students ===

The University instituted the [[Navitas Group|Navitas program]] in 2011 to expand the amount of international students at the school. This expanded over the years into the Global Student Success Program (GSSP). The GSSP, in cooperation with the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), gives students the support to “help discover opportunities at UNH to immerse in American culture and share your own traditions with others from the U.S. and from around the globe”.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/global/international-students&lt;/ref&gt; The programs guide students through the application process and the extent of their career.

During Fall 2015, UNH enrolled 298 Students from 34 different countries. The most common countries of origin are the People's Republic of China, Canada, and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Profile|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|website=University of New Hampshire Office of Admissions|publisher=University of New Hampshire|accessdate=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810024821/http://admissions.unh.edu/sites/default/files/media/pdf/unh_2016_profile_with_2015-2016_tuition_3.pdf|archive-date=August 10, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also offers intensive English language education for students through the ESL Institute. As well as advancing student’s knowledge of English as a second-language one of the goals of the ESL Institute is to “to provide students with the cultural knowledge and awareness needed to function satisfactorily, both academically and socially, in the United States”.&lt;ref&gt;https://cola.unh.edu/esl-institute/mission-statement&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2015 year the university had almost 300 students representing the school from over 30 countries.

===First-generation college students===
Begun in 1994, UNH Connect is a program where FGCS (and multicultural students) are given a jump-start to the experiences of college life with a summer pre-orientation program aimed at social connection and comfortability with college life. Each student is assigned a peer mentor who helps with the transition to their freshman year. The program, with 100 students in 2014, also gives FGCS an opportunity to meet people in similar situations prior to the beginning of college.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/orientation/connect/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center For Academic Resources (CFAR) also offers a program called TRIO that is partially funded by the US Department of Education. TRIO is intended for students who are FGCS, have a disability, or are in extreme financial need. Through the TRIO program you can receive services to help understand options for future careers as well as advice with financial aspects of college most FGCS would not have home support with. These include academic tutoring, assistance with student loans, scholarship advise, individual counseling, career planning, and many more. In the 2017-18 school year the UNH TRIO program was funded for 200 students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unh.edu/cfar/triostudent-support-services&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The University of New Hampshire offers two undergraduate degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts in music and the Bachelor of Music; and two graduate degree programs: the Master of Arts in music (concentrations in composition, conducting, and musicology), and the Master of Arts in teaching.

==Athletics==
{{main|New Hampshire Wildcats}}
[[File:Whittemore Center, UNH 2.jpg|thumb|Whittemore Center]]
The school's athletic teams are the [[University of New Hampshire Wildcats|Wildcats]], and they compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. New Hampshire is a member of the [[America East Conference]] for [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and [[tennis]]; and women's [[lacrosse]], [[crew]], [[field hockey]], and [[volleyball]]. The women's gymnastics&lt;ref&gt;[http://unhwildcats.com/index.aspx?path=wgym women's gymnastics]&lt;/ref&gt; program competes in the Eastern Atlantic Gymnastics League at the Division I level. They also compete in [[Hockey East]] in men's and women's [[ice hockey]], Eastern Collegiate Ski Association for skiing, as well as the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] for [[American football|football]] at the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly known as [[Division I-AA]]) level.

In the 2006 academic year the university cut women's crew, men's swimming &amp; diving, and men's and women's tennis at the varsity level, and trimmed the size of the men's ski team from 27 to 12. Luckily the UNH men's ski team was not cut, as they remain one of the top powerhouse teams in the nation. In 2013, the men's alpine team placed second  at the NCAA championships. The reason given was that the athletic department would save $500,000 towards a $1 million budget shortfall and be in compliance with [[Title IX]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219141044/http://www.unhwildcats.com/pres0506/013106.shtml|date=February 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the university cut baseball, softball, men's and women's golf, and men's lacrosse.

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through the Department of Campus Recreation, including [[aikido]], [[archery]], [[baseball]], [[crew]], [[cycling]], [[dance]], [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], [[figure skating]], [[golf]], men's [[lacrosse]], [[Nordic skiing]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[sailing]], [[softball]], [[tennis]], [[taekwondo]], men and women's Ultimate Frisbee,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate| last1=Johnson| first1=Cameron| title=Ultimate Frisbee: Sisters of Oriza: A look inside women's Ultimate| work=[[The New Hampshire]]| date=November 7, 2014| accessdate=November 12, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012085115/https://thenewhampshire.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/ultimate-frisbee-sisters-of-oriza-a-look-inside-womens-ultimate/| archive-date=October 12, 2015| dead-url=yes| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], and the Woodsmen Club. Many of these clubs compete either on an intercollegiate basis with New England teams, or sponsor university tournaments and frequently participate in national championships. UNH also offers horseback riding as a recreation. Many students can take horseback riding lessons with instructors, on their horse or the schools. UNH holds many events each year, for they have a large cross country course. UNH also has a [[dressage]] team and a hunt seat team that competes yearly.

The school's official colors are [[blue]] and [[white]]. The school's official mascot is the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] and its uniformed mascot is known as "[[Wild E. Cat]]".

The recognized [[fight song]] of UNH is "[[On to Victory (song)|On to Victory]]", the most current version of which was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998–2003. In 2003, "UNH Cheer" (originally titled "Cheer Boys") was resurrected from the university archives by Erika Svanoe, Director of Athletic Bands from 2003-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.erikasvanoe.com/conducting.html| title=Professional Experience| publisher=ErikaSvanoe.com| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the school song "Old New Hampshire", not to be confused with the [[Old New Hampshire|New Hampshire state song]] of the same name, "UNH Cheer" currently serves as a secondary fight song and is often performed immediately following "On to Victory".

On October 7, 2006, Wildcats [[wide receiver]] [[David Ball (wide receiver)|David Ball]] tallied the 51st receiving [[touchdown]] of his career to displace [[Jerry Rice]] of [[Mississippi Valley State University]], who was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] a month earlier, atop the ranking of NCAA Division I and I-AA players by career receiving touchdowns. He later signed as a [[rookie]] [[free agent]] with the [[Chicago Bears]] and played with well-known college football players [[Chris Leak]] and [[Darius Walker]].

==Durham campus==
[[File:CongreveAcrossTHall.JPG|thumb|left|Congreve Hall]]The University of New Hampshire is located in the town of [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], and is a "traditional New England campus." The Durham campus is {{convert|1100|acre|km2}}, with {{convert|300|acre|km2}} in the "campus core" and {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of open land on the west edge of campus. The campus core is considered to be the university property within a 10-minute walk from Thompson Hall, the symbolic and near-geographic center of campus. The campus core contains many of the academic and residential buildings, while the outer campus contains much of the agriculture land and buildings. The university owns a total of {{convert|2600|acre|km2}} of land.

===Housing===

[[File:Durham NH 011.jpg|thumb|left|Babcock Hall]]
The university offers all underclassmen the opportunity to live in university housing. As of 2006, the university housed 55% of all undergraduate students. While not required to live on campus freshman year, students are strongly encouraged to; as of the fall 2009 semester over 99% of incoming freshmen chose to live on campus, and over 70% of returning sophomores did as well.

The university offers students a choice of traditional dorm rooms, suites, and on-campus apartments. The university's Campus Master Plan envisions housing about 60% of undergraduates, requiring an addition of 1700 beds. However, the state of New Hampshire does not provide funding for non-academically related buildings, including dormitories.

Undergraduate housing is divided into three areas: The Hills, The Valley and The Timbers (formerly Area I, Area II and Area III, respectively). There are also two undergraduate apartment complexes, The Gables and Woodside Apartments. The university offers family housing in the Forest Park apartments and graduate housing in Babcock Hall. The second oldest dorm on campus is Hetzel Hall, named after the university's former president [[Ralph D. Hetzel]]. Built in 1925, it is located near downtown Durham.

For the fall 2006 semester, two new buildings at The Gables ("North" and "South") were opened, providing an additional 400 beds. In summer 2006, one-half of Forest Park was demolished to make way for two new buildings (A &amp; B) of the Southeast Residential Community (SERC). Buildings SERC A and SERC B have provided housing for 492 students since fall 2007. Two existing mini-dorms were demolished during summer 2007 (leaving four more mini-dorms) to construct a third building, SERC C, which has provided housing for 235 students since fall 2008. SERC A, B, and C are now referred to as Handler, Peterson, and Haaland Hall. Plans exist to provide 781 new beds by demolishing the remaining 9 buildings (98 units) in Forest Park. Later plans call for the construction of a new 170-unit graduate housing facility at a location to be determined.

Due to the over-enrollment of the 2006–2007 academic year, the university offered students who intended to live in campus housing a free parking pass for the academic year, credit in UNH "Dining Dollars" and a refund of the housing deposit given that the student withdrew their intentions to live on campus. The incentive was designed to free up space for the large incoming freshman class.

Stoke Hall is the largest residence building on campus. It houses a little over 700 undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/stoke-hall| title=Stoke Hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, UNH installed life-saving [[automated external defibrillator]]s in two fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = UNH installs AEDs in fraternity houses| url = http://www.wmur.com/news/unh-installs-aeds-in-fraternity-houses/36336182| publisher = [[WMUR]]| accessdate = November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themed housing===
The University of New Hampshire offers themed housing options for students interested in choosing a living environment that best suits their personality. Common themes include: first year, leadership, green living, multi-cultural, honors, chem-free, alcohol and drug-free and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.residential-life.unh.edu/living/hallsandthemes.html |title=Living on Campus – Theme Living Communities |publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housing is guaranteed to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and [[Williamson Hall]], the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Alexander Hall| url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/facility/alexander-hall| publisher=University of New Hampshire Housing &amp; Residential Life| accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) lose this guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester in order to be considered for on-campus housing the following semester.&lt;ref name=wait-list&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |title=UNH Housing Waitlist Process |publisher=Unh.edu |date=February 29, 2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701173600/http://unh.edu/housing/process/waitlist.html |archive-date=July 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfer students can generally get on campus housing if transferring to UNH for the spring semester (but must submit a completed housing wait-list application prior to transferring);&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt; however, transfer students&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://admissions.unh.edu/transfer|title=Transfer Students|date=2016-02-03|work=Undergraduate Admissions|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; transferring for the fall semester have a relatively low chance of getting on campus housing due to the high demand of returning students, and the incoming freshman class. Transfer students are also not guaranteed housing, unless transferring from a community college after graduating with their associates.&lt;ref name=wait-list/&gt;

==Manchester campus==
[[File:Manch-mills-westside.jpg|thumb|right|The north end of the Amoskeag Millyard, on the [[Merrimack River]]]]
[[File:Manch-DownTown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown [[Manchester, NH|Manchester]], looking south along Elm Street]]
As of March 2015, [[University of New Hampshire at Manchester]] is located in the {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} Pandora Mill at 88 Commercial Street, on the banks of the [[Merrimack River]] in Manchester's historic [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company|Amoskeag Millyard]]. The move to 88 Commercial Street increased the physical plant of the college by almost 50%, as from 2001 to 2014 the school was located in the {{convert|75000|sqft|adj=on}} University Center building at 400 Commercial Street.

==National Historic Chemical Landmark==
Conant Hall was dedicated as a [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|National Historical Chemical Landmark]]—the first in New Hampshire. Conant Hall was the first chemistry building on the Durham campus, and it was the headquarters of the [[American Chemical Society]] from 1907–1911, when Charles Parsons was the society’s secretary. In addition, from 1906–1928, the hall housed the laboratories of Charles James, who was an innovative developer of separation and analytical methods for compounds of rare earth elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=925&amp;content_id=CTP_004295&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=7645e5b7-59c9-4b73-afa0-fd8a2804bfeb  ACS National Historic Chemical Landmark], Separation of Rare Earth Elements (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; James Hall, the second chemistry building on campus, was named for Charles James.
