      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9449">'''Airflow,''' or '''air flow''' is the movement of air from one area to another. The primary cause of airflow is the existence of [[pressure gradient]]s. Air behaves in a [[fluid]] manner, meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower. [[Atmospheric pressure|Atmospheric air pressure]] is directly related to altitude, temperature, and composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/winds-and-the-pressure-gradient-force-1434440|title=How Do Air Pressure Differences Cause Winds?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ASHRAE, ed. ''ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2017''. Atlanta, GA: American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[engineering]], airflow is a measurement of the amount of [[air]] per unit of time that flows through a particular device.

The flow of air can be induced through mechanical means (such as by operating an electric or manual fan) or can take place passively, as a function of pressure differentials present in the environment.

== Types of airflow ==
Like any fluid, air may exhibit both [[Laminar flow|laminar]] and [[Turbulence|turbulent]] flow patterns.  Laminar flow occurs when air can flow smoothly, and exhibits a [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation|parabolic velocity profile]]; turbulent flow occurs when there is an irregularity (such as a disruption in the surface across which the fluid is flowing), which alters the direction of movement. Turbulent flow exhibits a flat velocity profile.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Reynolds number]], a ratio indicating the relationship between [[Viscosity|viscous]] and inertial forces in a fluid, can be used to predict the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. This number and related concepts can be applied to studying flow in systems of all scales.

The speed at which a fluid flows past an object varies with distance from the object's surface. The region surrounding an object where the air speed approaches zero is known as the [[boundary layer]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/aerodynamics.html|title=Aerodynamics - Introduction to the science of air flow|work=Explain that Stuff|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is here that surface friction most affects flow; irregularities in surfaces may affect boundary layer thickness, and hence act to disrupt flow.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Units==
Typical units to express airflow are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comairrotron.com/airflow-unit-conversion |title=Airflow Unit Conversion |publisher=Comairrotron.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By volume===
* l/s ([[litre]]s per [[second]])
* m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h ([[cubic metre]]s per [[hour]])
* ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hr ([[Cubic foot|cubic feet]] per hour)

===By mass===
* kg/s ([[kilogram]]s per [[second]])
Airflow can also be described in terms of [[air changes per hour]] (ACH), indicating full replacement of the volume of air filling the space in question.

==Measurement==
The instrument that measures airflow is called an [[airflow meter]]. [[Anemometer]]s are also used to measure wind speed and indoor airflow.

There are a variety of types, including straight probe anemometers, designed to measure air velocity, differential pressure, temperature, and humidity; rotating vane anemometers, used for measuring air velocity and volumetric flow; and hot-sphere anemometers.&lt;ref&gt;Melikov, Arsen K., Z. Popiolek, M. C. G. Silva, I. Care, and T. Siefker. "Accuracy limitations for low-velocity measurements and draft assessment in rooms." ''HVAC&amp;R Research'' 13, no. 6 (2007): 971-986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anemometers may use ultrasound or resistive wire to measure the energy transfer between the measurement device and the passing particles. A hot-wire anemometer, for example, registers decreases in wire temperature, which can be translated into airflow velocity by analyzing the rate of change. Some tools are capable of calculating air flow, wet bulb temperature, dew point, and turbulence.

== Simulation ==
Air flow can be simulated using [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) modeling, or observed experimentally through the operation of a [[wind tunnel]]'''.''' This may be used to predict airflow patterns around automobiles, aircraft, and marine craft, as well as air penetration of a building envelope.

==Control==
One type of equipment that regulates the airflow in ducts is called a [[Damper (flow)|damper]]. The damper can be used to increase, decrease or completely stop the flow of air. A more complex device that can not only regulate the airflow but also has the ability to generate and condition airflow is an [[air handler]].

==Uses==
Measuring the airflow is necessary in many applications such as [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] (to determine how much air is being replaced) and engines (to control the [[Air–fuel ratio]]).

Aerodynamics is the branch of [[Fluid dynamics|fluid dynamics (physics)]] that is specifically concerned with the measurement, simulation, and control of airflow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Managing airflow is of concern to many fields, including [[meteorology]], [[aeronautics]], medicine,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oac.med.jhmi.edu/res_phys/Encyclopedia/AirFlow/AirFlow.HTML|title=Air Flow|website=oac.med.jhmi.edu|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mechanical engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]] and [[building science]].

== Airflow in buildings ==
In building science, airflow is often addressed in terms of its desirability, for example in contrasting [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]]. Ventilation is defined as the desired flow of fresh outdoor supply air to another, typically indoor, space, along with the simultaneous expulsion of exhaust air from indoors to the outdoors. This may be achieved through mechanical means or through passive strategies (also known as [[natural ventilation]]). By contrast, [[Infiltration (HVAC)|air infiltration]] is characterized as the uncontrolled influx of air through an inadequately-sealed building envelope, usually coupled with unintentional leakage of conditioned air from the interior of a building to the exterior.&lt;ref&gt;Axley, James W. “Residential Passive Ventilation Systems: Evaluation and Design.” ''Air Infiltration and Ventilation Center, Tech Note'' 54 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Buildings may be ventilated using mechanical systems, passive systems or strategies, or a combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;Schiavon, S. (2014), Adventitious ventilation: a new definition for an old mode?. Indoor Air, 24: 557–558. doi:10.1111/ina.12155&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airflow in mechanical ventilation systems ([[HVAC]]) ===
Mechanical ventilation uses fans to induce flow of air into and through a building. Duct configuration and assembly affect air flow rates through the system. Dampers, valves, joints and other geometrical or material changes within a duct can lead to flow losses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Passive strategies for maximizing airflow ===
Passive ventilation strategies take advantage of inherent characteristics of air, specifically thermal buoyancy and pressure differentials, to evacuate exhaust air from within a building. [[Stack effect]] equates to using chimneys or similar tall spaces with openings near the top to passively draw exhaust air up and out of the space, thanks to the fact that air will rise when its temperature increases (as the volume increases and pressure decreases). Wind-driven passive ventilation relies on building configuration, orientation, and aperture distribution to take advantage of outdoor air movement. [[Cross ventilation|Cross-ventilation]] requires strategically-positioned openings aligned with local wind patterns.

=== Relationship of air movement to thermal comfort and overall Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) ===
Airflow is a factor of concern when designing to meet occupant thermal comfort standards (such as [[ASHRAE 55]]). Varying rates of air movement may positively or negatively impact individuals’ perception of warmth or coolness, and hence their comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Toftum, Jørn. “Air Movement–good or Bad?” ''Indoor Air'' 14 (2004): 40–45. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00271.x&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Air velocity interacts with air temperature, relative humidity, radiant temperature of surrounding surfaces and occupants, and occupant skin conductivity, resulting in particular thermal sensations.

Sufficient, properly-controlled and designed airflow (ventilation) is important for overall [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/default.html Indoor Environmental Quality] (IEQ) and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), in that it provides the necessary supply of fresh air and effectively evacuates exhaust air.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Akshamsaddin''' (Muhammad Shams al-Din bin Hamzah, {{lang-tr|Ak Şemsettin}}) (b. 1389, [[Damascus]] - d. 16 February 1459, [[Göynük]], [[Bolu]]), was an influential [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[alim|religious scholar]], poet, and mystic [[wali|saint]]. He was an influential [[Lala (title)|tutor]] and adviser to Emperor [[Mehmed the Conqueror]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8824/ A Part of the Eyoub (i.e., Uyüp) Cemetery, I, Constantinople, Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dergipark.ulakbim.gov.tr/abuifd/article/view/5000114392 Sûfîlere Yöneltilen Tenkitlere Bir Cevap: Akşemseddin ve Def‘U Metâini’s-Sûfiyye İsimli Eseri]&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his work with his master Shaykh [[Haji Bayram Wali]], he founded the Shamsiyya-[[Bayramiyya]] [[Sufi]] order. He discovered the lost grave of [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] (the [[sahabi|companion]] of [[Muhammad]]) in [[Constantinople]] preceding the [[Siege of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Murtaza Gürsoy: ''Meşhur Eyüp Sultan'' (The famous Ayyub Sultan), pp. 179-180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Athir: ''Usudul Ghaba'' (Lions of the Jungle), v. 2, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Istiab, v. 1, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Akshamsaddin and medicine==
In addition to his fame in religious sciences and [[Tasawwuf]], Akshemsaddin was popular in the fields of [[medicine]] and [[pharmacology]]. There is not much reference to how he acquired this knowledge, but the [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Elias John Wilkinson Gibb]] notes in his work ''History of Ottoman Poetry'' that Akshamsaddin learned from Haji Bayram Wali during his years with him.&lt;ref&gt;Elias John Wilkinson Gibb: ''History of Ottoman Poetry''. London, 1900-1909, v. 3, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Akshamsaddin was also knowledgeable in the treatment of [[psychological disorder|psychological]] and [[spiritual disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Taşköprülüzâde: ''Şakayık-ı Nûmâniye'', v. 1, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nezihe Araz: ''Anadolu Evliyaları''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nişancızâde Muhammed bin Ahmed: ''Mirat-ı Kâinat'', p. 556&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emir Hüseyin Enîsî: ''Menâkıb-ı Akşemseddin'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;İslam Ansiklopedisi, v. 1, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of the microbe===
Akshamsaddin mentioned the [[microbe]] in his work ''Maddat ul-Hayat'' (The Material of Life) about two centuries prior to [[Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek]]'s discovery through experimentation:
{{cquote|It is incorrect to assume that diseases appear one by one in humans. Disease infects by spreading from one person to another. This infection occurs through seeds that are so small they cannot be seen but are alive.&lt;ref&gt;Taşköprülüzâde: ''Shaqaiq-e Numaniya'', v. 1, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osman Şevki Uludağ: ''Beş Buçuk Asırlık Türk Tabâbet Tarihi'' (Five and a Half Centuries of Turkish Medical History). Istanbul, 1969, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Early life==
Jones was born in [[Wales]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/YuiZYGjrAri7jbENxncPblwarsA/appointments Companies House - Appointments - Alan Hywel Jones], checked 26 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and attended school in [[Ebbw Vale]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://chemicalsj10.imascientist.org.uk/profile/hyweljones I'n a scientist - Profile - HywelJones]&lt;/ref&gt; about {{convert|37|km}} north of Cardiff.

==Education and career==
===Academic career===
Jones studied at the [[University of Warwick]] from 1988 to 1997, receiving a BSc in Physics (1991), an MSc in Materials Characterisation (1993), and a PhD on the &lt;em&gt;Synthesis and Tribology of Sialon / TiB2 Ceramic Composite&lt;/em&gt; (1997).  He then secured a post as a post-doctoral research fellow and worked over three years on an EU-funded project on ultra-hard composites for tribological applications.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;

Jones moved to a post at [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam University's]] Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI) in 2000, and continues to work there.  He became a senior consultant in 2004, then a senior research fellow, and is now a principal research fellow.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;   He coordinates the consultancy activities of the institute, and has been involved in several hundred projects.&lt;ref name="SHUStaffatMC"/&gt;
Jones worked from 2008 to 2012 on UK [[Ministry of Defence]]-funded research into novel light-weight ceramic composite materials for personal armour,&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt; which in turn extended into armour-piercing ammunition, as well as kiln surfaces and high-wear industrial fittings.

His roles have also included membership in the Education and Skills Working Group of Materials UK, which produced a report on a 20-year strategy for UK materials science,&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt; the "What's in my stuff" public outreach and education campaign around recycling, and work as an expert witness in civil and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="SHUProfile"/&gt;

====Recognition====
Jones was a joint recipient of the Venture Prize of the [[Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers]], one of the ancient livery companies of London, for work on lightweight ceramic body armour, an award linked to the launch of university spin-off venture XeraCarb.&lt;ref name="SHUMERIProfile"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www4.shu.ac.uk/research/meri/dr-hywel-jones|title=Dr Hywel Jones - Materials and Engineering Research Institute - Sheffield Hallam University|website=www4.shu.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
He was also a recipient of a [[Yorkshire Forward]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/success-1400-times-over-1-236016|title=Success 1400 times over|website=www.thestar.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armourershall.co.uk/venture-prize/previous-venture-prize-winners|title=Previous Venture Prize Winners|website=Armourers' Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborations====
Jones has worked closely with several fellow scientists and academics, including Anthony Pick, Karen Vernon-Parry, [[Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill]] and Maria Hanson.

===Consultancy and commercialisation===
In 2011, Jones co-founded a university spinoff company, XeraCarb Ltd., with Anthony Pick.  With headquarters and factory in [[Barnsley]], the company works on silicon carbide composite ceramics, suitable for body armour and kiln linings, among other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://relationshipscience.com/sheffield-hallam-university-o584741|title=Sheffield Hallam University - Relationship Science|website=relationshipscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following acquisition, the company has since February 2017 operated as part of Capital Refractories, within the CRL Group, with Jones retained as Chief Scientific Officer.

In 2016, Jones co-founded, with Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill and others, Mikana Innovations Ltd., a spin-off based on joint work between Sheffield Hallam University and Rotary Engineering Ltd.; he is today a director.  This company produces a hybrid alloy, &lt;em&gt;mikana&lt;/em&gt;, based on Japanese craft techniques, suitable for volume production for the making of jewellery and other luxury items, and hollowware.

====Advanced materials====
Jones has worked on a form of "stainless silver" alloy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1508309/Scientists-take-a-shine-to-stainless-silver.html|title=Scientists take a shine to 'stainless' silver|first=David Derbyshire, Consumer Affairs|last=Editor|date=19 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as advanced ceramics and the hybrid alloy mikana.&lt;ref name="Mikana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikana.co.uk/|title=Mikana|first=Prototype|last=Creative|website=www.mikana.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceramics work has led to material advances in the making of personal armour and kiln lining, while mikana has properties similar to [[mokume gane]] while being more manageable and affordable.&lt;ref name="Mikana"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Jones lives in the Sheffield suburb of [[Crookes]].

'''Animal rights''' is the idea in which some, or all, [[non-human]] [[animal]]s are entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid [[suffering]]—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), pp. 8, 19–20; Rowlands (1998), p. 31ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone—an idea known since 1970 as [[speciesism]], when the term was coined by [[Richard D. Ryder]]—arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.&lt;ref&gt;Horta (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.&lt;ref&gt;That a central goal of animal rights is to eliminate the property status of animals, see Sunstein (2004), p. 11ff.
*For speciesism and fundamental protections, see Waldau (2011).
*For food, clothing, research subjects or entertainment, see Francione (1995), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple cultural traditions around the world such as [[Jainism]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Animism]] also espouse some forms of animal rights.

In parallel to the debate about moral rights, [[animal law]] is now widely taught in law schools in North America, and several prominent legal scholars{{who|date=January 2013}} support the extension of basic legal rights and [[person]]hood to at least some animals. The animals most often considered in arguments for personhood are [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. This is supported by some animal rights academics because it would break through the species barrier, but opposed by others because it predicates moral value on mental complexity, rather than on [[sentience]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;For animal law courses in North America, see [http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 "Animal law courses"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613170018/http://aldf.org/article.php?id=445 |date=2010-06-13 }}, [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]].

Critics of animal rights argue that nonhuman animals are unable to enter into a [[social contract]], and thus cannot be possessors of rights, a view summed up by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], who writes that only humans have duties, and therefore only humans have rights.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt; Another argument, associated with the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] tradition, is that animals may be used as resources so long as there is no unnecessary suffering&lt;ref name="Ethical"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liguori, G.| displayauthors=etal| year = 2017 | title = Ethical Issues in the Use of Animal Models for Tissue Engineering: Reflections on Legal Aspects, Moral Theory, 3Rs Strategies, and Harm-Benefit Analysis| journal = Tissue Engineering Part C Methods | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages= 850–862 | doi=10.1089/ten.TEC.2017.0189| pmid=28756735}}&lt;/ref&gt;; they may have some moral standing, but they are inferior in status to human beings, and any interests they have may be overridden, though what counts as "necessary" suffering or a legitimate sacrifice of interests varies considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 11, 16.

===Moral status and animals in the ancient world===
{{main|Moral status of animals in the ancient world}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Aristotle]] argued that animals lacked reason (''logos''), and placed humans at the top of the natural world.&lt;ref name=Sorabji7/&gt;]]
Aristotle argued that animals lacked reason (logos), and placed humans at the top of the natural world, yet the respect for animals in ancient Greece was very high. Some animals were considered divine, e.g. dolphins.
The 21st-century debates about animals can be traced back to the savage stone age from horrible histories, and the idea of a divine hierarchy. In the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'' 1:26 (5th or 6th century BCE), [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] is given "dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." Dominion need not entail property rights, but it has been interpreted, by some, over the centuries to imply ownership.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary philosopher [[Bernard Rollin]] writes that "''dominion'' does not entail or allow abuse any more than does dominion a parent enjoys over a child."&lt;ref name="Rollin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollin|first=Bernard E.|title=Animal Rights and Human Morality|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=978-1-61592-211-6|page=117}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rollin further states that the [[Biblical Sabbath]] requirement promulgated in the [[Ten Commandments]] "required that animals be granted a day of rest along with humans. Correlatively, the Bible forbids 'plowing with an ox and an ass together' (Deut. 22:10–11). According to the rabbinical tradition, this prohibition stems from the hardship that an ass would suffer by being compelled to keep up with an ox, which is, of course, far more powerful. Similarly, one finds the prohibition against 'muzzling an ox when it treads out the grain' (Deut. 25:4–5), and even an environmental prohibition against destroying trees when besieging a city (Deut. 20:19–20). These ancient regulations, virtually forgotten, bespeak of an eloquent awareness of the status of animals as ends in themselves", a point also corroborated by [[Norm Phelps]].&lt;ref name="Rollin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelps2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Phelps|first=Norm|title=Animal Rights According to the Bible|year=2002|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=978-1-59056-009-9|page=70|quote=The Bible's most important reference to the sentence and will of nonhuman animals is found in Deuteronomy 25:4, which became the scriptural foundation of the rabbinical doctrine of ''tsar ba'ale Chayim'', "the suffering of the living," which makes relieving the suffering of animals a religious duty for Jews. "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." The point of muzzling the ox was to keep him from eating any of the grain that he was threshing. The point of the commandment was the cruelty of forcing an animal to work for hours at a time with his face only inches from delicious food while not allowing him to eat any of it. From time immemorial, Jew have taken great pride in the care they provide their animals.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher and mathematician, [[Pythagoras]] (c. 580–c. 500 BCE), urged respect for animals, believing that human and nonhuman souls were [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] from human to animal, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner (2005), p. 47; Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Against this, [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE), student to the philosopher [[Plato]], argued that nonhuman animals had no interests of their own, ranking them far below humans in the [[Great Chain of Being]]. He was the first to create a taxonomy of animals; he perceived some similarities between humans and other species, but argued for the most part that animals lacked reason (''logos''), reasoning (''logismos''), thought (''dianoia'', ''nous''), and belief (''doxa'').&lt;ref name=Sorabji7&gt;Sorabji (1993), p. 12ff.; [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007642/animal-rights Wise (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theophrastus]] (c. 371 – c. 287 BCE), one of Aristotle's pupils, argued that animals also had reasoning (''logismos'') and opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust.&lt;ref name=Taylor35&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sorabji (1993) p. 45 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Theophrastus did not prevail; [[Richard Sorabji]] writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve.&lt;ref name="  Sorabji7"/&gt;

Plutarch (1 C. CE) in his Life of Cato the Elder comments that while law and justice are applicable strictly to men only, beneficence and charity towards beasts is characteristic of a gentle heart. This is intended as a correction and advance over the merely utilitarian treatment of animals and slaves by Cato himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cato_Major*.html|title=Plutarch • Life of Cato the Elder|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Beauchamp]] (2011) writes that the most extensive account in antiquity of how animals should be treated was written by the Neoplatonist philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] (234–c. 305 CE), in his ''On Abstinence from Animal Food'', and ''On Abstinence from Killing Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (2011a), pp. 4–5.

===17th century: Animals as automata===

====Early animal protection laws in Europe====
&lt;!---[[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]] was the Shogun of Japan from 1680 until 1709 and enacted animal rights, protecting especially d ogs. Wiki community, Please make a pretty wiki article about this subject---&gt;According to [[Richard D. Ryder]], the first known animal protection legislation in Europe was passed in Ireland in 1635. It prohibited pulling wool off sheep, and the attaching of ploughs to horses' tails, referring to "the cruelty used to beasts."&lt;ref&gt;''The Statutes at Large''. Dublin, 1786, cited in Ryder (2000), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641, the first legal code to protect domestic animals in North America was passed by the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].&lt;ref name=Francione7/&gt; The colony's constitution was based on ''[[Massachusetts Body of Liberties|The Body of Liberties]]'' by the Reverend [[Nathaniel Ward]] (1578–1652), an English lawyer, [[Puritan]] clergyman, and University of Cambridge graduate. Ward's list of "rites" included rite 92: "No man shall exercise any Tirrany or Crueltie toward any brute Creature which are usually kept for man's use." Historian [[Roderick Nash]] (1989) writes that, at the height of René Descartes' influence in Europe—and his view that animals were simply automata—it is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines.&lt;ref name=Nash19&gt;Nash (1989), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Puritans passed animal protection legislation in England too. Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in 1654 as part of the ordinances of the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]]—the government under [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599–1658), which lasted from 1653 to 1659, following the [[English Civil War]]. Cromwell disliked blood sports, which included [[cockfighting]], [[cock throwing]], [[dog fighting]], [[bull baiting]] and bull running, said to tenderize the meat. These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds, and became associated with idleness, drunkenness, and gambling. Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship, rather than ownership. The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people's lives, and the animal protection laws were overturned during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] was returned to the throne in 1660.&lt;ref name=Kete2&gt;Kete (2002), p. 19 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

====René Descartes====
{{rquote|right|[Animals] eat without pleasure, cry without pain, grow without knowing it; they desire nothing, fear nothing, know nothing. — [[Nicolas Malebranche]] (1638–1715)&lt;ref name=Malebranche&gt;Harrison (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The great influence of the 17th century was the French philosopher, [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650), whose [[Meditations on First Philosophy|''Meditations'']] (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Midgley1999/&gt; Writing during the [[scientific revolution]], Descartes proposed a [[Mechanistic#Universal mechanism|mechanistic theory]] of the universe, the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience.&lt;ref name=Cottingham&gt;Cottingham (1995), pp. 188–192.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{rquote|right|Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses.
There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, [[Mechanism (philosophy)#Universal mechanism|mechanist]], has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? — [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778)&lt;ref&gt;"Bêtes, ''Dictionnaire Philosophique''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
His mechanistic approach was extended to the issue of animal [[consciousness]]. Mind, for Descartes, was a thing apart from the physical universe, a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|separate substance]], linking human beings to the mind of God. The nonhuman, on the other hand, were for Descartes nothing but complex [[Automaton|automata]], with no souls, minds, or reason.&lt;ref name="Midgley1999"&gt;Midgley, Mary (May 24, 1999-2000). [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/134849], ''The New Statesman''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of animals as man's duty towards himself===

====John Locke, Immanuel Kant====
Against Descartes, the British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) argued, in ''Some Thoughts Concerning Education'' (1693), that animals did have feelings, and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong, but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animal's owner, or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel. Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals, he wrote: "For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will, by degrees, harden their minds even towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Locke (1693).&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke's position echoed that of [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274). [[Paul Waldau]] writes that the argument can be found at [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] (9:9–10), when [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] asks: "Is it for oxen that God is concerned? Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake." Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals, but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804), following Aquinas, opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans. For Kant, cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind. He argued in 1785 that "cruelty to animals is contrary to man's duty to ''himself'', because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings, and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other ''human beings'' is weakened."&lt;ref name=Kant1785&gt;Kant (1785), part II, paras 16 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century: Centrality of sentience===
[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] argued for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]].]]

====Jean-Jacques Rousseau====
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) argued in ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754) for the inclusion of animals in [[natural law]] on the grounds of [[sentience]]: "By this method also we put an end to the time-honored disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law: for it is clear that, being destitute of intelligence and liberty, they cannot recognize that law; as they partake, however, in some measure of our nature, in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed, they ought to partake of natural right; so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes. It appears, in fact, that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow-creatures, this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings: and this quality, being common both to men and beasts, ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill-treated by the former."&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau (1754), quoted in Midgley (1984), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on education, ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' (1762), he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet. He believed that the food of the culture a child was raised eating, played an important role in the character and disposition they would develop as adults. "For however one tries to explain the practice, it is certain that great meat-eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men. This has been recognized at all times and in all places. The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men. All savages are cruel, and it is not their customs that tend in this direction; their cruelty is the result of their food."

====Jeremy Bentham====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Jeremy Bentham]]: "The time will come, when humanity will extend its mantle over every thing which breathes."&lt;ref&gt;Bentham (1781), Part III.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Four years later, one of the founders of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748–1832), although opposed to the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], argued that it was the ability to suffer that should be the benchmark of how we treat other beings. Bentham claims that the capacity for suffering gives the right to equal consideration, equal consideration is that the interest of any being affected by an action are to be considered and have the equal interest of any other being. If rationality were the criterion, he argued, many humans, including infants and the disabled, would also have to be treated as though they were things.&lt;ref name=Benthall&gt;[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8322.2007.00494.x Benthall (2007)], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance, but argued that the latter's interests should be taken into account. He wrote in 1789, just as African slaves were being [[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|freed by the French]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the [[Hair follicle|villosity]] of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they ''reason''?, nor Can they ''talk''? but, Can they ''suffer?''&lt;ref name=Bentham&gt;Bentham (1789), quoted in Garner (2005), pp. 12—13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===19th century: Emergence of ''jus animalium''===
{{Further|Badger baiting|Bull baiting|Cockfighting}}
[[File:Badger-baiting2.jpg|thumb|[[Badger baiting]], one of the rural sports campaigners sought to ban from 1800 onwards.]]
The 19th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection, particularly in England. Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old, the needy, children, and the insane, and that this concern was extended to nonhumans. Before the 19th century, there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals, but only because of the damage to the animal as property. In 1793, for example, John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animal's tongue out; the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner.&lt;ref name=Legge40&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1800 onwards, there were several attempts in England to introduce animal protection legislation. The first was a bill against [[bull baiting]], introduced in April 1800 by a Scottish MP, Sir [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet|William Pulteney]] (1729–1805). It was opposed ''inter alia'' on the grounds that it was anti-working class, and was defeated by two votes. Another attempt was made in 1802, this time opposed by the Secretary at War, [[William Windham]] (1750–1810), who said the Bill was supported by Methodists and Jacobins who wished to "destroy the Old English character, by the abolition of all rural sports."&lt;ref name="Phelps 2007 pp. 96"&gt;Phelps (2007), pp. 96–98.

In 1809, [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Lord Erskine]] (1750-1823) introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding, wanton cruelty, and beating.  He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property: "''The animals themselves are without protection''--the law regards them not ''substantively''--they have no rights!"&lt;ref&gt;''Cruelty to Animals: The Speech of Lord Erskine in the House of Peers'' [https://archive.org/details/b28748165 (London: Richard Phillips, 1809) p 2] Italics in original speech.

In 1821, the Treatment of Horses bill was introduced by Colonel [[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]] (1754–1834), MP for Galway in Ireland, but it was lost among laughter in the House of Commons that the next thing would be rights for asses, dogs, and cats.&lt;ref name=Legge41&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "Humanity Dick" by George IV, Martin finally succeeded in 1822 with his "Ill Treatment of Horses and Cattle Bill"—or "Martin's Act", as it became known—which was the world's first major piece of animal protection legislation. It was given royal assent on June 22 that year as ''[[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822|An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle]]'', and made it an offence, punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment, to "beat, abuse, or ill-treat any horse, mare, gelding, mule, ass, ox, cow, heifer, steer, sheep or other cattle."&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt;

Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of "Humanity Dick", who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons, and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House's attention.&lt;ref name=Legge40/&gt; It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act, when he had Bill Burns, a [[costermonger]]—a street seller of fruit—arrested for beating a donkey, and paraded the animal's injuries before a reportedly astonished court. Burns was fined, and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey.&lt;ref name=Phelps100&gt;Phelps 2007, pp. 98–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries followed suit in passing legislation or making decisions that favoured animals. In 1822, the courts in New York ruled that wanton cruelty to animals was a misdemeanor at common law.&lt;ref name=Francione7&gt;Francione 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In France in 1850, [[:fr:Loi Grammont|Jacques Philippe Delmas de Grammont]] succeeded in having the ''Loi Grammont'' passed, outlawing cruelty against domestic animals, and leading to years of arguments about whether bulls could be classed as domestic in order to ban bullfighting.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, John. Bullfighting: Art, Technique and Spanish Society''. Transaction Publishers, 1999, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Washington followed in 1859, New York in 1866, California in 1868, and Florida in 1889.&lt;ref name=Legge50&gt;Legge and Brooman (1997), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, a series of amendments extended the reach of the 1822 Act, which became the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]], outlawing cockfighting, baiting, and dog fighting, followed by another [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1849|amendment in 1849]], and [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876|again in 1876]].

====Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals====

{{Further|Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals}}
Richard Martin soon realized that magistrates did not take the Martin Act seriously, and that it was not being reliably enforced. Martin's Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend [[Arthur Broome]] (1779-1837) to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals. Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;"To Correspondents" ''The Kaleidoscope'', 6 March 1821 p 288. Also see ''The Monthly Magazine'' Vol. 51 April 1, 1821 p 3."The Brute Species". "Notice" in ''Morning Post'', 17 February 1821, p 3. Similarly see "Cruelty to Animals" ''The Sporting Magazine'', Vol. VIII New Series No. XLIII (April 1821), p 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the passage of Richard Martin's anti-cruelty to cattle bill in 1822, Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms. Broome did organise and chair a meeting of sympathisers in November 1822 where it was agreed that a Society should be created and at which Broome was named its Secretary but the attempt was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;See Kathryn Shevelow, ''For the Love of Animals: The Rise of the Animal Protection Movemen''t (New York: Henry Holt, 2008), 268; Arthur W. Moss, ''Valiant Crusade: The History of the RSPCA'' (London: Cassell, 1961), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, Broome arranged a new meeting in Old Slaughter's Coffee House in [[St Martin's Lane]], a London café frequented by artists and actors. The group met on June 16, 1824, and included a number of MPs: Richard Martin, Sir [[James Mackintosh]] (1765–1832), Sir [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Buxton]] (1786–1845), [[William Wilberforce]] (1759–1833), and Sir [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|James Graham]] (1792–1861), who had been an MP, and who became one again in 1826.&lt;ref name=RSPCAhistory&gt;Anonymous (1972).

They decided to form a "Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals"; the [[RSPCA|Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], as it became known. It determined to send men to inspect slaughterhouses, [[Smithfield Market]], where livestock had been sold since the 10th century, and to look into the treatment of horses by coachmen.&lt;ref name="RSPCAhistory"/&gt; The Society became the Royal Society in 1840, when it was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria, herself strongly opposed to [[vivisection]].&lt;ref name=Legge47&gt;Legge and Brooman 1997, p. 47.

From 1824 onwards, several books were published, analyzing animal rights issues, rather than protection alone. [[Lewis Gompertz]] (1783/4–1865), one of the men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA, published ''Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes'' (1824), arguing that every living creature, human and nonhuman, has more right to the use of its own body than anyone else has to use it, and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings. [[Edward Nicholson (librarian)|Edward Nicholson]] (1849–1912), head of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the University of Oxford, argued in ''Rights of an Animal'' (1879) that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do, disregarding Descartes' mechanistic view—or what he called the "Neo-Cartesian snake"—that they lack consciousness.&lt;ref name=Taylor62&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.

Howard Moore (1862–1916), an American zoologist and author of ''The Universal Kinship'' (1906) and ''The New Ethics'' (1907).&lt;ref name=Nash137&gt;Nash 1989, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|140px|[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] argued in 1839 that the view of cruelty as wrong only because it hardens humans was "revolting and abominable".&lt;ref name=Schopenhauer96&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]''. This edition Hackett Publishing, 1998, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860). He wrote that Europeans were "awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights, in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown, that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Phelps 2007, p. 153–154.
*Schopenhauer wrote in ''The Basis of Morality'': "It is asserted that beasts have no rights&amp;nbsp;... that 'there are no duties to be fulfilled towards animals.' Such a view is one of revolting coarseness, a barbarism of the West, whose source is Judaism." A few passages later, he called the idea that animals exist for human benefit a "Jewish stence." See Phelps, ''op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism, arguing that, so long as an animal's death was quick, men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Idea Vol.I |publisher=The Project Gutenberg, 2011 |pages=477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer also theorized that the reason people succumbed to the "''unnatural diet''" of meat-eating was because of the unnatural, cold climate they emigrated to and the necessity of meat for survival in such a climate, for fruits and vegetables could not be dependably cultivated at those times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schopenhauer |first1=Arthur |title=Parerga &amp; Paralipomena Vol. II |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=144, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He applauded the animal protection movement in England—"To the honor, then, of the English, be it said that they are the first people who have, in downright earnest, extended the protecting arm of the law to animals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He also argued against the dominant [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, because Christian morality leaves animals out of account&amp;nbsp;... they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere "things," mere ''means'' to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, [[chandala]]s, and [[Mleccha|mlechchhas]], and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Schopenhauer96/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Percy Bysshe Shelley====
The English poet and dramatist [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822) wrote two essays advocating a vegetarian diet, for ethical and health reasons: ''[[A Vindication of Natural Diet]]'' (1813) and ''On the Vegetable System of Diet'' (1829, posth.).

====John Stuart Mill====
[[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873), the English philosopher, also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account, writing in 1864:{{verify source|type=year|date=November 2012}} "Nothing is more natural to human beings, nor, up to a certain point in cultivation, more universal, than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves.&amp;nbsp;... Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral,' let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned."&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 12; [http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm/ Mill (1874)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805172223/http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.htm |date=2012-08-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles Darwin====
[[File:1878 Darwin photo by Leonard from Woodall 1884 - cropped grayed partially cleaned.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=portrait|[[Charles Darwin]] wrote in 1837: "Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"]]
[[James Rachels]] writes that [[Charles Darwin]]'s (1809–1882) ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859)—which presented the [[theory of evolution]] by [[natural selection]]—revolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species. Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental and moral lives too, Darwin argued.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt; He wrote in his ''Notebooks'' (1837): "Animals – whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals. – Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind?"&lt;ref&gt;Darwin (1837), quoted in Redclift (2010), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), he argued that "There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties", attributing to animals the power of reason, decision making, memory, sympathy, and imagination.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009&gt;Rachels (2009), pp. 124–126; Beauchamp (2009), pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities, arguing that "humanity to the lower animals" was one of the "noblest virtues with which man is endowed." He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals, including setting traps. He wrote in a letter that he supported [[vivisection]] for "real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror&amp;nbsp;..." In 1875, he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection, lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection, and the study of physiology. Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day, such as Frances Power Cobbe, did not see Darwin as an ally.&lt;ref name=Rachels2009/&gt;

====American SPCA, Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford====
[[File:FrancesPowerCobbe2.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Frances Power Cobbe]] founded two of the first anti-vivisection groups.]]
[[File:Anna Kingsford 2.JPG|thumb|140px|[[Anna Kingsford]], one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism.]]

An early proposal for legal rights for animals came from a group of citizens in [[Ashtabula County, Ohio]]. Around 1844, the group proposed an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] stating that if slaves from [[Slave and free states|slave states]] were receiving representation as 3/5 of a person on the basis that they were animal property, all the animal property of the free states should receive representation also.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/25466018|title=Petition from Citizens of Ashtabula County, Ohio for a Constitutional Amendment that Representation in Congress be Uniform throughout the Country|last=|first=|date=1844|website=[[National Archives Catalog]]|publisher=|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first animal protection group in the United States, the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (ASPCA), was founded by [[Henry Bergh]] in April 1866. Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia, and had been disturbed by the mistreatment of animals he witnessed there. He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London, and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights, cockfights, and the beating of horses. He created a "Declaration of the Rights of Animals", and in 1866 persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti-cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advocacy.britannica.com/blog/advocacy/2006/11/the-aspca-pioneers-in-animal-welfare/|title=The ASPCA–Pioneers in Animal Welfare - Advocacy for Animals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, the Irish social reformer [[Frances Power Cobbe]] (1822–1904) founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection, the world's first organization opposed to animal research, which became the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]]. In 1880, the English feminist [[Anna Kingsford]] (1846–1888) became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society. She was also vocal in her opposition to experimentation on animals.&lt;ref&gt;Rudacille (2000), pp. 31, 46.
*Also see Vyvyan (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Cobbe set up the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research, coming close to success with the 1919 Dogs (Protection) Bill, which almost became law.&lt;!--add source, plus something about Cobbe/Kingsford disputes--&gt;

Ryder writes that, as the interest in animal protection grew in the late 1890s, attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden. They embraced the idea that what they saw as [[anthropomorphism]]—the attribution of human qualities to nonhumans—was unscientific. Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only, as [[Ivan Pavlov]] wrote in 1927, "without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states." It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the 17th century, that nonhumans were purely mechanical, with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness.&lt;ref name=Ryder5&gt;Ryder (2000), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Friedrich Nietzsche====
Avoiding utilitarianism, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) found other reasons to defend animals. He argued that "The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion."&lt;ref&gt;Animal Rights: A Historical Anthology. By [[Andrew Linzey]], Paul A. B. Clarke&lt;/ref&gt; He once wrote: "For man is the cruelest animal. At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his heaven on earth."&lt;ref&gt;The Selected Writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. {{ISBN|978-1-60459-332-7}} Wilder Publications April 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his writings, he speaks of the human being as an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciy.org/2010/06/10/6286/|title=Posthuman Destinies|publisher=sciy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Henry Salt====
In 1894, [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt]] (1851–1939), a former master at [[Eton College|Eton]], who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before, published ''Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (2009), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the object of the essay was to "set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt; Concessions to the demands for ''jus animalium'' had been made grudgingly to date, he wrote, with an eye on the interests of animals ''qua'' property, rather than as rights bearers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one—the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that "restricted freedom" to which Herbert Spencer alludes.&lt;ref name=Salt1&gt;[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm Salt 1894, chapter 1]. Salt cited Spencer's definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man&amp;nbsp;... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom&amp;nbsp;... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire, and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth. "[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day—it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;

===20th century: Animal rights movement===

====Brown Dog Affair, Lizzy Lind af Hageby====
{{main|Brown Dog affair}}
[[File:International Anti-Vivisection Congress, 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (centre, seated) in 1913.]]
In 1902, [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] (1878–1963), a Swedish feminist, and a friend, Lisa Shartau, traveled to England to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women, intending to learn enough to become authoritative anti-vivisection campaigners. In the course of their studies, they witnessed several animal experiments, and published the details as ''The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology'' (1903). Their allegations included that they had seen a brown terrier dog dissected while conscious, which prompted angry denials from the researcher, [[William Bayliss]], and his colleagues. After [[Stephen Coleridge]] of the National Anti-Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1876]], Bayliss sued and won, convincing a court that the animal had been anesthetized as required by the Act.&lt;ref name=Mason1997/&gt;

In response, anti-vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in 1906, with the plaque: "Men and Women of England, how long shall these Things be?" The statue caused uproar among medical students, leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a 24-hour police guard. The affair culminated in riots in 1907 when 1,000 medical students clashed with police, suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square. Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later.&lt;ref name=Mason1997&gt;Mason (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coral Lansbury]] (1985) and [[Hilda Kean]] (1998) write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the "Brown Dog Done to Death", which became a symbol of the oppression the women's suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment. Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future. The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti-science sentimentality, while the women saw themselves as progressive, with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age.&lt;ref&gt;Lansbury (1985), pp. 152–169; Kean (1998), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Development of veganism====
{{main|Veganism}}
Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided the use of eggs and animal milk in the 19th and early 20th century were known as strict vegetarians. The International Vegetarian Union cites an article informing readers of alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society's magazine in 1851 as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid [[animal product]]s entirely. There was increasing unease within the Society from the start of the 20th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption, and in 1923 its magazine wrote that the "ideal position for vegetarians is [complete] abstinence from animal products."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf Salt (1880)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616115150/http://www.ivu.org/history/europe19b/salt_a_plea_for_vegetarianism.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) argued in 1931 before a meeting of the Society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals, and not only as a human health issue. He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford, and read Salt's ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'' (1880). Salt wrote in the pamphlet that "a Vegetarian is still regarded, in ordinary society, as little better than a madman."&lt;ref name="Salt 1880"/&gt; In 1944, several members, led by [[Donald Watson]] (1910–2016), decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of egg and milk use. Watson coined the term "vegan" for those whose diet included no animal products, and they formed the British [[Vegan Society]] on November 1 that year.&lt;ref name=Leneman&gt;Leneman (1999)

====''Tierschutzgesetz''====
{{Further|Animal welfare in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Hermann Goering 2.jpg|thumb|This cartoon appeared in ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', a German satirical magazine, on September 3, 1933, showing lab animals giving the [[Nazi salute]] to [[Hermann Göring]], after restrictions on [[animal testing]] were announced.]]

On coming to power in January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws. The laws were similar to those that already existed in England, though more detailed and with severe penalties for breaking them. Arnold Arluke and [[Boria Sax]] write that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals, to the point where many people were regarded as less valuable than animals.&lt;ref name=Arluke1992&gt;Arluke and Sax (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1933 they passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals; one of their targets was [[kosher slaughter]]. In November the ''Tierschutzgesetz'', or animal protection law, was introduced, with [[Adolf Hitler]] announcing an end to animal cruelty: "''Im neuen Reich darf es keine Tierquälerei mehr geben.''" ("In the new Reich, no more animal cruelty will be allowed.") It was followed in July 1934 by the ''Reichsjagdgesetz'', prohibiting hunting; in July 1935 by the ''Naturschutzgesetz'', environmental legislation; in November 1937 by a law regulating animal transport in cars; and in September 1938 by a similar law dealing with animals on trains.&lt;ref&gt;Sax (2000) p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was a vegetarian in the later years of his life; several members of his inner circle, including [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], and [[Heinrich Himmler]], adopted some form of vegetarianism, though by most accounts their vegetarianism was not as strict as Hitler's.&lt;ref&gt;Proctor (1999), pp. 135–137; Sax (2000), pp. 35, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase in animal use====
Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation, animals still had no legal rights. Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests, whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty, or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not damaged. The over-exploitation of fishing stocks, for example, is viewed as harming the environment for people; the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them; poaching results in financial loss to the owner, and so on.&lt;ref name="Legge50"/&gt;

Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century, the situation for animals arguably deteriorated in the 20th century, particularly after the Second World War. This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research—300 in the UK in 1875, 19,084 in 1903, and 2.8 million in 2005 (50–100 million worldwide), and a modern annual estimated range of 10 million to upwards of 100 million in the US&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_07_06_animaltesting.pdf "Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2005"], Her Majesty's Stationery Office.

====Development of direct action====
{{further|Hunt Saboteurs Association|RSPCA Reform Group}}
In the early 1960s in England, support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of [[blood sport]]s, particularly hunting deer, [[Foxhunting|foxes]], and otters using dogs, an aristocratic and middle-class English practice, stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions. The psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] – who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late 1960s – writes that the new chair of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] tried in 1963 to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt, which triggered the formation that year of a [[direct action]] breakaway group, the Hunt Saboteurs Association. This was set up by a journalist, John Prestige, who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the [[Devon and Somerset Staghounds]]. The practice of sabotaging hunts (for example, by misleading the dogs with scents or horns) spread throughout south-east England, particularly around university towns, leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the "sabs".&lt;ref name=Ryder167&gt;Ryder (2000), p. 167ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy spread to the RSPCA, which had arguably grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage. It had failed to speak out against hunting, and indeed counted huntsmen among its members. As with the League Against Cruel Sports, this position gave rise to a splinter group, the RSPCA Reform Group, which sought to radicalize the organization, leading to chaotic meetings of the group's ruling Council, and successful (though short-lived) efforts to change it from within by electing to the Council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective, and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting, factory farming, and animal experimentation. Ryder himself was elected to the Council in 1971, and served as its chair from 1977 to 1979.&lt;ref name=Ryder167/&gt;

====Formation of the Oxford group====
{{main|Oxford Group (animal rights)}}
The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favor of animal rights. [[Ruth Harrison]] published ''Animal Machines'' (1964), an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the novelist [[Brigid Brophy]] had an article, "The Rights of Animals", published in ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name="Ryder5"/&gt; She wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relationship of [[homo sapiens]] to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrails in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present&amp;nbsp;... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Richard D Ryder in 2012 film The Superior Human?.png|thumb|British psychologist [[Richard D. Ryder]] was a member of the Oxford Group.]] --&gt;
[[Robert Garner]] writes that Harrison's book and Brophy's article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3&gt;Garner (2004), p. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (husband and wife from Canada), John Harris, and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]], now known as the Oxford Group. They decided to put together a [[symposium]] to discuss the theory of animal rights.&lt;ref name=Ryder5/&gt;

Around the same time, Richard Ryder wrote several letters to ''The Daily Telegraph'' criticizing animal experimentation, based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories. The letters, published in April and May 1969, were seen by Brigid Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals; it was in one of these pamphlets in 1970 that he coined the term "[[speciesism]]" to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections offered to humans.&lt;ref&gt;Waldau (2001), pp. 5, 23–29.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently became a contributor to the Godlovitches' symposium, as did Harrison and Brophy, and it was published in 1971 as ''[[Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Godlovitch, Godlovitch, and Harris (1971); see the Introduction for the reference to the symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publication of ''Animal Liberation''====
{{main|Animal Liberation (book)}}
In 1970, over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen, a vegetarian, Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that, by eating animals, he was engaging in the oppression of other species. Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches, and in 1973 Singer reviewed their book for ''The New York Review of Books''. In the review, he used the term "animal liberation", writing:

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AnimalLiberation.jpg|140px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975)]] --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are familiar with Black Liberation, Gay Liberation, and a variety of other movements. With Women's Liberation some thought we had come to the end of the road. Discrimination on the basis of sex, it has been said, is the last form of discrimination that is universally accepted and practiced without pretense&amp;nbsp;... But one should always be wary of talking of "the last remaining form of discrimination."&amp;nbsp;... ''Animals, Men and Morals'' is a manifesto for an Animal Liberation movement.&lt;ref name=SingerReview/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the strength of his review, ''The New York Review of Books'' took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as ''Animal Liberation'', now one of the animal rights movement's canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism – the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the "greatest happiness of the greatest number", a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham.&lt;ref name=SingerReview&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=9900 Singer (April 5, 1973)].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in favor of the [[equal consideration of interests]], the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human—for example, an interest in not suffering—is different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman.&lt;ref name=Singer5&gt;Singer 1990, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer used the term "speciesism" in the book, citing Ryder, and it stuck, becoming an entry in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 269, footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights. [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]]'s ''Victims of Science: The Use of Animals in Research'' (1975) appeared, followed by [[Andrew Linzey]]'s ''Animal Rights: A Christian Perspective'' (1976), and [[Stephen R. L. Clark]]'s ''The Moral Status of Animals'' (1977). A Conference on Animal Rights was organized by Ryder and Linzey at Trinity College, Cambridge, in August 1977. This was followed by [[Mary Midgley]]'s ''Beast And Man: The Roots of Human Nature'' (1978), then ''Animal Rights–A Symposium'' (1979), which included the papers delivered to the Cambridge conference.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt;

From 1982 onwards, a series of articles by [[Tom Regan]] led to his ''[[The Case for Animal Rights]]'' (1984), in which he argues that nonhuman animals are "subjects-of-a-life", and therefore possessors of moral rights, a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory.&lt;ref name=Garner2004p3/&gt; Regan wrote in 2001 that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous 20 years than in the 2,000 years before that.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (2001), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that Charles Magel's bibliography, ''Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights'' (1989), contains 10 pages of philosophical material on animals up to 1970, but 13 pages between 1970 and 1989 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2004), p. 2.

====Founding of the Animal Liberation Front====
{{main|Animal Liberation Front}}
In 1971, a law student, [[Ronnie Lee]], formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton, later calling it the Band of Mercy after a 19th-century RSPCA youth group. The Band attacked hunters' vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows, calling it "active compassion". In November 1973, they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory, claiming responsibility as a "nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind."&lt;ref name=Molland70&gt;Molland (2004), pp. 70–74; Monaghan (2000), pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in 1974, paroled after 12 months. In 1976, Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a [[leaderless resistance]] movement, calling it the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).&lt;ref name=Molland70/&gt; ALF activists see themselves as a modern [[Underground Railroad]], passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians, safe houses and sanctuaries.&lt;ref&gt;Best (2004), pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Some activists also engage in threats, intimidation, and arson, acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1998), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations, who find the networks difficult to infiltrate, because they tend to be organized around friends.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Gunn, former Chief Constable, Cambridge Constabulary, interviewed for "It Could Happen to You," True Spies, BBC Two, November 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats.&lt;ref&gt;Rood, Justin. [http://www.cq.com/public/20050325_homeland.html "Animal Rights Groups and Ecology Militants Make DHS Terrorist List, Right-Wing Vigilantes Omitted"], ''Congressional Quarterly'', March 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates, such as Singer, who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground. ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that, as [[Ingrid Newkirk]] puts it, "Thinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out."&lt;ref name=NewkirkBest341&gt;Newkirk (2004), p. 341./&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s through to the early 2000s there was an increased level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with [[animal research]]. Activist groups involved included the [[Justice Department (animal rights)|Justice Department]], the [[Animal Rights Militia]] and [[SHAC]].&lt;ref&gt;Holder, T.

====Animal Rights International====
{{further|Animal protectionism}}

[[Henry Spira]] (1927–1998), a former seaman and civil rights activist, became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States. A proponent of gradual change, he formed Animal Rights International in 1974, and introduced the idea of "reintegrative shaming", whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals, with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice. It is a strategy that has been widely adopted, most notably by [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Francione and Garner (2010), p. 1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spira's first campaign was in opposition to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1976, where cats were being experimented on, research that he persuaded them to stop. His most notable achievement was in 1980, when he convinced the cosmetics company [[Revlon]] to stop using the [[Draize test]], which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals. He took out a full-page ad in several newspapers, featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes, and the caption, "How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?" Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing, donated money to help set up the [[Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing]], and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies.&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;Feder, Barnaby J. (November 26, 1889). [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/magazine/pressuring-perdue.html "Pressuring Perdue"], ''The New York Times''.
*Also see Singer (1998), and Singer (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Revlon has since renewed testing on animals as it is unwilling to give up revenue from sales in China, where animal testing is required for cosmetics and other items.

===21st century: Developments===
In 1999, New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on "non-human hominids".&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt;

Also in 1999, Public Law 106-152 (Title 18, Section 48) was put into action in the United States. This law makes it a felony to create, sell, or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pet-abuse.com/pages/animal_cruelty/crush_videos.php#ixzz2C6yKSljR%3E|title=Stopping Crush Videos|publisher=pet-abuse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[Austrian Parliament|Austrian parliament]] banned experiments on apes, unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108/&gt; Also in Austria, the Supreme Court ruled in January 2008 that a chimpanzee (called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his [[personhood]]) was not a person, after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt. The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in [[Sierra Leone]] in 1982, then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments, but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country, and was taken to a shelter instead. He was kept there for 25 years, until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in 2007. Donors offered to help him, but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts, so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter's bankruptcy. The Association appealed the ruling to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee's personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights: the right to life, limited freedom of movement, personal safety, and the right to claim property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22670956/ It's official: In Austria, a chimp is not a person], Associated Press, January 15, 2008.

In June 2008, a committee of Spain's national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution to extend limited rights to nonhuman primates.

{{Further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Lord Mahavir Gold.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mahavira]], The Torch-bearer of [[Ahimsa]]. Ahimsa includes kindness and non-violence to all living organisms.]] [[Robert Garner]] writes that both [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. Several kings in India built hospitals for animals, and the emperor [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter, in line with ''[[ahimsa]]'', the doctrine of non-violence. Garner writes that [[Jainism]] took this idea further. Jains believe that no living creature should be harmed, and they are known to clear paths in front of them by sweeping them to protect any insect life that may be present.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal actions in the 21st century===
[[Paul Waldau]] writes that, in 2000, the High Court in [[Kerala]] used the language of "rights" in relation to circus animals, ruling that they are "beings entitled to dignified existence" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights, animals should be too. The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion, and said: "It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends, but also to recognize and protect their rights." Waldau writes that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language.&lt;ref name=Waldau2000p108&gt;Waldau (2011), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Indian government issued a ban on the use of live animals in education and much research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-17/india/31355109_1_cpcsea-control-and-supervision-cruelty|title=Govt bans use of live animals for education, research |publisher= The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==
For some the basis of animal rights is in religion or [[animal worship]] (or in general [[nature worship]]), with some religions banning killing of any animal; One of the most important sanctions of the [[Buddhist]] faith is the concept of [[ahimsa]], or refraining from the destruction of life&lt;!-- ([[#Reference-idRegenstein1991|Regenstein 1991]], p.&amp;nbsp;234)--&gt;. According to Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over other living beings. See also [[#Religions|in section above]].

In contrast, in other religions, animals can be [[unclean animal|unclean]], with in general allowing eating all except for these; "[[The Torah]] allows eating certain kinds of "winged swarming things" (i.e. insects) while prohibiting others".

===Islam===
{{Main|Animals in Islam}}

[[File:Amina Abaza with Dog.jpg|thumb|175px|Amina Tharwat Abaza{{snd}} Animal rights activist. Founder of [[Society for Protection of Animal Rights in Egypt]] holding a street dog.]]
Animal rights were recognized early by the [[Sharia]] (Islamic law). This recognition is based on both the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Hadith]]. In the Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. [[Muhammad]] forbade his followers to harm any animal and asked them to respect the rights of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Animals|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a distinctive characteristic of the Shariah that all animals have legal rights. Othman Llewellyn even argues that Shariah has mechanisms for the full repair of injuries suffered by non-human creatures including their representation in court, assessment of injuries and awarding of relief to them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The classical Muslim jurist 'Izz ad-Din ibn 'Abd as-Salam, who flourished during the thirteenth century, formulated the following statement of animal rights:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The rights of livestock and animals upon man: these are that he spend on them the provision that their kinds require, even if they have aged or sickened such that no benefit comes from them; that he not burden them beyond what they can bear; that he not put them together with anything by which they would be injured, whether of their own kind or other species, and whether by breaking their bones or butting or wounding; that he slaughters them with kindness when he slaughters them, and neither flay their skins nor break their bones until their bodies have become cold and their lives have passed away; that he not slaughter their young within their sight, but that he isolate them; that he makes comfortable their resting places and watering places; that he puts their males and females together during their mating seasons; that he not discard those which he takes as game; and neither shoots them with anything that breaks their bones nor brings about their destruction by any means that renders their meat unlawful to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last='Abd as-Salam|first='Izz ad-Din |title=Qawaa'id AlAhkaam fi Masaalih AlAnaam |publisher=AlMaktaba AlTijaariya AlKubra |location=Cairo |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, animal sacrifice is a prominent feature of [[Eid al-Adha#Traditions and practices|''Eid al-Adha'' observances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/42661/the-cost-of-sacrifice/ |title=Bakra Eid: The cost of sacrifice |publisher=Asian Correspondent |date=November 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and legal approaches==

===Overview===
{{Further|Consequentialism|Deontological ethics}}
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Martha Nussbaum]], Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago, is a proponent of the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]] to animal rights.]]
The two main philosophical approaches to animal rights are utilitarian and rights-based. The former is exemplified by Peter Singer, and the latter by Tom Regan and [[Gary Francione]]. Their differences reflect a distinction philosophers draw between ethical theories that judge the rightness of an act by its consequences (consequentialism/teleological ethics, or utilitarianism), and those that focus on the principle behind the act, almost regardless of consequences (deontological ethics). Deontologists argue that there are acts we should never perform, even if failing to do so entails a worse outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Craig (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of positions that can be defended from a consequentalist or deontologist perspective, including the [[Capability approach|capabilities approach]], represented by [[Martha Nussbaum]], and the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian approach]], which has been examined by Ingmar Persson and [[Peter Vallentyne]]. The capabilities approach focuses on what individuals require to fulfill their capabilities: Nussbaum (2006) argues that animals need a right to life, some control over their environment, company, play, and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2006), pp. 388ff, 393ff; also see Nussbaum (2004), p. 299ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen R. L. Clark]], [[Mary Midgley]], and [[Bernard Rollin]] also discuss animal rights in terms of animals being permitted to lead a life appropriate for their kind.&lt;ref&gt;Weir (2009): see Clark (1977); Rollin (1981); Midgley (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarianism favors an equal distribution of happiness among all individuals, which makes the interests of the worse off more important than those of the better off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25115834 Vallentyne (2005)]; Vallentyne (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, [[virtue ethics]], holds that in considering how to act we should consider the character of the actor, and what kind of moral agents we should be. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has suggested an approach to animal rights based on virtue ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands (2009), p. 98ff; Hursthouse (2000a); Hursthouse (2000b), p. 146ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Rowlands]] has proposed a [[Social contract|contractarian]] approach.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118/&gt;&lt;!--expand Clark, Nussbaum, virtue ethics--&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{further|Equal consideration of interests|Utilitarianism}}
{{rquote|right|''They talk about this thing in the head; what do they call it?'' ["Intellect," whispered someone nearby.] ''That's it. What's that got to do with women's rights or Negroes' rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?'' — [[Sojourner Truth]]&lt;ref name=Singer1990p6&gt;Singer (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nussbaum (2004) writes that utilitarianism, starting with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, has contributed more to the recognition of the moral status of animals than any other ethical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum (2004), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The utilitarian philosopher most associated with animal rights is Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University. Singer is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss how we ought to treat individuals. He is a [[Preference utilitarianism|preference utilitarian]], meaning that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it satisfies the preferences (interests) of those affected.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of preference utilitarianism, see Singer (2011), pp. 14ff, 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

His position is that there is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of human and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not being kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the ability to suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has interests, those interests must be given equal consideration.&lt;ref name=Singer7&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Singer quotes the English philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] (1838–1900): "The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view&amp;nbsp;... of the Universe, than the good of any other."&lt;ref name=Singer5/&gt;

[[File:Singer1.jpg|160px|thumb|[[Peter Singer]]: interests are predicated on the ability to suffer.]]
Singer argues that equality of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if the equality of the sexes were based only on the idea that men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is whether they can suffer.&lt;ref name=Singer1990p4&gt;Singer (1990), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators on all sides of the debate now accept that animals suffer and feel pain, although it was not always so. [[Bernard Rollin]], professor of philosophy, animal sciences, and biomedical sciences at Colorado State University, writes that Descartes' influence continued to be felt until the 1980s. Veterinarians trained in the US before 1989 were taught to ignore pain, he writes, and at least one major veterinary hospital in the 1960s did not stock narcotic analgesics for animal pain control. In his interactions with scientists, he was often asked to "prove" that animals are conscious, and to provide "scientifically acceptable" evidence that they could feel pain.&lt;ref name=Rollin117&gt;Rollin (1989), pp. xii, pp. 117–118; [http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v8/n6/full/7400996.html Rollin (2007)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific publications have made it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers do believe animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), pp. 10–17, citing Stamp Dawkins (1980), Walker (1983), and Griffin (1984); Garner (2005), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals [[animal language|have no language]]. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that there is no reason to suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990) p. 12ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjects-of-a-life===
{{further|The Case for Animal Rights}}
[[File:TomRegan2.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Tom Regan]]: animals are subjects-of-a-life.]]
Tom Regan, professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, argues in ''The Case for Animal Rights'' (1983) that nonhuman animals are what he calls "subjects-of-a-life", and as such are bearers of rights.&lt;ref name=Regan243&gt;Regan (1983), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that, because the moral rights of humans are based on their possession of certain [[Cognition|cognitive]] abilities, and because these abilities are also possessed by at least some nonhuman animals, such animals must have the same moral rights as humans. Although only humans act as moral agents, both marginal-case humans, such as infants, and at least some nonhumans must have the status of "moral patients".&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;

Moral patients are unable to formulate moral principles, and as such are unable to do right or wrong, even though what they do may be beneficial or harmful. Only moral agents are able to engage in moral action. Animals for Regan have "[[Intrinsic value (animal ethics)|intrinsic value]]" as subjects-of-a-life, and cannot be regarded as a means to an end, a view that places him firmly in the abolitionist camp. His theory does not extend to all animals, but only to those that can be regarded as subjects-of-a-life.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt; He argues that all normal mammals of at least one year of age would qualify:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;individuals are subjects-of-a-life if they have beliefs and desires; perception, memory, and a sense of the future, including their own future; an emotional life together with feelings of pleasure and pain; preference- and welfare-interests; the ability to initiate action in pursuit of their desires and goals; a psychophysical identity over time; and an individual welfare in the sense that their experiential life fares well or ill for them, logically independently of their utility for others and logically independently of their being the object of anyone else's interests.&lt;ref name=Regan243/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Singer is primarily concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we ought to treat nonhuman animals as we would humans. He applies the strict [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ideal (which Kant himself applied only to humans) that they ought never to be sacrificed as a means to an end, and must be treated as ends in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Regan (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolitionism===
{{further|Abolitionism (animal rights)|Animals, Property, and the Law}}
[[File:Gary Francione (cropped).jpg|thumb|130px|[[Gary Francione]]: animals need only the right not to be regarded as property.]]
Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at [[Rutgers Law School]] in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer, arguing that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned. Everything else would follow from that [[paradigm shift]]. He writes that, although most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, "in practice the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." The law only requires that any suffering not be "unnecessary". In deciding what counts as "unnecessary", an animal's interests are weighed against the interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1990), pp. 4, 17ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francione's ''Animals, Property, and the Law'' (1995) was the first extensive jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals to the treatment of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves in the United States]], where legislation existed that appeared to protect them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection unenforceable.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers as an example the United States [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], which he describes as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.&lt;ref&gt;Francione (1995), p. 208ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that a focus on animal welfare, rather than animal rights, may worsen the position of animals by making the public feel comfortable about using them and entrenching the view of them as property. He calls animal rights groups who pursue animal welfare issues, such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], the "[[Animal protectionism|new welfarists]]", arguing that they have more in common with 19th-century animal protectionists than with the animal rights movement; indeed, the terms "animal protection" and "protectionism" are increasingly favored. His position in 1996 was that there is no animal rights movement in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AmKARgx_FCgC&amp;pg=PA32 Francione (1996), p. 32ff]

Retrieved February 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contractarianism===
{{further|Social contract}}
[[Mark Rowlands]], professor of philosophy at the University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on the [[original position]] and the [[veil of ignorance]]—a "state of nature" thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairness—in [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). In the original position, individuals choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how primary social goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they are able-bodied or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they will assume in the society they are about to form.&lt;ref name=Rowlands1998p118&gt;Rowlands (1998), p. 118ff, particularly pp. 147–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is that, operating behind the veil of ignorance, they will choose a social contract in which there is basic fairness and justice for them no matter the position they occupy. Rawls did not include species membership as one of the attributes hidden from the decision makers in the original position. Rowlands proposes extending the veil of ignorance to include rationality, which he argues is an undeserved property similar to characteristics including race, sex and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Rowlands1998p118"/&gt;

===''Prima facie'' rights theory===
{{further|Prima facie right}}
American philosopher Timothy Garry has proposed an approach that deems nonhuman animals worthy of ''prima facie'' rights. In a philosophical context, a ''prima facie'' (Latin for "on the face of it" or "at first glance") right is one that appears to be applicable at first glance, but upon closer examination may be outweighed by other considerations. In his book ''Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory'', Lawrence Hinman characterizes such rights as "the right is real but leaves open the question of whether it is applicable and overriding in a particular situation".&lt;ref name="Hinman1998p208"&gt;Hinman, Lawrence M. Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace College, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that nonhuman animals are worthy of ''prima facie'' rights is to say that, in a sense, animals do have rights. However, these rights can be overridden by many other considerations, especially those conflicting a human's right to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Garry supports his view arguing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;if a nonhuman animal were to kill a human being in the U.S., it would have broken the laws of the land and would probably get rougher sanctions than if it were a human.  My point is that like laws govern all who interact within a society, rights are to be applied to all beings who interact within that society.  This is not to say these rights endowed by humans are equivalent to those held by nonhuman animals, but rather that if humans possess rights then so must all those who interact with humans.&lt;ref name=Garry2012p6&gt;Garry, Timothy J. Nonhuman Animals: Possessors of Prima Facie Rights (2012), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In sum, Garry suggests that humans have obligations to nonhuman animals; however, animals do not, and ought not to, have uninfringible rights against humans.

===Feminism and animal rights===
{{further|Women and animal advocacy|Ethics of care|Feminist ethics}}
[[File:Carol J. Adams with Snowball.jpg|thumb|180px|The American [[Ecofeminism|ecofeminist]] [[Carol J. Adams|Carol Adams]] has written extensively about the link between feminism and animal rights, starting with ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'' (1990).]]
Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"&gt;Lansbury (1985); Adams (1990); Donovan (1993); Gruen (1993); Adams (1994); Adams and Donovan (1995); Adams (2004); MacKinnon (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-vivisection movement in the 19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was largely run by women, including [[Francis Power Cobbe]], [[Anna Kingsford]], [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] and [[Caroline Earle White]] (1833–1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4289385 Kean (1995)].&lt;/ref&gt; Garner writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (2005), p. 141, citing Elston (1990), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern animal advocacy movement has a similar representation of women, though Garner (2005) writes that they are not invariably in leadership positions: during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C., in 1990—the largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United States—most of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men.&lt;ref name=Garner2005p142&gt;Garner (2005), pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, several influential animal advocacy groups have been founded by women, including the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] by Cobbe in London in 1898; the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] in 1962; and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], co-founded by [[Ingrid Newkirk]] in 1980. In the Netherlands, [[Marianne Thieme]] and [[Esther Ouwehand]] were elected to parliament in 2006 representing the Parliamentary group for Animals.

The preponderance of women in the movement has led to a body of academic literature exploring feminism and animal rights; feminism and vegetarianism or veganism, the oppression of women and animals, and the male association of women and animals with nature and emotion, rather than reason—an association that several feminist writers have embraced.&lt;ref name="Lansbury et al"/&gt; [[Lori Gruen]] writes that women and animals serve the same symbolic function in a patriarchal society: both are "the used"; the dominated, submissive "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gruen (1993), p. 60ff.&lt;/ref&gt; When the British feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759–1797) published ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758–1835), a Cambridge philosopher, responded with an anonymous parody, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'' (1792), claiming that Wollstonecraft's arguments for women's rights could be applied equally to animals, a position he intended as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Singer (1990), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--add something about language; treatment of female animals; feminist care ethic; suffragettes--&gt;

Some [[transhumanism|transhumanists]] argue for animal rights, liberation, and "uplift" of animal consciousness into machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ethics of Animal Enhancement|author=George Dvorsky|author-link=George Dvorsky|url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/dvorsky20110729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transhumanism also understands animal rights on a gradation or spectrum with other types of sentient rights, including human rights and the rights of conscious artificial intelligences (posthuman rights).&lt;ref Name="Evans 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Evans | first = Woody | authorlink = Woody Evans | title = Posthuman Rights: Dimensions of Transhuman Worlds | journal = Teknokultura | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | date = 2015 | url = http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/TEKN/article/view/49072/46310 | accessdate = December 5, 2016| doi = 10.5209/rev_TK.2015.v12.n2.49072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics===

====R. G. Frey====
[[R. G. Frey]], professor of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in ''Interests and Rights'' (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences."&lt;ref&gt;Frey (1989), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carl Cohen====
[[Carl Cohen (professor)|Carl Cohen]], professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, argues that rights holders must be able to distinguish between their own interests and what is right. "The holders of rights must have the capacity to comprehend rules of duty governing all, including themselves. In applying such rules, [they]&amp;nbsp;... must recognize possible conflicts between what is in their own interest and what is just. Only in a community of beings capable of self-restricting moral judgments can the concept of a right be correctly invoked." Cohen rejects Singer's argument that, since a brain-damaged human could not make moral judgments, moral judgments cannot be used as the distinguishing characteristic for determining who is awarded rights. Cohen writes that the test for moral judgment "is not a test to be administered to humans one by one", but should be applied to the capacity of members of the species in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200, Spr07/cohen.pdf Cohen (1986)]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
*Cohen and Regan (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Richard Posner====
[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|150px|Judge [[Richard Posner]]: "facts will drive equality."&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;]]
Judge [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] debated the issue of animal rights in 2001 with Peter Singer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dialogues/features/2001/animal_rights/_2.html Singer (June 15, 2001)].&lt;/ref&gt; Posner posits that his [[Ethical intuitionism|moral intuition]] tells him "that human beings prefer their own. If a dog threatens a human infant, even if it requires causing more pain to the dog to stop it, than the dog would have caused to the infant, then we favour the child. It would be monstrous to spare the dog."&lt;ref name=Posner&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/110101/entry/110129/ Posner (June 15, 2001)]; [http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm Posner-Singer debate in full], courtesy link on utilitarian.net.
*Also see Posner (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer challenges this by arguing that formerly unequal rights for gays, women, and certain races were justified using the same set of intuitions. Posner replies that equality in civil rights did not occur because of ethical arguments, but because facts mounted that there were no morally significant differences between humans based on race, sex, or sexual orientation that would support inequality. If and when similar facts emerge about humans and animals, the differences in rights will erode too. But facts will drive equality, not ethical arguments that run contrary to instinct, he argues. Posner calls his approach "soft utilitarianism", in contrast to Singer's "hard utilitarianism". He argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "soft" utilitarian position on animal rights is a moral intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, and we think that to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition in the language of philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Roger Scruton, September 2002.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Roger Scruton]]: rights imply obligations.]]

====Roger Scruton====
[[Roger Scruton]], the British philosopher, argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, "your right may be my duty." Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as "the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.&lt;ref name=Scruton/&gt;

He accuses animal rights advocates of "pre-scientific" [[anthropomorphism]], attributing traits to animals that are, he says, [[Beatrix Potter]]-like, where "only man is vile." It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.
*Scruton (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scruton singled out [[Peter Singer]], a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', "contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;Scruton, Roger. [http://www.city-journal.org/html/10_3_urbanities-animal.html "Animal Rights"], ''City Journal'', summer 2000.

==Continuity between humans and nonhuman animals==
[[File:Bonobo 009.jpg|thumb|A [[bonobo]], a nonhuman great ape]]

[[Evolution]]ary studies have provided explanations of [[altruism|altruistic behaviours]] in humans and nonhuman animals, and suggest similarities between humans and some nonhumans.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence (2004) Animal Acts: Configuring the Human in Western History. Journal of Popular Culture, 37(3), 555&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists such as [[Jane Goodall]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] believe in the capacity of nonhuman [[great apes]], humans' closest relatives, to possess rationality and self-awareness.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Ape Project: Equality beyond humanity. 1993. Fourth Estate publishing, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, research led by psychologist [[Diana Reiss]] and zoologist Lori Marino was presented to a conference in San Diego, suggesting that [[dolphin]]s are second in intelligence only to human beings, and concluded that they should be regarded as nonhuman persons. Marino used [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans to compare the dolphin and primate brain; she said the scans indicated there was "psychological continuity" between dolphins and humans. Reiss's research suggested that dolphins are able to solve complex problems, use tools, and pass the [[mirror test]], using a mirror to inspect parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Ascione. Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence. Purdue University Press 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christian theology]], the founder of the [[Methodist]] movement, [[John Wesley]], was a [[Christian vegetarian]] and maintained "that animals had immortal souls and that there were considerable similarities between human and non-human animals."&lt;ref name="Preece2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preece|first=Rod|title=Sins of the Flesh: A History of Ethical Vegetarian Thought|date=1 July 2009|publisher=UBC Press|language=English|isbn=9780774858496|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public attitudes ==

According to a paper published in 2000 by Harold Herzog and Lorna Dorr, previous academic surveys of attitudes towards animal rights have tended to suffer from small sample sizes and non-representative groups.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold; Dorr, Lorna (2000) "Electronically Available Surveys of Attitudes Toward Animals", ''Society &amp; Animals'' 10:2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of factors appear to correlate with the attitude of individuals regarding the treatment of animals and animal rights. These include gender, age, occupation, religion, and level of education. There has also been evidence to suggest that prior experience with [[pet|companion animals]] may be a factor in people's attitudes.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006"&gt;Apostol, L., Rebega, O.L. &amp; Miclea, M. (2013). "Psychological and Socio-Demographic Predictors of Attitudes towards Animals". ''Social and Behavioural Sciences'', 78, pages 521–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are more likely to empathize with the cause of animal rights than men.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold. (2007). "Gender Differences in Human-Animal Interactions: A Review". ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals''. 20:1. Pages 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards [[feminism]] and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on "nurturance or compassion" among women.&lt;ref&gt;Pifer, Linda. (1996). "Exploring the Gender Gap in Young Adults' Attitudes about Animal Research". ''Society and Animals''. 4:1. Pages 37–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 survey to examine whether or not people who believed in evolution were more likely to support animal rights than [[creationism|creationists]] and believers in [[intelligent design]] found that this was largely the case – according to the researchers, the respondents who were strong [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]]s and believers in [[creationism]] were less likely to advocate for animal rights than those who were less fundamentalist in their beliefs. The findings extended previous research, such as a 1992 study which found that 48% of animal rights activists were [[atheist]]s or [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;DeLeeuwa, Jamie; Galen, Luke; Aebersold, Cassandra; Stanton, Victoria (2007). "[http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf Support for Animal Rights as a Function of Belief in Evolution, Religious Fundamentalism, and Religious Denomination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620141651/http://www.animalsandsociety.org/assets/library/745_s3.pdf |date=2013-06-20 }}", ''Society and Animals'' 15, pages 353–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galvin, Shelley L.; Herzog Jr., Harold A. (1992) "Ethical Ideology, Animal Rights Activism, And Attitudes Toward The Treatment Of Animals." ''Ethics &amp; Behavior'' 2.3. Pages 141–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two surveys found that attitudes towards animal rights tactics, such as [[direct action]], are very diverse within the animal rights communities. Near half (50% and 39% in two surveys) of activists do not support direct action. One survey concluded "it would be a mistake to portray animal rights activists as homogeneous."&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An attitude survey of animal rights activists. Psychological Science. 2(3), 194–196&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
BAP1 is also known as:
* UniProt name: [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q92560 Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase BAP1]
* ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase like-2 (UCHL2)
* human cerebral protein 6 (hucep 6)
* human cerebral protein-13 (hucep-13)

== Gene ==
In humans, BAP1 is encoded by the ''BAP1'' gene located on the short arm of [[chromosome 3 (human)|chromosome 3]] (3p21.31-p21.2).

== Structure ==
Human BAP1 is 729 [[amino acid]]s long and has three [[domain (protein)|domains]]:

# a ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (UCH) [[N-terminus]] catalytic domain, which removes [[ubiquitin]] from ubiquitylated substrates: residues 1-240, with an active site comprising the [[Cysteine]]91, [[Alanine]]95, and [[Glycine]]178 residues.
# a unique linker region, which includes a [[Host cell factor C1]] [[Protein-protein interaction|binding]] domain at residues 356-385. 
# a [[C-terminal]] domain: residues 598-729, which includes a [[Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L5|UCH37]]-like domain (ULD) at residues 675-693 and two [[Nuclear localization sequence]]s at residues 656-661 and 717-722.

== Function ==
In both ''[[Drosophila]]'' and humans, BAP1 functions as the catalytic subunit of the Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, which controls [[homeobox]] genes by regulating the amount of ubiquitinated  [[Histone H2A]] in [[Nucleosome]]s bound to their [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]]. In flies and humans, the PR-DUB complex is formed through the interaction of BAP1 and [[ASXL1]] ([http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0261823.html ''Asx''] in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]])&lt;ref name="pmid20436459"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheuermann JC, de Ayala Alonso AG, Oktaba K, Ly-Hartig N, McGinty RK, Fraterman S, Wilm M, Muir TW, Müller J | title = Histone H2A deubiquitinase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex PR-DUB | journal = Nature | volume = 465 | issue = 7295 | pages = 243–7 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20436459 | pmc = 3182123 | doi = 10.1038/nature08966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19615732"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sowa ME, Bennett EJ, Gygi SP, Harper JW | title = Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape | journal = Cell | volume = 138 | issue = 2 | pages = 389–403 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19615732 | pmc = 2716422 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.04.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BAP1 has also been shown to associate with other factors involved in chromatin modulation and transcriptional regulation, such as [[Host cell factor C1]],&lt;ref name="pmid19815555"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Machida YJ, Machida Y, Vashisht AA, Wohlschlegel JA, Dutta A | title = The deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1 regulates cell growth via interaction with HCF-1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 284 | issue = 49 | pages = 34179–88 | date = Dec 2009 | pmid = 19815555 | pmc = 2797188 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M109.046755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19188440"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Misaghi S, Ottosen S, Izrael-Tomasevic A, Arnott D, Lamkanfi M, Lee J, Liu J, O'Rourke K, Dixit VM, Wilson AC | title = Association of C-terminal ubiquitin hydrolase BRCA1-associated protein 1 with cell cycle regulator host cell factor 1 | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 2181–92 | date = Apr 2009 | pmid = 19188440 | pmc = 2663315 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.01517-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20805357"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H, Mashtalir N, Daou S, Hammond-Martel I, Ross J, Sui G, Hart GW, Rauscher FJ, Drobetsky E, Milot E, Shi Y, Affar el B | title = The ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase BAP1 forms a ternary complex with YY1 and HCF-1 and is a critical regulator of gene expression | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 21 | pages = 5071–85 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20805357 | pmc = 2953049 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.00396-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which acts as an adaptor to couple [[E2F]] transcription factors to [[chromatin]]-modifying complexes during [[cell cycle]] progression.

== Role in disease ==
In cancer, BAP1 can function both as a [[Tumor suppressor]] and as a [[Metastasis suppressor]].

=== Somatic mutations in cancer ===
* BAP1 [[somatic mutation]]s were identified in a small number of breast and lung cancer cell lines,&lt;ref name=pmid9528852/&gt; but BAP1 was first shown to act as a [[tumor suppressor]] in cultured cells, where its [[Deubiquitinating enzyme|deubiquitinase]] (UCH) domain and [[Nuclear localization sequence]]s were required for BAP1 to suppress cell growth.&lt;ref name="pmid18757409"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ventii KH, Devi NS, Friedrich KL, Chernova TA, Tighiouart M, Van Meir EG, Wilkinson KD | title = BRCA1-associated protein-1 is a tumor suppressor that requires deubiquitinating activity and nuclear localization | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 68 | issue = 17 | pages = 6953–62 | date = Sep 2008 | pmid = 18757409 | pmc = 2736608 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 2010, [[J. William Harbour]] and colleagues published a landmark article in [[Science (journal)|Science]], in which they used [[Exome sequencing]] of patient tumor samples and identified inactivating mutations in BAP1 in 47% of [[Uveal melanoma]]s. They were also the first to show germline BAP1 mutations, and that BAP1 mutation was strongly associated with [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name="pmid21051595"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harbour JW, Onken MD, Roberson ED, Duan S, Cao L, Worley LA, Council ML, Matatall KA, Helms C, Bowcock AM | title = Frequent mutation of BAP1 in metastasizing uveal melanomas | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6009 | pages = 1410–3 | date = Dec 2010 | pmid = 21051595 | pmc = 3087380 | doi = 10.1126/science.1194472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These [[mutation]]s included multiple [[Nonsense mutations]] and [[RNA splicing#Splicing errors|splice site]] mutations throughout the gene.  [[missense mutations]] were only found within the UCH and ULD domains, further supporting the requirement for BAP1 catalytic function.  This study also identified a [[Germline mutation]] in one of the [[uveal melanoma]] patients, suggesting that, besides being a [[Metastasis suppressor]], BAP1 could [[Genetic predisposition|predispose]] certain people to more aggressive [[uveal melanoma]] tumors. 
* BAP1 mutations have been identified in aggressive [[Mesothelioma]]s with similar mutations as seen in melanomas,.&lt;ref name="pmid21642991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bott M, Brevet M, Taylor BS, Shimizu S, Ito T, Wang L, Creaney J, Lake RA, Zakowski MF, Reva B, Sander C, Delsite R, Powell S, Zhou Q, Shen R, Olshen A, Rusch V, Ladanyi M | title = The nuclear deubiquitinase BAP1 is commonly inactivated by somatic mutations and 3p21.1 losses in malignant pleural mesothelioma | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 7 | pages = 668–72 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21642991 | doi = 10.1038/ng.855 | pmc = 4643098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BAP1 occur in approximately 15% of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) cases. Sequencing efforts demonstrated worse outcomes in patients with BAP1 mutated clear cell renal cell carcinoma. .&lt;ref name="doi.10.1038/ng.2323"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peña-Llopis S, Vega-Rubín-de-Celis S, Liao A, Leng N, Pavía-Jiménez A, Wang S, Yamasaki T, Zhrebker L, Sivanand S, Spence P, Kinch L, Hambuch T, Jain S, Lotan Y, Margulis V, Sagalowsky AI, Summerour PB, Kabbani W, Wong SW, Grishin N, Laurent M, Xie XJ, Haudenschild CD, Ross MT, Bentley DR, Kapur P, Brugarolas J | title = BAP1 loss defines a new class of renal cell carcinoma | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 751–9 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22683710 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2323 | pmc=3788680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome===
Two studies used [[Genome sequencing]] independently to identify [[Germline mutation]]s in BAP1 in families with [[genetic predisposition]]s to [[mesothelioma]]&lt;ref name="pmid21874000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Testa JR, Cheung M, Pei J, Below JE, Tan Y, Sementino E, Cox NJ, Dogan AU, Pass HI, Trusa S, Hesdorffer M, Nasu M, Powers A, Rivera Z, Comertpay S, Tanji M, Gaudino G, Yang H, Carbone M | title = Germline BAP1 mutations predispose to malignant mesothelioma | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1022–5 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 21874000 | pmc = 3184199 | doi = 10.1038/ng.912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Melanocytic tumors of uncertain malignant potential|melanocytic skin tumors]]&lt;ref name="pmid21874003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiesner T, Obenauf AC, Murali R, Fried I, Griewank KG, Ulz P, Windpassinger C, Wackernagel W, Loy S, Wolf I, Viale A, Lash AE, Pirun M, Socci ND, Rütten A, Palmedo G, Abramson D, Offit K, Ott A, Becker JC, Cerroni L, Kutzner H, Bastian BC, Speicher MR | title = Germline mutations in BAP1 predispose to melanocytic tumors | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1018–21 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 21874003 | pmc = 3328403 | doi = 10.1038/ng.910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The atypical melanocytic lesions resemble Spitz nevi and have been characterized as "atypical Spitz tumors" (ASTs), although they have a unique histology and exhibit both BRAF and BAP1 mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Heydrich CE, Schneider KA, Rana Q |title=When to Consider Referral to a Genetic Counselor for Lesser Known Cancer Syndromes |journal=Contemporary Oncology |year=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages= 26–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Further studies have identified germline BAP1 mutations associated with other cancers.&lt;ref name="pmid21941004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abdel-Rahman MH, Pilarski R, Cebulla CM, Massengill JB, Christopher BN, Boru G, Hovland P, Davidorf FH | title = Germline BAP1 mutation predisposes to uveal melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma, meningioma, and other cancers | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 856–9 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 21941004 | doi = 10.1136/jmedgenet-2011-100156 | pmc = 3825099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies suggest that [[germline mutation]] of BAP1 results in a [http://omim.org/entry/614327 Tumor Predisposition Syndrome] linking BAP1 to many more cancers.

== Immunochemistry ==
[[Immunohistochemistry]] for BAP1 is a prognostic biomarker to predict poor oncologic outcomes and adverse clinicopathological features in patients with non-metastatic [[clear cell renal cell carcinoma]] (CCRCC). BAP1 assessment using immunohistochemistry on [[needle biopsy]] may benefit preoperative risk stratification and guide treatment planning.&lt;ref name="pmid24076305"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kapur P, Christie A, Raman JD, Then MT, Nuhn P, Buchner A, Bastian P, Seitz C, Shariat SF, Bensalah K, Rioux-Leclercq N, Xie XJ, Lotan Y, Margulis V, Brugarolas J | title = BAP1 immunohistochemistry predicts outcomes in a multi-institutional cohort with clear cell renal cell carcinoma | journal = The Journal of Urology | volume = 191 | issue = 3 | pages = 603–10 | date = Mar 2014 | pmid = 24076305 | doi = 10.1016/j.juro.2013.09.041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3327">A '''balanced salt solution''' ('''BSS''') is a [[solution]] made to a physiological [[pH]] and [[tonicity|isotonic]] salt concentration. Solutions most commonly include [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O62-balancedsaltsolution.html&lt;/ref&gt; Balanced salt solutions are used for washing [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and cells and are usually combined with other agents to treat the tissues and cells. They provide the cells with [[water]] and inorganic ions, while maintaining a physiological pH and osmotic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby W, Pastan I. ''Cell culture''. In: Colowick S, Kaplan N, eds. Methods in Enzymology. Vol 58. San Diego, Calif: Academic Press. 1979 {{ISBN|978-0-12-181776-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes [[glucose]] is added as an [[energy]] source and [[phenol red]] is used as a [[pH indicator]].

In medicine, balanced salt solutions can be used as an irrigation solution such as during [[Intraocular lens|intraocular]] [[surgery]] and to replace intraocular fluids.

Several components of the [[signaling cascade]] that mediates the HMB-induced increase in human skeletal muscle protein synthesis have been identified ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref name="Pimentel 2017 systematic review on HMB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson DJ, Hossain T, Hill DS, Phillips BE, Crossland H, Williams J, Loughna P, Churchward-Venne TA, Breen L, Phillips SM, Etheridge T, Rathmacher JA, Smith K, Szewczyk NJ, Atherton PJ | title = Effects of leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate on human skeletal muscle protein metabolism | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 591 | issue = 11 | pages = 2911–2923 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23551944 | pmc = 3690694 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2013.253203 | quote = The stimulation of MPS through mTORc1-signalling following HMB exposure is in agreement with pre-clinical studies (Eley et al. 2008).&amp;nbsp;... Furthermore, there was clear divergence in the amplitude of phosphorylation for 4EBP1 (at Thr37/46 and Ser65/Thr70) and p70S6K (Thr389) in response to both Leu and HMB, with the latter showing more pronounced and sustained phosphorylation.&amp;nbsp;...  Nonetheless, as the overall MPS response was similar, this cellular signalling distinction did not translate into statistically distinguishable anabolic effects in our primary outcome measure of MPS.&amp;nbsp;... Interestingly, although orally supplied HMB produced no increase in plasma insulin, it caused a depression in MPB (−57%). Normally, postprandial decreases in MPB (of ~50%) are attributed to the nitrogen-sparing effects of insulin since clamping insulin at post-absorptive concentrations (5&amp;nbsp;μU&amp;nbsp;ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) while continuously infusing AAs (18&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not suppress MPB (Greenhaff et al. 2008), which is why we chose not to measure MPB in the Leu group, due to an anticipated hyperinsulinaemia (Fig. 3C). Thus, HMB reduces MPB in a fashion similar to, but independent of, insulin. These findings are in-line with reports of the anti-catabolic effects of HMB suppressing MPB in pre-clinical models, via attenuating proteasomal-mediated proteolysis in response to LPS (Eley et al. 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to HMB's [[Precursor (chemistry)|metabolic precursor]], {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}}, HMB has been shown to increase protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle via [[phosphorylation]] of the [[mechanistic target of rapamycin]] (mTOR) and subsequent activation of {{abbrlink|mTORC1|mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1}}, which leads to [[Translation (biology)|protein biosynthesis]] in cellular [[ribosome]]s via phosphorylation of mTORC1's immediate targets (i.e., the [[p70S6 kinase]] and the [[protein translation|translation]] repressor protein [[4EBP1]]).{{#tag:ref|Approximately equal doses of pure {{abbr|HMB-FA|β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid}} (2.42&amp;nbsp;grams) and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} (3.42&amp;nbsp;grams) do not produce statistically distinguishable anabolic effects, as measured by the [[fractional synthesis]] of [[myofibril|myofibrillar proteins]], in the skeletal muscle of living humans.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review" /&gt; At 150&amp;nbsp;minutes post-ingestion, these doses of HMB-FA and {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} increased muscle protein synthesis by ~70% and ~110% respectively in one study.&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sarcopenia July 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips SM | title = Nutritional supplements in support of resistance exercise to counter age-related sarcopenia | journal = Advances in Nutrition | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 452–460 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26178029 | pmc = 4496741 | doi = 10.3945/an.115.008367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}&lt;ref name="Pharmacology of HMB-FA in humans in vivo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Skeletal muscle homeostasis 2016 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brook MS, Wilkinson DJ, Phillips BE, Perez-Schindler J, Philp A, Smith K, Atherton PJ | title = Skeletal muscle homeostasis and plasticity in youth and ageing: impact of nutrition and exercise | journal = Acta Physiologica | volume = 216 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–41 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26010896 | pmc = 4843955 | doi = 10.1111/apha.12532 | quote = The mechanisms underlying the anabolic effects of food intake involve both the stimulation of MPS (Rennie et al. 1982) and suppression of MPB (Wilkes et al. 2009). The potent increase in MPS is driven almost entirely by essential amino acids (EAAs) (Smith et al. 1992), with the branched chain AA (BCAA: leucine, isoleucine and valine), in particular leucine [and its metabolite(s), e.g. β‐hydroxy β‐methylbutyric acid (HMB) (Van Koevering &amp; Nissen 1992)] being central to these effects (Wilkinson et al. 2013). Although the mechanisms underlying the unique anabolic properties of leucine are incompletely defined, recent work in yeast and cultured mammalians cells has demonstrated that leucyl tRNA synthetase is upstream of activating the hitherto ‘cellular AA sensor’, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in response to leucine (Bonfils et al. 2012, Han et al. 2012). This was reaffirmed by experiments showing that of all the EAAs, leucine is the most effective EAA in increasing the activity (i.e. phosphorylation) of mTORC1 (Atherton et al. 2010b) and its substrates. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muscle atrophy-related signal transduction review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutt V, Gupta S, Dabur R, Injeti E, Mittal A | title = Skeletal muscle atrophy: Potential therapeutic agents and their mechanisms of action | journal = Pharmacological Research | volume = 99 | issue =  | pages = 86–100 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26048279 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrs.2015.05.010 | quote = In an experimental animal model of cancer-induced cachexia, HMB treatment not only down-regulated the expression of key regulatory components of 19S and 20S proteasome–proteolytic pathway but also stimulated protein synthesis which further regulates the loss of muscle mass [40].&amp;nbsp;...

HMB has been shown to stimulate the [[cell proliferation|proliferation]], [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and [[cell fusion|fusion]] of human [[myosatellite cells]] ''[[in vitro]]'', which potentially increases the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle, by increasing the protein expression of certain [[myogenic regulatory factors]] (e.g., [[myoD]] and [[myogenin]]) and gene [[transcription factor]]s (e.g., [[MEF2]]).&lt;ref name="ISSN position stand 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Systematic review December 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human myosatellite cells in vitro" /&gt; HMB-induced human myosatellite cell proliferation ''in vitro'' is mediated through the phosphorylation of the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]]s [[ERK1]] and [[ERK2]].&lt;ref name="Systematic review December 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMB in animals 2015 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szcześniak KA, Ostaszewski P, Fuller JC, Ciecierska A, Sadkowski T | title = Dietary supplementation of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate in animals – a review | journal = Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 405–417 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25099672 | doi = 10.1111/jpn.12234 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/jpn.12234#jpn12234-bib-0012 | quote = Cholesterol is a major component of the cell membrane, and sarcolemma is the one that relies mainly on de novo synthesis of cholesterol. This is important under stressful conditions when muscle cells may lack the capacity to produce adequate amounts of the cholesterol that is essential to proper functioning of cell membranes. Many biochemical studies have shown that HMB may be a precursor of cholesterol synthesis (Bachhawat et al., 1955; Bloch et al., 1954; Coon et al., 1955; Adamson and Greenberg, 1955; Gey et al., 1957). According to pertinent literature, HMB carbon is incorporated into cholesterol. Therefore, increased intramuscular HMB concentrations may provide readily available substrate for the cholesterol synthesis that is needed to form and stabilize the sarcolemma.&amp;nbsp;... It is known that HMB supplementation decreases post-exercise levels of enzymes, indicating muscle damage, such as creatinine phosphokinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which suggests an enhancement of the muscle cell membrane function. This was shown in numerous studies in humans undergoing both resistance and endurance training (Wilson et al., 2013)&amp;nbsp;... In theory, HMB use as a precursor to cholesterol could aid in stabilizing muscle cell membranes; however, this has not been confirmed by research studies. The effect of HMB on protein metabolism may in fact help stabilize muscle structure more than any effect HMB may have on cholesterol metabolism in the cell. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Human myosatellite cells in vitro" /&gt; HMB-induced human myosatellite differentiation and accelerated fusion of myosatellite cells into muscle tissue ''in vitro'' is mediated through the phosphorylation of [[protein kinase B|Akt]], a [[serine/threonine-specific protein kinase]].&lt;ref name="Systematic review December 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMB in animals 2015 review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Human myosatellite cells in vitro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornasio R, Riederer I, Butler-Browne G, Mouly V, Uni Z, Halevy O | title = Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) stimulates myogenic cell proliferation, differentiation and survival via the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1793 | issue = 5 | pages = 755–763 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19211028 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.12.017 | department = primary source | quote = &lt;!--Human myoblasts (satellite cells) were isolated as described previously&amp;nbsp;...--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- HMB has also been shown to induce phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, and Akt, up-regulate MEF2 expression, and activate [[mTORC2|mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2]] (mTORC2) in mouse [[neuro2a cell]]s ''in vitro''.&lt;ref name="HMB-dependent Neuro2a neurite outgrowth"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salto R, Vílchez JD, Girón MD, Cabrera E, Campos N, Manzano M, Rueda R, López-Pedrosa JM | title = β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate (HMB) Promotes Neurite Outgrowth in Neuro2a Cells | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 8 | pages = e0135614 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26267903 | pmc = 4534402 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0135614 | department = primary source | quote = In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that HMB promoted neurite outgrowth through PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in Neuro2a cells.

It seems that HMB is able to act on three of the four major mechanisms involved in muscle deconditioning (protein turnover, apoptosis, and the regenerative process), whereas it is hypothesized to strongly affect the fourth (mitochondrial dynamics and functions). Moreover, HMB is inexpensive (~30– 50 US dollars per month at 3 g per day) and may prevent osteopenia (Bruckbauer and Zemel, 2013; Tatara, 2009; Tatara et al., 2007, 2008, 2012) and decrease cardiovascular risks (Nissen et al., 2000). For all these reasons, HMB should be routinely used in muscle-wasting conditions especially in aged people.&amp;nbsp;... 3&amp;nbsp;g of CaHMB taken three times a day (1&amp;nbsp;g each time) is the optimal posology, which allows for continual bioavailability of HMB in the body (Wilson et al., 2013)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt; Around&amp;nbsp;40% of dietary {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} is converted to {{nowrap|acetyl-CoA}}, which is subsequently used in the synthesis of other compounds.&lt;ref name="Leucine metabolism" /&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;

The vast majority of {{nowrap|{{smallcaps all|L}}-leucine}} metabolism is initially catalyzed by the [[branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase]] enzyme, producing {{nowrap|[[α-ketoisocaproate]]}} (α-KIC).&lt;ref name="HMB athletic performance-related effects 2011 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanchi NE, Gerlinger-Romero F, Guimarães-Ferreira L, de Siqueira Filho MA, Felitti V, Lira FS, Seelaender M, Lancha AH | title = HMB supplementation: clinical and athletic performance-related effects and mechanisms of action | journal = Amino Acids | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 1015–1025 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 20607321 | doi = 10.1007/s00726-010-0678-0 | quote = HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine (Van Koverin and Nissen 1992), an essential amino acid. The first step in HMB metabolism is the reversible transamination of leucine to [α-KIC] that occurs mainly extrahepatically (Block and Buse 1990). Following this enzymatic reaction, [α-KIC] may follow one of two pathways. In the first, HMB is produced from [α-KIC] by the cytosolic enzyme KIC dioxygenase (Sabourin and Bieber 1983). The cytosolic dioxygenase has been characterized extensively and differs from the mitochondrial form in that the dioxygenase enzyme is a cytosolic enzyme, whereas the dehydrogenase enzyme is found exclusively in the mitochondrion (Sabourin and Bieber 1981, 1983). Importantly, this route of HMB formation is direct and completely dependent of liver KIC dioxygenase. Following this pathway, HMB in the cytosol is first converted to cytosolic β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), which can then be directed for cholesterol synthesis (Rudney 1957) (Fig. 1). In fact, numerous biochemical studies have shown that HMB is a precursor of cholesterol (Zabin and Bloch 1951; Nissen et al. 2000).&lt;!--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the second pathway, after transamination, [α-KIC] in liver generates isovaleryl-CoA through the enzymatic action of branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) and after several steps, there is production of HMG-CoA through the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (Fig. 1). Under normal conditions the majority of KIC is converted into isovaleryl-CoA, in which approximately 5% of leucine is metabolized into HMB (Wilson et al. 2008; Van Koverin and Nissen 1992).

A variety of synthetic routes to {{nowrap|β-hydroxy}} {{nowrap|β-methylbutyric}} acid have been developed. The first reported [[chemical syntheses]] approached HMB by oxidation of [[alkene]], [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] [[diol]], and [[alcohol]] precursors:

==History==

The first reported [[chemical synthesis]] of HMB was published in 1877 by the Russian chemists Michael and [[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev|Alexander Zaytsev]].&lt;ref name="First synthesis" /&gt; HMB was isolated from the bark of ''[[Erythrophleum|Erythrophleum couminga]]'' (a Madagascan tree) in 1941 by [[Leopold Ružička]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ružička L, Dalma G, Engel BG, Scott WE | author-link1 = Leopold Ružička | title = Zur Kenntnis der Erythrophleum-Alkaloide.

A '''binary pulsar''' is a [[pulsar]] with a [[binary star|binary companion]], often a [[white dwarf]] or [[neutron star]]. (In at least one case, the double pulsar [[PSR J0737-3039]], the companion neutron star is another pulsar as well.)  Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test [[general relativity]] because of the strong gravitational fields in their vicinities. Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe directly, its presence can be deduced from the timing of the pulses from the pulsar itself, which can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by [[radio telescope]]s.

==History==
The first binary pulsar, [[PSR B1913+16]] or the "Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar" was discovered in 1974 at [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] by [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.]] and [[Russell Hulse]], for which they won the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. While Hulse was observing the newly discovered pulsar PSR B1913+16, he noticed that the rate at which it pulsed varied regularly. It was concluded  that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity, and that the pulse period was varying due to the Doppler effect: As the pulsar was moving towards Earth, the pulses would be more frequent; and  conversely, as it moved away from Earth fewer would be detected in a given time period. One can think of the pulses like the ticks of a clock; changes in the ticking are indications of changes in the pulsars speed toward and away from Earth. Hulse and Taylor also determined that the stars were approximately equally massive by observing these pulse fluctuations, which led them to believe the other  object was also a neutron star. Pulses from this system are now tracked to within 15 [[microsecond|μs]].&lt;ref name="wet2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | year=  2010| title=Timing Measurements of the Relativistic Binary Pulsar PSR B1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 722 |  pages=1030–1034 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/722/2/1030 | arxiv =  1011.0718v1 | bibcode=2010ApJ...722.1030W
 | last3 = Taylor | first3 = J. H. | last2 = Nice | first2 = D. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the PSR B1913+16 binary pulsar also led to the first accurate determination of neutron star masses, using relativistic timing effects.&lt;ref name="wt82"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. |last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1982| title=A new test of general relativity - Gravitational radiation and the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 253 |  pages=908–920 | doi=10.1086/159690 | bibcode=1982ApJ...253..908T }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the two bodies are in close proximity, the gravitational field is stronger, the passage of time is slowed – and the time between pulses (or ticks) is lengthened. Then as the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time. A special relativistic effect, time dilation, acts around the orbit in a similar fashion.  This relativistic time delay is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion in a circular orbit, and what is actually observed.

Prior to [[First observation of gravitational waves|2015]] and the operation of [[LIGO|Advanced LIGO]],&lt;ref name="PRL-20160211"&gt;{{cite journal | collaboration = LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration | last1 = Abbott | first1 = Benjamin P.  |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 |journal=[[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] |volume=116 | issue = 6 |pages=061102 |year=2016 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 | arxiv=1602.03837|bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116f1102A | pmid=26918975}}&lt;/ref&gt; binary pulsars were the only  tools scientists had to detect evidence of [[gravitational waves]]; Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that two neutron stars would emit gravitational waves as they orbit a common center of mass, which would carry away orbital energy and cause the two stars to draw closer together and shorten their orbital period. A  10-parameter model incorporating information about the pulsar timing, the [[Kepler's laws|Keplerian]] orbits and three post-Keplerian corrections (the rate of [[periastron]] advance,  a factor for [[gravitational redshift]] and [[time dilation]], and a rate of change of the orbital period from [[gravitational radiation]] emission) is sufficient to completely model the binary pulsar timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Weisberg | first= J. M. | date=  October 1981| title=Gravitational waves from an orbiting pulsar | journal=Scientific American | volume = 245 |  pages=74–82 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1081-74 | bibcode=1981SciAm.245d..74W |  last2 = Taylor | first2 = J. H. | last3 = Fowler | first3 = L. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes2007"&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/psr1913.htm | title=Prof. Martha Haynes Astro 201 Binary Pulsar PSR 1913+16 Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measurements made of the orbital decay of the PSR B1913+16 system were a near perfect match to Einstein's equations. Relativity predicts that over time a binary system's orbital energy will be converted to [[gravitational radiation]]. Data collected by Taylor and Joel M. Weisberg and their colleagues of the orbital period of PSR B1913+16 supported this relativistic prediction; they reported in 1982&lt;ref name="wt82"/&gt; and subsequently&lt;ref name="wet2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Taylor | first = J. H. | last2=Weisberg | first2= J. M. | year=  1989| title=Further experimental tests of relativistic gravity using the binary pulsar PSR 1913 + 16 | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume = 345 |  pages=434–450 | doi=10.1086/167917 | bibcode=1989ApJ...345..434T }}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant. In the decade following its discovery the system's orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year - this means that the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same. Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease.

==Effects==
Sometimes the relatively normal companion star of a binary pulsar will swell up to the point that it dumps its outer layers onto the pulsar. This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X-ray light which can appear to pulsate, in a process called the [[X-ray binary]] stage. The flow of matter from one stellar body to another often leads to the creation of an [[accretion disk]] about the recipient star.

[[Pulsar]]s also create a  "wind" of relativistically outflowing particles, which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the [[magnetosphere]] of their companions and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission.

[[File:Stained glass windows in Lincoln Cathedral 07 East Window.jpg|thumb|upright= 1.5|One of the most prestigious stained glass commissions of the 19th century, the re-glazing of the 13th-century east window of Lincoln Cathedral, Ward and Hughes, 1855.]]

A revival of the art and craft of [[stained-glass]] [[window]] manufacture took place in [[Early modern Britain|early 19th-century Britain]], beginning with an armorial window created by [[Thomas Willement]] in 1811–12.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The revival led to stained glass windows becoming such a common and popular form of coloured pictorial representation that many thousands of people, most of whom would never [[Commission (art)|commission]] or purchase a painting, contributed to the commission and purchase of stained-glass windows for their parish church.

Within 50 years of the beginnings of commercial manufacture in the 1830s, British stained glass grew into an enormous and specialised industry, with important centres in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Birmingham]], [[Whitechapel]] in [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]], [[Norwich]] and [[Dublin]]. The industry also flourished in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. By 1900 British windows had been installed in [[Copenhagen]], [[Venice]], [[Athens]], [[Bangalore]], [[Nagasaki]], [[Manila]] and [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. St Alban's Copenhagen; Basilica of Ss Giovanni and Paolo, Venice; St Paul's Church, Athens; All Saints' Church, Bangalore; the original Nagasaki Cathedral; Manila Cathedral; St John's Presbyterian Church, Wellington.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[World War I|Great War]] from 1914 to 1918, stained glass design was to change radically.

==Background==
{{Main|Medieval stained glass}}
[[File:Lincoln Cathedral Bishops Eye.jpg|thumb|The ''Bishop's Eye'', (1320) at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], is filled with salvaged fragments.]]
Following the [[Norman conquest]] of [[England]] in 1066, many churches, abbeys and cathedrals were built, initially in the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] or [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style, then in the increasingly elaborate and decorative [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In these churches the windows were generally either large or in multiples so that the light within the building was maximised. The windows were glazed, frequently with [[came glasswork|coloured glass held in place by strips of lead]]. Because flat glass could only be manufactured in small pieces, the method of glazing lent itself to patterning. The pictorial representation of biblical characters and narratives was a feature of Christian churches, often taking the form of murals. By the 12th century stained glass was well adapted to serve this purpose.  For 500 years the art flourished and adapted to changing architectural styles.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of English glass was smashed by [[Puritans]] under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Churches which retain a substantial amount of early glass are rare. Very few of England's large windows are intact. Those that contain a large amount of Medieval glass are usually reconstructed from salvaged fragments. The east, west and south transept windows of [[York Minster]] and the west and [[transept|north Transept]] windows of [[Canterbury Cathedral|Canterbury]] give an idea of the splendours that have been mostly lost.&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Seddon and Stephens, ''Stained Glass''&lt;/ref&gt;
In Scotland, which never manufactured its own stained glass but bought from the south, they lost much of their glass not because it was smashed but because the monasteries were disbanded. These monasteries had monks with skills in repairing. When they went, windows gradually fell apart.

==Influences on the revival of stained glass==
[[File:York York minster windows 020.JPG|thumb|left|The 14th-century glass of west window of [[York Minster]] has figures set beneath brightly coloured canopies, adopted by 19th-century designers such as [[Clayton and Bell]]]]

===Historic===
Medieval windows and drawings of them provided the source and inspiration for nearly all the earlier 19th-century designers.

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] retains more ancient glass than any other English cathedral except York. Much of it is appears to be imported from France and some is very early, dating from the 11th century. Much of the glass is in the style of [[Chartres Cathedral]] with deep blue featuring as the background colour in most windows. There are wide borders of stylised floral motifs and small pictorial panels of round, square or diaper shape. Other windows contain rows of apostles, saints and prophets. These windows, including the large west window have a predominance of red, pink, brown and green in the colours, with smaller areas of blue. Most of the glass in this remarkable window is older than the 15th-century stone tracery that contains it, the figure of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] being part of a series of [[Jesse Tree|Ancestors of Christ]] that are among the oldest surviving panels in England.
[[File:Canterbury Cathedral 032 Miraculous draft.JPG|thumb|13th-century glass at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] is full of lively narratives set in roundels surrounded by foliate scrolls, adopted by many 19th-century designers including [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck|Clutterbuck]], [[William Wailes]] and [[Ward and Hughes]]]]
[[York Minster]] also contains much of its original glass including important narrative windows of the Norman period, the famous "Five Sister" windows, the 14th-century west window and 15th-century east window. The "Five Sisters", although repaired countless times so that they now contain a spider's web of lead, still reveal their delicate pattern of simple geometric shapes enhanced by [[grisaille]] painting. They were the style of window which was most easily imitated by early 19th-century plumber-glaziers. The east and west windows of York are outstanding examples because in each case they are huge, intact, at their original location and by a known craftsman. The west window, designed in about 1340 by Master Robert, contains tiers of saints and stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary, each surmounted by a delicate Gothic canopy in white and yellow-stain, against a red background. The highly ornate tracery lights are filled with floral motifs. White glass ''stone borders'' surround each panel, making it appear to float in its frame. The east window of 1405 was glazed by [[John Thornton (glass painter)|John Thornton]] and is the largest intact medieval window in the world. It presents a narrative in sequential panels of the ''[[Genesis creation myth|Creation]]'', the ''[[Fall of Man]]'', ''the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]]'', ''the [[Apocalypse]]'', ''the [[Last Judgment]]'' and ''the Glory of God''.
York also has windows with small diaper-shaped ''quarries'' painted with little birds and other motifs which were much reproduced in the 19th century.

Between them, the windows of York and Canterbury cathedrals provided the examples for different styles of windows- geometric patterns, floral motifs and borders, narratives set in small panels, rows of figures, major thematic schemes.

Scattered all over England, sometimes in remote churches, is similar evidence of the designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, [[St Neot, Cornwall|St Neot's]] in Cornwall and [[Fairford]] in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. The theme is that of the east window of York, ''[[Salvation|the Salvation of Mankind]]'', but in this case the theme is spread across all the windows of the church, large and small.

===Philosophic===

====Romanticism====
In the 18th century there was a growing trend for philosophers, writers and painters to [[Romanticism|commune with nature]]. Nature was seen as all the more attractive if it contained signs of the grand aspirations, ideals and follies of humankind. Few things were considered more romantic than a medieval ruin which conjured up images of the traditional "romances" or idealistic sagas of the [[Middle Ages]].
England contained a great number of large Medieval ruins. These were chiefly castles destroyed by the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in the 17th century and, even more significantly, vast abbey churches ruined at the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century. These ruined abbey churches suffered three long-term fates. Some were used as quarries for their building materials. The more remote abbeys were simply left to slowly decay.  Those that were conveniently placed were awarded, with their associated lands, to favourites of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] and his heirs. Thus it was that many of England's nobility grew up in homes that included within their structure part the Gothic remains of an ancient church or its associated monastic buildings. Some of these houses, such as the poet [[Lord Byron|Byron's]] home, [[Newstead Abbey]], contain reference to their origin within their name.

In the 18th century the owning of such a pile became fashionable. Those of noble lineage who did not have a ruin or a battlemented tower or an interior with pointed arcades promptly built one. Among the earliest of these creations was the novelist [[Horace Walpole|Horace Walpole's]] refurbishing of his London villa, which gave its name to the pretty and somewhat superficial style of architectural decoration known as [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill Gothick]]. The movement gained impetus- Sir [[Walter Scott]] built himself a Scottish Baronial mansion, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]]; the castles of [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]], [[Arundel Castle|Arundel]] and [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] were refurbished by their owners. The movement was just as strong in Germany where "Mad" King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] indulged his medievalism by building the [[Disneyland]] icon of [[Neuschwanstein]]. All over Europe, those who could afford to do so began the restoration and refurbishment of Medieval buildings. The last great Romantic flourish was the building of [[Castle Drogo]] by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] between 1910 and 1930.

====The Oxford Movement====
Begun in [[Oxford]] in 1833 by the theologian [[John Keble]] and supported by John Henry Newman, the [[Oxford Movement]] stressed the universality or "catholic" nature of the Christian Church and urged priests of the [[Church of England]] to reconsider their [[English Reformation|pre-Reformation]] traditions in both [[Doctrine]] and [[Liturgy]]. While reinforcing the concept of direct descent from the Apostles through the Church of Rome, the movement did not advocate a return to Roman Catholicism. In practice, however, several hundred Anglican priests, including Newman, became Roman Catholic. The long-term effects of the Oxford Movement were the rapid expansion of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Catholic liturgical styles in many Anglican churches. The emphasis on liturgical rites brought about an artistic revolution in church building and decoration.

====The Cambridge Camden Society====
Formed in 1839 as a society of [[Cambridge]] undergraduates with an interest in Medieval architecture, [[Cambridge Camden Society|this group]] developed into a powerful movement for the recording, study preservation of England's ancient churches, the analysis and definition of architectural style and the dissemination of such information through its publications, chiefly a monthly journal ''The Ecclesiologist'' (1841–1869).
The [[Cambridge Camden Society]] did much to bring about a revival of medieval styles in the design and appointments of 19th-century churches, as well as in the [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of older ones. Their notions were often highly prescriptive, inflexible and intolerant of diversity within the church. They were insistent upon revival rather than originality.

[[File:John Ruskin self portrait 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Self-portrait of [[John Ruskin]], advocate of the Gothic Revival.]]

====John Ruskin====
[[John Ruskin]] (1819–1900), an art critic, wrote two books that were highly influential in Art Philosophy. In ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' (1849) and ''The Stones of Venice'' (1851–1853), he discussed the moral, social and religious implications of buildings, emphasising the desirability of an ethical approach to the practice of the arts. His thinking influenced the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], whose artistic style Ruskin defended against criticism.

====The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 1849–1853====
This group of artists, of whom [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[William Holman Hunt]] were the central figures, rejected the indulgent [[classicism]], the [[materialism]] and the lack of [[social responsibility]] that they perceived in the artistic trends of mid-19th-century painting. They sought to recreate in their works the simple forms, bright colours, religious devotion and artistic anonymity of the period of art that preceded the rise of the great and famous individuals of the [[Renaissance]] period. They initially exhibited their works signed only with the initials PRB, [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].

[[File:George Frederic Watts portrait of William Morris 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Morris]], designer, craftsman and teacher, portrait by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1870]]

====The Arts and Crafts Movement====
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) was for a time a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and was influenced by their ideals and those of John Ruskin. As a precociously diverse designer, he saw the creation of arts in terms of social responsibility. He rejected, as Ruskin did, the mass-production of ornate and decorative wares of all sorts, such as those products of industry that were displayed in the 1851 [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]]. Morris advocated a return to cottage crafts and the revival and promulgation of old skills. To this end he formed a business partnership with Marshall and Faulkner, employing [[Ford Madox Brown]], another highly creative and dynamic artist and thus began what is termed "[[Arts and Crafts Movement|the Arts and Crafts Movement]]".
Stained glass was just one of many products of their studio. Morris and Brown saw themselves as original artists working in the spirit of their antecedents. They did not reproduce earlier forms exactly, and because of disagreements with the philosophy of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], rarely created stained glass windows for ancient churches.
William Morris's success as an entrepreneur was such that he was able to keep Rossetti, Burne-Jones and others in regular employment as designers. Through their teaching at the [[Working Men's College]] in London the group had enormous influence on many designers of all sorts.

====The Aesthetic Movement====
The [[Aesthetic Movement]] was a reaction against both the works of industry and the influential Socialist and Christian idealism of Morris and Ruskin who both saw art as directly linked to morality. Followers of the Aesthetic Movement, who included Burne-Jones and other stained glass designers such as Henry Holiday, propounded a philosophy of "Art for Art's sake". The style that evolved was sensuous and luxurious, linked with the rise of [[Art Nouveau]].

[[File:AWNPugin.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]], architect and designer.]]

===Architectural===

====Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin====
[[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812–1852) was the son of the Neo-Gothic architect [[Augustus Charles Pugin]] and was a convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in 1835. He built his first church in 1837. He was an enormously productive and meticulous church architect and designer of interiors.  With the growth of Roman Catholicism in England, and the development of large industrial centres there was much scope for his talents. He worked with and employed other designers and was instrumental in encouraging the firm of [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham to turn their attention to the production of glass.
Pugin's most renowned designs are the interiors, particularly the [[House of Lords]], that he designed for the architect [[Sir Charles Barry]], (1795–1860) at the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London. After the destruction by fire of the Houses of Parliament in 1834, Barry had won the commission for their rebuilding, the stipulation being that they should be in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]], as the most significant part of the Medieval complex, the Great Hall of [[Westminster Hall|Westminster]], remained standing. The rebuilding, which took up the rest of Barry's life, included a vast array of arts and crafts of all kinds, not the least of which was stained glass windows, both pictorial and armorial.  The knowledge, elegance and sophistication of Pugin's designs imbue and unite the interiors. As an ecclesiastical designer, his influence upon every medium is hard to overstate.

[[File:George Gilbert Scott.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[George Gilbert Scott|George G. Scott]], architect and restorer of cathedrals.]]

====Sir George Gilbert Scott====
As an architect [[George Gilbert Scott|Scott]], (1811–1878), was persuaded by Pugin to turn his creativity towards Gothic Revival.  Scott was an Anglican, his first significant commission being the design of the [[Martyrs' Memorial]] in [[Oxford]], a powerful and highly visible architectural statement against the [[Oxford Movement]]. To Sir Gilbert fell the task of [[Victorian restoration|restoration]] of many of England's finest Medieval structures including [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]], [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]], [[Chester Cathedral|Chester]], [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]] and [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]] Cathedrals. In the restorations, he was to employ and influence a great number of designers, including major stained glass firms.

====John Loughborough Pearson====
[[John Loughborough Pearson|Pearson]] (1817–1897) was, like Scott, chiefly a restorer of churches.  His major work was the creation of the new cathedral at [[Truro Cathedral|Truro]] in [[Cornwall]].

====Greek Thomson====
[[Alexander Thomson]], nicknamed "Greek", (1817–1875), was one of the best known Scottish architects of his day and had a profound effect on later architects, particularly [[Charles Rennie MacIntosh]]. His building designs are curious and eclectic combinations of elements from the [[Greek architecture|Classical]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], the [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and the [[Exoticism|Exotic]]. He designed a number of churches with richly decorated interiors and employed several stained glass firms to furnish them with glass in the appropriate style.

[[File:Thinke and Thanke Willement.jpg|thumb|left|Armorial window with Willement's motto, from his home, Davington Priory]]

===Manufacturing===

====Industrial Revolution====

With the [[Industrial Revolution|growth of industry]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and in particular the growth of those industries associated with commercial glass production, metal trades, [[metallurgy]] and the associated technical advancements, the scene was set for the revival of stained glass manufacture and the development of that industry on an unprecedented scale. [[Thomas Willement]], a plumber and glazier, produced his first armourial window in 1811, and is known as the father of the 19th-century stained glass industry. Because of the prevalence of [[leadlight]] windows, many glaziers had the required skills for making windows in geometric patterns using coloured glass for chapels and churches.  Between 1820 and 1840 some 40 different glass painters appear in the London trades directories.
At the time of the showcase of [[Victorian age|Victorian]] enterprise, the [[Crystal Palace Exhibition]] of 1851, stained glass manufacture had reached a point where 25 firms were able to display their works, including [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman]] of [[Birmingham]], [[William Wailes]] of [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Ballantine and Allen]] of [[Edinburgh]], [[Betton and Evans]] of [[Shrewsbury]] and [[William Holland (stained glass maker)|William Holland]] of [[Warwick]].

====Charles Winston====
Charles Winston was a 19th-century lawyer whose hobby was the study of Medieval glass. In 1847 he published an influential book on its styles and production, including a translation from Theophilus' ''On Diverse Arts'', the foremost Medieval treatise on painting, stained glass and metalwork, written in the early 12th century.

Winston's interest in the technicalities of coloured glass production led him to take shards of medieval glass to [[James Powell and Sons]] of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance was because it was too flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended a return to the manufacture of hand-made [[Architectural glass|crown]] and [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinder glass]] with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows.

==Stylistic developments in 19th-century stained-glass windows==
&lt;!---NOTE ON SIZING OF PICS if you remove the forced sizing, the pics won't fit. They are each illustrating the text next to them, so that the reader can see what is being described, so none ought to be removed.---&gt;
The stylistic trends below did not necessarily follow each other consecutively. Rather, they overlapped and co-existed. Some stained glass studios were essentially a one-man show in which a single craftsmen designed and made windows of a particular style. Other firms were managed with considerable entrepreneurial skills, employing a number of designers. Some designers freelanced- their work can be seen in windows by a number of firms. Some firms changed with changing tastes and survived well into the 20th century. John Hardman &amp; Co. is still in business.

[[File:Stained glass Quarries.jpg|thumb|95px|right|Window with hand-painted quarries.]]

===Armorial windows===

These contain precisely painted shields and [[Heraldry|heraldic]] decoration utilising painterly skills that had remained in use during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Thomas Willement]] was an armorial painter of windows.

===Geometric patterns===

These windows are simple and decorative, frequently utilising the skills of the provincial [[Plumbing|plumber]]/[[Architectural glass|glazier]]. Many of these windows are among the earliest use of coloured glass but comparatively few have survived because later [[Victorian era|Victorians]] have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s.

===Quarries===

These windows are usually patterned with [[fleur de lys]] and other floral motifs that were suited to the shape of the ''diamond panes''. They added a pleasant glowing ambience to an interior and in many churches in the early 19th century made up the entire glazing. They could be painted or stencilled with designs and are sometimes mould-cast or have impressed motifs. They were systematically replaced one by one when more elaborate windows were donated. These windows generally date from 1830 to 1860. [[James Powell and Sons|Powell]] was a major supplier of impressed and stencilled quarries.

[[File:Stained glass Foliage.JPG|thumb|95px|left|Medieval foliage and Classical Figures.]]

===Medieval foliate windows===

From studying [[Stained glass|Medieval windows]], particularly those at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], many stained glass artists became adept at designing foliage and decorative borders that reproduce [[Archaeology|archaeological]] originals. There are windows of this type in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing [[The Bible|scriptural]] texts.

In those windows that are set with figurative ''rondels'', the style within them is often [[Classicism|Classical]] (see below) but sometimes [[Gothic art|Medievalising]] and sometimes seeks to reproduce the original style so accurately that to they casual eye they have the appearance of ancient windows. Ancient windows in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] were removed in the 19th century and replaced with copies. There is a very fine [[Jesse Tree]] (the Ancestors of Christ) window of this nature at the eastern end. Two panels of the original have since been returned.

===Classical figures===

Although often striving for an [[Exoticism|exotic]] appearance, the figures in many early 19th-century windows are [[Classicism|classicising]] in style. Set against a background of ''geometry'', ''quarries'' or ''foliage'', the small painted incidents within ''rondels'' and ''quatrefoils'' are nearly always conservatively [[Academic art|academic]] in their appearance, with figures based on those in [[Steel engraving|engravings]] of works by admired painters, [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], [[Andrea del Sarto]] and [[Perugino]]. Often in the case of windows with ornate foliage, the archaeologically correct surrounds are at variance with the style of the rondels which make no attempt to reproduce the medieval. [[William Wailes]] and [[Charles Edmund Clutterbuck]] were among the important firms.

[[File:Stained glass Gothic Revival.JPG|thumb|right|95px|Gothic forms and pure colour.]]

===Gothic Revival===

Inspired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]] and the [[Gothic Revival]], some artists sought to reproduce the style of figures that they saw in ancient glass, [[illuminated manuscripts]] and the few remaining English wall paintings of the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] period. A major source was provided by the [[Biblia Pauperum]]  or so-called "Poor Man's Bible". The resulting figures are elongated, curvilinear and stylised rather than naturalistic. The drapery folds and scrolls are exaggerated and the gestures are expansive. The painted details are highly linear, crisply defined and elegant. The style lent itself to narrative, to pure colour and to highly decorative effects. While the figures may seem quaint or even naïve, the quality of design of many of these windows is often highly sophisticated and the detailing exquisite.  The masters of Gothic revival were [[Hardman &amp; Co.|John Hardman and Co.]] of Birmingham and [[Clayton and Bell]].

[[File:Stained glass Arts &amp; crafts.JPG|thumb|95px|left|asymmetric design with bold colours]]

===Arts and Crafts Movement===

The group that surrounded and were influenced by [[William Morris]] passed through a series of trends, initially [[Pre-Raphaelites|Pre-Raphaelite]], which, although espousing the Medieval, was not [[Gothic Revival]] in the archaeological sense, being an esoteric mix of [[Medieval art|Medieval]], [[Early Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] and deeply personal influences. The [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] style lent itself to the depiction of solidly working-class [[apostles]] and [[virtues]] set against backgrounds of quarries that resemble glazed earthenware tiles. The botanically accurate and semi-realistic grapevines, sunflowers and other growing things were more prominent than Gothic canopies.  Narratives that emphasised hard labour, human decency and charitable love were the themes that lent themselves to enthusiastic treatment by Morris and [[Ford Madox Brown]]. [[Burne-Jones]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] were to become philosophic traitors to the Arts and Crafts Movement by their association with the [[Aesthetic Movement]].

[[File:Stained glass Naturalism.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Human interest and tertiary colours.]]

===Naturalism===

The 1870s was a time of rich ornamentation and [[eclecticism]] in the arts. The treatment of Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to an appearance of having been carved from fine white [[limestone]]. [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] architectural details made an appearance and were often used without reference to the nature of the real [[architecture]] that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after [[World War I]].

The [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style of figure painting began to give way to a more naturalistic style in which the figures seem more three-dimensional and portrait-like. An important source at this time was German wood engravings and etchings. These were available in a number of forms. Bibles and Bible picture books were available with several different series of such [[steel engraving|engravings]]. The works of [[Albrecht Dürer]] were much admired. One of the advantages of using engravings as a source was that the essentially linear techniques that were employed by the engraver to define forms could be easily interpreted in lead and the fine linear treatment of shadows was likewise easy for the stained glass artist to achieve using the monochrome paint technique. There were also windows imported into England at this time from the studios of [[Mayer of Munich]] which influenced English designers towards this style.

In the late 19th century there is often a great richness in the colouration of the windows, marked by a use of tertiary colours including rich purple, salmon pink, olive green, claret red, saffron and brown. ''Flashed glass'' was skillfully employed to enhance deep folds in robes. With this interest in colour, many windows depict atmospheric effects. Sunsets, glowering storm clouds and blazing glories appear behind the figures.

In line with the naturalistic drafting of the figures, there is a pictorial emphasis on depicting human interaction and response, often with detailed facial expressions and rather flamboyant gestures. Large scenes with large figures were popular. Among the major exponents were [[Lavers, Barraud and Westlake]]; and [[Heaton, Butler and Bayne]].  These trends continued, taking two basic directions until [[World War I]].

The notable exceptions to the general trend were a large number of the windows made by Clayton and Bell who produced a diverse range of styles and continued to supply cheerfully coloured Gothic-style windows with a proliferation of bright red and yellow to catch the morning sun in church chancels.

[[File:Stained glass Refinement.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Elegant figures in subdued colours.]]

===Refinement===

A somewhat more reserved style emerged in which the vibrant colouration is toned down in favour of backgrounds that are basically white, discreetly enhanced with ''yellow-stain''. The clothing of the figures is often of the darker shades, royal blue, wine red and dark green and is lined or bordered with intricately decorated yellow-stained glass. The painting of canopies and draperies was taken to a new height. The [[grisaille|monochrome]] painting of faces is intensely detailed. The style lent itself to the depiction of [[saint]]s and [[prophet]]s, [[bishop]]s and [[admiral]]s, and [[Christ]] (or [[Queen Victoria]]) enthroned. The most influential firm in this style was [[Burlison and Grylls]]. There are many windows by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] of this type.

[[File:Stained glass Aesthetic.jpg|thumb|right|95px|Individual. Much use of opalescent glass.]]
'''Aestheticism'''

The [[Aesthetic Movement]] included [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Burne-Jones]], the illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and writer [[Oscar Wilde]]. They propounded "Art for Art's sake", claiming that Beauty was an end in itself and that the creation of art should not be bound to any social or moral ideals. The Aesthetic artists were primarily concerned with the creation of that which was beautiful. Because of this, windows created by these artists are often stylistically diverse from each other and from other styles, yet are highly recognisable as the work of a particular designer, rather than of a particular workshop.

These windows rarely pay homage to [[Medieval art|Medieval]] origins. They are closely associated with [[Art Nouveau]]. The designs are often sinuous, luscious and richly textured, making highly creative use of ''flashed glass'' and repetitive forms. Drifting clouds, sweeping draperies and angel's wings lent themselves to the art of the Aesthetes. The idiosyncrasies of Burne-Jones’ style make his windows particularly easy to recognise.  While [[Charles Eamer Kempe]] made many windows that were traditional and "safe", he designed others that are clearly aesthetic. [[Christopher Whall]] and, in America, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Tiffany]] were Aesthetic designers.

[[File:Stained glass Opulent.jpg|thumb|left|95px|Luxurious drapery, pearl borders.]]

===Opulence===

In the last days of the [[British Empire|Empire]], the technical proficiency and artistic excesses of the traditional stained glass artists reached their height. The great windows of this period demonstrate a mastery over figure drawing and stained glass painting. The artists had developed ways of achieving every possible textural effect through the expert application of ground-glass paint and yellow-stain:- babies’ ringlets, old men's beards, silk brocade, dove's feather, ripe grapes, gold braid, glowing pearls and greasy sheep's wool could all be painted to realistic perfection by any number of studios. Many windows of the [[Edwardian period]] are the most opulent creations of the stained glass industry. The youthful [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] of the [[Annunciation]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]] the fisherman, [[John the Baptist|John]] the itinerant preacher and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] the carpenter are all depicted in robes of the most sumptuous nature, lined with cloth of gold and lavishly decorated at the edges with rubies and pearls.

In the years immediately following [[World War I]], many of these windows were created by the more conservative studios as memorials to fallen soldiers. Hence there are countless two-light windows of [[St George]] and [[St Michael]] and even more lancets of the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]] gathering his lost sheep to the fold. These are the last product of the second [[Golden Age]] of stained glass window production.&lt;ref&gt;The example illustrated commemorates a 21-year-old soldier who died in the Great War. His brothers, who also died aged 17 and 19, are commemorated in the adjacent window of Christ with the Children.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common types of 19th-century windows based on content==
(For ''Glossary of terms''', see below. The terms in italics are explained.)

* Small rectangular or ''diaper quarries'' of clear glass set with an ''armorial'' shield, the colours being painted and fired onto the glass.
* Simple geometric decorative patterns in repeating shapes based on large, often overlapping, circles, squares and ''diapers'' set against a background of clear or decorated quarries, often within a plain brightly coloured border, surrounded by an additional clear border.
* Densely patterned diaper-shaped ''quarries'' with the design either hand painted in ''grisaille'' and ''yellow-stain'' or moulded and printed into the glass. See No.1 below
* ''Quarry'' windows set with one or more ''roundels'', ''quatrefoils'' or ''mandorlas'' containing a symbol, figure or biblical scene.
* Elaborate, intensely coloured foliage-based patterns, usually set with figurative roundels or quatrefoils and imitating ''Norman'' and ''Early Gothic'' windows. See No.2 below
* Rows of apostles, saints, prophets or virtues, each occupying one ''light'' and usually set in an architectural frame surmounted by an ornate ''canopy''. In the case of a large window with an irregular number of lights, the figure of Jesus or the Virgin with the Christ Child is usually at the centre. See No.3 below
* A series of related narrative scenes, each depicted in a single ''light'' within architectural surrounds. See No.4 below
* A series of small related narratives depicted in rows across several ''lights'', like a comic strip. See No.5 below
* A single significant incident or theme occupying a window of several ''lights'' so that the pictorial content spans the divisions in the window. See Nos.6&amp;7 below
* A complex arrangement in a large window where a central incident spread across several lights is surrounded by related themes in the outer lights, lower panels and ''tracery''. See No.8 for two related themes within a small window.

==Glossary of terms used above==

* '''Lancet''' – a single simply shaped window that is tall and narrow, and with a pointed arch at the top so that its shape is similar to a knife blade.
* '''Mullion''' – a vertical stone architectural member which divides and supports sections of a large window.
* '''Tracery''' – the pattern of stonework found at the tops of many windows.
* '''Light''' – one discreet section of a window of any shape, but most usually applied to the tall vertical sections when the window is divided up by stone mullions.
* '''Tracery lights''' – the irregularly shaped sections of glass that fill the tracery at the tops of windows.
* '''Panel''' – a part of a window that is constructed as a single piece. Most church windows with the exception of small lancets contain several panels.
* '''Diaper''' – a diamond or lozenge-shaped piece of glass. Many old windows, both ecclesiastical and domestic, are made from glass in a diaper pattern. Many figurative windows have a background of diapers.
* '''Quarry''' – a four-sided geometrically shaped piece of glass, coloured, painted, printed or impressed with a design and used to create a regular decorative pattern in a window.
* '''Grisaille''' – monochrome painting on glass using a mixture of ground glass, ground lead and other substances.
* '''Yellow-stain''' – a pigment of silver nitrate painted and fired on the surface of a window to give a bright yellow colour.
* '''Stone-border''' – a thin border of glass, generally white or transparent but sometimes red, encircling a window light and giving a radiant effect.
* '''Roundels, quatrefoils and mandorlas''' – these are shapes to be found within window designs, containing a picture or significant motif. A ''roundel'' is circular, a ''quatrefoil'' has four lobes like a simple flower, a ''mandorla'' is the shape enclosed by two arcs, meeting at points top and bottom and usually only used to contain a depiction of [[Christ]] or a symbol of him. It is sometimes also used for a depiction of the [[Virgin Mary]].
* '''Canopy''' – a motif found in many windows representing an elaborate architectural canopy, usually [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style but occasionally [[Classicism|Classical]]. The canopy and accompanying columns give the visual impression that the figure or scene is set in a carved niche or viewed through an elaborate window.
* '''Flashed glass''' – is glass which is made by dipping the blowing rod, or "pontil", into one colour then a second, and sometimes a third, before blowing to a sheet. The resulting sheet has a thin layer of a darker colour "flashed" over a paler colour. The dark colour can be removed, or partially removed, by abrading or etching. It is frequently used for heraldry.
* '''Norman style''' – windows with semicircular tops, in which the glass is usually divided into geometric sections by iron bracing. In the style of the 11th and 12th centuries.
* '''Gothic style''' – with pointed arches
* '''Early English''' (Gothic) – lancet-shaped windows that are often grouped together. In the style of the mid 12th to early 13th centuries.
* '''Geometric''' (Decorated Gothic) – pointed-arched windows which have tracery in circle-based geometric designs. In the style of the mid-13th to early 14th centuries.
* '''Curvilinear''' or '''Flowing''' (Decorated Gothic) – Gothic windows which have tracery with S-shaped curves and flame-like forms, sometimes very elaborate. In the style of the 14th century.
* '''Perpendicular''' (Gothic) – Gothic windows which appear wide with flattened pointed arches and are divided by regular vertical mullion and, in very large windows, horizontal transoms. In the style of the late 14th to early 16th centuries.
* '''Classical''' – windows with semi-circular arches and designs that are imitative of Classical [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or [[Renaissance]] form and detail.

'''CLARIN''' is a European research network working in the field of archiving and processing of language-related resources in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. 

CLARIN is an [[acronym]] for ''Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure''. CLARIN is a community of scholars of various disciplines and a network of institutions. The scholars use CLARIN as a forum for joined developments and exchange of resources. They also exchange information on [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[Standard Operating Procedure|procedure]]s for long time [[archiving]] of research data. The institutions of CLARIN offer services in the same field. 

On the European level, CLARIN is an independent body operating under [[European law]] as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium|European Research Infrastructure Community]] (ERIC). CLARIN ERIC represents the CLARIN community in the public and coordinates individual efforts in the field.

CLARIN is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLARIN entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010209|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

([https://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/EH%2BSK-CLARIN.bib_.txt BiBTeX])

== Objective ==
CLARIN's objective is to provide a research infrastructure for researchers of the humanities and social sciences working with language related material. The network should allow the persistent storage and access to the data in an archive, to disseminate the material and to reuse it in other research contexts. By exchanging material, effects of synergy are achieved by not duplicating work and participating at each other's development. Additionally new research questions can follow and the material can be used for quality assurance in the research process. 
By offering depositing services, tutorials and support for archiving, special search engines for language resources and web based analysis systems the infrastructure becomes usable for the research community.

'''CLARIN Vision'''

All digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a single sign-on online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Mission'''

Create and maintain an infrastructure to support the sharing, use and sustainability of language data and tools for research in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Value proposition'''

CLARIN makes digital language resources available to scholars, researchers, students, and citizen-scientists from all disciplines, especially in the humanities and social sciences, through single sign-on access. CLARIN offers long-term solutions and technology services for deploying, connecting, analysing and sustaining digital language data and tools. CLARIN supports scholars who want to engage in cutting edge data-driven research, contributing to a truly multilingual European Research Area.

For details please see: [https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition CLARIN Value proposition, 2017].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition|title=Value Proposition {{!}} CLARIN ERIC|website=www.clarin.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services offered ==
CLARIN offers a wide range of services to the research community, for example:
* Virtual Language Observatory,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/vlo Virtual Language Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; a special search engine for language resources available to the academic community via CLARIN
* Depositing services,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/content/depositing-services Depositing Services]&lt;/ref&gt; where scholars can deposit their own language related materials resulting from academic research processes 
* Web based analysis tools&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/Main_Page Web based analysis tools]&lt;/ref&gt; (webservices), offering software from computational linguistics for the academic community.

In addition to such technical services, tutorials are prepared, standards and processes developed and implemented. Researchers receive support in the archiving process, for example by reference material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.dwds.de/clarin/userguide/text/ CLARIN User handbook by CLARIN-D]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The majority of operations, services and centres of the CLARIN infrastructure is provided and funded by CLARIN ERICmembers (and observers). Members and observers can be countries or intergovernmental organizations. They set up a national consortium, typically consisting of universities, research institutions, libraries and public archives, of which at least one has the status of CLARIN centre (see [https://www.clarin.eu/content/overview-clarin-centres overview of CLARIN centres]). The contribution expected from members and observers is to create and provide access to digital language data collections, and digital tools and expertise for researchers to work with them.

Below is the list of current CLARIN ERIC members, observers and third parties:

'''Members:'''
* [[Austria]]
* [[Bulgaria]]
*[[Croatia]]
* [[Czech Republic]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[Estonia]]
* [[Finland]]
* [[Germany]]
* [[Greece]]
* [[Hungary]] 
* [[Italy]]
* [[Latvia]]
* [[Lithuania]]
* [[Netherlands]]
* [[Norway]] 
* [[Poland]]
* [[Portugal]]
* [[Slovenia]]
* [[Sweden]]

The [[Dutch Language Union]] (DLU) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] and member of CLARIN as well.

'''Observers:'''
* [[France]] 
* [[United Kingdom]]

'''Third party:'''
* Carnegie Mellon University (US)

== Type of organization ==
The CLARIN consortium is organized as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (ERIC) under [[European law]], which is a special type of organization created for [[research infrastructures]].
It is hence part of the activities in the [[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures]] ([http://www.esfri.eu/ ESFRI]) context.

== Government ==
On the European level CLARIN is governed by the following structures:

* CLARIN General Assembly: Assembly of all members of CLARIN ERIC, represented by a delegate of the appropriate ministries. There is one delegate per country who may bring a subject matter expert.
* CLARIN Board of Directors: Assembly of the directors for coordinating the committees, serving as contact points and for the administration of the consortium. It is the highest body outside of the General Assembly. The directors are nominated by the General Assembly. The chair persons of the National Coordinators' Forum and of the Standing Committee of CLARIN Technical centers are ex officio members of the Board of Directors.
* CLARIN National Coordinators' Forum: committee of national subject matter experts with one delegate per member. 
* CLARIN Standing Committee of Technical Centers (also: ''Centre Committee'' or ''SCCTC''): Delegates of the different CLARIN centres.
* CLARIN Scientific Advisory Board: consulting body of international experts who are not part of CLARIN but nominated by the General Assembly. 
* Other consulting committees as needed. At the moment there is the CLARIN Legal Issues Committee, (CLIC) and the CLARIN Standards Committee.

The seat of CLARIN ERIC is at the [[University of Utrecht]] with the office of the Executive Director. The staff of the office and all other institutions works distributed, the participants can be from all EU countries, and the staff may work from their home institutions.

Every member has a national CLARIN partner organization, often organized as national project networks. Every member supports at least one CLARIN centre, providing a repository for the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] scholar working with language oriented research data. Often these centres offer additional technical services and some [[webservice]]s beyond the national community.

Scholars of the CLARIN community meet every year for the CLARIN Annual Meeting. For this every member may send delegates, experts from CLARIN centres. These meetings are also used for the committees to report on their progress and inform about new developments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9270">'''Civic intelligence''' is an "[[intelligence]]" that is devoted to addressing public or civic issues. The term has been applied to individuals and, more commonly, to collective bodies, like organizations, institutions, or societies.&lt;ref name=Schuler-2007&gt;{{Harvnb|Schuler|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
Civic intelligence is similar&lt;ref name=Schuler-2007 /&gt; to [[John Dewey]]'s "cooperative intelligence" or the "democratic faith" that asserts that "each individual has something to contribute, and the value of each contribution can be assessed only as it entered into the final pooled intelligence constituted by the contributions of all".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewey|1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civic intelligence is implicitly invoked by the subtitle of [[Jared Diamond]]'s 2004 book, ''Collapse: Why Some Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Diamond|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the question posed in [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]]'s 2000 book ''Ingenuity Gap: How Can We Solve the Problems of the Future?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Homer-Dixon|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; that suggests that civic intelligence will be needed if humankind is to stave off problems related to climate change and other potentially catastrophic occurrences. With these meanings, civic intelligence is less a phenomenon to be studied and more of a dynamic process or tool to be shaped and wielded.&lt;ref name=Schuler-2007 /&gt;

[[Robert Putnam]], who is largely responsible for the widespread consideration of "social capital", has written that social innovation often occurs in response to social needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Putnam|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This certainly resonates with [[George Basalla]]'s findings related to technological innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basalla|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simultaneously facilitates and responds to social innovation. The concept of "civic intelligence," certainly an example of social innovation, is a response to a perceived need and the reception that it receives or doesn't receive will be in proportion to its perceived need by others.

Civic intelligence focuses on the role of civil society and the public for several reasons. At a minimum, the public's input is necessary to ratify important decisions made by business or government. Beyond that, however, civil society has originated and provided the leadership for a number of vital social movements. Any inquiry into the nature of civic intelligence must be collaborative and participatory. Civic intelligence is inherently multi-disciplinary and open-ended. Cognitive scientists address some of these issues in the study of "distributed cognition." Social scientists study aspects of it with their work on group dynamics, democratic theory, on social systems generally, and in many other subfields. The concept is important in business literature ("organizational learning") and in the study of "epistemic communities" (scientific research communities, notably).

No atlas of civic intelligence exists, yet the quantity and quality of examples worldwide is enormous. While a comprehensive "atlas" is not necessarily a goal, people are currently developing online resources to record at least some small percentage of these efforts. The rise in the number of transnational advocacy networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keck|Sikkink|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; the coordinated worldwide demonstrations protesting the invasion of Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Social Forum]]s that provided "free space" for thousands of activists from around the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sen|Anand|Escobar|Waterman|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; all support the idea that civic intelligence is growing. Although smaller in scope, efforts like the work of the Friends of Nature group to create a "Green Map" of [[Beijing]] are also notable.

==The term==
Like the term ''[[social capital]]'', ''civic intelligence'' has been used independently by several people since the beginning of the 20th century. Although there has been little or no direct contact between the various authors, the different meanings associated with the term are generally complementary to each other.

The first usage identified was made in 1902 by [[Samuel T. Dutton]], Superintendent of Teachers College Schools on the occasion of the dedication of the Horace Mann School when it noted that "increasing civic intelligence" is a "true purpose of education in this country." More recently, in 1985, David Matthews, president of the [[Kettering Foundation]], wrote an article entitled ''Civic Intelligence'' in which he discussed the decline of civic engagement in the United States.

A still more recent version is Douglas Schuler's "Cultivating Society's Civic Intelligence: Patterns for a New 'World Brain'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schuler|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Schuler's version, civic intelligence is applied to groups of people because that is the level where public opinion is formed and decisions are made or at least influenced. It applies to groups, formal or informal, who are working towards civic goals such as environmental amelioration or non-violence among people. This version is related to many other concepts that are currently receiving a great deal of attention including [[collective intelligence]], distributed intelligence, [[participatory democracy]], [[emergence]], [[new social movement]]s, [[collaborative problem-solving]], and [[Web 2.0]].

When Schuler developed the Liberating Voices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-69366-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pattern language]] for communication revolution, he made civic intelligence the first of 136 patterns.&lt;ref name="Civic Intelligence Pattern"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schuler|first1=Douglas|title=Civic Intelligence|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/civic-intelligence-1|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=26 October 2015|ref=Civic Intelligence Pattern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:CODIT example 4 - Auró.JPG|right|thumb|Example of Compartmentalization, with radial and circular walling, in an [[Acer platanoides]] of 5 years]]

'''Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees''' (CODIT), also known as Compartmentalization Of Disease In Trees by some, is a concept created by [[Alex Shigo|Dr. Alex Shigo]] after years of studying tree [[wood-decay fungi|decay]] patterns.  Though disputed upon its introduction in the late 1970s, the concept is now widely accepted by modern arboriculture and is referenced widely in publications including Shigo's 'Modern Arboriculture' and 'A New Tree Biology'.

==Theoretical background==
In keeping with the theory of [[spontaneous generation]], in which living things can develop from non-living things, scientists traditionally believed that tree decay led to fungal growth. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  With the advent of [[germ theory]], however, [[Germany|German]] [[forester]] [[Robert Hartig]] in the early 20th century theorized the opposite was the case, and developed a new model for [[wood-decay fungi|tree decay]]: when trees are wounded, [[fungi]] infect the wounds, and the result is decayed wood.  Over time, the research of Shigo and others helped to expand this theory, leading to the modern concept of tree decay: when trees are wounded, many organisms, not just fungi, infect the wood at different times and in different ways; trees respond to these infections with both chemical and physical changes; discolored and decayed wood results, but is limited by compartmentalization.

==Process==
[[File:CODIT Model.svg|thumb|CODIT model walls labeled]]
According to CODIT, when a tree is wounded [[Cell (biology)|cells]] undergo changes to form "walls" around the wound, slowing or preventing the spread of disease and decay to the rest of the tree.

*'''Wall 1.'''  The first wall is formed by plugging up normally conductive [[vascular tissue]] above and below the wound.  This tissue runs up and down the length of the [[Plant stem|stem]], so plugging it slows the vertical spread of decay.  Tissues are plugged in various ways, such as with [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]], polyphenolic deposits, anti-fungal substances and (in conifers) by the closure of the bordered pits linking vessel cells. This wall is the weakest.
*'''Wall 2.'''  The second wall is formed by the thick-walled, lignin-rich cells of the latewood [[growth ring]] interior and exterior to the wound, thus slowing the radial spread of decay.  This wall is the second weakest, and is continuous except where intersected by ray cells (see next section).
*'''Wall 3.'''  The third wall is formed by ray cells, which are groups of radiating cells oriented perpendicularly to the stem axis, dividing the stem into segments not entirely unlike the slices of a pie.  These groups of cells are not continuous and vary in length, height and thickness, forming a [[maze]]-like barrier to tangential spread of decay.  After wounding, some ray cells are also altered chemically, becoming toxic to some microorganisms.  This is the strongest wall at the time of wounding, prior to the growth of the fourth wall.
*'''Wall 4.'''  The fourth wall, known as the '''barrier zone''', is created by new growth of specialised woody tissue on the exterior of the tree, isolating tissue present at the time of infection from subsequent growth.  This is the strongest wall, and often the only one which can completely halt the spread of infection by closing the wound with new wood.  When only the fourth wall remains intact, the result is something most people have seen walking through the woods or in a park: a living tree with a completely rotted-out interior.  In such cases, all the tissue present at the time of injury has become infected, but new healthy tissue has been allowed to continue to grow outside of the fourth wall.

==Practical impact==
By increasing understanding of how trees respond to decay, CODIT has had many applications.  For example, [[arborists]] are frequently called upon to analyze the danger posed to people or property by a damaged or decaying tree.  By knowing how decay is likely to spread, such hazard tree analyses may be more accurate, thereby preventing unnecessary [[tree removal]], property damage, or injury.  For another example, in the production of [[maple syrup]] holes are drilled into a tree's vascular tissues, which necessarily damages the tree.  CODIT has helped farmers to better understand the effects of different tapping techniques and accordingly to change their methods to minimize damage and maximize production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313125348/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/forestry/Fh/fhissues/logtatum2.htm "Minimizing Wounding/Discoloration in Northern Hardwood Stands"], Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, retrieved September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Work done by Gilman et al. at the [[University of Florida]] shows that a wound's proximity to leaf mass greatly influences compartmentalization as well as wound closure.

[[File:IMG 0996 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An elderly [[Tibet]]an woman holding a prayer wheel demonstrates the continuity theory. Despite their age, older adults generally maintain the same traditions and beliefs.]]The '''continuity theory''' of normal [[Aging (life cycle)|aging]] states that older adults will usually maintain the same activities, [[behavior]]s, [[Social relationship|relationships]] as they did in their earlier years of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=American Society on Aging | title=Continuity theory: How elders find wisdom in spite of it all | url=http://www.asaging.org/at/at-214/continuity.html | accessdate=2007-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this [[theory]], older adults try to maintain this continuity of lifestyle by adapting strategies that are connected to their past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Atchley R. C. |year= 1989 |title= A continuity theory of normal aging |journal= The Gerontologist |volume= 29 |pages= 183–190 | issue=2 |pmid=2519525 |doi=10.1093/geront/29.2.183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuity theory is one of three major psychosocial theories which describe how people develop in old age.&lt;ref name="Ebersole2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Priscilla Ebersole|title=Gerontological nursing and healthy aging|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUlB72lFtIIC&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=4 June 2011|date=8 April 2005|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-03165-3|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two psychosocial theories are the [[disengagement theory]], with which the continuity theory comes to odds, and the [[Activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] upon which the continuity theory modifies and elaborates. Unlike the other two theories, the continuity theory uses a life course perspective to define normal aging.

The continuity theory can be classified as a micro-level theory because it pertains to the individual, and more specifically it can be viewed from the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist perspective]] in which the individual and society try to obtain a state of [[Social equilibrium|equilibrium]].

==History==
The continuity theory originated in the observation that a large proportion of older adults show consistency in their activities, personalities, and relationships despite their changing physical, mental, and [[social status]].&lt;ref name="Theory_history"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor1=Richard Schulz |editor2=Linda S. Noelker |editor3=Kenneth Rockwood |editor4=Richard L. Sprott | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aging| title = Continuity Theory| edition = 4th| year = 2006| publisher = Springer Publishing Company| volume = 1| isbn = 0-8261-4843-3| pages = 266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, George L. Maddox gave an [[empiricism|empirical]] description of the theory in a chapter of the book ''Middle Age and Aging: A Reader in Social Psychology'' called "Persistence of life style among the elderly: A [[longitudinal study]] of patterns of social activity in relation to [[life satisfaction]]". The continuity theory was formerly proposed in 1971 by Robert Atchley in his article "Retirement and Leisure Participation: Continuity or Crisis?" in the journal ''The Gerontologist''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Profiles in Gerontology: A Biographical Dictionary |last= Achenbaum |first= W. Andrew |authorlink= |author2=Daniel M. Albert |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood Press  |location= |isbn=0-313-29274-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1989, he published another article entitled "A Continuity Theory of Normal Aging, in ''The Gerontologist'' in which he substantially developed the theory. In this article, he expanded the continuity theory to explain the development of internal and external structures of continuity. In 1999, Robert Atchley continued to strengthen his theory in his book ''Continuity and Adaptation in Aging: Creating Positive Experiences''.&lt;ref name="Theory_history"/&gt;

==Elements==
The theory deals with the internal structure and the external structure of continuity to describe how people adapt to their situation and set their goals. The internal structure of an individual such as [[Personality psychology|personality]], [[idea]]s, and [[belief]]s remain constant throughout the life course. This provides the individual a way to make future decisions based on their internal foundation of the past. The external structure of an individual such as [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[role|social roles]] provides a support for maintaining a stable [[self-concept]]  and lifestyle.

==Criticisms and weaknesses==
The major criticism for the theory is its definition of normal aging.&lt;ref name="Criticisms"&gt;{{cite book |title= Aging and The Life Course: An Introduction to Social Gerontology |last= Quadagno |first= Jill |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages  |location= |edition=4th |isbn=0-07-352816-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory distinguishes normal aging from pathological aging, neglecting the older adults with chronic illness.

The [[Feminist theory|feminist theories]] criticise the continuity theory for defining normal aging around a male model.&lt;ref name="Criticisms"/&gt;

Another weakness of the theory is that it fails to demonstrate how social institutions impact the individuals and the way they age.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Zalta (ed.), URL = [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/decision-theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Decision theory can be broken into two branches: [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the [[optimal decision|best decisions]], given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]; and descriptive decision theory, which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions.

Closely related to the field of [[game theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myerson|first1=Roger B.|title=Game theory analysis of conflict|date=1991|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674728615|chapter=1.2: Basic concepts of Decision Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision theory is concerned with the choices of individual agents whereas game theory is concerned with interactions of agents whose decisions affect each other. Decision theory is an interdisciplinary topic, studied by economists,
statisticians, psychologists, biologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habibi|first=Iman|last2=Cheong|first2=Raymond|last3=Lipniacki|first3=Tomasz|last4=Levchenko|first4=Andre|last5=Emamian|first5=Effat S.|last6=Abdi|first6=Ali|date=2017-04-05|title=Computation and measurement of cell decision making errors using single cell data|url=http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|volume=13|issue=4|pages=e1005436|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005436|issn=1553-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt; political and other social scientists, philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, Sven Ove. "Decision theory: A brief introduction." (2005) Section 1.2: A truly interdisciplinary subject.&lt;/ref&gt; and computer scientists.

Empirical applications of this rich theory are usually done with the help of [[statistics|statistical]] and [[econometrics|econometric]] methods, especially via the so-called choice models, such as [[probit]] and [[logit]] models. Estimation of such models is usually done via parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric [[maximum likelihood]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167947316302596 | doi=10.1016/j.csda.2016.10.024 | volume=108 | title=Nonparametric estimation of dynamic discrete choice models for time series data | year=2017 | journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis | pages=97–120 | last1 = Park | first1 = Byeong U. | last2 = Simar | first2 = Léopold | last3 = Zelenyuk | first3 = Valentin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Normative and descriptive==
[[Normative]] decision theory is concerned with identifying the best decision to make, modelling an ideal decision maker who is able to compute with perfect accuracy and is fully [[rationality|rational]]. The practical application of this prescriptive approach (how people ''ought to'' make decisions) is called [[decision analysis]], and is aimed at finding tools, methodologies and software ([[decision support system]]s) to help people make better decisions.

In contrast, [[Positive statement|positive]] or descriptive decision theory is concerned with describing observed behaviors under the assumption that the decision-making agents are behaving under some consistent rules. These rules may, for instance, have a procedural framework (e.g. [[Amos Tversky]]'s elimination by aspects model) or an [[axiom]]atic framework, reconciling the [[Expected utility hypothesis#Von Neumann|Von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms]] with behavioral violations of the [[expected utility]] hypothesis, or they may explicitly give a functional form for [[time inconsistency|time-inconsistent]] [[utility function]]s (e.g. Laibson's [[Hyperbolic discounting|quasi-hyperbolic discounting]]).

The prescriptions or predictions about behaviour that positive decision theory produces allow for further tests of the kind of decision-making that occurs in practice. There is a thriving dialogue with [[experimental economics]], which uses laboratory and field experiments to evaluate and inform theory. In recent decades, there has also been increasing interest in what is sometimes called "behavioral decision theory" and this has contributed to a re-evaluation of what rational decision-making requires.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see: {{cite book |author=Anand, Paul |title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-823303-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What kinds of decisions need a theory?==

===Choice under uncertainty=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Risk]] --&gt;
{{Details|Expected utility hypothesis}}
The area of choice under uncertainty represents the heart of decision theory. Known from the 17th century ([[Blaise Pascal]] invoked it in his [[Pascal's Wager|famous wager]], which is contained in his ''[[Pensées]]'', published in 1670), the idea of [[expected value]] is that, when faced with a number of actions, each of which could give rise to more than one possible outcome with different probabilities, the rational procedure is to identify all possible outcomes, determine their values (positive or negative) and the probabilities that will result from each course of action, and multiply the two to give an "expected value", or the average expectation for an outcome; the action to be chosen should be the one that gives rise to the highest total expected value.  In 1738, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published an influential paper entitled ''Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk'', in which he uses the [[St. Petersburg paradox]] to show that expected value theory must be [[Norm (philosophy)|normatively]] wrong. He gives an example in which a Dutch merchant is trying to decide whether to insure a cargo being sent from Amsterdam to St Petersburg in winter. In his solution, he defines a [[utility function]] and computes [[expected utility]] rather than expected financial value (see&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoemaker|first=P. J. H.|title=The Expected Utility Model: Its Variants, Purposes, Evidence and Limitations|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=20|year=1982|pages=529–563}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a review).

In the 20th century, interest was reignited by [[Abraham Wald|Abraham Wald's]] 1939 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses
 |last=Wald |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Wald
 |journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]
 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=299–326 |year=1939
 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177732144
 |mr=932
}}&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out that the two central procedures of [[frequentist statistics|sampling-distribution-based]] statistical-theory, namely [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis testing]] and [[estimation theory|parameter estimation]], are special cases of the general decision problem.  Wald's paper renewed and synthesized many concepts of statistical theory, including [[loss function]]s, [[risk function]]s, [[admissible decision rule]]s, [[prior probability|antecedent distributions]], [[admissible decision rule#Bayes rules|Bayesian procedures]], and [[minimax]] procedures.  The phrase "decision theory" itself was used in 1950 by [[E. L. Lehmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehmann|first=E. L.|authorlink=E. L. Lehmann|title=Some Principles of the Theory of Testing Hypotheses|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|year=1950|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–26|jstor=2236552|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177729884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of [[subjective probability]] theory, from the work of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], [[Bruno de Finetti]], [[L. J. Savage|Leonard Savage]] and others, extended the scope of expected utility theory to situations where subjective probabilities can be used. At the time, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s theory of [[expected utility]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Third ed.)|last=Neumann|first=John von|last2=Morgenstern|first2=Oskar|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953 |origyear=1944|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that expected utility maximization followed from basic postulates about rational behavior.

The work of [[Maurice Allais]] and [[Daniel Ellsberg]] showed that human behavior has systematic and sometimes important departures from expected-utility maximization. The [[prospect theory]] of [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] renewed the empirical study of [[behavioral economics|economic behavior]] with less emphasis on rationality presuppositions. Kahneman and Tversky found three regularities – in actual human decision-making, "losses loom larger than gains"; persons focus more on ''changes'' in their utility-states than they focus on absolute utilities; and the estimation of subjective probabilities is severely biased by [[anchoring]].

===Intertemporal choice===
{{Main|Intertemporal choice}}
Intertemporal choice is concerned with the kind of choice where different actions lead to outcomes that are realised at different points in time.  If someone received a windfall of several thousand dollars, they could spend it on an expensive holiday, giving them immediate pleasure, or they could invest it in a pension scheme, giving them an income at some time in the future.  What is the optimal thing to do?  The answer depends partly on factors such as the expected [[interest rate|rates of interest]] and [[inflation]], the person's [[life expectancy]], and their confidence in the pensions industry.  However even with all those factors taken into account, human behavior again deviates greatly from the predictions of prescriptive decision theory, leading to alternative models in which, for example, objective interest rates are replaced by [[hyperbolic discounting|subjective discount rates]].

===Interaction of decision makers===
Some decisions are difficult because of the need to take into account how other people in the situation will respond to the decision that is taken.  The analysis of such social decisions is more often treated under the label of [[game theory]], rather than decision theory, though it involves the same mathematical methods. From the standpoint of game theory most of the problems treated in decision theory are one-player games (or the one player is viewed as playing against an impersonal background situation). In the emerging field of [[socio-cognitive]] engineering, the research is especially focused on the different types of distributed decision-making in human organizations, in normal and abnormal/emergency/crisis situations.&lt;ref&gt;Crozier, M. &amp; Friedberg, E. 1995. "Organization and Collective Action. Our Contribution to Organizational Analysis" in Bacharach S.B, Gagliardi P. &amp; Mundell P. (Eds). Research in the Sociology of Organizations. Vol. XIII, Special Issue on European Perspectives of Organizational Theory, Greenwich, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex decisions===
Other areas of decision theory are concerned with decisions that are difficult simply because of their complexity, or the complexity of the organization that has to make them. Individuals making decisions may be limited in resources or are [[Bounded rationality|boundedly rational]] (have finite time or intelligence); in such cases the issue, more than the deviation between real and optimal behaviour, is the difficulty of determining the optimal behaviour in the first place. One example is the model of economic growth and resource usage developed by the [[Club of Rome]] to help politicians make real-life decisions in complex situations{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Decisions are also affected by whether options are framed together or separately; this is known as the [[distinction bias]].  In 2011, Dwayne Rosenburgh explored and showed how decision theory can be applied to complex decisions that arise in areas such as [[wireless communications]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenburgh, D. 2011. "Decision Theory with its Applications in Wireless Communication" in Zhang, Y. (Ed.), GUIZANI, M. (Ed.). (2011). Game Theory for Wireless Communications and Networking. Boca Raton: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heuristics==
{{Main|Heuristic}}

The heuristic approach to decision-making makes decisions based on routine thinking, which, while quicker than step-by-step processing, opens the risk of introducing inaccuracies, mistakes and fallacies, which may be easily disproved in a step-by-step process of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Payne | first2 = J. W. | year = 1985 | title = EFFORT AND ACCURACY IN CHOICE | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 395–414 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example of common and incorrect thought process is the [[gambler's fallacy]], or believing that a random event is affected by previous random events (truth is, there is a fifty percent chance of a coin landing on heads even after a long sequence of tails).  Another example is that decision-makers may be biased towards preferring moderate alternatives to extreme ones; the "Compromise Effect" operates under a mindset driven by the belief that the most moderate option, amid extremes, carries the most benefits from each extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roe | first1 = R. M. | last2 = Busemeyer | first2 = J. R. | last3 = Townsend | first3 = J. T. | year = 2001 | title = Multialternative decision field theory: A dynamic connectionist model of decision making | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 370–392 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A highly controversial issue is whether one can replace the use of probability in decision theory by other alternatives.

===Probability theory===
Advocates for the use of probability theory point to:
*   the work of [[Richard Threlkeld Cox]] for justification of the probability axioms,
*   the [[Dutch book]] paradoxes of [[Bruno de Finetti]] as illustrative of the theoretical difficulties that can arise from departures from the probability axioms, and
*   the complete class theorems, which show that all [[admissible decision rule]]s are equivalent to the Bayesian decision rule for some utility function and some [[prior distribution]] (or for the limit of a sequence of prior distributions). Thus, for every decision rule, either the rule may be reformulated as a [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] procedure (or a limit of a sequence of such), or there is a rule that is sometimes better and never worse.

===Alternatives to probability theory===
The proponents of [[fuzzy logic]], [[possibility theory]], [[quantum cognition]], [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], and [[info-gap decision theory]] maintain that probability is only one of many alternatives and point to many examples where non-standard alternatives have been implemented with apparent success; notably, probabilistic decision theory is [[sensitivity analysis|sensitive]] to assumptions about the probabilities of various events, while non-probabilistic rules such as [[minimax]] are [[robust statistics|robust]], in that they do not make such assumptions.

===Ludic fallacy===
{{Main|Ludic fallacy}}

A general criticism of decision theory based on a fixed universe of possibilities is that it considers the "known unknowns", not the "[[unknown unknowns]]"{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}: it focuses on expected variations, not on unforeseen events, which some argue (as in [[black swan theory]]) have outsized impact and must be considered – significant events may be "outside model". This line of argument, called the [[ludic fallacy]], is that there are inevitable imperfections in modeling the real world by particular models, and that unquestioning reliance on models blinds one to their limits.

[[File:Voyager 2 Neptune and Triton.jpg|thumb|400px|Photograph of the [[crescent]] of the planet Neptune (top) and its moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (center), taken by ''[[Voyager 2]]'' during its 1989 flyby]]
The '''definition of ''planet''''', since the word was coined by the [[ancient Greeks]], has included within its scope a wide range of celestial bodies. [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] employed the term ''asteres planetai'' (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), "wandering stars", for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky. Over the millennia, the term has included a variety of different objects, from the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] to [[natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s.

By the end of the 19th century the word ''[[planet]]'', though it had yet to be defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the [[Solar System]]. After 1992, however, astronomers began to discover many additional objects beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], as well as hundreds of [[extrasolar planet|objects orbiting other stars]]. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be [[star]]s, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a ''planet'' could be.

The issue of a clear definition for ''planet'' came to a head in January 2005 with the discovery of the [[trans-Neptunian object]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet, [[Pluto]]. In its August 2006 response, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of [[nomenclature]], released [[2006 definition of planet|its decision]] on the matter during a meeting in [[Prague]]. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System, states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is [[mass]]ive enough for its [[hydrostatic equilibrium|own gravity to make it round]], and has "[[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared its neighbourhood]]" of smaller objects around its orbit. Under this new definition, Pluto and the other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, and while many scientists have accepted the definition, some in the astronomical community have rejected it outright.

=== Planets in antiquity ===
[[File:Platon-2.jpg|thumb|upright|The philosopher [[Plato]]]]
While knowledge of the planets predates history and is common to most civilizations, the word ''planet'' dates back to [[ancient Greece]]. Most Greeks believed the Earth to be stationary and at the center of the universe in accordance with the [[geocentric model]] and that the objects in the sky, and indeed the sky itself, revolved around it (an exception was [[Aristarchus of Samos]], who put forward an early version of [[heliocentrism]]). Greek astronomers employed the term ''asteres planetai'' (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), "wandering stars",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/planet|title=Definition of planet|publisher=Merriam-Webster OnLine|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordsources.info/words-mod-planets.html|title=Words For Our Modern Age: Especially words derived from Latin and Greek sources|publisher=Wordsources.info|accessdate=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year, in contrast to the ''asteres aplaneis'' (ἀστέρες ἀπλανεῖς), the "[[fixed stars]]", which stayed motionless relative to one another. The five bodies currently called "planets" that were known to the Greeks were those visible to the naked eye: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]].

Graeco-Roman [[Timeline of cosmology|cosmology]] commonly considered seven planets, with the Sun and the Moon counted among them (as is the case in modern [[Planets in astrology|astrology]]); however, there is some ambiguity on that point, as many ancient astronomers distinguished the five star-like planets from the Sun and Moon. As the 19th-century German naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] noted in his work ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the seven cosmical bodies which, by their continually varying relative positions and distances apart, have ever since the remotest antiquity been distinguished from the "unwandering orbs" of the heaven of the "fixed stars", which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions and distances unchanged, five only—Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn—wear the appearance of stars—"''cinque stellas errantes''"—while the Sun and Moon, from the size of their disks, their importance to man, and the place assigned to them in mythological systems, were classed apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cosmos: A Sketch of a Physical Description of the Universe |author=Alexander von Humboldt |year=1849 |work=digitised 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3CEJAAAAIAAJ |page=297 |accessdate=2007-07-23 |publisher=H.G.

In his ''[[Almagest]]'' written in the 2nd century, [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] refers to "the Sun, Moon and five planets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Almagest by Ptolemy|author=R. Gatesby Taliaterro (trans.)|publisher= University of Chicago Press|year= 1952|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] explicitly mentions "the five stars which many have called wandering, and which the Greeks call Planeta."&lt;ref name=planeta&gt;{{cite web|title=Astra Planeta|author=theoi.com|url=http://www.theoi.com/Titan/AstraPlaneta.html|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Manilius]], a Latin writer who lived during the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] and whose poem ''Astronomica'' is considered one of the principal texts for modern [[astrology]], says, "Now the [[dodecatemory]] is divided into five parts, for so many are the stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=GP Goold (trans.)|title=Marcus Manilius: Astronomica|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1977|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single view of the seven planets is found in [[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', written sometime around 53 BC, where the spirit of [[Scipio Africanus]] proclaims, "Seven of these spheres contain the planets, one planet in each sphere, which all move contrary to the movement of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dream of Scipio|author=Cicero|work=Roman Philosophy |others=Richard Hooker (translator)|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/SCIPIO.HTM|year=1996|accessdate=2007-06-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703203835/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ROME/SCIPIO.HTM |archivedate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', written in 77 AD, [[Pliny the Elder]] refers to "the seven stars, which owing to their motion we call planets, though no stars wander less than they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural History vol 1|author=IH Rackham|publisher=William Heinemann Ltd.|year=1938|page= 177, viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonnus]], the 5th century Greek poet, says in his ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', "I have oracles of history on seven tablets, and the tablets bear the names of the seven planets."&lt;ref name=planeta /&gt;

=== Planets in the Middle Ages ===
[[File:John Gower world Vox Clamantis.jpg|thumb|upright|John Gower]]
Medieval and Renaissance writers generally accepted the idea of seven planets. The standard medieval introduction to astronomy, [[Sacrobosco|Sacrobosco's]] ''[[De sphaera mundi|De Sphaera]]'', includes the Sun and Moon among the planets,&lt;ref&gt;Sacrobosco, "On the Sphere", in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 450.  "every planet except the sun has an epicycle."&lt;/ref&gt; the more advanced ''Theorica planetarum'' presents the "theory of the seven planets,"&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "The Theory of the Planets," in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  while the instructions to the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' show how "to find by means of tables the mean ''motuses'' of the sun, moon, and the rest of the planets."&lt;ref&gt;[[John of Saxony (astronomer)|John of Saxony]], "Extracts from the Alfonsine Tables and Rules for their use", in Edward Grant, ed. ''A Source Book in Medieval Science,'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', 14th-century poet [[John Gower]], referring to the planets' connection with the craft of [[Classical planets in Western alchemy|alchemy]], writes, "Of the planetes ben begonne/The gold is tilted to the Sonne/The Mone of Selver hath his part...", indicating that the Sun and the Moon were planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Heather|title=The Seven Planets|journal=Folklore|year=1943|pages=338–361|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1943.9717687|volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who rejected the geocentric model, was ambivalent concerning whether the Sun and Moon were planets. In his ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'', Copernicus clearly separates "the sun, moon, planets and stars";&lt;ref name=koper&gt;{{cite web|title=The text of Nicholas Copernicus' De Revolutionibus (On the Revolutions), 1543 C.E.|author=Edward Rosen (trans.)|work=Calendars Through the Ages|url=http://webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Copernicus.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in his Dedication of the work to Pope Paul III, Copernicus refers to, "the motion of the sun and the moon... and of the five other planets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dedication of the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies to Pope Paul III|author=Nicolaus Copernicus|work=The Harvard Classics.  1909–14|url=http://www.bartleby.com/39/12.html|accessdate=2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth ===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|Copernicus]]
Eventually, when Copernicus's [[heliocentric model]] was accepted over the [[geocentric]], [[Earth]] was placed among the planets and the Sun and Moon were reclassified, necessitating a conceptual revolution in the understanding of planets. As the [[historian of science]] [[Thomas Kuhn]] noted in his book, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, (1962) ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 1st. ed., (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 115, 128–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Copernicans who denied its traditional title 'planet' to the sun ... were changing the meaning of 'planet' so that it would continue to make useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies ... were seen differently from the way they had been seen before... Looking at the moon, the convert to Copernicanism ... says, 'I once took the moon to be (or saw the moon as) a planet, but I was mistaken.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Copernicus obliquely refers to Earth as a planet in ''De Revolutionibus'' when he says, "Having thus assumed the motions which I ascribe to the Earth later on in the volume, by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth..."&lt;ref name=koper/&gt; [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] also asserts that Earth is a planet in the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'': "[T]he Earth, no less than the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly."&lt;ref name=gal&gt;{{cite web|title=Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|work=Calendars Through the Ages|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/calendars/year-text-Galileo.html|accessdate=2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern planets ===
[[File:William Herschel01.jpg|thumb|upright|William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus]]
In 1781, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] was searching the sky for elusive [[stellar parallax]]es, when he observed what he termed a [[comet]] in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased in proportion to the power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope.&lt;ref name=ken/&gt; However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his "comet", his colleague, British [[Astronomer Royal]] [[Nevil Maskelyne]], wrote to him, saying, "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] or tail to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Herschel: Astronomer and Musician of 19 New King Street, Bath|author=Patrick Moore|publisher=PME Erwood|year=1981|page=8|isbn=0-907322-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "comet" was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named [[Uranus]] after the father of Saturn.

Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846, and presumed irregularities in Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find [[Pluto]] in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all.&lt;ref name=ken&gt;

=== Satellites ===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|upright|Galileo Galilei]]
When Copernicus placed Earth among the planets, he also placed the Moon in orbit around Earth, making the Moon the first [[natural satellite]] to be identified. When [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] discovered his four [[Galilean moons|satellites]] of Jupiter in 1610, they lent weight to Copernicus's argument, because if other planets could have satellites, then Earth could too. However, there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were "planets"; Galileo referred to them as "four planets flying around the star of Jupiter at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siderius Nuncius|author=Galileo Galilei|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1989|page=26|others=Albert van Helden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Christiaan Huygens]], upon discovering Saturn's largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] in 1655, employed many terms to describe it, including "planeta" (planet), "stella" (star), "luna" (moon), and the more modern "satellite" (attendant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema Saturnium: Sive de Causis Miradorum Saturni Phaenomenon, et comite ejus Planeta Novo|author= Christiani Hugenii (Christiaan Huygens)|publisher=Adriani Vlacq|year= 1659|pages= 1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Cassini]], in announcing his discovery of Saturn's moons [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]] in 1671 and 1672, described them as ''Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne'' ("New planets around Saturn").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Decouverte de deux Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne|author=Giovanni Cassini|publisher=Sabastien Mabre-Craniusy|year= 1673| pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the "Journal de Scavans" reported Cassini's discovery of two new Saturnian moons in 1686, it referred to them strictly as "satellites", though sometimes Saturn as the "primary planet".&lt;ref name="Cassini1686–1692"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1098/rstl.1686.0013| last = Cassini | first = G.

=== Minor planets ===
[[File:Giuseppe Piazzi.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Piazzi, discoverer of Ceres]]
One of the unexpected results of [[William Herschel|William Herschel's]] discovery of Uranus was that it appeared to validate [[Bode's law]], a mathematical function which generates the size of the [[semimajor axis]] of planetary [[orbit]]s. Astronomers had considered the "law" a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] found a miniature new world, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet.&lt;ref name=Hilton&gt;{{cite web | author=Hilton, James L. | title=When did asteroids become minor planets? | work=U.S. Naval Observatory | url=http://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/weaver_projects/GPD/Contributed_Talks/hilton_gpd_poster.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in 1802, [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] discovered [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], a second "planet" at roughly the same distance from the Sun as Ceres. That two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking; even [[Shakespeare]] had ridiculed the idea ("Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King Henry the Fourth Part One in The Globe Illustrated Shakespeare: The Complete Works Annotated|author=William Shakespeare|publisher=Granercy Books|year= 1979|page= 559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, in 1804, another world, [[3 Juno|Juno]], was discovered in a similar orbit.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; In 1807, Olbers discovered a fourth object, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], at a similar orbital distance.

Herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification, [[asteroid]]s (meaning "starlike" since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled [[star]]s), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; This conception was entrenched by the fact that, due to the difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet-uncharted stars, those four remained the only asteroids known until 1845.&lt;ref name=18planets&gt;{{cite web

Ceres became "(1) Ceres", Pallas became "(2) Pallas", and so on. By the 1860s, the number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred, and observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them collectively as "[[minor planet]]s", or "small planets", though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such.&lt;ref name=Hilton/&gt; To this day, "minor planet" remains the official designation for all small bodies in orbit around the Sun, and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in the IAU's [[Minor Planet Catalogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The MPC Orbit (MPCORB) Database|url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/MPCORB.html|accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluto ===
{{main article|Planets beyond Neptune}}
[[File:Clyde Tombaugh image.jpg|thumb|upright|Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto]]

The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is mirrored in the story of [[Pluto]], which was named a planet soon after its discovery by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto, a tiny and icy world in a region of [[gas giant]]s with an orbit that carried it high above the [[ecliptic]] and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto's largest moon, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which allowed them to determine its mass. Pluto was found to be much tinier than anyone had expected: only one sixth the mass of Earth's Moon.  However, as far as anyone could yet tell, it was unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar to Pluto in composition, size, and orbital characteristics. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised [[Kuiper belt]] (sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt), a band of icy debris that is the source for "short-period" comets—those with orbital periods of up to 200 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Weissman, Paul R. | title=The Kuiper Belt|  bibcode=1995ARA&amp;A..33..327W|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.33.090195.001551 | year=1995 | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume=33 | pages=327–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluto's orbit lay within this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question.  Many scientists concluded that tiny Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet, just as Ceres had been a century earlier. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]] suggested that a "planet" should be redefined as "any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Brown, Mike. | title=A World on the Edge | work=[[NASA]] Solar System Exploration | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | accessdate=2006-05-25 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427091759/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=105 | archivedate=2006-04-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets. In 1999, [[Brian G. Marsden]] of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Minor Planet Center]] suggested that Pluto be given the [[minor planet number]] 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet.&lt;ref name=comet&gt;{{cite web

The discovery of several other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s approaching the size of Pluto, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population.

In the immediate aftermath of the object's discovery, there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a "[[tenth planet]]". NASA even put out a press release describing it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA-Funded Scientists Discover Tenth Planet|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/newplanet-072905.html| year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acceptance of Eris as the tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set Pluto as an arbitrary minimum size. Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognise Pluto's historical identity as a planet by "[[grandfathering]]" it into the planet list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topic&amp;nbsp;— First Mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt; "From Darkness to Light: The Exploration of the Planet Pluto"|author= Bonnie Buratti|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/events/lectures/nov05.cfm|year=2005|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IAU definition ==
{{main article|IAU definition of planet}}The discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] forced the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using [[approval voting]]. The definitions were:[[File:Michael E Brown 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael E Brown, discoverer of Eris]]
* A planet is any object in [[orbit]] around the Sun with a diameter greater than 2000&amp;nbsp;km. (eleven votes in favour)
* A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. (eight votes in favour)

Since no consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in [[Prague]] in August 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |title=Planet Definition |work=IAU |url=http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826193101/http://www.astronomy2006.com/planet-definition.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-26 |accessdate=2006-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from two of the three proposals.

The IAU further resolves:

[[Pluto]] is a "dwarf planet" by the above definition and is recognised as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.}}
{{TNO imagemap}}

The IAU also resolved that "''planets'' and ''dwarf planets'' are two distinct classes of objects", meaning that dwarf planets, despite their name, would not be considered planets.&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt;

On September 13, 2006, the IAU placed Eris, its moon Dysnomia, and Pluto into their [[Minor Planet Catalogue]], giving them the official minor planet designations [[Pluto|(134340) Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|(136199) Eris]], and [[Dysnomia (moon)|(136199) Eris I Dysnomia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circular No. 8747 |author=Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, International Astronomical Union |url=http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/iauc/08700/08747.html |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-07-03 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205035336/http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/special/08747.pdf web.archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[possible dwarf planets]], such as [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|2003 EL&lt;sub&gt;61&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|2005 FY&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] and [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], were left in temporary limbo until a formal decision could be reached regarding their status.

On June 11, 2008, the IAU executive committee announced the establishment of a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned "new category of trans-Neptunian objects" to which Pluto is a prototype. This new class of objects, termed [[plutoid]]s, would include Pluto, Eris and any other future trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU also determined that, for naming purposes, only those TNOs with an [[absolute magnitude]] brighter than H = +1 would be allowed into the category.

== Acceptance of the IAU definition ==
[[File:Outersolarsystem objectpositions labels comp.png|thumb|Plot of the current positions of all known [[Kuiper belt objects]], set against the outer planets]]

Among the most vocal proponents of the IAU's decided definition are [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the discoverer of Eris; [[Steven Soter]], professor of astrophysics at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]; and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]].

In the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], when the Hayden Planetarium was undergoing a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused to refer to Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;Space.com (2001).

This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Tyson [[The Pluto Files|wrote a book]] detailing the demotion of Pluto.

In an article in the January 2007 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Soter cited the definition's incorporation of current theories of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]]; that as the earliest [[protoplanet]]s emerged from the swirling dust of the [[protoplanetary disc]], some bodies "won" the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before the end of the initial formation period, both failed to win the accretion competition.

When the numbers for the winning objects are compared to those of the losers, the contrast is striking; if Soter's concept that each planet occupies an "orbital zone"{{Ref label|B|b|none}} is accepted, then the least orbitally dominant planet, Mars, is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100. Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, only accounts for one third of the material in its orbit; Pluto's ratio is even lower, at around 7 percent.&lt;ref name=Soter&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What is a Planet?|author= Steven Soter|work=Department of Astrophysics, American Museum of Natural History|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0608359.pdf|format=PDF|date=2006-08-16|accessdate=2015-07-15|arxiv= astro-ph/0608359|bibcode = 2006AJ....132.2513S |doi = 10.1086/508861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves "absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eight Planets|author=Michael E.

== Ongoing controversies ==
Despite the IAU's declaration, a number of critics remain unconvinced. The definition is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of [[Pluto]]-as-planet proponents, in particular [[Alan Stern]], head of [[NASA|NASA's]] [[New Horizons]] mission to [[Pluto]], have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community.&lt;ref name=britt&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto demoted in highly controversial definition| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title=Pluto: Down But Maybe Not Out| work= Space.com| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060831_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.

=== Clearing the neighbourhood ===
{{main article|Clearing the neighbourhood}}
One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of "cleared the neighbourhood around its [[orbit]]". [[Alan Stern]] objects that "it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Rincon|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5283956.stm| title=Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt|work=BBC News|accessdate=2007-02-28 | date=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition.{{Ref label|C|c|none}}
[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|The asteroids of the inner Solar System; note the [[Trojan asteroid]]s (green), trapped into Jupiter's orbit by its gravity]]
Mike Brown counters these claims by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the [[Trojan asteroid]]s), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called [[plutino]]s, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

In October 2015, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of the [[University of California Los Angeles]] proposed a metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone of extent 2{{radic|3}} of its [[Hill radius]] in a specific time scale. This metric places a clear dividing line between the dwarf planets and the planets of the solar system.&lt;ref name=Margot&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=A Quantitative Criterion For Defining Planets|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=150|issue=6|pages=185|author=Jean-Luc Margot |arxiv=1507.06300|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/150/6/185|bibcode=2015AJ....150..185M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation is based on the mass of the host star, the mass of the body, and the orbital period of the body. An Earth-mass body orbiting a solar-mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 [[astronomical unit]]s from the star.  A Mars-mass body at the orbit of Pluto clears its orbit. This metric, which leaves Pluto as a dwarf planet, applies to both the Solar System and to extrasolar systems.&lt;ref name=Margot/&gt;

Some opponents of the definition have claimed that "clearing the neighbourhood" is an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and organiser of the petition, expressed this opinion to [[National Public Radio]]. He believes that the definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location.  He believes that a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would not be considered a planet, because he believes that it would not have time to clear its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5788798| format=RealPlayer| title= Astronomers Prepare to Fight Pluto Demotion| first=Sykes| last=Mark| date=2006-09-08| accessdate=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown notes, however, that were the "clearing the neighbourhood" criterion to be abandoned, the number of planets in the Solar System could rise from eight to [[List of possible dwarf planets|more than 50]], with hundreds more potentially to be discovered.&lt;ref name=browndwarf/&gt;

[[File:Proteus (Voyager 2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], a moon of [[Neptune]], is irregular, despite being larger than the spheroidal [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]].]]

=== Hydrostatic equilibrium ===
The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU's]] definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own [[gravity]] to form them into a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]; this means that they will reach a round, [[ellipsoid]]al shape. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point gravity begins to pull an object towards its own [[centre of mass]] until the object collapses into an ellipsoid. (None of the large objects of the Solar System are truly spherical.  Many are [[spheroid]]s, and several, such as the larger moons of Jupiter and Saturn and the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}}, have been further distorted into ellipsoids by rapid rotation or [[tidal force]]s, but still in hydrostatic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Brown, Michael E.| title=2003EL61| work= California Institute of Technology| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/2003EL61| accessdate=2006-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

However, there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, "how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice."&lt;ref name=Soter /&gt; Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices,{{Ref label|D|d|none}} such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas.&lt;ref name=browndwarf&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dwarf Planets|author=Mike Brown|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat energy, from [[gravitational collapse]], [[impact event|impacts]], tidal forces, or [[radioactive decay]], also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]], which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is.&lt;ref name="Thomas2010"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2010.01.025| last1 = Thomas| first1 = P.

=== Double planets and moons ===
{{main article|Double planet}}
[[File:Pluto and Charon from Hubble.jpg|thumb|A [[telescope|telescopic]] image of [[Pluto]] and [[Charon (moon)|Charon]]]]

The definition specifically excludes [[natural satellite|satellites]] from the category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term "satellite".&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt; In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for [[Pluto]] and its largest satellite, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], which possess a [[barycenter]] outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto–Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, even though they are similar in relative size, only Pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet.&lt;ref name=IAU0603/&gt;

[[File:Moon trajectory1.png|thumb|A diagram illustrating the [[Moon]]'s co-orbit with the [[Earth]]]]

However, some have suggested that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, [[Isaac Asimov]] noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the [[ecliptic]], the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1975). ''Just Mooning Around'', In: Of time and space, and other things. Avon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. There are 19 moons in the Solar System that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and would be considered planets if only the physical parameters are considered.  Both Jupiter's moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] are larger than Mercury, and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth's. Moons such as [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a [[magnetic field]]. Just as [[star]]s in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets.&lt;ref name=Buie2005&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is hard to make a consistent argument that a 400&amp;nbsp;km iceball should count as a planet because it might have interesting geology, while a 5000&amp;nbsp;km satellite with a massive atmosphere, methane lakes, and dramatic storms [Titan] shouldn't be put into the same category, whatever you call it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he goes on to say that, "For most people, considering round satellites (including our Moon) "planets" violates the idea of what a planet is."&lt;ref name=Brown /&gt;

[[Alan Stern]] has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term ''satellite planet'' for a planet-sized satellite.&lt;ref name="satelliteplanet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Stern, K. D. Runyon  et al. proposed a new geophysical definition of planet that defined a planet simply as an object large enough to be spherical under its own gravity but not large enough to fuse. This definition would add 19 moons to the list of planets in our Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Geophysical Planet Definition|author=K.D. Runyon, S.A. Stern, T.R.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The material difference between a low-mass star and a large [[gas giant]] is not clearcut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and [[helium]], with trace levels of heavier [[chemical element|elements]] in their [[atmosphere]]s. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the "top down," out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the "bottom up," from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of [[silicate]]s or ices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2004| author=G. Wuchterl| title=Giant planet formation| work=Institut für Astronomie der Universität Wien| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j6357423q7324013/| accessdate=2006-10-04| doi=10.1007/BF00613290|bibcode = 1994EM&amp;P...67...51W }}&lt;/ref&gt; As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores, though the [[Juno mission|''Juno'' mission]] to Jupiter could resolve the issue. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet.

[[File:Brown Dwarf Gliese 229B.jpg|thumb|left|The brown dwarf [[Gliese 229B]] in orbit around its star]]
Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object's ability to [[Nuclear fusion|fuse]] [[hydrogen]] in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse [[deuterium]]. However, due to the relative rarity of that [[isotope]], this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star's lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Basri | first=Gibor | title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics | year=2000 | volume=38 | pages=485–519 | doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 | bibcode=2000ARA&amp;A..38..485B}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binary star]]s and other multiple-star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer [[Adam Burrows (astronomer)|Adam Burrows]] of the [[University of Arizona]] claims that "from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burrows, Adam |author2=Hubbard, W.B. |author3=Lunine, J. |author4=Leibert, James | year=2001 | title=The Theory of Brown Dwarfs and Extrasolar Giant Planets | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.73.719 | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=73 | issue=3 | pages=719–765 | arxiv=astro-ph/0103383|bibcode = 2001RvMP...73..719B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrows also claims that such stellar remnants as [[white dwarfs]] should not be considered stars,&lt;ref&gt;Croswell p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; a stance which would mean that an orbiting [[white dwarf]], such as [[Sirius B]], could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to sustain atomic fusion during its lifetime should be considered a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Croswell, Ken | year=1999 | title=Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems| publisher= Oxford University Press|page=119|isbn=0-19-288083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The confusion  does not end with brown dwarfs. Maria Rosa Zapatario-Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young [[star cluster]]s of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2000|author1=Zapatero M.

[[File:hubbledwarf.jpg|left|thumb|upright|CHXR 73 b, an object which lies at the border between planet and brown dwarf]]
This definition makes location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a "sub-brown dwarf," whereas such an object in orbit around a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical. Further, in 2010, a paper published by Burrows, David S. Spiegel and John A. Milsom called into question the 13-Jupiter-mass criterion, showing that a brown dwarf of three times solar [[metallicity]] could fuse deuterium at as low as 11 Jupiter masses.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1008.5150 |author1=David S.

====Planetary-mass stellar objects====
The ambiguity inherent in the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] observed [[Cha 110913-773444]] (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own [[planetary system]]. Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year= 2005| author= Clavin, Whitney| title=A Planet With Planets?

In September 2006, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] imaged [[CHXR 73 b]] (left), an object orbiting a young companion star at a distance of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's [[protoplanetary disc]], and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet or failed star?

In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the [[Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics]] of [[Grenoble]] in France announced the discovery of [[CFBDSIR 2149-0403]]; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the [[AB Doradus moving group]], less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a [[T dwarf|spectral class T brown dwarf]], Delorme speculates that it may be a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CFBDSIR2149-0403: a 4-7 Jupiter-mass free-ﬂoating planet in the young moving group AB Doradus?|author1=P.

In October 2013, astronomers led by Dr. Michael Liu of the [[University of Hawaii]] discovered [[PSO J318.5-22]], a solitary free-floating [[L dwarf]] estimated to possess only 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter, making it the least massive [[sub-brown dwarf]] yet discovered.&lt;ref name="liu_discovery"&gt;

=== Semantics ===
Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as ''not'' so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and '[[minor planet]]' are best considered [[compound noun]]s. [[Benjamin Zimmer]] of [[Language Log]] summarised the confusion: "The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as '[[Welsh rabbit]]' (not really a rabbit) and '[[Rocky Mountain oysters]]' (not really oysters)."&lt;ref name=langlog&gt;{{cite web | last = Zimmer | first = Benjamin | authorlink = Benjamin Zimmer |title=New planetary definition a "linguistic catastrophe"!| work=[[Language Log]]| url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003504.html| accessdate=2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Dava Sobel]], the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with [[National Public Radio]], "A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Travel Guide to the Solar System |year=2006 |work=National Public Radio |url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Oct/hour2_102706.html |accessdate=2006-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107104814/http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Oct/hour2_102706.html |archivedate=2006-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Brown noted in an interview with the Smithsonian that, "Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word "dwarf planet," but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets."&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|title=Pluto's Planethood: What Now? |work=Air and Space |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2006/august-september/FEATURE-PlutoDebate.php?page=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101211205/http://www.airspacemag.com/issues/2006/august-september/FEATURE-PlutoDebate.php?page=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-01 |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, astronomer Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, "The name 'minor planet' [has] been more or less synonymous with 'asteroid' for a very long time. So it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'."&lt;ref name=langlog /&gt;

[[File:SoilStack.PNG|thumb|{{colorbox|darkseagreen}}{{nbsp}}Soil stack is connected to the sewer at the bottom and vented at the top, while {{colorbox|white}}{{nbsp}}each plumbing fixture has its own trap.]]
In modern [[plumbing]], a '''drain-waste-vent''' (or DWV) is part of a system that removes [[sewage]] and [[greywater]] from a building, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes to aid free flow. Waste is produced at [[Plumbing fixture|fixtures]] such as toilets, sinks, and showers, and exits the fixtures through a [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]], a dipped section of pipe that always contains water.

== Overview ==
DWV systems maintain [[pressure|neutral air pressure]] in the drains, allowing free flow of [[water]] and [[sanitary sewer|sewage]] down drains and through waste pipes by [[gravity]]. It is critical that a sufficient downward slope be maintained throughout, to keep liquids and entrained solids flowing freely towards the main drain from the building. In relatively rare situations, a downward slope out of a building to the sewer cannot be created, and a special collection pit and grinding lift "sewage ejector" [[pump]] are needed. By contrast, [[potable water]] supply systems operate under pressure to distribute water up through buildings, and do not require a continuous downward slope in their piping.

Every fixture is required to have an internal or external [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]]; double trapping is prohibited by [[plumbing code]]s due to its susceptibility to clogging. Every plumbing fixture must also have an attached vent. The top of stacks must be vented too, via a '''stack vent''', which is sometimes called a '''stink pipe'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Gee|title=Cat burglar's crude escape|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/cat-burglars-crude-escape/story-e6freuzi-1111114069411|date=30 July 2007|accessdate=20 March 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All plumbing waste fixtures use traps to prevent [[sewer gas]]es from leaking into the house. Through traps, all fixtures are connected to waste lines, which in turn take the waste to a "soil stack", or "soil vent pipe". At the building drain system's lowest point, the drain-waste vent is attached, and rises (usually inside a wall) to and out of the roof. Waste exits from the building through the building's main drain and flows through a sewage line, which leads to a [[septic system]] or a [[sanitary sewer|public sewer]]. [[Cesspit]]s are generally prohibited in developed areas.

The '''venting system''', or '''plumbing vents''', consists of a number of pipes leading from waste pipes to the outdoors, usually through the roof. Vents provide a means to release sewer gases outside instead of inside the house. Vents also admit oxygen to the waste system to allow [[aerobic decomposition|aerobic]] sewage digestion, and to discourage noxious [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic decomposition]].{{elucidate|date=March 2015}} Vents provide a way to equalize the pressure on both sides of a trap, thereby allowing the trap to hold the water which is needed to maintain effectiveness of the trap, and avoiding "trap suckout" which otherwise might occur.

== Operation ==

A [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] pipe is normally at neutral air pressure compared to the surrounding [[atmosphere]]. When a column of [[waste water]] flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead of it in the pipe, creating a ''positive'' pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream trap water seals. As the column of water passes, air must freely flow in behind the waste stream, or ''negative'' pressure results. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge.

Excessive negative air pressure, behind a "slug" of water that is draining, can [[siphon]] water from [[Trap (plumbing)|traps]] at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a [[toilet]] outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious [[sewer gas]]es to enter a building.

On the other hand, if the air pressure within the drain becomes suddenly higher than ambient, this positive transient could cause waste water to be pushed into the fixture, breaking the trap seal, with serious [[hygiene]] and health consequences if too forceful. [[Tall buildings]] of three or more stories are particularly susceptible to this problem. '''Vent stacks''' are installed in parallel to waste stacks to allow proper venting in tall buildings.

== External venting ==
Most residential building drainage systems in North America are vented directly through the building roofs. The DWV pipe is typically [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or [[PVC]] DWV-rated plastic pipe equipped with a [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] at the roof penetration to prevent rainwater from entering the buildings. Older homes may use [[copper]], [[iron]], [[lead]] or [[clay]] pipes, in rough order of increasing antiquity.

Under many older building codes, a vent stack (a pipe leading to the main roof vent) is required to be within a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack.  One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run.  Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a [[Piping and plumbing fittings#Clean-outs|cleanout]] allows for better serviceability of the long run.

A blocked vent is a relatively common problem caused by anything from leaves, to dead animals, to [[Ice jam|ice dam]]s in very cold weather, or a horizontal section of the venting system, sloped the wrong way and filled with water from rain or condensation. Symptoms range from bubbles in the toilet bowl{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} when it is flushed, to slow drainage,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and all the way to siphoned (empty) traps which allow sewer gases to enter the building.

When a fixture trap is venting properly, a "sucking" sound can often be heard as the fixture vigorously empties out during normal operation. This phenomenon is harmless, and is different from "trap suckout" induced by pressure variations caused by wastewater movement ''elsewhere'' in the system, which is not supposed to allow interactions from one fixture to another. Toilets are a special case, since they are usually designed to self-siphon to ensure complete evacuation of their contents; they are then automatically refilled by a special valve mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Internal venting ==
'''Mechanical vents''' (also called '''cheater vents'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/illegal-plumbing-products-in-minnesota/180329901/ |work=[[Star Tribune]] |date=21 November 2012 |title=Illegal Plumbing Products in Minnesota |first=Reuben |last=Saltzman |quote=Mechanical vents are not allowed in Minnesota. These are often referred to as cheater vents, and they come in two varieties - an air admittance valve and a check vent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) come in two types: Air admittance valves and '''check vents''', the latter being a vent with a [[check valve]].

'''Air admittance valves''' ('''AAVs''', or commonly referred to in the UK as '''Durgo valves''' and in the US as '''Studor vents''' and '''Sure-Vent®''') are negative-pressure-activated, one-way mechanical valves, used in a [[plumbing]] or drainage venting system to eliminate the need for conventional pipe venting and roof penetrations. A discharge of [[wastewater]] causes the AAV to open, releasing the vacuum and allowing air to enter the plumbing vent pipe for proper pressure equalization.

Since AAVs will only operate under negative pressure situations, they are not suitable for all venting applications, such as venting a sump, where positive pressures are created when the sump fills. Also, where positive drainage pressures are found in larger buildings or multi-story buildings, an air admittance valve could be used in conjunction with a positive pressure reduction device such as the PAPA positive air pressure attenuator, to provide a complete venting solution for more-complicated drainage venting systems.

Using AAVs can significantly reduce the amount of venting materials needed in a plumbing system, increase plumbing labor efficiency, allow greater flexibility in the layout of plumbing fixtures, and reduce long-term roof maintenance problems associated with conventional vent stack roofing penetrations.

While some state and local building departments prohibit AAVs, the International Residential and International Plumbing Codes allow it to be used in place of a vent through the roof. AAV's are certified to reliably open and close a minimum of 500,000 times, (approximately 30 years of use) with no release of sewer gas; some manufacturers claim their units are tested for up to 1.5 million cycles, or at least 80 years of use. AAVs have been effectively used in Europe for more than two decades.{{when|date=July 2015}} US manufacturers offer warranties that range from 1 year to "lifetime".

==Island fixture vent==
[[Image:chicago loop plumbing 01.png|thumb|right|400px|Island fixture vent for under-cabinet waste plumbing]]
An '''island fixture vent''', sometimes colloquially called a "Chicago Loop" or "Bow Vent", is an alternate way of venting the [[trap (plumbing)|trap]] installed on an under [[countertop|counter]] island [[sink]] or other similar applications where a conventional vertical vent stack or [[air admittance valve]] is not feasible or allowed.

As with all drains, ventilation must be provided to allow the flowing [[wastewater|waste water]] to displace the [[sewer gas]] in the drain, and then to allow air (or some other fluid) to fill the [[vacuum]] which would otherwise form as the water flows down the pipe.

An island fixture vent provides an elegant solution for this necessity:  when the drain is opened, water displaces the sewer gas up to the [[sanitary tee]], the water flows downward while sewer gas is displaced upward and toward the vent.  The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created.

The key to a functional island fixture vent is that the top elbow must be at least as high as the "flood level" (the peak possible drain water level in the sink).  This ensures that the vent never becomes waterlogged.

===Cost===
The cost of installation is high because of the number of elbows and small pieces of pipe required.  The largest cost outlay with modern plastic drain pipes is labor. Use of [[street elbow]]s is helpful.

Alternately if moving sink to an island sink, install the P-trap below the floor of the island and vent off the top of the drain.  Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain.  Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to existing vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned.  Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g., 1.25&amp;nbsp;inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm, etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a  plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean-out would permit the cleaning of the pipes.

== Fittings ==
{{See also|Piping and plumbing fittings}}
Drainage and venting systems require not only [[piping|pipe]], but also many specialized [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]] which add considerably to their cost of construction. Special access fittings such as "[[Piping and plumbing fittings#Clean-outs|clean-outs]]" enhance the long-term maintainability of the systems, and are required by most plumbing codes.

The '''Duhem–Quine thesis''', also called the '''Duhem–Quine problem''', after [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], is that it is impossible to test a [[scientific hypothesis]] in isolation, because an [[empirical method|empirical]] test of the hypothesis requires one or more background assumptions (also called ''auxiliary assumptions'' or ''auxiliary hypotheses''). In recent decades the set of associated assumptions supporting a thesis sometimes is called a ''bundle of hypotheses''.

==The substance of the thesis==
The Duhem–Quine thesis argues that no scientific hypothesis is by itself capable of making predictions.&lt;ref name="Harding1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sandra Harding|title=Can theories be refuted?: essays on the Duhem-Quine thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwit8JTcLfAC&amp;pg=PR9|year=1976|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-0630-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, deriving predictions from the hypothesis typically requires background assumptions that several other hypotheses are correct; for example, that an experiment works as predicted or that previous scientific theory is sufficiently accurate. For instance, as evidence against the idea that the [[Earth]] is in motion, some people objected that birds did not get thrown off into the sky whenever they let go of a tree branch. Later theories of physics and astronomy, such as [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[relativistic mechanics]] could account for such observations without positing a fixed Earth, and in due course they replaced the static-Earth auxiliary hypotheses and initial conditions.

Although a bundle of hypotheses (i.e. a hypothesis and its background assumptions) ''as a whole'' can be tested against the empirical world and be falsified if it fails the test, the Duhem–Quine thesis says it is impossible to isolate a single hypothesis in the bundle.  One solution to the dilemma thus facing scientists is that when we have rational reasons to accept the background assumptions as true (e.g. explanatory scientific theories together with their respective supporting evidence) we will have rational—albeit nonconclusive—reasons for thinking that the theory under test probably is wrong in at least one respect if the empirical test fails.

==Example from Galilean astronomy== 
The pioneering work of [[Galileo Galilei]] in the application of the [[telescope]] to astronomical observation met with rejection from influential sceptics. They denied the truth of his most startling reports, such as that there were [[Galileo Galilei|mountains on the moon]] and [[satellite]]s around Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Galilei, Galileo. Sidereus nuncius. 1610. [https://archive.org/details/Sidereusnuncius00Gali]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular some prominent philosophers, most  notoriously [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], refused to look through the telescope, arguing in effect that the instrument might have introduced [[Artifact (error)|artefacts]] producing illusions of mountains or satellites invisible to the unencumbered eye. To neglect such possibilities amounted to [[underdetermination]] in which argument for optical artefacts could be urged as being of merit equal to arguments for observation of new celestial effects, whether the latter were more parsimonious or not. On a similar principle in modern times a prevalent view is that [[Marcello Truzzi#.22Extraordinary claims.22|extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof]].

In the early 17th century the modern version&lt;ref name="Harding1976"/&gt; of the Duhem–Quine thesis had not been formulated, but commonsense objections to such elaborate and ad hoc implicit auxiliary assumptions certainly could be urged. To begin with, the mechanism of the (Galilean) telescopes had been explained in terms of [[geometrical optics]] and the nature of the objects that they imaged was consistent; for example a distant lake would not resemble a tree when seen through a telescope. The behaviour of telescopes on Earth denied any basis for arguing that they could create systematic artefacts in the sky, such as apparent satellites that behaved in the predictable manner of Jovian moons. Evidence also offered no basis to suggest that they could present yet other, more elaborate artefacts, fundamentally different from the satellites, such as Lunar mountains that cast shadows varying consistently with the direction of Solar illumination. 

In practice of course, the [[Galileo affair|politics and theology]] of the day trumped common sense, but the nature of the controversy was a clear example of how different bundles of (usually implicit) auxiliary assumptions could support mutually inconsistent hypotheses concerning a single topic. In terms of either version of the Duhem–Quine thesis it therefore is necessary to study the defensibility of the auxiliary assumptions together with the primary hypotheses if one is to select the most viable working hypotheses.

==Pierre Duhem==
As popular as the Duhem–Quine thesis may be in [[philosophy of science]], in reality [[Pierre Duhem]] and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] stated very different theses.  Duhem believed that ''only in the field of [[physics]]'' can a single individual hypothesis not be isolated for testing.  He says in no uncertain terms that experimental theory in physics is not the same as in fields like [[physiology]] and certain branches of [[chemistry]]. Also, Duhem's conception of "theoretical group" has its limits, since he states that not all concepts are connected to each other logically. He did not include at all ''a priori'' disciplines such as [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] within the theoretical groups in physics, since they cannot be tested.

== Willard Van Orman Quine ==
{{See also|Confirmation holism}}
Quine, on the other hand, in "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", presents a much stronger version of [[underdetermination]] in science.  His theoretical group embraces ''all'' of human knowledge, including mathematics and logic. He contemplated the entirety of human knowledge as being one unit of empirical significance.   Hence all our knowledge, for Quine, would be [[epistemological]]ly no different from [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[Greek gods]], which were posited in order to account for experience.

Quine even believed that logic and mathematics can also be revised in light of experience, and presented [[quantum logic]] as evidence for this.  Years later he retracted this position; in his book ''Philosophy of Logic'', he said that to revise logic would be essentially "changing the subject". In classic logic, connectives are defined according to [[truth value]]s. The connectives in a multi-valued logic, however, have a different meaning than those of classic logic. As for [[quantum]] logic, it is not even a logic based on truth values, so the logical connectives lose the original meaning of classic logic. Quine also notes that [[deviant logic]]s usually lack the simplicity of classic logic, and are not so fruitful.

The '''Etching Revival''' is the re-emergence and invigoration of [[etching]] as an original form of [[printmaking]] during a period of time stretching approximately from 1850 to 1930.

==Historical outline==
During the century after [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt's]] death the techniques of etching and [[drypoint]] brought to their highest point by him gradually declined. By the late eighteenth century, with brilliant exceptions like [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], most etchings were reproductive or illustrative.

However, in the 1840s and 50's in France, a number of artists did produce some landscape etchings which seemed to recapture some of the spirit of the [[Old Master print]]. [[Daubigny]], [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and especially [[Charles Jacque]] produced etchings that were different from those heavily worked reproductive plates of the previous century.

Several people were of special importance to the French Etching Revival. The publisher [[Alfred Cadart]],&lt;ref name="Oxford 359"&gt;Martin Kemp (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=95J-ppmZmt8C&amp;pg=PA359 ''The Oxford History of Western Art''], Oxford University Press (2000), p. 359, {{ISBN|0-19-860012-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the printer Auguste Delâtre, and [[Maxime Lalanne]], an etcher who wrote a popular textbook of etching in 1866, established the broad contours of the movement. Cadart founded the ''Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; des Aquafortistes'' in 1862, reviving the awareness of the beautiful, original etching in the minds of the collecting public.&lt;ref name="Oxford 359" /&gt; [[Charles Méryon]] was an early inspiration, and close collaborator with Delâtre, laying out the various possible techniques of modern etching and producing works that would be ranked with Rembrandt and [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;van Breda, Jacobus. "Charles Meryon: Paper and Ink," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 3 No. 3 (September-October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Treatise on Etching'' by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880. It played a significant role in the Etching Revival in America. However, before the translation of Lalanne's book, [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton]] had become an enthusiastic promoter of etching in Britain. His ''Etching and Etchers'' (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled ''[[The Portfolio]]'', that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.[[File:Zaandam2.jpg|thumb|''Zaandam by [[James MacNeill Whistler]], c.1889]]

For Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was [[Francis Seymour Haden]], the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one the highpoints of etching history. Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.

It was Whistler who convinced the artist [[Alphonse Legros]], one of the members of the French Revival, to come to England as a teacher. This linking of the art of the two countries, though short-lived, did much to validate etching as an art form. Very soon, French etching would show the same modernist signs that French art showed generally, while English and American etching remained true to the kind of technical proficiency and subject matter artists revered in Rembrandt. One distinct aspect of the revival, in contrast with the Old Master period, was an interest in giving unique qualities to each impression of a print.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury, Sara. "Giving a Good Impression: B.J.O. Nordfeldt's Inscribed Etchings," &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 7 No. 2 (July-August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fall in popularity==
Etching as a collected and therefore as a practised art appears to have died with the [[Great Depression]]. Without a large group of collectors many artists returned to their canvases. Etchings fell hugely in value until the 1980s when a new market (albeit a small one) began to develop for what is now seen as a small but important tributary of the stream of 19th- and 20th-century art.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15456">{{short description|Hypothetical mechanism to activate and deactivate  phenotypic effect of accumulated genetic variation}}
{{evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary capacitance''' is the storage and release of variation, just as electric capacitors store and release charge. Living systems are [[mutational robustness|robust]] to mutations. This means that living systems accumulate [[genetic variation]] without the variation having a [[phenotype|phenotypic]] effect. But when the system is disturbed (perhaps by stress), robustness breaks down, and the variation has phenotypic effects and is subject to the full force of [[natural selection]]. An evolutionary capacitor is a molecular switch mechanism that can "toggle" genetic variation between hidden and revealed states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masel |first=J |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Q&amp;A: Evolutionary capacitance |journal=BMC Biology |date=Sep 30, 2013|volume=11|pages=103 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-103 |pmid=24228631 |pmc=3849687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If some subset of newly revealed variation is adaptive, it becomes fixed by [[genetic assimilation]]. After that, the rest of variation, most of which is presumably deleterious, can be switched off, leaving the population with a newly evolved advantageous trait, but no long-term handicap. For evolutionary capacitance to increase [[evolvability]] in this way, the switching rate should not be faster than the timescale of genetic assimilation.&lt;ref name="Kim 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim Y|title=Rate of adaptive peak shifts with partial genetic robustness |journal=Evolution |volume=61 |issue=8 |pages=1847–1856 |year=2007 |pmid=17683428 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00166.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This mechanism would allow for rapid [[adaptation]] to new environmental conditions. Switching rates may be a function of stress, making genetic variation more likely to affect the phenotype at times when it is most likely to be useful for adaptation. In addition, strongly deleterious variation may be purged while in a partially cryptic state, so cryptic variation that remains is more likely to be adaptive than random mutations are.&lt;ref name="Masel 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Masel| first=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel | title=Cryptic Genetic Variation Is Enriched for Potential Adaptations| journal=Genetics| volume=172| issue=3| pages=1985–1991| date=March 2006| url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?&amp;artid=1456269| doi=10.1534/genetics.105.051649 | accessdate =| pmid=16387877| pmc=1456269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitance can help cross "valleys" in the [[fitness landscape]], where a combination of two mutations would be beneficial, even though each is deleterious on its own.&lt;ref name="Kim 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masel 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trotter|first1=Meredith V.|last2=Weissman|first2=Daniel B.|last3=Peterson|first3=Grant I.|last4=Peck|first4=Kayla M.|last5=Masel |first5=Joanna |authorlink=Joanna Masel |title=Cryptic genetic variation can make "irreducible complexity" a common mode of adaptation in sexual populations|journal=Evolution|date=December 2014|volume=68 |issue=12|pages=3357–3367|doi=10.1111/evo.12517|pmid=25178652|pmc=4258170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is currently no [[scientific consensus|consensus]] about the extent to which capacitance might contribute to evolution in natural populations. The possibility of evolutionary capacitance is considered to be part of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Pigliucci 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |title=Do We Need an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis? |journal=Evolution |volume=61|issue=12 |pages=2743–2749 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00246.x |pmid=17924956 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Switches that turn robustness to phenotypic rather than genetic variation on and off do not fit the capacitance analogy, as their presence does not cause variation to accumulate over time. They have instead been called phenotypic stabilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.07.005 |author1=Masel J |author1link=Joanna Masel |author2=Siegal ML |title=Robustness: mechanisms and consequences |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=395–403 |year=2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/trends/genetics/abstract/S0168-9525(09)00146-2 |pmid=19717203 |pmc=2770586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enzyme promiscuity==
{{main|enzyme promiscuity}}
In addition to their native reaction, many [[enzymes]] perform side reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=MF|author2=Hollfelder, F|title=Efficient, crosswise catalytic promiscuity among enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer.|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date=Jan 2013|volume=1834|issue=1|pages=417–24|pmid=22885024|doi=10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.07.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, binding proteins may spend some proportion of their time bound to off-target proteins. These reactions or interactions may be of no consequence to current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] but under altered conditions, may provide the starting point for adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Brien|first=PJ|author2=Herschlag, D|title=Catalytic promiscuity and the evolution of new enzymatic activities.|journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology|date=Apr 1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=R91–R105|pmid=10099128|doi=10.1016/s1074-5521(99)80033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, several mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene [[B-lactamase]] introduce [[cefotaxime]] resistance but do not affect [[ampicillin]] resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumura|first=I|author2=Ellington, AD|title=In vitro evolution of beta-glucuronidase into a beta-galactosidase proceeds through non-specific intermediates.|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=Jan 12, 2001|volume=305|issue=2|pages=331–9|pmid=11124909|doi=10.1006/jmbi.2000.4259}}&lt;/ref&gt; In populations exposed only to ampicillin, such mutations may be present in a minority of members since there is not fitness cost (i.e. are within the [[neutral network (evolution)|neutral network]]). This represents cryptic genetic variation since if the population is newly exposed to cefotaxime, the minority members will exhibit some resistance.

==Chaperones==
[[Chaperone (protein)|Chaperones]] assist in [[protein folding]]. The need to fold proteins correctly is a big restriction on the [[Molecular evolution|evolution of protein sequences]]. It has been proposed that the presence of chaperones may, by providing additional robustness to errors in folding, allow the exploration of a larger set of genotypes. When chaperones are overworked at times of environmental stress, this may "switch on" previously cryptic genetic variation.&lt;ref name="Rutherford 98"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/24550 |vauthors=Rutherford SL, Lindquist S |title=Hsp90 as a capacitor for morphological evolution |journal=Nature |volume=396 |issue=6709 |pages=336–342 |year=1998 |pmid=9845070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hsp90===
The hypothesis that chaperones can act as evolutionary capacitors is closely associated with the heat shock protein [[Hsp90]]. When Hsp90 is downregulated in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a broad range of different phenotypes are seen, where the identity of the phenotype depends on the genetic background.&lt;ref name="Rutherford 98" /&gt; This was thought to prove that the new phenotypes depended on pre-existing cryptic genetic variation that had merely been revealed. More recent evidence suggests that these data might be explained by new mutations caused by the reactivation of formally dormant [[Transposon|transposable elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Specchia V |author2=Piacentini L |author3=Tritto P |author4=Fanti L |author5=D’Alessandro R |author6=Palumbo G |author7=Pimpinelli S |author8=Bozzetti MP | title=Hsp90 prevents phenotypic variation by suppressing the mutagenic activity of transposons |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=1 |pages=662–665  |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/nature08739 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7281/full/nature08739.html |pmid=20062045}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding regarding transposable elements may be dependent on the strong nature of the Hsp90 knockdown used in that experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vamsi K Gangaraju |author2=Hang Yin |author3=Molly M Weiner |author4=Jianquan Wang |author5=Xiao A Huang |author6=[[Haifan Lin]] | title=Drosophila Piwi functions in Hsp90-mediated suppression of phenotypic variation |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=43 |pages=153–158  |year=2011 |doi=10.1038/ng.743 |url= http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v43/n2/abs/ng.743.html |issue=2 |pmid= 21186352 |pmc=3443399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GroEL===

The overproduction of [[GroEL]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' increases [[mutational robustness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mario A. Fares |author2=Mario X.

==Yeast prion [PSI+]==

[[Sup35p]] is a [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] protein involved in recognising [[stop codon]]s and causing [[Translation (genetics)|translation]] to stop correctly at the ends of proteins. Sup35p comes in a normal form ([psi-]) and a [[Fungal prions|prion]] form ([PSI+]). When [PSI+] is present, this depletes the amount of normal Sup35p available. As a result, the rate of errors in which translation continues beyond a stop codon increases from about 0.3% to about 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/yea.320070211 |vauthors=Firoozan M, Grant CM, Duarte JA, Tuite MF |title=Quantitation of readthrough of termination codons in yeast using a novel gene fusion assay |journal=Yeast |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–183 |year=1991 |pmid=1905859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can lead to different growth rates, and sometimes different [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]], in matched [PSI+] and [psi-] strains in a variety of stressful environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/35035005 |vauthors=True HL, Lindquist SL |title=A yeast prion provides a mechanism for genetic variation and phenotypic diversity |journal=Nature| volume=407 |issue=6803 |pages=477–483 |year=2000 |pmid=11028992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the [PSI+] strain grows faster, sometimes [psi-]: this depends on the genetic background of the strain, suggesting that [PSI+] taps into pre-existing cryptic genetic variation. Mathematical models suggest that [PSI+] may have evolved, as an evolutionary capacitor, to promote [[evolvability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masel J, Bergman A |title=The evolution of the evolvability properties of the yeast prion [PSI+] |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=1498–1512 |year=2003 |pmid=12940355 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.110213 |vauthors=Lancaster AK, Bardill JP, True HL, Masel J |title=The Spontaneous Appearance Rate of the Yeast Prion PSI+ and Its Implications for the Evolution of the Evolvability Properties of the PSI+ System |journal=Genetics|volume=184 |issue=2 |pages=393–400 |year=2010 |pmid=19917766 |pmc=2828720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[PSI+] appears more frequently in response to environmental stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tyedmers J, Madariaga ML, Lindquist S |title=Prion Switching in Response to Environmental Stress |journal=PLoS Biology|volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e294 |year=2008 |pmid=19067491 |pmc=2586387 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060294 |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yeast, more stop codon disappearances are [[Reading frame|in-frame]], mimicking the effects of [PSI+], than would be expected from mutation bias or than are observed in other taxa that do not form the [PSI+] prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msl172 |vauthors=Giacomelli M, Hancock AS, Masel J |title=The conversion of 3′ UTRs into coding regions |journal=Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution |volume=24 |pages=457–464 |year=2007 |pmid=17099057 |issue=2 |pmc=1808353}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations are compatible with [PSI+] acting as an evolutionary capacitor in the wild.

==Gene knockouts==

Evolutionary capacitance may also be a general feature of complex gene networks, and can be seen in simulations of gene knockouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bergman A, Siegal ML |title=Evolutionary capacitance as a general feature of complex gene networks |journal=Nature |volume=424 |issue=6948 |pages=549–552 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12891357 |doi=10.1038/nature01765}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screen of all gene knockouts in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] found that many act as phenotypic stabilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levy SF, Siegal ML |title=Network hubs buffer environmental variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=e264 |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060264 |pmid=18986213 |pmc=2577700 |editor1-last=Levchenko |editor1-first=Andre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knocking out a regulatory protein such as a chromatin regulator may lead to more effective capacitance than knocking out a metabolic enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Itay Tirosh |author2=Sharon Reikhav |author3=Nadejda Sigal |author4=Yael Assia |author5=Naama Barkai |title=Chromatin regulators as capacitors of interspecies variations in gene expression |journal=Molecular Systems Biology| volume=6 |year=2010 |doi=10.1038/msb.2010.84 |issue=435 |pages=435 |pmid=21119629 |pmc=3010112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facultative sex==

[[Recessive]] mutations can be thought of as cryptic when they are present overwhelmingly in [[zygosity|heterozygotes]] rather than homozygotes. [[Origin and function of meiosis#Function of Meiosis|Facultative sex]] that takes the form of [[Self-fertilization#Autogamy|selfing]] can act as an evolutionary capacitor in a primarily [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] population by creating homozygotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masel J, Lyttle DN |title=The consequences of rare sexual reproduction by means of selfing in an otherwise clonally reproducing species |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |year=2011 | doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2011.08.004 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580911000736 |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=317–322 |pmid=21888925 |pmc=3218209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facultative sex that takes the form of [[Reproduction#Allogamy|outcrossing]] can act as an evolutionary capacitor by breaking up allele combinations with phenotypic effects that normally cancel out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynch M, Gabriel W |title=Phenotypic evolution and parthenogenesis |journal=American Naturalist| volume=122 |year=1983 |issue=6 |pages=745–764 |jstor=2460915 |doi=10.1086/284169|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bvb:19-epub-5009-1 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fisheries Research and Development Corporation''' (FRDC) is a statutory authority that manages research and development investment by the [[Australian Government]] and the Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Investing for tomorrow's fish: the FRDC's research, development and extension plan 2010–2015 | year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9808007-1-5 | publisher=FRDC |url = http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/RDE_plan_2010-2015_final.pdf |location=Canberra |p=i }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

The FRDC is one of fifteen Australian rural research and development corporations managing investment by the [[Australian Government]] and primary industries that during the past 25 years has been crucial to the doubling of the productivity of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rural R&amp;D corporations |url=http://www.ruralrdc.com.au/Page/Home.aspx |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception in 1992, the Corporation's major focus was on research concerning the management of commercial wild-catch fisheries and, to a lesser extent, aquaculture. Since then, the scope has widened greatly to encompass economic, environmental and social aspects of the entire fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors – that is, the recreational and indigenous customary sectors in addition to the commercial wild-catch and aquaculture sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=4}} The Corporation’s strategic investments in research, development and extension activities benefit all its stakeholders (listed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Fisheries Research and Development Corporation annual report 2012–2013 | date=2013| url = http://frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Annual_Report/FRDC_Annual_Report_2013.pdf | publisher=FRDC |location=Canberra |p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FRDC is unique among the corporations in balancing its investment between natural resource management and industry productivity and development. Therefore, a significant proportion of funding is directed at research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=17}}

In fulfilling its role of planning, investing in and managing fisheries research, development and extension (RD&amp;E) activities in Australia, the FRDC provides leadership and coordination of the monitoring, evaluating and reporting on RD&amp;E activities and facilitates the dissemination, extension and commercialisation of research results to end-users. The FRDC achieves this through coordinating investment by government and industry, and involving stakeholders to set and address RD&amp;E priorities. The FRDC also monitors and evaluates the adoption of RD&amp;E outputs to inform future decisions.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=ix}}

== Governance ==

Formed as a statutory corporation on 2 July 1991 under the provisions of the ''Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989'' (the PIERD Act), the FRDC is responsible to the [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)]].

A Chairman and a board of directors govern the FRDC; the Executive Director leads the corporation’s business activities on a day-to-day basis. The board oversees corporate governance, sets strategic direction and monitors the ongoing performance of the Corporation and the Executive Director. The board and the Executive Director are responsible for managing and evaluating the Corporation and its investments, and for reporting to government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors. During 2012-13 the focus for the FRDC Board was on:
* implementing the National Framework for Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension
* developing strategic investment options to ensure delivery of outcomes against the FRDC RD&amp;E Plan
* responding to findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the rural research and development corporations and the Rural Research and Development Council’s National Strategic Investment Plan
* developing a plan to improve the perception of the fishing and aquaculture through making research results more publicly available and addressing factually incorrect media (and similar) reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= FRDC annual operational plan 2012–13 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/AOP-2012-13.pdf |location=Canberra |p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRDC supports a network of Research Advisory Committees (RACs) located in each state and the Northern Territory. The RACs have an extremely important role in maximising the efficiency of the FRDC's planning and funding process.
== Investment ==

=== Revenue sources ===

[[File:Entrance to Fisheries Research House, Canberra, Australia.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Canberra, Australia]]
The primary revenue for the FRDC comes from the Australian Government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, based on:

* the Australian Government providing unmatched funds equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of Australian fisheries production (AGVP);
* fishers and [[aquaculturist]]s providing contributions of at least 0.25 per cent of AGVP; and
* the Australian Government matching contributions by fishers and aquaculturists up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of AGVP.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

The Corporation also manages significant contributions by stakeholders in FRDC-funded projects. 
The FRDC’s strategic investments in RD&amp;E activities benefit the three sectors of fishing: commercial (wild catch and aquaculture), recreational and indigenous customary.
The FRDC has a significant responsibility in ensuring, on behalf of the Australian Government, that research is undertaken to assist in the management of the fisheries and aquaculture resource for ongoing sustainability. A significant proportion of funding is therefore directed to research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

===Investment strategy===
The FRDC invests in RD&amp;E across the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, and for the benefit of both recreational and indigenous customary fishers. The FRDC seeks to achieve maximum leverage from its investment by providing research administration and services using a value-adding model in which research projects are tailored to deliver a specific outcome and are actively managed and monitored. 
The FRDC commissions RD&amp;E through a variety of flexible investment approaches, including an open call for project applications; formal partnership agreements with industry sectors; subprograms and coordination programs that are tailored to a specific industry sector or activity; short-term tactical research investment; and specifically targeted commissioned RD&amp;E, especially where there is market failure by private investment.
The focus for FRDC investment aligns with the following 14 themes, as outlined in the Corporation’s 2010-2015 Strategic RD&amp;E Plan.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=8}} The investment balance between themes, which may vary depending on strategic needs, is reported in each annual report.{{sfn| FRDC annual report 2012–2013 | p=9}}

== Relationships with stakeholders ==
In developing projects addressing the Corporation’s five programs, strategic directions are established in association with the FRDC’s stakeholders, which are:
* the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors
* the federal, state and territory governments (including their fisheries managers and other natural resource managers)
* research partners (including universities, fisheries research organisations, industry and private sector research providers, and investors)
* the people of Australia (on whose behalf aquatic natural resources are managed, and as consumers).{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=5}}

The FRDC works with its partners to undertake program management effectively, to disseminate the results, and to assist with their adoption and, when appropriate, commercialisation.

=== Stakeholder research priorities ===

One of the primary challenges for the FRDC is to gain a solid understanding of the needs and priorities of its stakeholders, many of whom come from a diverse range of sectors and operations. There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&amp;E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&amp;E Strategy and the Corporation’s RD&amp;E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs. Where possible, industry and fisheries management are directly engaged and integrated into the delivery of each project.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Australian Government priorities===
The federal [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]], the [[Abbott Ministry|Parliamentary Secretary]] and the [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]] set priorities that the Corporation is required to address. In 2009 the Australian Primary Industries Ministerial Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mincos.gov.au/pages/background.aspx Primary Industries Ministerial Council]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a “statement of intent” to implement a ''National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework''  through 14 primary industry sectors and 7 cross-industry sectors. Within the framework, each industry sector and cross-sectoral issue was to be assessed for its RD&amp;E capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework|url=http://www.npirdef.org/strategies|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As its contribution to the framework, the FRDC and its stakeholders developed a landmark document setting out future directions for fishing and aquaculture RD&amp;E: the ''National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010 |url=http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/National_RDandE_Strategy_for_Fishing_and_Aquaculture.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultation and collaboration==

===Australian Fisheries Management Forum===
The Australian Fisheries Management Forum comprises the heads of the federal, state and territory government agencies responsible for management of fisheries, who discuss strategic issues relating to fisheries and aquaculture management. The FRDC works with the forum, sitting as an invited representative to meetings, providing advice and ensuring forum priorities are incorporated into the Corporation’s RD&amp;E planning processes.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Representative organisations===

Four representative organisations have been appointed under the PIERD Act, with which the FRDC consults and reports formally at their annual general meetings:
* Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Industry Confederation Inc. (trading as Recfish Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[http://recfishaustralia.org.au Recfish Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Aquaculture Council Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.org.au National Aquaculture Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonwealth Fisheries Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comfish.com.au Commonwealth Fisheries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Levy organisation: Australian Prawn Farmers Association===

The FRDC administers a research and development levy on behalf of the Australian Prawn Farmers Association (APFA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; a levy organisation, which has a leading role with FRDC in ensuring its priorities are met. FRDC investments in prawn farming research and development is driven by the APFA’s RD&amp;E Plan. The two entities enjoy a very close working relationship. The APFA has nominated that the majority of its investment is to be through co-investment with the Australian Seafood CRC.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=15}}

===Industry sector bodies===
The FRDC also has a close relationship with the National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance represents the commercial fishing, pearling and aquaculture industries through state industry councils and peak sector associations to build on the partnerships established with individual industry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

The FRDC also invests in, and partners, entities such as Southern Rocklobster Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernrocklobster.com Southern Rocklobster Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbtia.com.au Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsga.com.au Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Pearl Producers Association, Australian Prawn Farmers’ Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abfa.org.au/index.html Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Other rural research and development corporations===
The FRDC joins with other rural research and development corporations – at the project level and more broadly in functional areas – on a range of activities to enhance joint strategic outcomes. Most significant are climate change projects, evaluation of RD&amp;E, and the “Appetite for Excellence” primary producers tour – a competition for chefs, waiters and restaurateurs. The FRDC is a member of the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations, participating in meetings of R&amp;D corporations' executive directors, business managers and communications managers. The FRDC also provides advice and services in project management and the FRDC-developed project management software, OmniFish.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Industry development===
The FRDC works with various entities to develop the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors in such matters as market development; strengthening trade and market access; developing standards, e.g. for responsible fishing; standardising names for Australian fish; developing quality management systems; and reaching agreement on sustainability. To that end, in 2001 the Corporation and a now defunct peak body of the commercial sector incorporated a not-for-profit company, Seafood Services Australia Ltd, with the mission “to enhance the profitability, international competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of the Australian seafood industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Evolution of the FRDC to 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/Evolution_of_the_FRDC_Sep_2012.pdf |location=Canberra |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry development activities suffered a setback in 2013, when the company ceased trading after "a significant reduction in the availability of funding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seafood Services Australia closes its doors|url=https://seafood.net.au|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre===
The FRDC initiated, and is a core participant in, the Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodcrc.com Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's research program aims to increase the profitability and value of the Australian seafood industry, increase access to premium markets and increase demand for Australian seafood – priorities aligned with the FRDC’s RD&amp;E programs, in particular Program 2: Industry.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

==Research partners==
In any given year, the Corporation has under management about 300 active projects. Investment in research is the FRDC’s core business. As a result, it is vital to the FRDC’s success that it has excellent relationships with its research partners. The key research partners are:
* [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]]
* [[Australian Fisheries Management Authority]]
* state fisheries research centres
* [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]]
* universities
* [[Cooperative Research Centre]]s
* other rural research and development corporations and companies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruralrdc.com.au Rural research and development corporations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* industry groups
* co-investors from the private sector.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

== The Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors ==

The fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors is one of the most complex of Australia’s primary industries in terms of both its structure and the natural resources on which it depends. Most of the industry’s business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:
* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers
* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors
* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&amp;E plan, 2010|p=13}}
Legislatively, the "fishing industry" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as "any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products".

The commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008–09. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.
In 2009–10, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008–09, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009–10.
Demand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood’s prominent role in a healthy diet. In Asian markets consumption is also increasing with the growth of the middle class, especially in China and India. This will place demands on the supply of the limited resource, leading to increases in price.
Currently Australia’s commercial seafood production only provides about 28 per cent of domestic demand. In part because of the rising value of the Australian dollar, the commercial sector is now re-orienting towards better serving the Australian market.

'''Flue-gas desulfurization''' ('''FGD''') is a set of technologies used to remove [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) from [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plant]]s, and from the emissions of other sulfur oxide emitting processes (e.g [[trash incineration]])

==Methods==
As stringent environmental regulations regarding SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have been enacted in many countries, {{chem|SO|2}} is now being removed from flue gases by a variety of methods. Below are common methods used:

*[[Wet scrubber|Wet scrubbing]] using a slurry of alkaline [[sorbent]], usually [[limestone]] or [[lime (mineral)|lime]], or seawater to scrub gases;
*[[Spray drying|Spray-dry]] scrubbing using similar sorbent slurries;
*[[Wet sulfuric acid process]] recovering [[sulfur]] in the form of commercial quality [[sulfuric acid]];
*[[SNOX process|SNOX Flue gas desulfurization]] removes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates from flue gases;
*Dry sorbent injection systems that introduce powdered hydrated lime (or other sorbent material) into exhaust ducts to eliminate SO2 and SO3 from process emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nol-tec.com/documents/pdfs/NTS_FGD_02_09_B.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

For a typical coal-fired power station, flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) may remove 90 percent or more of the {{chem|SO|2}} in the flue gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compositech-filters.com/power-exhaust-filters|title=Flue Gas Desulfurization - FGD Wastewater Treatment {{!}} Compositech Filters Manufacturer|last=Inc.|first=Compositech Products Manufacturing,|website=www.compositech-filters.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Methods of removing [[sulfur dioxide]] from boiler and furnace exhaust gases have been studied for over 150 years.  Early ideas for flue gas desulfurization were established in [[England]] around 1850.

With the construction of large-scale power plants in England in the 1920s, the problems associated with large volumes of {{chem|SO|2}} from a single site began to concern the public.  The {{chem|SO|2}} emissions problem did not receive much attention until 1929, when the [[House of Lords]] upheld the claim of a landowner against the Barton Electricity Works of the [[Manchester Corporation]] for damages to his land resulting from {{chem|SO|2}} emissions.  Shortly thereafter, a press campaign was launched against the erection of power plants within the confines of London.  This outcry led to the imposition of {{chem|SO|2}} controls on all such power plants.&lt;ref name=Biondo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Biondo |first1=S.J. |last2=Marten |first2=J.C. |title=A History of Flue Gas Desulphurization Systems Since 1850 |journal=Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=948–61 |date=October 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major FGD unit at a utility was installed in 1931 at [[Battersea Power Station]], owned by [[London Power Company]].  In 1935, an FGD system similar to that installed at Battersea went into service at Swansea Power Station.  The third major FGD system was installed in 1938 at [[Fulham Power Station]]. These three early large-scale FGD installations were abandoned during [[World War II]].  Large-scale FGD units did not reappear at utilities until the 1970s, where most of the installations occurred in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=Biondo/&gt;

As of June 1973, there were 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in capacity from 5 [[Megawatt|MW]] to 250 MW.&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;Beychok, Milton R., ''Coping With SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', Chemical Engineering/Deskbook Issue, 21 October 1974&lt;/ref&gt; As of around 1999 and 2000, FGD units were being used in 27 countries, and there were 678 FGD units operating at a total power plant capacity of about 229 [[gigawatts]]. About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in [[Germany]], 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries. Approximately 79% of the units, representing about 199 gigawatts of capacity, were using lime or limestone wet scrubbing. About 18% (or 25 gigawatts) utilized spray-dry scrubbers or sorbent injection systems.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;Nolan, Paul S., ''Flue Gas Desulfurization Technologies for Coal-Fired Power Plants'', The Babcock &amp; Wilcox Company, U.S., presented by Michael X. Jiang at the Coal-Tech 2000 International Conference, November 2000, Jakarta, Indonesia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CMU&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edward S. |last1=Rubin |first2=Sonia |last2=Yeh |first3=David A. |last3=Hounshell |first4=Margaret R. |last4=Taylor |year=2004 |title=Experience curves for power plant emission control technologies |journal=International Journal of Energy Technology and Policy |volume=2 |issue=1–2 |pages=52–69 |url=http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/xrmv74watby1y7e2/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141009182230/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/xrmv74watby1y7e2/ |archivedate=9 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, Milton R., ''Comparative economics of advanced regenerable flue gas desulfurization processes'', EPRI CS-1381, Electric Power Research Institute, March 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sulfuric acid mist formation==
[[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and oil can contain a significant amount of sulfur. When fossil fuels are burned, about 95 percent or more of the sulfur is generally converted to [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}). Such conversion happens under normal conditions of temperature and of oxygen present in the [[flue gas]]. However, there are circumstances under which such reaction may not occur.

When flue gas has too much oxygen, the {{chem|SO|2}} further oxidizes into [[sulfur trioxide]] ({{chem|SO|3}}). Too much oxygen is only one of the ways that {{chem|SO|3}} is formed. Gas temperature is also an important factor. At about 800&amp;nbsp;°C, formation of {{chem|SO|3}} is favored. Another way that {{chem|SO|3}} can be formed is through catalysis by metals in the fuel. Such reaction is particularly true for heavy fuel oil, where a significant amount of [[vanadium]] is present. In whatever way {{chem|SO|3}} is formed, it does not behave like {{chem|SO|2}} in that it forms a liquid [[aerosol]] known as [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}) mist that is very difficult to remove. Generally, about 1% of the sulfur dioxide will be converted to {{chem|SO|3}}. Sulfuric acid mist is often the cause of the blue haze that often appears as the flue gas plume dissipates. Increasingly, this problem is being addressed by the use of wet [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.

== FGD chemistry ==

=== Basic principles ===
Most FGD systems employ two stages: one for [[fly ash]] removal and the other for {{chem|SO|2}} removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and {{chem|SO|2}} in one scrubbing vessel. However, these systems experienced severe maintenance problems and low removal efficiency. In wet scrubbing systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the {{chem|SO|2}}-absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the {{chem|SO|2}} is first reacted with the lime, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device.

Another important design consideration associated with wet FGD systems is that the flue gas exiting the absorber is saturated with water and still contains some {{chem|SO|2}}. These gases are highly corrosive to any downstream equipment such as fans, ducts, and stacks. Two methods that may minimize corrosion are: (1) reheating the gases to above their [[dew point]], or (2) using materials of construction and designs that allow equipment to withstand the corrosive conditions. Both alternatives are expensive. Engineers determine which method to use on a site-by-site basis.

=== Scrubbing with an alkali solid or solution ===
[[File:Flue gas desulfurization unit EN.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Schematic design of the absorber of an FGD]]
{{chem|SO|2}} is an [[acid gas]], and, therefore, the typical sorbent slurries or other materials used to remove the {{chem|SO|2}} from the flue gases are alkaline. The reaction taking place in wet scrubbing using a {{chem|CaCO|3}} ([[limestone]]) slurry produces [[calcium sulfite]] ({{chem|CaSO|3}}) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:{{chem|CaCO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{chem|SO|2}}{{sub|(g)}} → {{chem|CaSO|3}}{{sub|(s)}} + {{CO2}}{{sub|(g)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrated lime]]) slurry, the reaction also produces CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[calcium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

When wet scrubbing with a Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium hydroxide]]) slurry, the reaction produces MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[magnesium sulfite]]) and may be expressed in the simplified dry form as:

:Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → MgSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(s)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}

To partially offset the cost of the FGD installation, some designs, particularly dry sorbent injection systems, further oxidize the CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcium sulfite) to produce marketable CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[gypsum]]) that can be of high enough quality to use in [[wallboard]] and other products. The process by which this synthetic gypsum is created is also known as forced oxidation:

:CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(s)}}

A natural alkaline usable to absorb SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is seawater. The {{chem|SO|2}} is absorbed in the water, and when oxygen is added reacts to form sulfate ions SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- and free H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The surplus of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is offset by the carbonates in seawater pushing the carbonate equilibrium to release {{CO2}} gas:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + ½O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

:HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}} + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}}

In industry [[Caustic soda|caustic]] (NaOH) is often used to scrub {{chem|SO|2}}, producing [[sodium sulfite]]:

:2NaOH{{sub|(aq)}} + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(g)}} → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{sub|(aq)}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O{{sub|(l)}}&lt;ref name="RJC"&gt;[http://rasayanjournal.co.in/vol-3/issue-2/23.pdf] REMOVAL OF SULPHUR DIOXIDE FROM FLUE GASES IN 
THERMAL PLANTS&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Types of wet scrubbers used in FGD ====
To promote maximum [[Liquid-to-gas ratio|gas–liquid surface area]] and residence time, a number of wet scrubber designs have been used, including spray towers, venturis, plate towers, and mobile [[packed bed]]s. Because of scale buildup, plugging, or erosion, which affect FGD dependability and absorber efficiency, the trend is to use simple scrubbers such as spray towers instead of more complicated ones. The configuration of the tower may be vertical or horizontal, and flue gas can flow cocurrently, countercurrently, or crosscurrently with respect to the liquid. The chief drawback of spray towers is that they require a higher liquid-to-gas ratio requirement for equivalent {{chem|SO|2}} removal than other absorber designs.

FGD scrubbers produce a scaling wastewater that requires treatment to meet discharge regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA reg"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, D.C. [http://www2.epa.gov/eg/steam-electric-power-generating-effluent-guidelines-2015-final-rule "Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category."] Final Rule. 2015-09-30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, technological advancements in [[ion exchange membranes]] and [[electrodialysis]] systems has enabled high-efficiency treatment of FGD wastewater to meet recent EPA discharge limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowering Cost and Waste in Flue Gas Desulfurization Wastewater Treatment|url=http://www.powermag.com/lowering-cost-waste-flue-gas-desulfurization-wastewater-treatment/|website=Power Mag|publisher=Electric Power|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment approach is similar for other highly scaling industrial wastewaters.

=====Venturi-rod scrubbers=====
{{main|venturi scrubber}}
A [[venturi scrubber]] is a converging/diverging section of duct. The converging section accelerates the gas stream to high velocity. When the liquid stream is injected at the throat, which is the point of maximum velocity, the turbulence caused by the high gas velocity atomizes the liquid into small droplets, which creates the surface area necessary for mass transfer to take place. The higher the pressure drop in the venturi, the smaller the droplets and the higher the surface area. The penalty is in power consumption.

For simultaneous removal of {{chem|SO|2}} and fly ash, venturi scrubbers can be used. In fact, many of the industrial sodium-based throwaway systems are venturi scrubbers originally designed to remove particulate matter. These units were slightly modified to inject a sodium-based scrubbing liquor. Although removal of both particles and {{chem|SO|2}} in one vessel can be economic, the problems of high pressure drops and finding a scrubbing medium to remove heavy loadings of fly ash must be considered. However, in cases where the particle concentration is low, such as from oil-fired units, it can be more effective to remove particulate and {{chem|SO|2}} simultaneously.

=====Packed bed scrubbers=====
A packed scrubber consists of a tower with packing material inside. This packing material can be in the shape of saddles, rings, or some highly specialized shapes designed to maximize the contact area between the dirty gas and liquid. Packed towers typically operate at much lower pressure drops than venturi scrubbers and are therefore cheaper to operate. They also typically offer higher {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiency. The drawback is that they have a greater tendency to plug up if particles are present in excess in the exhaust air stream.

=====Spray towers=====
{{main|spray tower}}
A [[spray tower]] is the simplest type of scrubber. It consists of a tower with spray nozzles, which generate the droplets for surface contact. [[Spray tower]]s are typically used when circulating a slurry (see below). The high speed of a venturi would cause erosion problems, while a packed tower would plug up if it tried to circulate a slurry.

Counter-current packed towers are infrequently used because they have a tendency to become plugged by collected particles or to scale when [[lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[limestone]] scrubbing slurries are used.

==== Scrubbing reagent ====

As explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Depending on the application, the two most important are [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] (also known as [[caustic soda]]). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda. The problem is that it results in a slurry being circulated through the scrubber instead of a solution. This makes it harder on the equipment. A spray tower is typically used for this application. The use of lime results in a slurry of calcium sulfite (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) that must be disposed of. Fortunately, calcium sulfite can be oxidized to produce by-product gypsum (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) which is marketable for use in the building products industry.

Caustic soda is limited to smaller combustion units because it is more expensive than lime, but it has the advantage that it forms a solution rather than a slurry. This makes it easier to operate. It produces a "[[spent caustic]]" solution of [[sodium sulfite]]/bisulfite (depending on the pH), or sodium sulfate that must be disposed of.  This is not a problem in a [[kraft pulp]] mill for example, where this can be a source of makeup chemicals to the recovery cycle.

=== Scrubbing with sodium sulfite solution ===

It is possible to scrub [[sulfur dioxide]] by using a cold solution of [[sodium sulfite]]; this forms a sodium hydrogen sulfite solution. By heating this solution it is possible to reverse the reaction to form sulfur dioxide and the sodium sulfite solution. Since the sodium sulfite solution is not consumed, it is called a regenerative treatment. The application of this reaction is also known as the [[Wellman–Lord process]].

In some ways this can be thought of as being similar to the reversible [[liquid–liquid extraction]] of an [[inert gas]] such as [[xenon]] or [[radon]] (or some other solute which does not undergo a chemical change during the extraction) from water to another phase. While a chemical change does occur during the extraction of the sulfur dioxide from the gas mixture, it is the case that the extraction equilibrium is shifted by changing the temperature rather than by the use of a chemical reagent.

=== Gas phase oxidation followed by reaction with ammonia ===

A new, emerging flue gas desulfurization technology has been described by the [[IAEA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-tc.iaea.org/tcweb/publications/factsheets/sheet16p.pdf IAEA Factsheet] about pilot plant in Poland.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[radiation]] technology where an intense beam of [[electrons]] is fired into the flue gas at the same time as [[ammonia]] is added to the gas. The Chendu power plant in China started up such a flue gas desulfurization unit on a 100 MW scale in 1998.  The Pomorzany power plant in Poland also started up a similar sized unit in 2003 and that plant removes both sulfur and nitrogen oxides. Both plants are reported to be operating successfully.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/36/116/36116306.pdf |chapter=Electron beam application in gas waste treatment in China |last1=Haifeng |first1=Wu |publisher=INET Tsinghua University |location=Beijing, China |title=Proceedings of the FNCA 2002 workshop on application of electron accelerator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAEA&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf Section of IAEA 2003 Annual Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221100739/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Reports/Anrep2003/physical.pdf |date=21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accelerator design principles and manufacturing quality need further improvement for continuous operation in industrial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichtj.waw.pl/ichtj/nukleon/back/full/vol50_2005/v50s3p17f.pdf ''Application of ionizing radiation to environmental protection''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[radioactivity]] is required or created in the process. The electron beam is generated by a device similar to the [[electron gun]] in a TV set. This device is called an accelerator. This is an example of a radiation chemistry process&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; where the physical effects of radiation are used to process a substance.

The action of the electron beam is to promote the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur(VI) compounds. The ammonia reacts with the sulfur compounds thus formed to produce [[ammonium sulfate]], which can be used as a nitrogenous [[fertilizer]]. In addition, it can be used to lower the nitrogen oxide content of the flue gas. This method has attained industrial plant scale.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/product.biblio.jsp?osti_id=20634234 ''Industrial Plant for Flue Gas Treatment with High Power Electron Accelerator''] by A.G. Chmielewski, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts and statistics==
:''The information in this section was obtained from a US EPA published fact sheet.''&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/catc/dir1/ffdg.pdf Air Pollution Control Fact Sheet] US EPA date coded 2003, accessed 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Flue gas desulfurization scrubbers have been applied to combustion units firing coal and oil that range in size from 5 MW to 1500 MW. [[Scottish Power]] are spending £400 million installing FGD at [[Longannet power station]], which has a capacity of over 2 GW. Dry scrubbers and spray scrubbers have generally been applied to units smaller than 300 MW.

FGD has been fitted by [[RWE npower]] at [[Aberthaw Power Station]] in south Wales using the seawater process and works successfully on the 1580MW plant.

Approximately 85% of the flue gas desulfurization units installed in the US are wet scrubbers, 12% are spray dry systems, and 3% are dry injection systems.

The highest {{chem|SO|2}} removal efficiencies (greater than 90%) are achieved by wet scrubbers and the lowest (less than 80%) by dry scrubbers. However, the newer designs for dry scrubbers are capable of achieving efficiencies in the order of 90%.

In spray drying and dry injection systems, the flue gas must first be cooled to about 10–20&amp;nbsp;°C above [[adiabatic]] [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]] to avoid wet solids deposition on downstream equipment and plugging of baghouses.

The capital, operating and maintenance costs per [[short ton]] of {{chem|SO|2}} removed (in 2001 US dollars) are:

*For wet scrubbers larger than 400 MW, the cost is $200 to $500 per ton
*For wet scrubbers smaller than 400 MW, the cost is $500 to $5,000 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers larger than 200 MW, the cost is $150 to $300 per ton
*For spray dry scrubbers smaller than 200 MW, the cost is $500 to $4,000 per ton

== Alternative methods of reducing sulfur dioxide emissions==

An alternative to removing [[sulfur]] from the flue gases after burning is to remove the sulfur from the fuel before or during combustion.  [[Hydrodesulfurization]] of fuel has been used for treating [[fuel oil]]s before use.  [[Fluidized bed combustion]] adds lime to the fuel during combustion. The lime reacts with the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[sulfate]]s which become part of the [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]].
This elemental sulfur is then separated and finally recovered at the end of the process for further usage in, for example, agricultural products. Safety is one of the greatest benefits of this method, as the whole process takes place at [[atmospheric pressure]] and ambient temperature. This method has been developed by Paqell, a joint venture between [[Shell Global Solutions]] and Paques.&lt;ref name=Paqell&gt;[http://paqell.com/thiopaq/process-description/ THIOPAQ Oil &amp; Gas process description and flow diagram] – official Paqell website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{RunicChars}}
The '''Golden Horns of Gallehus''' were two horns made of [[Sheet metal|sheet]] [[gold]],  discovered in Gallehus, north of [[Møgeltønder]] in [[Southern Jutland]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=drfactbox&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2007/12/20/114905.htm?rss=true Official Danish news (DR) page with fact box regarding the subject] {{da icon}}; The horns are also identified as ''Tunderense''  in older literature,   a learned Latin adjective formation of  ''Tundern'', the old name of Tønder.&lt;/ref&gt;
The horns dated to the early 5th century, i.e. the beginning of the [[Germanic Iron Age]].

The horns were found in 1639 and in 1734, respectively, at locations only some 15–20 metres apart.&lt;ref name=drfactbox/&gt; They were composed of segments of double sheet gold. The two horns were found incomplete; the longer one found in 1639 had seven segments with ornaments, to which six plain segments and a plain rim were added, possibly by the 17th-century restorer. The shorter horn found in 1734 had six segments, a narrow one bearing a [[Proto-Norse]] [[Elder Futhark]] inscription at the rim and five ornamented with images. It is uncertain whether the horns were intended as [[drinking horn]]s, or as [[blowing horn]]s, although drinking horns have more pronounced history as luxury items made from precious metal.

The original horns were stolen and melted down in 1802. Casts made of the horns in the late 18th century were also lost. Replicas of the horns must thus rely on 17th and 18th-century drawings exclusively and are accordingly fraught with uncertainty. Nevertheless,  replicas of the original horns were produced and are exhibited at the [[National Museum of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen]], and the [[Moesgaard Museum]], near [[Aarhus]], Denmark. These replicas also have a history of having been stolen and retrieved twice, in 1993 and in 2007.

The horns are the subject of one of the best-known poems in Danish literature, "The Golden Horns" (''Guldhornene''), by [[Adam Oehlenschläger]].

==Description==
Both horns consisted of two layers of gold sheet, the inner sheet of lesser quality, amalgamated with silver, the outer sheet of pure gold. The outer sheet was constructed from a number of rings, each covered with cast figures soldered onto the rings, with yet more figures chased into the rings between the larger figures. The second horn bore an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription in [[Proto-Norse]] which is of great value for [[Germanic linguistics]].

Both horns were once the same length,{{Dubious|date=May 2009}} but a segment of the narrow end of the second (shorter) horn, which was missing when it was found (1734), had already been plowed up and recovered prior to 1639. It also was subsequently melted down and lost.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
The longer horn in its restored state was 75.8&amp;nbsp;cm in length, as measured along the outer perimeter; the opening diameter was 10.4&amp;nbsp;cm., and the horn weighed 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg.

Because the casts made of the horns were lost, it is uncertain whether the horns were simply curved or whether they had a winding, helix-like curvature like a natural ox-horn.

[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the runic inscriptions found on one of the copies housed at the [[Moesgaard Museum]].]]

===Runic inscription===
The second horn bore the following [[Elder Futhark]] inscription ([[Rundata|DR 12 †U]]):
:[[File:Gallehus inscription.png|300px]] (1734 drawing after the original)
:{{Runic|ᛖᚲᚺᛚᛖᚹᚨᚷᚨᛊᛏᛁᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᛚᛏᛁᛃᚨᛉ᛬ᚺᛟᚱᚾᚨ᛬ᛏᚨᚹᛁᛞᛟ᛬}} (Runic [[Unicode]])
:'''ekhlewagastiz:holtijaz:horna:tawido:''' (transliteration)

This is read as a sentence in [[Proto-Norse]], ''{{lang|gem-Latn|ek Hlewagastiz Holtijaz horna tawidō}}'', translating to "I Hlewagastiz Holtijaz made the horn". This inscription is among the earliest inscriptions in the Elder Futhark that record a full sentence, and the earliest preserving a line of [[alliterative verse]].

The meaning of the [[Germanic name|given name]] ''Hlewagastiz'' is debated: it  may mean either "lee guest" or "fame guest". ''Holtijaz'' may either be a patronymic, "son (or descendant) of Holt", or express a characteristic such as "of the wood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runenprojekt.uni-kiel.de/abfragen/standard/deutung2.asp?findno=28&amp;ort=Gallehus&amp;objekt=Goldhorn Kiel University] has a compilation of literature. Interpretation as a patronymic is more common. The alternative interpretation   "of the sacred grove" is found in Klingenberg, Heinz ,''Runenschrift - Schriftdenken - Runeninschriften''. Heidelberg (1973) and in Grønvik, Ottar,  'Runeinnskriften på gullhornet fra Gallehus' in ''Maal og Minne'' (1999), 1-18. The translation "wood-dweller" is found in Karker, Allan, ''Dansk i tusind år: Et omrids af sprogets historie'', Copenhagen (1993). An interpretation of ''Holt'' as a toponym, translating "from Holt", is found in Gutenbrunner, Siegfried, ''Schleswig-Holsteins älteste Literatur. Von der Kimbernzeit bis zur Gudrundichtung'', Kiel (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible cipher runes===
[[File:Gallehus cipher Hartner.png|thumb|240px|reading of the supposed cipher in the top segment according to Hartner (1969).]]
The two rows of images in the top segment of the longer horn have been taken as a [[Cipher runes|cipher]] encoding a runic text of 22 letters, although there is no universally accepted decipherment.  Hartner (1969)  read  ''luba horns ens helpa hjoho'', an "[[apotropaic]] sentence" translated by Hartner as "may I, the potion of this horn, bring help to the clan".&lt;ref&gt;review of Hartner (1969) by A. T. Reiche in Isis, The History of Science Society (1973), p. 236; c.f. Beer (1970), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
{{further|Migration period art}}
{{double image|left|Large Gallehus horn images.png|190|Small Gallehus horn images.png|170|The image panels of the both horns projected onto a flat surface (etchings by J. R. Paulli, 1734)}}
The figures embossed on the horns combine depictions of numerous anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and [[mythological hybrid|hybrid]] motifs. In addition to the main figures which are soldered to the horn, protruding from the horn surface, there are a number of additional figures and ornaments realized by [[chasing]].

There are numerous attempts at their interpretation, all of them speculative. Interpretation is especially difficult since it has to rely on the imprecise drawings made before the loss of the original horns. Interpretations usually try to align the iconography with [[Germanic mythology]], although Mediterranean ([[Byzantine]]) elements are also cited.

Obvious parallels with Germanic [[Migration Period art]] are rather limited. There are large considerable number of serpents, some of them intertwining in the fashion of the wider [[animal style]] of Dark Age Europe. A figure holding a horn may be compared to the "valkyrie" shown on the [[Tjängvide image stone]]. Two masked figures armed with sword and shield on the smaller horn are reminiscent of other Germanic depictions of [[sword-dance]]s, e.g. on the [[Sutton Hoo helmet]]. Two other armed figures with large horns or antlers may be compared to [[horned helmet]] iconography, or to the "[[Cernunnos]]" figure on the [[Gundestrup cauldron]]. The peculiar image of a tricephalous figure has been taken as a pagan predecessor of depictions of a [[tricephalous Christ]] symbolizing the [[Trinity]] in Christian iconography but is difficult to place in a contemporary context. Olrik (1918) nevertheless recognized a number of [[Norse gods]] among the figures, including [[Tyr]], [[Odin]], [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Axel Olrik, ''Gudefremstillinger paa guldhornene og andre ældre mindesmærker'', Danske Studier (1918), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankfurt historian of science [[Willy Hartner]] in 1969 published an interpretation involving [[gematria]] and [[archaeoastronomy]], taking many of the figures as representing [[constellation]]s, claiming that the iconography refers to a lunar eclipse of 4 November 412 and a solar eclipse of 16 April 413.

The first horn (A) had figures arranged in seven segments, The second horn (B) had six segments including the narrow one containing the runic inscription around the rim.

==Discovery==

[[File:Paulli 1734 title page illustration.png|thumb|Title page illustration of the 1734 treatise on the second horn by Richard Joachim Paulli]]
[[File:Guldhorn paulli.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Depiction of the horn found AD 1734 on 21 April near the village of Gallehus, in Schackenborg county, not far from the town of Tønder as a peasant was digging, at nearly the same place as a similar one was found AD 1639. It is made from a double gold sheet, the outer one of very fine, the inner of inferior gold. It holds one Maß or ... and weighs 7 pounds 14 ounces]]

===First horn===
The longer horn was discovered on July 20, 1639 by a peasant girl named Kirsten Svendsdatter in the village of Gallehus, near [[Møgeltønder]], Denmark when she saw it protrude above the ground. She wrote a letter to King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] who retrieved it and in turn gave it to the Danish [[Christian V of Denmark|prince Christian]], who{{Dubious|date=May 2009}}&lt;!--Christian V was born only in 1646--&gt; refurbished it into a drinking-horn, adding a golden pommel to be screwed on at the narrow end to close it up.

The Danish antiquarian [[Olaus Wormius]] wrote a treatise named ''De aureo cornu'' on the first Golden Horn in 1641.
The first preserved sketch of the horn comes from this treatise. Wormius notes that he had not seen the horn in the state in which it was found, and it cannot now be determined whether the rim and the narrow segments devoid of ornamentation were modern additions like the pommel.

In 1678, the horn was described in the ''[[Journal des Savants]]''.

===Second horn===
About 100 years later on April 21, 1734 the other (shorter, damaged) horn was found by Erich Lassen not far from the first horn. He gave it to the count of Schackenborg who in turn delivered it to King [[Christian VI of Denmark]] and received 200 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] in return. From this moment both horns were stored at ''Det kongelige Kunstkammer'' (The Royal Chamber of Art) at [[Christiansborg]], currently the Danish [[Rigsarkivet]] (national archive). The shorter horn was described in a treatise by archivist Richard Joachim Paulli in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Published in German as ''Zuverlässiger Abriss des Anno 1734 bey Tundern gefundenen Güldenen Horns'' (1734), in Danish translation as ''Tilforladelig Tegning paa det Anno 1734 udi Jydland fundene Guld-Horn'' (1735), with 7 woodcuts, comprising half-page cut on title page and 6 figures depicting the runic inscription and decorations on the golden horn. For reproductions, cf. Oxenstierna, E. C. G. ''Die Goldhörner von Gallehus'', Lidingö, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burglary and destruction==

===Original horns===
On May 4, 1802, the horns were stolen by a [[goldsmith]] and [[watchmaker]] named Niels Heidenreich from [[Foulum]], who entered a storage area containing the horns using forged keys. Heidenreich took the horns home and melted them down to recycle the gold. The theft was discovered the next day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/|title=Golden Horns of Gallehus «  Trafficking Culture|website=traffickingculture.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a bounty of 1,000 rigsdaler was advertised in the papers.

The [[master craftsman|grandmaster]] of the goldsmiths [[guild]], Andreas Holm, suspected that Heidenreich had been involved, since he had tried to sell Holm forged “[[pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]s” (Indian coins with god motifs), made from bad gold mixed with [[brass]]. Holm and his colleagues had kept watch on Heidenreich and saw him dump coin stamps in the town moat. He was arrested on April 27, 1803, and confessed on April 30. On June 10, Heidenreich was sentenced to prison, and not released until 1840. He died four years later. His buyers returned the recycled gold, which ended up in coins, not copies of the horns.

However, a set of [[plaster]] casts of the horns had been made for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in [[Rome]], but they had already been lost in a shipwreck off the [[Corsica]]n coast. Approximate copies were instead created from sketches. The horns pictured above are newer copies, made in 1980.

===Copies===
In 1993, copies of the horns were stolen from [[Moesgaard Museum]], which were shortly after recovered ditched in a forest near [[Hasselager]]. These copies are made of gilded [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece Moesgaard udstiller guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929125611/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1092023.ece |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2007, a set of modern [[Gilding|gilded]] [[silver]] copies were stolen from Kongernes Jelling museum at 4:30 in the morning,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece Professionelle bag tyveri af guldhorn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000510/http://jp.dk/indland/krimi/article1091371.ece |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but were recovered shortly after on September 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Trafficking Culture, http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/golden-horns-of-gallehus/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gravitational-wave astronomy''' is an emerging branch of [[observational astronomy]] which aims to use [[gravitational wave]]s (minute distortions of [[spacetime]] predicted by [[Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]]) to collect observational data about objects such as [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s, events such as [[supernova]]e, and processes including those of the  [[early universe]] shortly after the [[Big Bang]].

Gravitational waves have a solid theoretical basis, founded upon the theory of relativity. They were first predicted by Einstein in 1916; although a specific consequence of general relativity, they are a common feature of all theories of gravity that obey [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Bernard F.|title=Gravitational waves on the back of an envelope|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=52|issue=5|pages=412|doi=10.1119/1.13627|bibcode = 1984AmJPh..52..412S |date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, after 1916 there was a long debate whether the waves were actually physical, or artefacts of coordinate freedom in general relativity; this was not fully resolved until the 1950s.  Indirect observational evidence for their existence first came in the late 1980s, from monitoring of the [[PSR B1913+16|Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar]] (discovered 1974); the pulsar orbit was found to evolve exactly as would be expected for gravitational wave emission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hulse|first=R.

On 11 February 2016 it was announced that the [[LIGO]] collaboration had [[First observation of gravitational waves|directly observed gravitational waves for the first time]] in September 2015.

Ordinary gravitational waves frequencies are very low and much harder to detect, while higher frequencies occur in more dramatic events and thus have become the first to be observed.

In addition to a merger of black holes, a binary [[neutron star merger]] has been directly detected: a [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB) was detected by the orbiting [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope#GRB 170817A signals a multi-messenger transient|Fermi gamma-ray burst monitor]] on 2017 August 17 12:41:06 UTC, triggering an automated notice worldwide. Six minutes later a single detector at Hanford LIGO, a [[gravitational-wave observatory]], registered a gravitational-wave candidate occurring 2 seconds before the gamma-ray burst. This set of observations is consistent with a binary [[neutron star]] merger,&lt;ref name=iop2017oct16&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa91c9/meta#apjlaa91c9s2 ''Astrophysical Journal Letters'' (2017 October 16), Multi-messenger Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger]&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced by a multi-messenger transient event which was signalled by gravitational-wave,  and electromagnetic (gamma-ray burst, optical, and infrared)-spectrum sightings.

There are several current scientific collaborations for observing gravitational waves. There is a worldwide network of ground-based detectors, these are kilometre-scale [[Michelson interferometer|laser interferometers]] including: the [[LIGO|Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]] (LIGO), a joint project between [[MIT]], [[Caltech]] and the scientists of the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]] with detectors in [[Livingston, Louisiana]] and [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]]; [[Virgo interferometer|Virgo]], at the [[European Gravitational Observatory]], [[Cascina]], Italy; [[GEO600]] in [[Sarstedt]], Germany, and the [[KAGRA|Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector]] (KAGRA), operated by the [[University of Tokyo]] in the [[Kamioka Observatory]], Japan. LIGO and Virgo are currently being upgraded to their advanced configurations. Advanced LIGO began observations in 2015, detecting gravitational waves even though not having reached its design sensitivity yet; Advanced Virgo is expected to start observing in 2016. The more advanced KAGRA is scheduled for 2018. GEO600 is currently operational, but its sensitivity makes it unlikely to make an observation; its primary purpose is to trial technology.

=== Low frequency ===
An alternative means of observation is using [[pulsar timing array]]s (PTAs). There are three consortia, the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA), the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]] (NANOGrav), and the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] (PPTA), which co-operate as the [[International Pulsar Timing Array]]. These use existing radio telescopes, but since they are sensitive to frequencies in the nanohertz range, many years of observation are needed to detect a signal and detector sensitivity improves gradually. Current bounds are approaching those expected for astrophysical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sesana|first=A.|title=Systematic investigation of the expected gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries in the pulsar timing band|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters|date=22 May 2013|volume=433|issue=1|pages=L1–L5|doi=10.1093/mnrasl/slt034|arxiv = 1211.5375 |bibcode = 2013MNRAS.433L...1S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate frequencies===
Further in the future, there is the possibility of space-borne detectors. The [[European Space Agency]] has selected a gravitational-wave mission for its L3 mission, due to launch 2034, the current concept is the [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna]] (eLISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = ESA's new vision to study the invisible universe| publisher = ESA | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ESA_s_new_vision_to_study_the_invisible_Universe |accessdate = 29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in development is the Japanese [[Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory]] (DECIGO).

==Scientific value==
[[Astronomy]] has traditionally relied on [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Originating with the visible band, as technology advanced, it became possible to observe other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], from [[Radio astronomy|radio]] to [[Gamma-ray astronomy|gamma rays]]. Each new frequency band gave a new perspective on the Universe and heralded new discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longair|first=Malcolm|title=Cosmic century: a history of astrophysics and cosmology.|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1107669367}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, indirect and later direct [[Cosmic-ray observatory|measurements of high-energy, massive, particles]] provided an additional window into the cosmos.

[[Russell Alan Hulse|Russell Hulse]] and [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.|Joseph Taylor]] were awarded the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for showing that the orbital decay of a pair of neutron stars, one of them a pulsar, fits general relativity's predictions of gravitational radiation.&lt;ref name=npp1993&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1993 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/index.html|DUPLICATE_accessdate=|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many other binary pulsars (including one [[PSR J0737-3039|double pulsar system]]) have been observed, all fitting gravitational-wave predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stairs|first=Ingrid H.|title=Testing General Relativity with Pulsar Timing|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=6|pages=5|doi=10.12942/lrr-2003-5|arxiv = astro-ph/0307536 |bibcode = 2003LRR.....6....5S |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to [[Rainer Weiss]], [[Kip Thorne]] and [[Barry Barish]] for their role in the first detection of gravitational waves.&lt;ref name="BBC-20171003"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rincon |first1=Paul |last2=Amos |first2=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41476648|title=Einstein's waves win Nobel Prize |work=[[BBC News]] |date=3 October 2017 |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=2017 Nobel Prize in Physics Awarded to LIGO Black Hole Researchers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html |date=3 October 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20171003dk"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kaiser |first=David |authorlink=David Kaiser |title=Learning from Gravitational Waves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/opinion/gravitational-waves-ligo-funding.html |date=3 October 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gravitational waves provide complementary information to that provided by other means. By combining observations of a single event made using different means, it is possible to gain a more complete understanding of the source's properties. This is known as [[multi-messenger astronomy]]. Gravitational waves can also be used to observe systems that are invisible (or almost impossible to detect) to measure by any other means. For example, they provide a unique method of measuring the properties of black holes.

Gravitational waves can be emitted by many systems, but, to produce detectable signals, the source must consist of extremely massive objects moving at a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]]. The main source is a binary of two [[compact object]]s. Example systems include:
* Compact binaries made up of two closely orbiting stellar-mass objects, such as [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s or [[black hole]]s. Wider binaries, which have lower orbital frequencies, are a source for detectors like [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelemans|first=Gijs|title=The Galactic gravitational wave foreground|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 May 2009|volume=26|issue=9|pages=094030|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/26/9/094030|arxiv = 0901.1778 |bibcode = 2009CQGra..26i4030N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroeer|first=A|author2=Vecchio, A|title=The LISA verification binaries|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 October 2006|volume=23|issue=19|pages=S809–S817|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/23/19/S19|arxiv = astro-ph/0605227 |bibcode = 2006CQGra..23S.809S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closer binaries produce a signal for ground-based detectors like [[LIGO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abadie|first=J|author2=et al.|title=Predictions for the rates of compact binary coalescences observable by ground-based gravitational-wave detectors|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=7 September 2010|volume=27|issue=17|pages=173001|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/27/17/173001|arxiv = 1003.2480 |bibcode = 2010CQGra..27q3001A |last3=Abbott|first3=R.|last4=Abernathy|first4=M.|last5=Accadia|first5=T.|last6=Acernese|first6=F.|last7=Adams|first7=C.|last8=Adhikari|first8=R.|last9=Ajith|first9=P.|last10=Allen|first10=B.|last11=Allen|first11=G.|last12=Amador Ceron|first12=E.|last13=Amin|first13=R.

Gravitational waves interact only weakly with matter. This is what makes them difficult to detect. It also means that they can travel freely through the Universe, and are not [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] or [[scattering|scattered]] like electromagnetic radiation. It is therefore possible to see to the center of dense systems, like the cores of [[supernova]]e or the [[Galactic Centre]]. It is also possible to see further back in time than with electromagnetic radiation, as the [[Chronology of the universe|early universe]] was opaque to light prior to [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], but transparent to gravitational waves.

The ability of gravitational waves to move freely through matter also means that [[gravitational-wave detector]]s, unlike [[telescope]]s, are not pointed to observe a single [[field of view]] but observe the entire sky. Detectors are more sensitive in some directions than others, which is one reason why it is beneficial to have a network of detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Bernard F|title=Networks of gravitational wave detectors and three figures of merit|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|date=21 June 2011|volume=28|issue=12|pages=125023|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/28/12/125023|arxiv = 1102.5421 |bibcode = 2011CQGra..28l5023S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In cosmic inflation===
[[Inflation (cosmology)|Cosmic inflation]], a hypothesized period when the universe rapidly expanded during the first 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;seconds after the [[Big Bang]], would have given rise to gravitational waves; that would have left a characteristic imprint in the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the CMB radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=Wayne|author2=White, Martin|title=A CMB polarization primer|journal=New Astronomy|volume=2|issue=4|pages=323–344|doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(97)00022-5|arxiv = astro-ph/9706147 |bibcode = 1997NewA....2..323H |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamionkowski|first=Marc|author2=Stebbins, Albert|title=Statistics of cosmic microwave background polarization|journal=Physical Review D|volume=55|issue=12|pages=7368–7388|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.7368|arxiv = astro-ph/9611125 |bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.7368K |date=1997|last3=Stebbins|first3=Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to calculate the properties of the primordial gravitational waves from measurements of the patterns in the [[microwave]] radiation, and use those calculations to learn about the early universe. {{how|date=August 2017}}

==Development==
[[Image:LIGO control.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The LIGO Hanford Control Room]]
As a young area of research, gravitational-wave astronomy is still in development; however, there is consensus within the astrophysics community that this field will evolve to become an established component of 21st century [[multi-messenger astronomy]].&lt;ref name=LIGO_plan/&gt;

Gravitational-wave observations complement observations in the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Price|first1=Larry|title=Looking for the Afterglow: The LIGO Perspective|journal=LIGO Magazine|date=September 2015|issue=7|page=10|url=http://www.ligo.org/magazine/LIGO-magazine-issue-7.pdf#page=10|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LIGO_plan&gt;{{cite web|title=PLANNING FOR A BRIGHT TOMORROW: PROSPECTS FOR GRAVITATIONAL-WAVE ASTRONOMY WITH ADVANCED LIGO AND ADVANCED VIRGO|url=http://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-ObservingScenario/index.php|publisher=[[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These waves also promise to yield information in ways not possible via detection and analysis of electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves can be absorbed and re-radiated in ways that make extracting information about the source difficult. Gravitational waves, however, only interact weakly with matter, meaning that they are not scattered or absorbed. This should allow astronomers to view the center of a supernova, stellar nebulae, and even colliding galactic cores in new ways.

Ground-based detectors have yielded new information about the inspiral phase and mergers of binary systems of two [[stellar black hole|stellar mass black hole]]s, and merger of two [[neutron star]]s. They could also detect signals from [[core-collapse supernova]]e, and from periodic sources such as pulsars with small deformations. If there is truth to speculation about certain kinds of [[phase transition]]s or kink bursts from long [[cosmic string]]s in the very early universe (at [[cosmic time]]s around 10&lt;sup&gt;−25&lt;/sup&gt; seconds), these could also be detectable.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Cutler|Thorne|2002|loc=sec. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Space-based detectors like LISA should detect objects such as binaries consisting of two [[white dwarfs]], and [[AM CVn star]]s (a [[white dwarf]] accreting matter from its binary partner, a low-mass helium star), and also observe the mergers of [[supermassive black hole]]s and the inspiral of smaller objects (between one and a thousand [[solar mass]]es) into such black holes. LISA should also be able to listen to the same kind of sources from the early universe as ground-based detectors, but at even lower frequencies and with greatly increased sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Cutler|Thorne|2002|loc=sec. 3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Detecting emitted gravitational waves is a difficult endeavor. It involves ultra stable high quality lasers and detectors calibrated with a sensitivity of at least 2·10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;sup&gt;−1/2&lt;/sup&gt; as shown at the ground-based detector, GEO600.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Seifert F., et al.|2006|loc=sec. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that even from large astronomical events, such as supernova explosions, these waves are likely to degrade to vibrations as small as an atomic diameter.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Golm|Potsdam|2013|loc=sec. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperpersonal theory''' (HPT) is related and understood through [[computer-mediated communication]](CMC). Hyperpersonal theory is part of [[interpersonal communication]] theory meaning that the HPT suggests CMC due to the uses technological messages rather than [[face-to-face interaction]]s. According to Erin Schumaker (2013) the hyperpersonal theory represents how people communicate online rather than FtF.  The theory displays predictions on how people present themselves in a virtual environment. HPT demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumaker|first1=Erin|date=2013|title=Exploring the Hyperpersonal Model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication|journal=Dissertation at Ohio State University|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walther ==
Joseph Walther is noted to be the founder of this theory, however, he uses his finding to teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In his research he found "the hyperpersonal model of CMC proposes a set of concurrent theoretically based processes to explain how CMC may facilitate impressions and relationships online"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes and Functions|last1=Walther|first1=Joseph|location=Chapter 14|pages=443–471|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to FtF relationships. The model Walther created has four main components that illustrate how CMC relates to message structure and reception:&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

# Effects due to receiver processes
# Effects among message senders
# Attributes of the channel
# Feedback effects

Effects due to receiver processes explains how communication could be misunderstood or exaggerated perceptions by the sender. By this, Walther explains that without FtF interactions and gesture cues, receivers fill in the missing information from the sender. The second component involves the sender. Walther illustrates that senders are able to avoid distractions of conversation with FtF interaction, allowing the sender to compose messages making themselves more desirable over text and online rather than the receiver being able to see their characteristics and gesture cues. Senders are able to disclose information while being able to provide only the information they want the receiver to know. The third component describes how CMC is the channel of the conversation. In this section, senders are able to take their time and craft messages or responses without conversation flow.  Senders are able to perfect messages through the channel without  communication interruptions. The fourth component involves feedback from CMC. It exemplifies behavioral conformation and overall impressions made by the receiver of the channel. The feedback effects component has been under study recently due to acknowledging if this component was enhancing the identity of the sender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These four components represent how CMC may effect how relationships online exceed offline relationships.

== Background ==
Orignination of the hyperpersonal theory model came from [[Joseph Walther]]. He is the Director of Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Walther, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara says, "his teaching and research focus on [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and social media in personal relationships, groups, educational settings, and inter-ethic conflict, topics on which he has contributed several original theories and numerous experiments and surveys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther|title=UC Santa Barbara Department of Communication|website=comm.ucsb.edu|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-mediated communication ==
Computer-mediated communication, also known as CMC, relates to hyperpersonal theory model because it suggests that computer-mediated communication can turn hyperpersonal since they both lack the use of face-to-face communication. CMC "may be [[wikt:impersonal|impersonal]]".&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walther |first1=Joseph B. |title=Computer-Mediated Communication |journal=Communication Research |date=29 June 2016 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1177/009365096023001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now online friendships and virtual communities. CMC was "emerged as an unintended byproduct of linking large computers to one another for security and information redundancy".&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; In doing so, operators found that the computers were able to send messages to other people, enabling computer-mediated communication. From this, researchers began to question whether CMC could replace traveling to events, such as business meetings, and indicate whether or not CMC might provide meetings more effective than FtF meetings.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; This is where researchers developed online behaviors vs personal interaction behaviors. They tested this by interactions through e-mail. Researchers then found that computer-mediated communication was more task-oriented rather than FtF conversations/meetings.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel's [[Media richness theory|Media Richness theory]] depict FtF interactions contain more richness than CMC. Daft and Lengel state, "messages should be communicated on channels with sufficient and appropriate media richness capacities."&lt;ref name=":423"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John|last2=Zmud|first2=Robert|date=April 1999|title=Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential Nature of Media Richness Perceptions|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=42|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continue to propose that "messages communicated on channels that are inappropriate to the equivocality of a situation and the richness of the information may be misinterpreted by recipients or may be otherwise ineffective"&lt;ref name=":423" /&gt; Whereas, Walther explains HPT represents how communication interpersonally online has enhanced society with new technologies, allowing people to create virtual communities. Walther enacted the finding and research of CMC when Daft and Lengel stated that management problems became too difficult and complex; stating that the richness of communication was lost when tying to convey adequate insight and understanding &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; Walther explains that growing numbers of reports indicate that CMC interactions are sometimes just as interactive as FtF interactions.

== Uses of Hyperpersonal theory ==
Hyperpersonal theory Model describes how people use virtual communication, or [[computer-mediated communication]], rather than [[face-to-face communication]] (FtF). There are two directions Walther makes on the work of CMC and its interpersonal effects:&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

# To integrate theories and findings based on impersonal and interpersonal interactions in CMC, allowing favorable outcomes for certain contexts in HPT &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;
# To view a new perspective on intimacy, solidarity, and liking via CMC, allowing HPT to surpass FtF interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock ===
Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use Joseph Walther's hyperpersonal theory model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established "some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Crystal|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalie|last3=Hancock|first3=Jeffrey|date=2010|title=The Disclosure–Intimacy Link in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Attributional Extension of the Hyperpersonal Model|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=37|pages=58–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depicted that people tend to "put their best foot forward"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that "related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a "more positive hyperpersonal relationship”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Daft &amp; Lengel's Media Richness Theory ===
Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt;

=== Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory ===
[[Ned Kock]], is a researcher of the [[Media naturalness theory|Media Naturalness]] and [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion theory]] (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to "richer" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory (Carlson and Zmud 1999) essentially undercut Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kock|first=Ned|last2=Garza|first2=Vanessa|date=April–June 2011|title=Media Naturalness and Compensatory Channel Expansion: A Study of Online and Face-to-Face Sections of the Same Course|url=|journal=International Journal of Distance Education Technologies|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve "positive effects" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning.

== Critique ==
Walther describes some challenges to CMC research. His area of concern lies within three areas:&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

# Neglect of off-line comparisons in CMC
# New technologies
# Studying interpersonal communication

Walthers seeks to tell researchers not compare FtF communication with CMC due the fact they rely on different users and features.

According to Charles Soukup (2000), the problem with CMC communication lies within the multi-media aspects. Many researcher have lacked studying new technologies and multi-media outlets in today's society. Researchers are failing to see the new dimensions CMC has to offer, the researchers are relying too much on textual aspects of CMC rather than communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soukup |first1=Charles |title=Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=30 June 2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=407–425 |doi=10.1177/1461444800002004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has researched and written widely on religious matters, from [[Celtic Christianity]] to the future of [[spirituality]] in Britain. In addition, he has published works on the subjects of [[hymnody]], monarchy, the [[Victorian era]], [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[musical theatre]].

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Ian Bradley was born in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], on [[Whit Sunday]] 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studia.no/vare.php?ean=9780826482822 Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns - Studia AS - Bokhandel]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the southeast of England and was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[New College, Oxford]], from which he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|first-class honours degree]] in modern history.  He remained at [[Oxford|University of Oxford]] to complete a [[doctoral thesis]] on religion and politics in early nineteenth-century Britain, earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree.

===Career===
Bradley subsequently worked in radio and television production with the [[BBC]]. He spent five years on the staff of ''[[The Times]]'' (and was a features writer for ''The Times'' for eight years) and then combined freelance writing with teaching at [[Cranleigh School]] in [[Surrey]]. Following further study at the [[University of St Andrews]], from which he graduated with a first-class honours [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] degree in [[theology]], Bradley was ordained to the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]] and appointed Head of Religious Broadcasting for [[BBC Scotland]]. He has lived in Scotland since 1985. He sat on the committee that drafted the [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Church Hymnary, fourth edition (2005)|Church of Scotland's Hymnary (Fourth Edition)]], which was published in 2005. Bradley has taught in the areas of Christianity in contemporary Britain; hymnody, liturgy and worship; monarchy, church and state; and the theology of [[musical theatre]]. According to his profile in his 1997 book ''Abide with Me'', he was one of the first lecturers to teach an honors course on hymnology at a British University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37548665|title=Abide With Me: The World of Victorian Hymns|last=Ian|first=Bradley|date=1997|publisher=SCM Press|isbn=033402692X|location=London|oclc=37548665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lectured on [[church history]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] for many years, Bradley was appointed to a position at the University of St Andrews in 1998, where he was later awarded a Chair in Cultural and Spiritual History in its School of Divinity, where he was previously Principal of [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]]. He retired in 2017. He is also associate minister of Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews, and honorary Church of Scotland chaplain for the university.&lt;ref name=UnivBioPage/&gt;

As a journalist, Bradley contributes frequently to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Tablet]]'' and ''[[Life and Work (magazine)|Life and Work]]'' as well as often appearing on [[television]] and [[BBC Radio 4]]. Bradley frequently writes, broadcasts and lectures about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and has spoken numerous times at the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]]s in [[Buxton]] and [[Harrogate]], England. He performs regularly with the University of St Andrews Gilbert and Sullivan Society, of which he is honorary life president. He is the author of more than 30 books.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html Penguin Group Authors - New Zealand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075652/http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html |date=27 September 2007 }}.

The '''Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR)''' is an organization founded in 1987 by [[Heidi Hartmann]] to meet the need for [[women]]-centered, policy-oriented research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=10903&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was co-founded by current IWPR President Heidi Hartmann in 1986. IWPR has informed policy by putting relevant, high quality facts in the hands of thousands of local leaders and advocates, increasing their ability to shape and implement legislation that benefits women and their families. IWPR has published hundreds of reports, fact sheets, and research-in-briefs that place women as the central point of analysis. The research serves as a reliable resource to policymakers, providing background and context for present and future policy agendas impacting women in the United States and around the world. IWPR’s research addresses issues of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. In addition, IWPR research focuses specifically on policies that help or hurt women in their efforts to achieve social, economic, and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwpr.org/about/history&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Areas==
===Employment, Economic Change &amp; Education===
IWPR examines the quality of jobs across a diverse range of workers and job types as well as produces research that explores access to employment benefits.

On average, women earn less than men in virtually every single occupation for which there is sufficient data for both men and women to calculate an earnings ratio. IWPR tracks the gender wage gap over time. Given the existing gender wage gap, educational attainment is especially crucial for women, as women need more education to reach the same average income levels as men.

===Democracy and Society===
IWPR seeks to identify successful strategies to encourage women’s participation in civic and political life by analyzing data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels.

===Poverty, Welfare and Income Security===
Around the world, research shows that women tend to be in poverty at greater rates than men. IWPR has served as a resource on women’s poverty issues by producing research on income security and suggesting improvements to planning and policies that take into consideration the welfare of women.

===Work and Family===
For most Americans, work and family go hand in hand. Early care and education programs are crucial to a thriving economy, not only because they allow parents to work, but because the child care sector is large and purchases numerous goods and services. IWPR aims to improve access to child care, measure workplace flexibility and determine whether the defining characteristics of a good job are being implemented in American society.

===Health and Safety===
Women have specific concerns when it comes to health. More often than not, women make the majority of health care-related decisions regarding health issues for their families, are the primary caregivers, and spend more than their male counterparts on health (KFF 2009; Agency for 2004). IWPR’s research on women’s health and safety informs policy decisions by identifying gender and racial/ethnic disparities in health outcomes and access to health care services in addition to highlighting opportunities for improvement.

==IWPR Projects and Initiatives==
===Status of Women in the States Reports=== 
IWPR has analyzed data on a wide range of indicators at the local, state and federal levels, including demographics, economic security, educational attainment, reproductive rights, political participation, civic engagement, and access to health care and work support in order to publish a collection of comprehensive reports. Each report offers policy recommendations shaped by the research findings for that state, city or area.

===Women and Social Security===
Women are more likely to rely on Social Security because they have fewer alternative sources of income, often outlive their husbands, and are more likely to be left to rear children when their husbands die or become disabled. Specifically, adult women are 57 percent of all social security beneficiaries aged 65 and older. IWPR produces and disseminates materials to keep women involved on the ongoing Social Security debate and to ensure that women’s concerns are addressed when or if any changes to the system take place.

===Student Parent Success Initiative=== 
The Student Parent Success Initiative focuses on supporting students with dependent children who are pursuing college education. Funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the project gives IWPR the opportunity to initiate new research and foster communication and collaboration among advocates, policymakers, and practitioners invested in the success of student parents in postsecondary education.

==Subject Matter==

Parliamentary and Political Law means the field of law, legal scholarship and legal practice relating to the functions and operations of parliamentary, governmental and judicial institutions and their respective officials.

Parliamentary Law means the body of law dealing with the establishment and functioning of parliamentary institutions, and includes the law of parliamentary privilege.

Political Law means the body of law dealing with the structure of the State and the processes of governing, with the application of legal, public policy and political instruments of governing, and with the impact of law on democratic governing.

Within the overall domain of public law, Parliamentary and Political Law is complementary to constitutional law and administrative law.  As an interdisciplinary study, it is distinct from, yet linked to, political science, and public policy and administration.

The Institute (and through its Journal) specializes in the interdisciplinary, comprehensive and comparative analysis of these topics.

==Publications and Programs==

The Institute publishes [http://econcordia.com/sites/IPPL/journal.aspx?section=36 The Journal of Parliamentary and Political Law] three times a year, which is available through [[Carswell (publishers)|Carswell Thomson]].

It also hosts a bi-annual conference, and The Third ''Law and Parliament'' Conference was held

'''Iterative design''' is a [[design]] methodology based on a cyclic process of [[prototyping]], [[Product testing|testing]], analyzing, and refining a product or process.  Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made.  This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design.  In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.

==Iterative design process==
The iterative design process may be applied throughout the [[new product development]] process.  However, changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development.  The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a [[prototype]].  The prototype should be evaluated by a [[focus group]] or a group not associated with the product in order to deliver non-biased opinions.  Information from the focus group should be synthesized and incorporated into the next iteration of the design.  The process should be repeated until user issues have been reduced to an acceptable level.

===Application: Human computer interfaces===
Iterative design is commonly used in the development of human computer interfaces.  This allows designers to identify any usability issues that may arise in the user interface before it is put into wide use.  Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so a usability engineering lifecycle should be built around the concept of iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Iterative User Interface Design | year = 1993 | author = Nielsen, J. | journal = IEEE Computer  vol.26 no.11 pp 32-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical steps of iterative design in user interfaces are as follows:

# Complete an initial interface design
# Present the design to several test users
# Note any problems had by the test user
# Refine interface to account for/fix the problems
# Repeat steps 2-4 until user interface problems are resolved

Iterative design in user interfaces can be implemented in many ways.  One common method of using iterative design in computer software is [[software testing]].  While this includes testing the product for functionality outside of the user interface, important feedback on the interface can be gained from subject testing early versions of a program.  This allows software companies to release a better quality product to the public, and prevents the need of product modification following its release.

Iterative design in online (website) interfaces is a more continual process, as website modification, after it has been released to the user, is far more viable than in software design.  Often websites use their users as test subjects for interface design, making modifications based on recommendations from visitors to their sites.

==Iterative design use==
Iterative design is a way of confronting the reality of unpredictable user needs and behaviors that can lead to sweeping and fundamental changes in a design. User testing will often show that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Thus, it is important that the flexibility of the iterative design’s implementation approach extends as far into the system as possible. Designers must further recognize that user testing results may suggest radical change that requires the designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs. Iterative design applies in many fields, from making knives to rockets. As an example consider the design of an [[electronic circuit]] that must perform a certain task, and must ultimately fit in a small space on a [[circuit board]]. It is useful to split these independent tasks into two smaller and simpler tasks, the functionality task, and the space and weight task. A [[breadboard]] is a useful way of implementing the electronic circuit on an interim basis, without having to worry about space and weight.

Once the circuit works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design.  When the design is finalized, one can set about designing a proper circuit board meeting the space and weight criteria.  Compacting the circuit on the circuit board requires that the wires and components be juggled around without changing their electrical characteristics.  This juggling follows simpler rules than the design of the circuit itself, and is often [[Place and route|automated]]. As far as possible [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off the shelf]] components are used, but where necessary for space or performance reasons, custom made components may be developed.

Several instances of iterative design are as follows:

*'''Wiki''': A [[wiki]] is a natural repository for iterative design.  The 'Page History' facility allows tracking back to prior versions.  Modifications are mostly incremental, and leave substantial parts of the text unchanged.
*'''Common law''': The principle of [[legal precedent]] builds on past experience.  This makes law a form of iterative design where there should be a clear [[audit trail]] of the development of legal thought.
*'''Evolution''': There is a parallel between iterative and the theory of [[natural Selection]].  Both involve a trial and error process in which the most suitable design advances to the next generation, while less suitable designs perish by the wayside.  Subsequent versions of a product should also get progressively better as its producers learn what works and what doesn't in a process of refinement and [[Continual improvement process|continual improvement]].

==Fast prototyping tools==
One approach to iterative design is to use the highest level of abstraction for developing an early generation product. The principle here is that rapid development may not produce efficient code, but obtaining feedback is more important that technology optimization. Examples of this approach include use of non-functional code, object databases, or low code platforms - these allow quick testing of designs before issues of optimization are addressed.

==Benefits==
When properly applied, iterative design will ensure a product or process is the best solution possible.  When applied early in the development stage, significant cost savings are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Cost/Benefit Analysis for incorporating human factors in the software lifecycle | date = April 1988 | author = Marilyn Mantei; Toby Teorey  | journal = Publications of the ACM  vol.31 no.4 pp 428-439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits to iterative design include:
# Serious misunderstandings are made evident early in the lifecycle, when it's possible to react to them.
# It enables and encourages user feedback, so as to elicit the system's real requirements.
# Where the work is contracted, Iterative Design provides an incremental method for more effectively involving the client in the complexities that often surround the design process.
# The development team is forced to focus on those issues that are most critical to the project, and team members are shielded from those issues that distract and divert them from the project's real risks.
# Continual testing enables an objective assessment of the project's status.
# Inconsistencies among requirements, designs, and implementations are detected early.
# The workload of the team, especially the testing team, is spread out more evenly throughout the lifecycle.
# This approach enables the team to leverage lessons learned, and therefore to continually improve the process.
# Stakeholders in the project can be given concrete evidence of the project's status throughout the lifecycle.

==Marshmallow Challenge==
[[File:Marshmallow_Challenge.jpg|thumb|Marshmallow challenge winning work.]]
The Marshmallow Challenge is an instructive design challenge. It involves the task of constructing the highest possible free-standing structure with a marshmallow on top. The structure must be completed within 18 minutes using only 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, and one yard of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=The Marshmallow Challenge |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpwrap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpwrap.com/2010/04/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |location=CA |publisher=BPWrap |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation and studies of participants show that kindergartners are regularly able to build higher structures, in comparison to groups of business school graduates. This is explained by the tendency for children to at once stick the marshmallow on top of a simple structure, test the prototype, and continue to improve upon it. Whereas, business school students tend to spend time vying for power, planning, and finally producing a structure to which the marshmallow is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerz |first=Dennis G. |url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/weblog/2010/05/the_marshmallow_challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge - Jerz's Literacy Weblog |publisher=Jerz.setonhill.edu |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was invented by Peter Skillman of [[Palm, Inc.]] and popularized by Tom Wujec of [[Autodesk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Chris |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/marshmallows-and-spaghetti-how-kindergartners-think-like-lean-startups.php |title=Marshmallows and Spaghetti: How Kindergartners Think Like Lean Startups |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineeringrevision.com/302/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Engineeringrevision.com |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfishprogramming.com/2010/04/28/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Selfish Programming |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713002340/http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/science/node/1578 |title=Marshmallow challenge &amp;#124; Faculty of Science &amp;#124; University of Calgary |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Original Design Challenge|title=Peter Skillman Marshmallow Design Challenge|date=2014-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p5sBzMtB3Q|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other notes==
He published in 2011 the book "Homo eroticus", devoted to the evolution of human sexuality. It discusses inter alia certain famous theories in the field and proposes interesting new explanations for this problems, e.g., the fur losing by humans, ovulation veiling in women, two type of woman sexual receptivity, the origination of intimacy, marriage, love, and initiation and circumcision rites. The book was highly praised by specialists and recommended as a reading for university students in Cracow, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homo-eroticus.ibs.opole.pl/reviews.html "Reviews"] at the book "Homo eroticus" website.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">'''Memory dependence prediction''' is a technique, employed by high-performance [[out-of-order execution]] [[microprocessor]]s that execute [[primary storage|memory]] access operations (loads and stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads and stores at [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] [[execution (computers)|execution]] time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to [[speculative execution|speculatively execute]] certain loads and stores out of order, while preventing other loads and stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]], [[memory disambiguation]] techniques are used to determine if the loads and stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.

By using the memory dependence predictor to keep most dependent loads and stores in order, the processor gains the benefits of aggressive out-of-order load/store execution but avoids many of the memory dependence violations that occur when loads and stores were incorrectly executed. This increases performance because it reduces the number of [[pipeline flush]]es that are required to recover from these memory dependence violations. See the [[memory disambiguation]] article for more information on memory dependencies, memory dependence violations, and recovery.

In general, memory dependence prediction predicts whether two memory operations are dependent, that is, if they interact by accessing the same memory location. Besides using store to load (RAW or true) memory dependence prediction for the out-of-order scheduling of loads and stores, other applications of memory dependence prediction have been proposed. See for example.&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP"&gt;Streamlining Inter-Operation Memory Communication via Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory dependence prediction is an optimization on top of '''memory dependence speculation'''. Sequential execution semantics imply that stores and loads appear to execute in the order specified by the program. However, as with out-of-order execution of other instructions, it may be possible to execute two memory operations in a different from the program implied order. This is possible when the two operations are independent. In memory dependence speculation a load may be allowed to execute before a store that precedes it. Speculation succeeds when the load is independent of the store, that is, when the two instructions access different memory locations. Speculation fails when the load is dependent upon the store, that is, when the two accesses overlap in memory. In the first, modern out-of-order designs, memory speculation was not used as its benefits were limited. Αs the scope of the out-of-order execution increased over few tens of instructions, naive memory dependence speculation was used. In '''naive memory dependence speculation''',&lt;ref name="SaSoMD"&gt;Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Memory Dependences, Moshovos, Breach, Vijaykumar and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1997. Also as technical report, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; a load is allowed to bypass any preceding store. As with any form of speculation, it is important to weight the benefits of correct speculation against the penalty paid on incorrect speculation. As the scope of out-of-order execution increases further into several tens of instructions, the performance benefits of naive speculation decrease. To retain the benefits of aggressive memory dependence speculation while avoiding the costs of mispeculation several predictors have been proposed.

'''Selective memory dependence prediction'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP"&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos, Ph.D. Thesis, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dec. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; stalls specific loads until it is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Specifically, '''Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP" /&gt; delays loads only as long as it is necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The '''synonym predictor'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The '''store sets'''&lt;ref&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction using Store Sets, Chrysos and Emer, in the Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The '''store barrier'''&lt;ref&gt;Apparatus to dynamically control the out-of-order execution of load-store instructions in a processor capable of dispatching, issuing and executing multiple instructions in a single processor cycle, Hesson, LeBlanc and Ciavaglia, IBM, US Patent 5,615,350, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, '''speculative memory cloaking'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; and '''speculative memory bypassing'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory.

==Analogy to branch prediction==
Memory dependence prediction for loads and stores is analogous to [[branch predictor|branch prediction]] for [[conditional branch]] instructions. In branch prediction, the branch predictor predicts which way the branch will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions down one of the paths of the branch. Later, when the branch instruction executes, it can be determined if the branch instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a [[misprediction|branch misprediction]], and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed.

Branch prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines the direction of the branch (taken or not). This is a binary decision. Then, the predictor determines the actual target address. Similarly, memory dependence prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines whether there is a dependence. Then it determines which this dependence is.

One of the distinct ecosystems is the Riverine Forest. These are found on the lower flood plains along the rivers edge. The main species found here is one of the deciduous species; the [[Populus balsamifera|Balsam Poplar]]. These trees like a high volume of moisture and are able to tolerate flooding. They are distinguishable by their thick, gnarly bark and their larger, pointed leaves. These leaves have a distinct drip tip. The trees supply homes for the many native species of fauna. 

Other Key trees include [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]], [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]], [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]], [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], [[Tsuga canadensis|eastern hemlock]], [[white pine]], [[Pinus resinosa|red pine]], [[Quercus rubra|northern red oak]], [[Prunus pensylvanica|pin cherry]], and [[Picea rubens|red spruce]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Nun Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease''' is a continuing [[longitudinal study]], begun in 1986, to examine the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]]. [[David Snowdon]], the founding Nun Study investigator, began the research at the [[University of Minnesota]], but moved it to the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1986. In 2008, with Snowdon's retirement, the study returned to the University of Minnesota. Similar environmental influences and general lifestyles among the participants make the nuns an ideal population to study, and although it is ongoing it has yielded several findings. At the University of Minnesota, Kelvin Lim and Laura Hemmy are developing a new Alzheimer's Disease study working with the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;''Trust &amp; Dare'', newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1992, researchers at [[Rush University Medical Center]] [[Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center]] (RADC), building on the success of the Nun Study, proposed the [[Rush Religious Orders Study]]. The Religious Orders Study was funded by the [[National Institute on Aging]] in 1993, and is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Overview and Findings from the Religious Orders Study, Curr Alzheimer Res. 2012 July 1:9(6): 628-645.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the University of Minnesota are collaborating with the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center on the Religious Orders Study, as well as several other ongoing studies.&lt;ref&gt;Trust &amp; Dare, newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Nun Study, begun in 1986 with funding by the National Institute on Aging, focuses on a group of 678 American [[Roman Catholic]] sisters who are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Studying a relatively homogeneous group (no drug use, little or no alcohol, similar housing and reproductive histories, etc.) minimizes the extraneous [[variable (research)|variable]]s that may confound other similar research.

==Current findings==
Researchers have also accessed the convent archive to review documents amassed throughout the lives of the nuns in the study. Among the documents reviewed were autobiographical essays that had been written by the nuns upon joining the sisterhood; upon review, it was found that an essay's lack of linguistic density (e.g., complexity, vivacity, fluency) functioned as a [[statistical significance|significant]] predictor of its author's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. The approximate mean age of the nuns at the time of writing was merely 22 years. Roughly 80% of nuns whose writing was measured as lacking in linguistic density went on to develop Alzheimer's disease in old age; meanwhile, of those whose writing was not lacking, only 10% later developed the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR: Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study Neurobiology of Aging 26(3):341347, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, findings of the Nun Study suggest "that traits in early, mid, and late life have strong relationships with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the [[mental  disabilities|mental]] and [[cognitive disabilities]] of old age."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp The University of Minnesota's Nun Study FAQ page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512190448/http://www.healthstudies.umn.edu/nunstudy/faq.jsp |date=2010-05-12 }}, December 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|right|thumb|A [[frog]] in [[frog#Eggs / frogspawn|frogspawn]]]]
In [[biology]], '''offspring''' are the young born of living [[organism]]s, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of [[sexual reproduction]], two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a '''brood''' or '''progeny''' in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the [[bird|chicks]] hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the [[brood (honeybee)|honeybee]].

Human offspring ([[kinship and descent|descendants]]) are referred to as [[child]]ren (without reference to age, thus one can refer to a parent's "[[minor (law)|minor]] children" or "[[adult]] children" or "[[infant|infant children]]" or "[[Teenagers|teenage children]]" depending on their age); male children are [[son]]s and female children are [[daughter]]s (see [[kinship and descent]]). Offspring can occur after mating or after [[artificial insemination]].

Offspring contains many parts and properties that are precise and accurate in what they consist of, and what they define. As the offspring of a new species, also known as a child or f1 generation, consist of genes of the father and the mother, which is also known as the parent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these offspring contains numerous genes which have coding for specific tasks and properties. Males and females both contribute equally to the genotypes of their offspring, in which gametes fuse and form. An important aspect of the formation of the parent offspring is the chromosome, which is a structure of DNA which contains many genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus more on the offspring and how it results in the formation of the f1 generation, is an inheritance called sex-linkage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/chromosome-chromosomes-eukaryotic-chromosome-eucariotic-chromosome-procariotic-6|title=chromosome|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a gene which is located on the sex chromosome and patterns of these inheritance differ in both male and female. The explanation that proves the theory of the offspring having genes from both parent generations, is proven through a process called crossing-over, which consists of taking genes from the male chromosomes and genes from the female chromosome, resulting in a process of [[meiosis]] occurring, and leading to the splitting of the chromosomes evenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on which genes are dominantly expressed in the gene will result in the sex of the offspring. The female will always give an X chromosome, whereas the male, depending on the situation, will either give an X chromosome or a Y chromosome. If a male offspring is produced, the gene will consist of an X and a Y chromosome. If two X chromosomes are expressed and produced, it produces a female offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/qa/what_is_gene.html|title=what is a gene|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is the production of an offspring which represents the identical genes as its parent. Reproductive cloning begins with the removal of the nucleus from an egg, which holds the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to clone an organ, a stem cell is to be produced and then utilized to clone that specific organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precaution.org/lib/cloned_animals.nejm.041230.pdf|title=cloning|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common misconception of cloning is that it produces an exact copy of the parent being cloned. Cloning copies the DNA/genes of the parent and then creates a genetic duplicate. The clone will not be a similar copy as he or she will grow up in different surroundings from the parent and may encounter different opportunities and experiences. Although mostly positive, cloning also faces some setbacks in terms of ethics and human health. Though cell division and DNA replication is a vital part of survival, there are many steps involved and mutations can occur with permanent change in an organism's and their offspring's DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnemstudio.org/genetic-algorithms-mutation.htm|title=mutation|accessdate=1 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some mutations can be good as they result in random evolution periods in which may be good for the species, but most mutations are bad as they can change the genotypes of offspring, which can result in changes that harm the species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

{{quote |''I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,&lt;br/&gt;My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,&lt;br/&gt;My gay apparel for an almsman's gown&lt;br/&gt;My figured goblets for a dish of wood.''&lt;br/&gt;

 – [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&lt;ref&gt; Baldick,2008. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2111">In [[rhetoric]], '''parechesis''' ({{Lang|grc|παρήχησις}}) is the repetition of the same sound in several words in close succession.&lt;ref&gt;Gert J. C. Jordaan -''Ancient Greek Inside Out: The Semantics of Grammatical Constructions - Guide for Exegetes and Students in Classical and New Testament Greek''  2013- Page 171 3643903537 "NT: 1.27 Parechesis (παρήχησις, likeness ofsound) 0 Definition: Parechesis is repetition of the same sound in successive words. It includes alliteration (repetition of the same consonant) and assonance (repetition of the same vowel).&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of a parechesis is: "He persuades the Pithian ({{Lang|grc|πείθει τὸν Πειθίαν}})."&lt;ref&gt;cf. Xen. ''Hist.'' 7.41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermogenes of Tarsus]] discusses parechesis in his work ''On the invention of arguments'' (Περὶ εὑρέσεως).&lt;ref&gt;Herm.

It is related to [[paronomasia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Historia Monachorum in Aegypto: Monastic Hagiography in ... 0191075817 Andrew Cain - 2016  "Three types of paronomasia are prevalent in the work: same root (verb) but different inflection;16 same root (verb) but different or added prefix;17 and same root but different derivatives.18 Parechesis is identical to paronomasia except that verbal resonance is achieved through the concurrence of words, similar in sound but dissimilar in sense, which are from different roots..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullinger, E. W. ''Figures of Speech Used in the Bible'' 1970  "In these cases, where the Paronomasia is in the Hebrew thought, it is called Parechesis so far as the Greek is concerned. And it is only when we go to the Hebrew thought that we can hear the Hebrew words sounding beside the Greek words."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24394">'''Predicate transformer semantics''' were introduced by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Edsger Dijkstra]] in his seminal paper "[[Guarded commands|Guarded commands, nondeterminacy and formal derivation of programs]]". They define the semantics of an [[imperative programming]] paradigm by assigning to each ''statement'' in this language a corresponding ''predicate transformer'': a [[total function]] between two ''[[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]]'' on the state space of the statement. In this sense, predicate transformer semantics are a kind of [[denotational semantics]]. Actually, in [[guarded commands]], Dijkstra uses only one kind of predicate transformer: the well-known '''weakest preconditions''' (see below).

Moreover, predicate transformer semantics are a reformulation of [[Floyd–Hoare logic]]. Whereas Hoare logic is presented as a [[deductive system]], predicate transformer semantics (either by '''weakest-preconditions''' or by '''strongest-postconditions''' see below) are '''complete strategies''' to build [[Deductive reasoning|valid deductions]] of Hoare logic. In other words, they provide an effective [[algorithm]] to reduce the problem of verifying a Hoare triple to the problem of proving a [[First-order logic|first-order formula]]. Technically, predicate transformer semantics perform a kind of [[symbolic execution]] of statements into predicates: execution runs ''backward'' in the case of weakest-preconditions, or runs ''forward'' in the case of strongest-postconditions.

== Weakest preconditions ==
=== Definition ===
Given a  ''statement'' ''S'', the '''weakest-precondition''' of ''S'' is a
function mapping any [[postcondition]] ''R'' to a [[precondition]] ''P''. Actually,  the result of this function, denoted &lt;math&gt;wp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt;, is the "weakest" precondition on the initial state ensuring that execution of ''S'' terminates in a final state satisfying ''R''.

More formally, let us use variable ''x'' to denote ''abusively'' the [[tuple]] of variables involved in statement ''S''. Then, a given ''Hoare triple'' &lt;math&gt;\{ P \} S \{ R \}&lt;/math&gt; is provable in [[Hoare logic]] for '''total correctness''' if and only if the first-order predicate below holds:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, P \Rightarrow wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, weakest-preconditions are defined recursively over the [[abstract syntax]] of statements. Actually, weakest-precondition semantics is a [[continuation-passing style]] semantics of state transformers where the predicate in parameter is a continuation.

=== Skip ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{skip},R) \ =\ R&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Abort ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{abort},R) \ =\ \textbf{false}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Assignment ===
We give below two equivalent weakest-preconditions for the assignment statement. In these formulas, &lt;math&gt;R[x \leftarrow E]&lt;/math&gt; is a copy of ''R'' where [[Free variables and bound variables|free occurrences]] of ''x'' are replaced by ''E''. Hence, here, expression ''E'' is implicitly coerced into a ''valid term'' of the underlying logic: it is thus a ''pure'' expression, totally defined, terminating and without side effect. 
* version 1:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; wp(x := E, R)\ =\ \forall y, y = E \Rightarrow R[x \leftarrow y]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''y'' is a fresh variable (representing the final value of variable ''x'')
|} 
* version 2:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; wp(x := E, R)\ =\ R[x \leftarrow E] &lt;/math&gt; 
|}

The first version avoids a potential duplication of ''E'' in ''R'', whereas the second version is simpler when there is at most a single occurrence of ''x'' in ''R''. The first version also reveals a deep duality between weakest-precondition and strongest-postcondition (see below).

An example of a valid calculation of ''wp'' (using version 2) for assignments with integer valued variable ''x'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
wp(x := x - 5, x &gt; 10) &amp; = &amp; x - 5 &gt; 10 \\
                       &amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; x &gt; 15 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that in order for the postcondition ''x &gt; 10'' to be true after the assignment, the precondition ''x &gt; 15'' must be true before the assignment.  This is also the "weakest precondition", in that it is the "weakest" restriction on the value of ''x'' which makes ''x &gt; 10'' true after the assignment.

=== Sequence ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(S_1;S_2,R)\ =\ wp(S_1,wp(S_2,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[t]{rcl} wp(x:=x-5;x:=x*2\ ,\ x&gt;20) &amp; = &amp; wp(x:=x-5,wp(x:=x*2, x &gt; 20))\\ 
  &amp; = &amp; wp(x:=x-5,x*2 &gt; 20)\\
  &amp; = &amp; (x-5)*2 &gt; 20\\
  &amp; = &amp; x &gt; 15
  \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conditional ===
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{if}\ E\ \textbf{then}\ S_1\ \textbf{else}\ S_2\ \textbf{end},R)\ =\ (E \Rightarrow wp(S_1,R)) \wedge (\neg E \Rightarrow wp(S_2,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[t]{rcl} 
wp(\textbf{if}\ x &lt; y\ \textbf{then}\ x:=y\ \textbf{else}\;\;\textbf{skip}\;\;\textbf{end},\ x \geq y)
&amp; = &amp; (x &lt; y \Rightarrow wp(x:=y,x\geq y))\ \wedge\ (\neg (x&lt;y) \Rightarrow wp(\textbf{skip}, x \geq y))\\
&amp; = &amp; (x &lt; y \Rightarrow y\geq y) \ \wedge\ (\neg (x&lt;y) \Rightarrow x \geq y)\\
&amp; \Leftrightarrow &amp; \textbf{true}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

=== While loop ===
==== Partial Correctness ====
Ignoring termination for a moment, we can define the rule for the ''weakest liberal precondition'', denoted ''wlp'', using a predicate ''I'', called the [[loop invariant]], typically supplied by the programmer:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wlp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)\ =\ 
            \begin{array}[t]{l} 
            I\\ 
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((E \wedge I) \Rightarrow wlp(S,I))[x \leftarrow y]\\
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((\neg E \wedge I) \Rightarrow R)[x \leftarrow y]
          \end{array}
 &lt;/math&gt; 
|}

This simply states that (1) the invariant must hold at the start of the loop; (2) additionally,  for any initial state ''y'', the invariant and guard taken together be strong enough to establish the weakest precondition necessary for the loop body to be able to re-establish the invariant; (3) finally, if and when the loop terminates in a given state ''y'', the fact that the loop guard is false along with the invariant should be able to establish the required postcondition.

==== Total Correctness ====
To show total correctness, we also have to show that the loop terminates. For this we define a [[well-founded relation]] on the state space denoted "&lt;" and called [[loop variant]]. Hence, we have:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)\ =\ 
           \begin{array}[t]{l} 
            I\\ 
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((E \wedge I) \Rightarrow wp(S,I \wedge x &lt; y))[x \leftarrow y]\\
            \wedge\ \forall y, ((\neg E \wedge I) \Rightarrow R)[x \leftarrow y]
          \end{array}&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''y'' is a fresh tuple of variables
|}
Informally, in the above conjunction of three formulas: 
* the first one means that invariant ''I'' must initially hold;
* the second one means that the body of the loop (e.g. statement ''S'') must preserve the invariant and decrease the variant: here, variable ''y'' represents the initial state of the body execution;
* the last one means that ''R'' must be established at the end of the loop: here, variable ''y'' represents the final state of the loop.

In predicate transformers semantics, ''invariant'' and ''variant'' are built by mimicking the [[Kleene fixed-point theorem]]. Below, this construction is sketched in [[set theory]]. We assume that ''U'' is a set denoting the state space. First, we define a family of subsets of ''U'' denoted &lt;math&gt;(A_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; by induction over [[natural number]] ''k''. Informally &lt;math&gt;A_k&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of initial states that makes ''R'' satisfied after less than ''k'' iterations of the loop: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
A_0 &amp; = &amp; \emptyset \\
A_{k+1} &amp; = &amp; \left\{\ y \in U\ | \ ((E \Rightarrow wp(S, x \in A_k)) \wedge (\neg E \Rightarrow R))[x \leftarrow y]\ \right\} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we define: 
* invariant ''I'' as the predicate &lt;math&gt;\exists k, x \in A_k&lt;/math&gt;.
* variant &lt;math&gt;y &lt; z&lt;/math&gt; as the proposition &lt;math&gt;\exists i, y \in A_i \wedge (\forall j, z \in A_j \Rightarrow i &lt; j)&lt;/math&gt;

With these definitions, &lt;math&gt;wp(\textbf{while}\ E\ \textbf{do}\ S\ \textbf{done}, R)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to formula &lt;math&gt;\exists k, x \in A_k&lt;/math&gt;.

However, in practice, such an abstract construction cannot be handled efficiently by theorem provers. Hence, loop invariants and variants are provided by human users, or are inferred by some [[abstract interpretation]] procedure.

=== Non-deterministic guarded commands ===
Actually, Dijkstra's [[Guarded Command Language]] (GCL) is an extension of the simple imperative language given until here with non-deterministic statements. Indeed, GCL aims to be a formal notation to define algorithms. Non-deterministic statements represent choices left to the actual implementation (in an effective programming language): properties proved on non-deterministic statements are ensured for all possible choices of implementation. In other words, weakest-preconditions of non-deterministic statements ensure
* that there exists a terminating execution (e.g. there exists an implementation),
* and, that the final state of all terminating execution satisfies the postcondition.

Notice that the definitions of weakest-precondition given above (in particular for '''while-loop''') preserve this property.

==== Selection ====
Selection is a generalization of '''if''' statement:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(\mathbf{if}\ E_1 \rightarrow S_1 \ [\!] \ \ldots\ [\!]\ E_n \rightarrow S_n\ \mathbf{fi}, R)\ = \begin{array}[t]{l}
    (E_1 \vee \ldots \vee E_n) \\
    \wedge\ (E_1 \Rightarrow wp(S_1,R)) \\
    \ldots\\
    \wedge\ (E_n \Rightarrow wp(S_n,R)) \\
    \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here, when two guards &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_j&lt;/math&gt; are simultaneously true, then execution of this statement can run any of the associated statement &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Repetition ====
Repetition is a generalization of '''while''' statement in a similar way.

=== Specification statement (or weakest-precondition of procedure call) ===
[[Refinement calculus]] extends non-deterministic statements with the notion of ''specification statement''. Informally, this statement represents a procedure call in black box, where the body of the procedure is not known. Typically, using a syntax close to [[B-Method]], a '''specification statement''' is written 
:&lt;math&gt;P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y&lt;/math&gt;
where
* ''x'' is the global variable modified by the statement,
* ''P'' is a predicate representing the precondition,
* ''y'' is a fresh logical variable, bound in ''Q'', that represents the new value of ''x'' non-deterministically chosen by the statement,
* ''Q'' is a predicate representing a postcondition, or more exactly a guard: in ''Q'', variable ''x'' represents the initial state and ''y'' denotes the final state.

The weakest-precondition of '''specification statement''' is given by:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;wp(P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y\ ,\ R)\ =\ P \wedge \forall z, Q[y \leftarrow z] \Rightarrow R[x \leftarrow z]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''z'' is a fresh name
|}

Moreover, a statement ''S'' '''implements''' such a specification statement if and only if the following predicate is a tautology:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;\forall x_0, (P \Rightarrow wp(S,Q[x \leftarrow x_0][y \leftarrow x]))[x \leftarrow x_0]&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is a fresh name (denoting the initial state)
|}

Indeed, in such a case, the following property is ensured for all postcondition ''R'' (this is a direct consequence of ''wp'' monotonicity, see below):
:&lt;math&gt;wp(P\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ Q \rightarrow x:=y\ ,\ R) \Rightarrow wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt;

Informally, this last property ensures that any proof about some statement involving a specification remains valid 
when replacing this specification by any of its implementations.

== Other predicate transformers ==
=== Weakest liberal precondition  {{anchor|Weakest liberal precondition}} ===
An important variant of the weakest precondition is the '''weakest liberal precondition''' 
&lt;math&gt;wlp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt;, which yields the weakest condition under which ''S'' either does not terminate or establishes ''R''. It therefore differs from ''wp'' in not guaranteeing termination. Hence it corresponds to [[Hoare logic]] in partial correctness: for the statement language given above, ''wlp'' differs with ''wp'' only on '''while-loop''', in not requiring a variant (see above).

=== Strongest postcondition ===
Given ''S'' a statement and ''R'' a [[precondition]] (a predicate on the initial state), then
&lt;math&gt;sp(S, R)&lt;/math&gt; is their '''strongest-postcondition''': it implies any postcondition satisfied by the final state of any execution of S, 
for any initial state statisfying R. In other words, a Hoare triple &lt;math&gt;\{ P \} S \{ Q \}&lt;/math&gt; is provable in Hoare logic if and only if the predicate below hold:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x, sp(S,P) \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
Usually, '''strongest-postconditions''' are used in partial correctness.
Hence, we have the following relation between weakest-liberal-preconditions and strongest-postconditions: 
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x, P \Rightarrow wlp(S,Q)) \ \Leftrightarrow\ (\forall x, sp(S,P) \Rightarrow Q)&lt;/math&gt;

For example, on assignment we have:
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt; sp(x := E, R)\ =\ \exists y, x=E[x \leftarrow y] \wedge R[x \leftarrow y]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''y'' is fresh
|}

Above, the logical variable ''y'' represents the initial value of variable ''x''.
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt; sp(x := x - 5, x &gt; 15)\ =\ \exists y, x = y - 5 \wedge y &gt; 15 \ \Leftrightarrow \ x &gt; 10&lt;/math&gt;

On sequence, it appears that ''sp'' runs forward (whereas ''wp'' runs backward):
{| style="background-color:#eeeeff;" border="1" cellpadding="10"
|&lt;math&gt;sp(S_1;S_2\ ,\ R)\ =\ sp(S_2,sp(S_1,R))&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Win and sin predicate transformers ===
[[Leslie Lamport]] has suggested ''win'' and ''sin'' as ''predicate transformers''  for [[concurrent programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Leslie Lamport |first=Leslie  |last=Lamport |title=''win'' and ''sin'': Predicate Transformers for Concurrency |journal=[[TOPLAS|ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst.]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=396–428 |date=July 1990 |doi=10.1145/78969.78970 |url=http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-win}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Predicate transformers properties ==
This section presents some characteristic properties of predicate transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ralph-Johan |last=Back |first2=Joakim |last2=Wright |title=Refinement Calculus: A Systematic Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAEMCAAAQBAJ |origyear=1978 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4612-1674-2 |series=Texts in Computer Science |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below, ''T'' denotes a predicate transformer (a function between two predicates on the state space) and ''P'' a predicate. For instance, ''T(P)'' may denote ''wp(S,P)'' or ''sp(S,P)''. We keep ''x'' as the variable of the state space.

=== Monotonic ===
Predicate transformers of interest (''wp'', ''wlp'', and ''sp'') are [[monotonic]]. A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''monotonic''' if and only if:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x, P \Rightarrow Q) \Rightarrow (\forall x, T(P) \Rightarrow T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This property is related to the [[Hoare logic#Consequence rule|consequence rule of Hoare logic]].

=== Strict ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''strict''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{false})\ \Leftrightarrow\ \mathbf{false}&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, ''wp'' is strict, whereas ''wlp'' is generally not. In particular, if statement ''S'' may not terminate then
&lt;math&gt;wlp(S,\mathbf{false})&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. We have
:&lt;math&gt;wlp(\mathbf{while}\ \mathbf{true}\ \mathbf{do}\ \mathbf{skip}\ \mathbf{done}, \mathbf{false}) \ \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{true}&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, '''true''' is a valid invariant of that loop.

=== Terminating ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''terminating''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{true})\ \Leftrightarrow\ \mathbf{true}&lt;/math&gt;

Actually, this terminology makes sense only for strict predicate transformers: indeed, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,\mathbf{true})&lt;/math&gt; is the weakest-precondition ensuring termination of ''S''.

It seems that naming this property '''non-aborting''' would be more appropriate: in total correctness, non-termination is abortion, whereas in partial correctness, it is not.

=== Conjunctive ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''conjunctive''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(P \wedge Q)\ \Leftrightarrow\ (T(P) \wedge T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for &lt;math&gt;wp(S,.)&lt;/math&gt;, even if statement ''S'' is non-deterministic as a selection statement or a specification statement.

=== Disjunctive ===
A predicate transformer ''T'' is '''disjunctive''' iff:
:&lt;math&gt;T(P \vee Q)\ \Leftrightarrow\ (T(P) \vee T(Q))&lt;/math&gt;

This is generally not the case of &lt;math&gt;wp(S,.)&lt;/math&gt; when ''S'' is non-deterministic. Indeed, let us consider a non-deterministic statement ''S'' choosing an arbitrary boolean. This statement is given here as the following ''selection statement'':
:&lt;math&gt;S\ =\ \mathbf{if}\ \mathbf{true} \rightarrow x:=0\  [\!]\  \mathbf{true} \rightarrow x:=1\ \mathbf{fi}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,R)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the formula &lt;math&gt;R[x \leftarrow 0] \wedge R[x \leftarrow 1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;wp(S,\ x=0 \vee x=1)&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the ''tautology'' &lt;math&gt;(0=0 \vee 0=1) \wedge (1=0 \vee 1=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Whereas, the formula &lt;math&gt;wp(S, x=0) \vee wp(S,x=1)&lt;/math&gt;
reduces to the ''wrong proposition'' &lt;math&gt;(0=0 \wedge 1=0) \vee (1=0 \wedge 1=1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The same counter-example can be reproduced using a ''specification statement'' (see above) instead:
:&lt;math&gt;S\ =\ \mathbf{true}\ |&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;@&lt;math&gt;y.\ y \in \{ 0, 1 \} \rightarrow x:=y&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
* Computations of weakest-preconditions are largely used to statically check [[Assertion (computing)|assertions in programs]] using a theorem-prover (like [[satisfiability modulo theories|SMT-solvers]] or [[Interactive theorem proving|proof assistants]]): see [[Frama-C]] or [[ESC/Java|ESC/Java2]].
* Unlike many other semantic formalisms, predicate transformer semantics was not designed as an investigation into foundations of computation.  Rather, it was intended to provide programmers with a methodology to develop their programs as "correct by construction" in a "calculation style".  This "top-down" style was advocated by Dijkstra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Edsger W. |last=Dijkstra |title=A Constructive Approach to the Problem of Program Correctness |journal=BIT Numerical Mathematics |volume=8 |pages=174–186 |year=1968 |doi= 10.1007/bf01933419}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Niklaus Wirth|N. Wirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Niklaus Wirth |first=N. |last=Wirth |title=Program development by stepwise refinement |journal=Comm. ACM |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=221–7 |date=April 1971 |doi=10.1145/362575.362577 |url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:3026/eth-3026-01.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been formalized further by [[Ralph-Johan Back|R.-J. Back]] and others in the [[refinement calculus]]. Some tools like [[B-Method]] now provide  [[automated reasoning]] in order to promote this methodology.
* In the meta-theory of [[Hoare logic]], weakest-preconditions appear as a key notion in the proof of [[Gödel's completeness theorem|relative completeness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coq.inria.fr/V8.2pl1/contribs/HoareTut.hoarelogicsemantics.html Tutorial on Hoare Logic]: a [[Coq]] library, giving a simple but formal proof that [[Hoare logic]] is sound and complete with respect to an [[operational semantics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beyond predicate transformers ==
=== Weakest-preconditions and strongest-postconditions of imperative expressions ===
In predicate transformers semantics, expressions are restricted to terms of the logic (see above). However, this restriction seems too strong for most existing programming languages, where expressions may have side effects (call to a function having a side effect), may not terminate or abort (like ''division by zero''). There are many proposals to extend weakest-preconditions or strongest-postconditions for imperative expression languages and in particular for [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]].

Among them, ''Hoare Type Theory'' combines [[Hoare logic]] for a [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]-like language, [[separation logic]] and [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Aleksandar |last=Nanevski |first2=Greg |last2=Morrisett |first3=Lars |last3=Birkedal |title=Hoare Type Theory, Polymorphism and Separation |journal=Journal of Functional Programming |volume=18 |issue=5-6 |pages=865–911 |date=September 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0956796808006953 |url=http://ynot.cs.harvard.edu/papers/jfpsep07.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This system is currently implemented as a [[Coq]] library called '''Ynot'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ynot.cs.harvard.edu/ Ynot] a [[Coq]] library implementing Hoare Type Theory.&lt;/ref&gt; In this language, [[Evaluation strategy|evaluation of expressions]] corresponds to computations of ''strongest-postconditions''.

=== Probabilistic Predicate Transformers ===
''Probabilistic Predicate Transformers'' are an extension of predicate transformers for [[Randomized algorithm|probabilistic programs]].
Indeed, such programs have many applications in [[cryptography]] (hiding of information using some randomized noise), 
[[distributed systems]] (symmetry breaking).

'''Remote recording''', also known as '''location recording''', is the act of making a high-quality complex audio recording of a live concert performance, or any other location recording that uses [[multitrack recording]] techniques outside of a [[recording studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DulVm8t88QkC&amp;pg=PA328 |page=328 |title=The Audio Dictionary |last1=White |first1=Glenn D. |last2=Louie |first2=Gary J. |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-295-98498-8 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multitrack recording is then carefully [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]], and the finished result is called a remote recording or a [[live album]]. This is in contrast to a [[field recording]] which uses few microphones, recorded onto the same number of channels as the intended product. Remote recording is not the same as [[remote broadcast]] for which multiple microphones are mixed live and broadcast during the performance, typically to stereo. Remote recording and remote broadcast may be carried out simultaneously by the same crew using the same microphones.

One important benefit of a remote recording is that the performers will respond to the audience; they will not be as distracted by the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EojbvPF_8AC&amp;pg=PR17 |page=17 |last1=Bartlett |first1=Bruce |last2=Bartlett |first2=Jenny |title=Recording music on location: capturing the live performance |publisher=Focal Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-240-80891-6 |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for a remote recording is to capture an artist in a different [[acoustic space]] such as a church, ballroom or meeting hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00m1SlorUcIC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292 |last=Eargle |first=John |authorlink=John M. Eargle |title=Handbook of Recording Engineering |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2005 |isbn=0-387-28470-2 |edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make a remote recording, studio-quality recording equipment is trucked to the concert venue and connected to the concert [[microphone]]s with a bank of [[microphone splitter]]s. Other microphones may be added. The individual microphone signals are routed to separate tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlXjv13MGbMC&amp;pg=PA26 |page=26 |title=The Working Drummer |last=Van Horn |first=Rick |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=1997 |isbn=0-7935-7358-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remote recording is often made using a specially built '''remote truck''': a rolling recording studio carrying a [[mixing console]], [[studio monitor]]s and multitrack recorders. Beginning modestly in 1958, [[recording engineer]] [[Wally Heider]] developed and popularized the use of a remote truck in California in the mid-1960s and throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SyQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT90 |page=90 |title=High Tech Times In The World's Recording Mecca |last=McCullaugh |first=Jim |date=November 15, 1980 |work=Billboard |volume=92 |number=46 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Remote recording developed out of the practice of making [[field recording]]s with high-quality equipment. The earliest such recordings were crude, undertaken in the 1920s and 1930s, beginning with [[Ralph Peer]] in 1923. Peer carried a disc-cutting machine and recorded musicians directly to disc. From 1941 [[Alan Lomax]] became known for the field recordings he made of the various musical traditions carried to or created in the United States. In the 1950s, advances in microphones, mixers and tape recorders allowed more sophisticated equipment to be carried to a concert location, including more microphones, tape recorders with more tracks, and possibly a [[mixing console]] to mix multiple microphones down to fewer recorded tracks.

Not all remote recordings were well received by the public. For instance, in 1963 [[Chess Records]] hauled their monaural tape recorder to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]], to capture the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] weekend concerts including [[Bo Diddley]]'s electrifying performance in front of 2,000 excited fans. The resulting album, ''[[Bo Diddley's Beach Party]]'', did not sell well in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h6ZM112WU-8C&amp;pg=PA77 |page=77 |last=Bonomo |first=Joe |title=Jerry Lee Lewis: Lost and Found |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2009 |isbn=0-8264-2966-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, American recording engineer [[Wally Heider]] mounted recording equipment in a truck, reportedly the first to do so. The next year, engineer [[Reice Hamel]] did the same. Both men used new techniques, bringing many microphones to a concert and mixing the performance as it happened—in the manner of a remote broadcast—recording onto stereo tape recorders for release as stereo and mono records. Hamel's first truck grew from simple to more complex in the first seven years. He started with stereo, obtained a three-track machine on which he taped a [[Barbra Streisand]] concert, then in 1965 he configured the truck as a complete recording studio. In 1966 he installed a four-track machine, then moved to eight-track, and by 1971 was recording on sixteen tracks.&lt;ref name=Billboard1971&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 |page=4 |last=Glassenberg |first=Bob |title=Studio Track |date=July 31, 1971 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=83 |number=31 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Heider's recordings became hits or critical successes. One of them is the classic album [[Live in Concert (Ray Charles album)|''Live in Concert'']] by [[Ray Charles]], captured in 1964 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o552g5xRRiwC&amp;pg=PA132 |page=132 |title=All music guide to soul: the definitive guide to R&amp;B and soul |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2003 |isbn=0-87930-744-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heider recorded the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sr3PK27zG9EC&amp;pg=PA28 |page=28 |last=Brant |first=Marty |title=Join together: forty years of the rock music festival |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=0-87930-926-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Live_At_Monterey.html |title=Live At Monterey |publisher=AlbumLinerNotes.com |accessdate=July 17, 2011 |quote=Recorded on Wally Heider's 8-Track Remote using 3M analog tape.

After that, other recording studios assembled their own remote recording trucks and more concerts were saved on multitrack tapes. The [[Woodstock Festival]] was recorded on 12-track by a remote truck and then mixed at the [[Record Plant]] studio in New York.&lt;ref name=Billboard2009&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCUF-Ml_lBYC&amp;pg=PT22 |page=22 |last=Waddell |first=Ray |title=Peace and Prosperity: How A Three-Day Festival Became A Four-Decade Business |date=August 8, 2009 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |volume=121 |number=31 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1971, the Record Plant used its first remote truck to make its first remote recording, [[The Concert for Bangladesh]] held at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=Goggin1988&gt;{{cite journal |work=[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]] |title=The Record Plant at 20 |year=1988 |last=Goggin |first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the concert, Record Plant co-founder [[Chris Stone (entrepreneur)|Chris Stone]] said that remote recording had several key advantages to studio recording: "It is really not as expensive as studio time when one considers that the concert is two hours long, perhaps twice a night for two days. It is a spontaneous music that is recorded live. This makes it more flavorable {{sic}}. And it is usually easier on the musician, who gets paid for the concert and gets the recording done for his next LP at the same time. Everyone wins."&lt;ref name=Billboard1971/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6042">'''Resupination''' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''resupinus'', meaning "bent back
with the face upward" or "on the back".&lt;ref name="RWB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Roland Wilbur|title=The Composition of Scientific Words|date=1956|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page=478}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[wikt:Resupination|Resupination]]" is the [[wikt:noun|noun]] form of the [[wikt:adjective|adjective]] "resupine" which means "being upside-down, supine or facing upward".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language, College Edition'' 1964, The World Publishing Company, Cleveland and New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "resupinate" is generally only used in a [[Botany|botanical]] context - in everyday language, "supine" has a similar meaning.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web|title=supine|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/supine|publisher=Merriam-Webster dictionary|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Bruce (ed.)|title=The Australian Oxford Dictionary|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne, Vic|isbn=0195507932|page=1348|edition=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In botany, resupination refers to the "twisting"  of flowers or leaves through about 180° as they open. Resupinate leaves have the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] or "stalk" twisted - respuinate flowers twist as they open.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Arthur W.|title=Resupination Studies of Flowers and Leaves|journal=Annals of Botany|date=1939|volume=3|issue=4|pages=871–887|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== Alstroemeriaceae === 
Plants in the [[genus]] ''[[Alstroemeria]]'' have more or less resupinate leaves.&lt;ref name="burwur"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resupination|url=http://www.burwur.net/sinns/3resupe.htm|publisher=Sinningia and Friends|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orchidaceae ===
The flower of a typical plant in the orchid [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Orchidaceae]] has three [[sepal]]s and three [[petal]]s. One petal, called the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]], "lip" or "tongue", is typically quite different from the other two. It usually functions to attract an insect pollinator. As an orchid flower bud develops, the attachment of the lip to the axis of the flower is above (or [[wikt:adaxial|adaxial]] to) that of the other two petals. In many orchid [[genus|genera]], as the flower opens, it twists so that the attachment of the "lip" is below that of the other two petals, the three sepals and the sexual parts of the flower known as the [[Column (botany)|column]]. Orchid flowers that undergo this twist are called "resupinate" - those that do not are "non-resupinate".&lt;ref name="Ames"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ames|first1=Oakes|title=Resupination as a diagnostic character in the Orchidaceae with special reference to ''Malaxis monophyllos''|journal=Botanical Museum leaflets, Harvard University|date=1938|volume=6|issue=8|pages=145–183|jstor=41762701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZNOG"&gt;{{cite web|last1=St George|first1=Ian|title=Resupination|url=https://www.nativeorchids.co.nz/Journals/102/page4.htm|publisher=New Zealand Native Orchid Group|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milligan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milligan|first1=Brian|title=Resupination|url=http://www.oscov.asn.au/articles2/respun.htm|publisher=Orchid Societies Council of Victoria Inc.|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CANBR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower resupination|url=http://keys.trin.org.au/key-server/data/08090a09-0d0e-410b-860c-020705070e0e/media/Html/characters/Flower_resupination.htm|publisher=Australian Tropical Rainforest Orchids|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Charles Darwin]] did not use the term "resupination", he suggested that having the labellum on the lower part of the flower aids [[pollination]] by providing a landing place for visiting insects. However, the [[South America]]n bee ''[[Euglossa cordata]]'' pollinates both resupinate and non-resupinate orchid flowers. It has also been suggested that resupination exposes the labellum to sunlight, emphasizing patterns and nectar guides and increases the temperature and thus the vaporisation of floral scents.&lt;ref name="Arditti"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arditti|first1=Joseph|title=Resupination|journal=Lankesteriana|date=2003|volume=3|issue=2|pages=95–96|doi=10.15517/lank.v3i2.23025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Australian genera with non-resupinate flowers are ''[[Prasophyllum]]'', ''[[Cryptostylis]]'' and ''[[Caleana]]''.&lt;ref name="Milligan" /&gt;

[[Image:Gray 111 - Vertebral column.png|thumb|100px&lt;!--Way too tall unless this # is small--&gt;|right|[[Vertebrate]]s have a segmented vertebral column.]]

'''Segmentation''' in biology is the division of some [[animal]] and [[plant]] [[body plan]]s into a series of repetitive segments. This article focuses on the segmentation of [[animal]] body plans, specifically using the examples of the taxa [[Arthropoda]], [[Chordata]], and [[Annelida]]. These three groups form segments by using a "growth zone" to direct and define the segments. While all three have a generally segmented body plan and use a growth zone, they use different mechanisms for generating this patterning. Even within these groups, different organisms have different mechanisms for segmenting the body. Segmentation of the body plan is important for allowing free movement and development of certain body parts. It also allows for regeneration in specific individuals.

== Definition ==

Segmentation is a difficult process to satisfactorily define. Many taxa (for instance the molluscs) have some form of serial repetition in their units, but are not conventionally thought of as segmented. Segmented animals are those considered to have organs that were repeated, or to have a body composed of self-similar units, but usually it is the parts of an organism that are referred to as being segmented.&lt;ref name="Budd2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G. E. | title = Why are arthropods segmented? | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142X.2001.01041.x | journal = Evolution and Development | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 332–42 | year = 2001 | pmid = 
11710765| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
[[File:Illacme plenipes female with 170 segments and 662 legs (SPC000931) - ZooKeys-241-077-g006.jpeg|thumb|''[[Illacme plenipes]]'', a [[millipede]] with 170 segments and 662 legs]]
Segmentation in animals typically falls into three types, characteristic of different [[arthropods]], [[vertebrates]], and [[annelids]]. Arthropods such as the [[Drosophila|fruit fly]] form segments from a field of equivalent cells based on [[transcription factor]] gradients. Vertebrates like the [[zebrafish]] use oscillating [[gene expression]] to define segments known as [[somites]]. Annelids such as the [[leech]] use smaller [[blast cell]]s budded off from large [[teloblast]] cells to define segments.&lt;ref name = tautz&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz, D | title = Segmentation | journal = Dev Cell | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 301–312 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15363406 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2004.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arthropods===
[[File:Arthropod segment Hox gene expression.svg|thumb|Expression of [[Hox gene]]s in the body segments of different groups of [[arthropod]], as traced by [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. The Hox genes 7, 8, and 9 correspond in these groups but are shifted (by [[heterochrony]]) by up to three segments. Segments with maxillopeds have Hox gene 7. Fossil [[trilobite]]s probably had three body regions, each with a unique combination of Hox genes.]]

Although ''[[Drosophila]]'' segmentation is not representative of the [[arthropod]] phylum in general, it is the most highly studied. Early screens to identify genes involved in cuticle development led to the discovery of a class of genes that was necessary for proper segmentation of the ''Drosophila'' embryo.&lt;ref name = pick&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pick, L | title = Segmentation: Painting Stripes From Flies to Vertebrates | journal = Dev Genet | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9706689 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6408(1998)23:1&lt;1::AID-DVG1&gt;3.0.CO;2-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To properly segment the ''Drosophila'' embryo, the [[anterior]]-[[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] axis is defined by maternally supplied transcripts giving rise to gradients of these proteins.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = pick /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peel AD |author2=Chipman AD |author3=Akam M | title = Arthropod Segmentation: Beyond The Drosophila Paradigm | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 905–916 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16341071 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1724}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gradient then defines the expression pattern for [[gap gene]]s, which set up the boundaries between the different segments. The gradients produced from gap gene expression then define the expression pattern for the [[pair-rule gene]]s.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt;&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; The pair-rule genes are mostly [[transcription factor]]s, expressed in regular stripes down the length of the embryo.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt; These transcription factors then regulate the expression of [[segment polarity gene]]s, which define the polarity of each segment. Boundaries and identities of each segment are later defined.&lt;ref name = peel /&gt;

Within the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are segmented, as are the appendages (when they are present). Some of these elements (e.g. musculature) are not segmented in their sister taxon, the [[onychophora]].&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Annelids: Leech===

While not as well studied as in ''[[Drosophila]]'' and [[zebrafish]], segmentation in the [[leech]] has been described as “budding” segmentation. Early divisions within the leech embryo result in teloblast cells, which are stem cells that divide asymmetrically to create bandlets of blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Furthermore, there are five different teloblast lineages (N, M, O, P, and Q), with one set for each side of the midline. The N and Q lineages contribute two blast cells for each segment, while the M, O, and P lineages only contribute one cell per segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Weisblat DA |author2=Shankland M | title = Cell lineage and segmentation in the leech | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci | volume = 312 | issue = 1153 | pages = 39–56 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2869529 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1985.0176|bibcode = 1985RSPTB.312...39W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the number of segments within the embryo is defined by the number of divisions and blast cells.&lt;ref name = tautz /&gt; Segmentation appears to be regulated by the gene [[Hedgehog (gene)|Hedgehog]], suggesting its common evolutionary origin in the ancestor of arthropods and annelids.&lt;ref name=Dray2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Dray | first1 = N.| last2 = Tessmar-Raible | first2 = K.| last3 = Le Gouar | first3 = M.| last4 = Vibert | first4 = L.| last5 = Christodoulou | first5 = F.| last6 = Schipany | first6 = K.| last7 = Guillou | first7 = A.| last8 = Zantke | first8 = J.| last9 = Snyman | first9 = H.| last10 = Béhague | first10 = J.| last11 = Vervoort | first11 = M.| last12 = Arendt | first12 = D.| last13 = Balavoine | first13 = G.| title = Hedgehog signaling regulates segment formation in the annelid Platynereis| journal = Science| volume = 329| issue = 5989| pages = 339–342| year = 2010| pmid = 20647470| doi = 10.1126/science.1188913|bibcode = 2010Sci...329..339D | pmc=3182550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the annelids, as with the arthropods, the body wall, nervous system, kidneys, muscles and body cavity are generally segmented. However, this is not true for all of the traits all of the time: many lack segmentation in the body wall, coelom and musculature.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

===Chordates: Zebrafish===
[[Image:Zebrafish Somitogenesis.png|thumb|left|[[Zebrafish]] form segments known as [[somites]] through a process that is reliant upon gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]], as well as periodic oscillation of gene expression.]]

Although perhaps not as well studied as ''[[Drosophila]]'', segmentation in [[zebrafish]] is actively studied. The process is similar in zebrafish and other [[chordates]], such as the [[chicken]] and the [[mouse]]. Segmentation in chordates is characterized as the formation of a pair of [[somites]] on either side of the midline. This is often referred to as [[somitogenesis]].

In the zebrafish, segmentation is coordinated by the [[clock and wavefront model]]. The "clock" refers to the periodic oscillation of specific genes, such as Her1, a hairy/Enhancer of split- gene. Expression starts at the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] end of the embryo and moves towards the [[anterior]]. The wavefront is where the somites mature, defined by gradients of [[retinoic acid]] and [[Fibroblast growth factor|FGF]]. Retinoic acid is high in the anterior and FGF is high in the posterior; the wavefront is the point at which both concentrations are at their lowest. Cells at this point will mature and form a pair of somites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cinquin O | title = Understanding the somitogenesis clock: what's missing? | journal = Mech Dev | volume = 124 | issue = 7-8 | pages = 501–517 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17643270 | doi = 10.1016/j.mod.2007.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaboration of this process with other signalling chemicals allows for structures such as muscles to span the basic segments.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Other taxa ===

In other taxa, there is some evidence of segmentation in some organs, but this segmentation is not pervasive to the full list of organs mentioned above for arthropods and annelids. One might think of the serially repeated units in many [[Cycloneuralia]], or the segmented body armature of the chitons (which is not accompanied by a segmented coelom).&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

== Origin ==
Segmentation can be seen as originating in two ways. To caricature, the 'amplification' pathway would involve a single-segment ancestral organism becoming segmented by repeating itself. This seems implausible, and the 'parcellization' framework is generally preferred – where existing organization of organ systems is 'formalized' from loosely defined packets into more rigid segments.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt; As such, organisms with a loosely defined metamerism, whether internal (as some molluscs) or external (as onychophora), can be seen as 'precursors' to eusegmented organisms such as annelids or arthropods.&lt;ref name="Budd2001" /&gt;

Since quality is likely to vary among patches of habitat, it is important to consider how a low quality patch might affect a population.  In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat.  One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population.  However, if the excess of [[individual]]s produced in the source frequently moves to the sink, the sink population can persist indefinitely.  Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat.  However, [[ecological traps|ecological trap]] theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]].  Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches may be more important to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform [[conservation ethic|conservation]] decisions.

==Theory development==
Although the seeds of a source-sink model had been planted earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Holt, R. D. 1985. Population-Dynamics in 2-Patch Environments - Some Anomalous Consequences of an Optimal Habitat Distribution. [[Theoretical Population Biology]] 28:181-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"&gt;Pulliam, H. R. 1988. Sources, sinks, and population regulation. [[American Naturalist]] 132:652-661.&lt;/ref&gt; is often recognized as the first to present a fully developed source-sink model.  He defined source and sink patches in terms of their demographic parameters, or [[Matrix population models|BIDE rates]] ([[birth]], [[immigration]], [[death]], and [[emigration]] rates).  In the source patch, birth rates were greater than death rates, causing the population to grow.  The excess individuals were expected to leave the patch, so that emigration rates were greater than immigration rates.  In other words, sources were a net exporter of individuals.  In contrast, in a sink patch, death rates were greater than birth rates, resulting in a population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated from the source patch.  Immigration rates were expected to be greater than emigration rates, so that sinks were a net importer of individuals.  As a result, there would be a net flow of individuals from the source to the sink [[#table1|(see Table 1)]].

Pulliam's work was followed by many others who developed and tested the source-sink model.  Watkinson and Sutherland&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"&gt;Watkinson, A. R., and W. J. Sutherland. 1995. Sources, sinks and pseudo-sinks. [[Journal of Animal Ecology]] 64:126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a phenomenon in which high immigration rates could cause a patch to appear to be a sink by raising the patch's population above its [[carrying capacity]] (the number of individuals it can support).  However, in the absence of immigration, the patches are able to support a smaller population.  Since true sinks cannot support any population, the authors called these patches "pseudo-sinks". Definitively distinguishing between true sinks and pseudo-sinks requires cutting off immigration to the patch in question and determining whether the patch is still able to maintain a population.  Thomas et al.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"&gt;Thomas, C. D., M. C. Singer, and D. A. Boughton. 1996. Catastrophic extinction of population sources in a butterfly metapopulation. [[American Naturalist]] 148:957-975.&lt;/ref&gt; were able to do just that, taking advantage of an unseasonable frost that killed off the host plants for a source population of [[list of subspecies of Euphydryas editha|Edith's checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha''). Without the host plants, the supply of immigrants to other nearby patches was cut off.  Although these patches had appeared to be sinks, they did not become extinct without the constant supply of immigrants.  They were capable of sustaining a smaller population, suggesting that they were in fact pseudo-sinks.

Watkinson and Sutherland's&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"/&gt; caution about identifying pseudo-sinks was followed by Dias,&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"&gt;Dias, P. C. 1996. Sources and sinks in population biology. [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] 11:326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that differentiating between sources and sinks themselves may be difficult.  She asserted that a long-term study of the demographic parameters of the populations in each patch is necessary.  Otherwise, temporary variations in those parameters, perhaps due to climate fluctuations or natural disasters, may result in a misclassification of the patches.  For example, Johnson&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2004. Source-sink dynamics in a temporally, heterogeneous environment. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 85:2037-2045.&lt;/ref&gt; described periodic flooding of a river in [[Costa Rica]] which completely inundated patches of the host plant for a rolled-leaf beetle (''Cephaloleia fenestrata'').  During the floods, these patches became sinks, but at other times they were no different from other patches.  If researchers had not considered what happened during the floods, they would not have understood the full complexity of the system.

Dias&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"/&gt; also argued that an inversion between source and sink habitat is possible so that the sinks may actually become the sources.  Because reproduction in source patches is much higher than in sink patches, natural selection is generally expected to favor adaptations to the source habitat.  However, if the proportion of source to sink habitat changes so that sink habitat becomes much more available, organisms may begin to adapt to it instead.  Once adapted, the sink may become a source habitat.  This is believed to have occurred for the [[blue tit]] (''Parus caeruleus'') 7500 years ago as forest composition on [[Corsica]] changed, but few modern examples are known.  Boughton&lt;ref name="Boughton-1999"&gt;Boughton, D. A. 1999. Empirical Evidence for Complex Source-Sink Dynamics with Alternative States in a Butterfly Metapopulation. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 80:2727-2739.&lt;/ref&gt; described a source—pseudo-sink inversion in butterfly populations of ''E. editha''.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"/&gt;  Following the frost, the butterflies had difficulty recolonizing the former source patches.  Boughton found that the host plants in the former sources senesced much earlier than in the former pseudo-sink patches.  As a result, immigrants regularly arrived too late to successfully reproduce.  He found that the former pseudo-sinks had become sources, and the former sources had become true sinks.

One of the most recent additions to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al.,&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"&gt;Tittler, R., L. Fahrig, and M. A. Villard. 2006. Evidence of large-scale source-sink dynamics and long-distance dispersal among wood thrush populations. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:3029-3036.&lt;/ref&gt; who examined [[wood thrush]] (''Hylocichla mustelina'') survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale.  The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and in the sink.  Using data from the [[Breeding Bird Survey]], an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag.  They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80&amp;nbsp;km apart.  Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source.  In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1).  The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.

One of the more confusing issues involves identifying sources and sinks in the field.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"&gt;Runge, J. P., M. C. Runge and J. D. Nichols. 2006. The role of local populations within a landscape context:defining and classifying sources and sinks. [[American Naturalist]] 167:925-938.&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; point out that in general researchers need to estimate per capita reproduction, probability of survival, and probability of emigration to differentiate source and sink habitats.  If emigration is ignored, then individuals that emigrate may be treated as mortalities, thus causing sources to be classified as sinks.  This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management.  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices&lt;ref name="Caswell-2001"&gt;Caswell, H. 2001. Matrix population models: Construction, analysis, and interpretation. 2nd edition.  Sinauer. Sunderland, Mass., USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and ecological statistics&lt;ref name="Williams-2001"&gt;Williams, B. K., J. D. Nichols, and M. J. Conroy. 2001. Analysis and management of animal populations.  Academic Press. San Diego, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to differentiate sources and sinks.

|''Habitat patches are represented in terms of their (1) inherent abilities to maintain a population (in the absence of immigration), (2) their attractiveness to organisms that are actively dispersing and choosing habitat patches, and (3) whether they are net exporters or importers of dispersing individuals.  Note that in all of these systems, source patches are capable of supporting stable or growing populations and are net exporters of individuals.  The major difference between them is that in the ecological trap model, the source patch is avoided (or at least not preferred to the low quality trap patch).  All of the low quality patches (whether sinks, pseudo-sinks, or traps) are net importers of dispersing individuals, and in the absence of dispersal, would show a population decline.  However, pseudo-sinks would not decline to extinction as they are capable of supporting a smaller population.  The other major difference between these low quality patch types is in their attractiveness; sink populations are avoided while trap patches are preferred (or at least not avoided).''

==Modes of dispersal==
Why would individuals ever leave high quality source habitat for a low quality sink habitat? This question is central to source-sink theory.  Ultimately, it depends on the organisms and the way they move and distribute themselves between habitat patches. For example, plants disperse passively, relying on other agents such as wind or water currents to move seeds to another patch. Passive dispersal can result in source-sink dynamics whenever the seeds land in a patch that cannot support the plant's growth or reproduction. Winds may continually deposit seeds there, maintaining a population even though the plants themselves do not successfully reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A. 1982. Population Ecology on an Environmental Gradient - Cakile-Edentula on a Sand Dune. [[Oecologia]] 52:348-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Another good example for this case are soil protists. Soil protists also disperse passively, relying mainly on wind to colonize other sites.&lt;ref&gt;Foissner, W. 1987. Soil protozoa: fundamental problems, ecological significance, adaptations in ciliates and testaceans, bioindicators, and guide to the literature. [[Progress in Protistology]] 2:69-212.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, source-sink dynamics can arise simply because external agents dispersed protist propagules (e.g., cysts, spores), forcing individuals to grow in a poor habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, L. D. 2015. Source-sink dynamics shapes the spatial distribution of soil protists in an arid shrubland of northern Chile. [[Journal of Arid Environments]] 113:121-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, many organisms that disperse actively should have no reason to remain in a sink patch,&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"&gt;Diffendorfer, J. E. 1998. Testing models of source-sink dynamics and balanced dispersal. [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 81:417-433.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the organisms are able to recognize it as a poor quality patch (see discussion of [[ecological traps]]).  The reasoning behind this argument is that organisms are often expected to behave according to the "[[ideal free distribution]]", which describes a population in which individuals distribute themselves evenly among habitat patches according to how many individuals the patch can support.&lt;ref&gt;Fretwell, S. D., and H. L. Lucas, Jr. 1969. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. [[Acta Biotheoretica]] 19:16-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  When there are patches of varying quality available, the ideal free distribution predicts a pattern of "balanced dispersal".&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this model, when the preferred habitat patch becomes crowded enough that the average [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] (survival rate or reproductive success) of the individuals in the patch drops below the average fitness in a second, lower quality patch, individuals are expected to move to the second patch.  However, as soon as the second patch becomes sufficiently crowded, individuals are expected to move back to the first patch.  Eventually, the patches should become balanced so that the average fitness of the individuals in each patch and the rates of dispersal between the two patches are even.  In this balanced dispersal model, the probability of leaving a patch is inversely proportional to the carrying capacity of the patch.&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this case, individuals should not remain in sink habitat for very long, where the carrying capacity is zero and the probability of leaving is therefore very high.

An alternative to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site.  This alternative has been called the "ideal preemptive distribution", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Pulliam, H. R., and B. J. Danielson. 1991. Sources, Sinks, and Habitat Selection - a Landscape Perspective on Population-Dynamics. [[American Naturalist]] 137:S50-S66.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be in the sink.  As the subordinate, younger individuals age, they may be able to take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move to the sink.  Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely.  Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites in the sink are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides in the sink.

==Importance in ecology==
The source-sink model of population dynamics has made contributions to many areas in ecology.  For example, a species' [[ecological niche|niche]] was originally described as the environmental factors required by a species to carry out its life history, and a species was expected to be found only in areas that met these niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Grinnell-1917"&gt;Grinnell, J. 1917. The Niche-Relationships of the California Thrasher. [[The Auk]] 34:427-433.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept of a niche was later termed the "fundamental niche", and described as all of the places a species could successfully occupy.  In contrast, the "realized niche", was described as all of the places a species actually did occupy, and was expected to be less than the extent of the fundamental niche as a result of competition with other species.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E. 1957. Concluding remarks. Cold Spring Harbor Symposium [[Quantitative Biology]] 22:415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the source-sink model demonstrated that the majority of a population could occupy a sink which, by definition, did not meet the niche requirements of the species,&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; and was therefore outside the fundamental niche (see Figure 2).  In this case, the realized niche was actually larger than the fundamental niche, and ideas about how to define a species' niche had to change.

Source–sink dynamics has also been incorporated into studies of [[metapopulation]]s, a group of populations residing in patches of habitat.  Though some patches may go extinct, the regional persistence of the metapopulation depends on the ability of patches to be re-colonized.  As long as there are source patches present for successful reproduction, sink patches may allow the total number of individuals in the metapopulation to grow beyond what the source could support, providing a reserve of individuals available for re-colonization.&lt;ref name="Howe-1991"&gt;Howe, R. W., G. J. Davis, and V. Mosca. 1991. The Demographic Significance of Sink Populations. [[Biological Conservation]] 57:239-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Source–sink dynamics also has implications for studies of the coexistence of species within habitat patches.  Because a patch that is a source for one species may be a sink for another, coexistence may actually depend on immigration from a second patch rather than the interactions between the two species.&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt;  Similarly, source-sink dynamics may influence the regional coexistence and demographics of species within a [[metacommunity]], a group of communities connected by the dispersal of potentially interacting species.&lt;ref&gt;Leibold, M. A., M. Holyoak, J. M. Chase, M. F. Hoopes, R. D. Holt, J. B. Shurin, R. Law, D. Tilman, M. Loreau, and A. Gonzalez. 2004. The metacommunity concept: a framework for multi-scale community ecology. [[Ecology Letters]] 7:601-613.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the source-sink model has greatly influenced [[ecological traps|ecological trap theory]], a model in which organisms prefer sink habitat over source habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, B. A., and R. L. Hutto. 2006. A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:1075-1085.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Land managers and conservationists have become increasingly interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned.  As a result, it is important to understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change.  Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat,&lt;ref name=lamb16&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2016 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements.  Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat.  Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there.  Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances.&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"/&gt;  Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction.  For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.

In considering where to place [[nature reserves|reserves]], protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if the cause of a sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert current sink patches to source patches (e.g. [[no-take zones]]).&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"&gt;Roberts, C. M. 1998. Sources, sinks, and the design of marine reserve networks. [[Fisheries (journal)|Fisheries]] 23:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Derek E.|last2=Bolger|first2=Douglas T.|date=2017-05-05|title=Movements and source–sink dynamics of a Masai giraffe metapopulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|issn=1438-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others.  Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not be in the future as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change.  Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;  While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;

In [[respiratory physiology]], '''specific ventilation''' is defined as the ratio of the volume of gas entering a region of the lung (ΔV) following an inspiration, divided by the end-expiratory volume (V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) of that same lung region:

SV = {{frac|ΔV|V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}

It is a dimensionless quantity. For the whole human lung, given an indicative [[tidal volume]] of 0.6 L and a [[functional residual capacity]] of 2.5 L, average SV is of the order of 0.24.

The distribution of specific ventilation within the lung can be inferred using Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) experiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://jap.physiology.org/content/44/3/416.abstract?sid=d898c725-6248-486d-9103-1e7f3984a37d  Lewis et al], S. M. Lewis, J. W. Evans, and A. A. Jalowayski. Continuous distributions of specific ventilation recovered from inert gas washout, Journal of Applied Physiology, 1978 vol. 44 no. 3 416-423&lt;/ref&gt; or imaging techniques such as [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET) using &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) using either hyperpolarized gas (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[Helium|He]], &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;[[Xenon|Xe]]) or proton MRI (oxygen enhanced imaging).

A '''substance of very high concern''' ('''SVHC''') is a [[chemical substance]] (or part of a group of chemical substances) for which it has been proposed that the use within the [[European Union]] be subject to authorisation under the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_396/l_39620061230en00010849.pdf Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L396, 30.12.2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–849.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, listing of a substance as an SVHC by the [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) is the first step in the procedure for restriction of use of a chemical. The first list of SVHCs was published on 28 October 2008 and the list has been updated many times to include new candidates. The most recent update occurred on 27 June 2018 to include a total 191 SVHC.&lt;ref name="echa.europa.eu"&gt;[http://echa.europa.eu/en/candidate-list-table Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

*it is [[carcinogen]]ic;
*it is [[mutagen]]ic;
*it is [[Reproductive toxicity|toxic for reproduction]];
*it is [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent]], [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulative]] and toxic according to the criteria set out in Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation&lt;ref name="AnnexXIII"&gt;Annex XIII, REACH Regulation, at pp. 383–85.&lt;/ref&gt; (PBT substances);
*there is "scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of [[Worry|concern]]"; such substances are identified on a case-by-case basis.

The "equivalent concern" criterion is significant because it is this classification which allows substances which are, for example, [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic]], [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] or otherwise present an unanticipated environmental health risk to be regulated under REACH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Chemicals Agency|title=Proposals to identify Substances of Very High Concern current consultations|url=http://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/proposals-to-identify-substances-of-very-high-concern|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply because a substance meets one or more of the criteria does not necessarily mean that it will be proposed as an SVHC. Many such substances are already subject to restrictions on their use within the European Union, such as those in Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Annex XVII, REACH Regulation, at pp. 395–849.&lt;/ref&gt; SVHCs are substances for which the current restrictions on use (where these exist) might be insufficient. There are three priority groups for assessment:&lt;ref name="Art58-3"&gt;Article 58.3, REACH Regulation, at p. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
*PBT substances and vPvB substances;
*substances which are widely dispersed during use;
*substances which are used in large quantities.

==Procedure for listing==
Proposals for inclusion of a substance on the list of SVHCs can come either from the [[European Commission]] or one of the Member States of the European Union. The proposals are made public by the [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) and are open for public comment for 60–90 days. If the substance is deemed to meet one or more of the criteria, it is then listed as an SVHC.&lt;ref&gt;Article 59, REACH Regulation, at pp. 146–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a substance has been listed as an SVHC, the Agency commissions a technical report from one or more national or private laboratories, which analyses the available information on manufacture, imports, uses and releases of the substance, as well as possible alternatives. On the basis of this technical report, the Agency decides whether to prioritise the substance, in effect, whether to make a recommendation to the European Commission to add the substance to Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation, making its use subject to authorisation. The draft recommendations must be made public and opened for comment for three months before the final recommendations are sent to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Article 58, REACH Regulation, at pp. 143–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft recommendations were published on 14 January 2009, and new draft recommendations must be issued at least once every two years.

==Consequences of listing==
The list of SVHCs is primarily a public list of substances for which the European Chemicals Agency is considering imposing a requirement for authorisation for some or all uses. However, there are some direct consequences of including a substance on the list of SVHCs. Suppliers of pure SVHCs must provide their customers with a [[safety data sheet]] (SDS).&lt;ref&gt;Article 31.1, REACH Regulation, at p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppliers of mixtures of substances which contain more than 0.1% by weight of any SVHC must provide their customers with a safety data sheet ''on request''.&lt;ref&gt;Article 31.3, REACH Regulation, at p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers or importers of articles containing more than 0.1% by weight of any SVHC must provide their customers, and consumers on request, with adequate information on the safe use and disposal of the article, including the name of the SVHC(s) concerned.&lt;ref name="Art7"&gt;Article 7, REACH Regulation, at pp. 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1 June 2011, manufacturers and importers of articles also have to notify the European Chemicals Agency of the quantities of SVHCs used in their articles.&lt;ref name="Art7" /&gt;

In addition to the obviously involved chemical industry, there are many more industries affected by this regulation: drapery and leather industry, plastic processing, cosmetic industry, food industry, petroleum processing, printing industry, sports equipment industry, toys industry, recycling industry, electrical engineering industry, fine mechanics industry, optics industry, engine and plant production industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/media/corporate/industrial_service/REACH_Compliance_Services_TUV_Rheinland.pdf |title= REACH Compliance. Made Easy.|publisher=TÜV Rheinland|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Candidate list of substances of very high concern ==
The following substances are included on the candidate list of substance of very high concern. This list is updated at regular intervals by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), with the first substances listed on 28 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Decision ED/67/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, [[European Chemicals Agency|ECHA]] updated the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) for Authorization by including 13 new substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/previous-recommendations;jsessionid=6CCE0A7F5C99D839BB8705B9069FEB56.live1 |title= Previous recommendations|publisher= [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA)|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 13 newly added SVHCs on June 18, 2012, four of them ([[Colour Index International|C.I.]] [[Basic Violet 3]], C.I. [[Basic Blue 26]], C.I. [[Solvent Blue 4]] and 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)-4'-(methylamino)trityl alcohol) are identified as SVHC only if the presence of the carcinogenic constituents [[Michler's ketone]] or [[Michler's base]] is ≥ 0.1% w/w. Therefore, all the proposed substances are [[carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic for reproduction]] (CMR substances; [[H-phrases]] H340, H341, H350, H351, H360, H361),&lt;ref&gt;Bouwman, Yvonne; Fenton-May, V'Iain; Le Brun, Paul (2015). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s_FrCgAAQBAJ Practical Pharmaceutics: An International Guideline for the Preparation, Care and Use of Medicinal Products]''. Springer.  pp. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; which may pose serious effects on human beings. The most recent update is from July 27, 2018, find the complete list in references.&lt;ref&gt;https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table&lt;/ref&gt;

To sell or use these [[Chemical substance|substances]], manufacturers, importers and users in the [[European Union]] (EU) need to apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]].

This list is referred to as the "candidate" list because all substances placed on it are candidates for inclusion in Annex XIV of REACH. If a substance is added to Annex XIV, it is given a "latest application date" and a "sunset date". The sunset date is the date after which the substance cannot be used or imported into the EU without authorisation from the ECHA, and the latest application date is the date by which any applications for use must be submitted to the ECHA.&lt;ref name="echa.europa.eu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''System of systems engineering''' ('''SoSE''') is a set of developing processes, tools, and methods for designing, re-designing and deploying solutions to [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] challenges.

== Overview ==
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains.  SoSE is more than [[systems engineering]] of monolithic, [[complexity|complex systems]] because design for System-of-Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, "Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem," 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10–13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements.

System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program.  SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for [[System of systems|System-of-Systems]] problems.

Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering.  One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

==History==
The Teylers Museum was originally opened in 1784 as a museum of science and arts. During the course of the next few decades the number of natural history objects grew, and under [[Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda|J.G.S. van Breda]] the Paleontological collection grew with the purchase of various collections based on his in-depth knowledge and personal network. [[Tiberius Winkler]] began the task of cataloguing, and was thus able to sort the collection into more or less important objects, and to display these, the idea of a new museum slowly gained ground with the directors.

The '''triangle of auscultation of the lungs''' is a relative thinning of the musculature of the back, situated along the medial border of the [[scapula]].

== Boundaries ==
It has the following boundaries:

* Superiorly and medially, by the inferior portion of the trapezius
* Inferiorly, by the [[latissimus dorsi]]
* Laterally, by the medial border of the scapula

The superficial floor of the triangle is formed by the lateral portion of the [[erector spinae]] muscles. Deep to these muscles are the osseous portions of the  6th and 7th ribs and the internal and external intercostal muscles.

==Function==
Due to the relative thinning of the musculature of the back in the triangle, the posterior thoracic wall is closer to the skin surface, making respiratory sounds able to be heard more clearly with a stethoscope.

Typically, the triangle of auscultation is covered by the [[scapula]]. To better expose the floor of the triangle up of the posterior thoracic wall in the 6th and 7th intercostal space, a patient is asked to fold their arms across their chest, laterally rotating the scapulae, while bending forward at the trunk, somewhat resembling a fetal position.

On the left side, the cardiac orifice of the stomach lies deep to the triangle, and in days before X-rays were discovered the sound of swallowed liquids were auscultated over this triangle to confirm an oesophageal tumour

The '''School of Mathematics and Statistics''' is a constituent body of the [[Sydney Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was established in its present form in 1991.

As of December 2010, the Head of School is Professor Neville Weber and the Deputy Head of School is Associate Professor David Easdown.&lt;ref name="about_school"&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magma computer algebra system]] is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the School.

==History==
Mathematics has been taught at the University since its establishment. The first Professor of Mathematics was [[Morris Birkbeck Pell|Morris Pell]], one of the University's three foundation professors. Pell gave the first lecture in mathematics on 13 October 1852, two days after the University's inauguration, to all 24 students at the time. At least two years of mathematics were still required of all the University's students at the time of Pell's retirement in 1877.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School of Mathematics and Statistics was established on 1 January 1991 with the merging of the departments of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, and Mathematical Statistics.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School is located in the Carslaw Building, which was completed in the early 1960s, and is named after mathematician [[Horatio Scott Carslaw|Horatio Carslaw]] (1870-1954), who was once Professor of Mathematics at the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/Carslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wiel Arets''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈʋil ˈaːrəts}}, born {{Birth date|1955|05|06|df=y}}) is a Dutch [[architect]], [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], [[urbanist]], [[industrial designer]] and the former [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the College of Architecture at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]], in the [[United States of America]]. Arets was previously the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany, and studied at the [[Eindhoven University|Technical University of Eindhoven]], graduating in 1983.One year later he founded [[Wiel Arets Architects]], a multidisciplinary [[architecture]] and [[design]] studio (moved to Maatrich in 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mchmaster.com/faculty/wiel-arets/|title=Wiel Arets|website=www.mchmaster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays with offices located throughout [[Europe]]. From 1995-2002 he was the Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] in [[Rotterdam]], where he introduced the idea of 'progressive-research' and co-founded the school's architectural journal named ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Life and career==
Wiel Arets was born on 6 May 1955 in [[Heerlen]], [[Netherlands]] to Wiel Arets (1929) and Mia Heuts (1931). His father was a book printer and his mother was a [[fashion designer]], both from whom he learned respect for the tradition of [[craft]] and a love of books and reading.&lt;ref name=STILLS&gt;{{cite book

  | date= December 2010 |isbn=978 90 6450 764 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He briefly studied [[engineering]], and then [[physics]], before ultimately deciding on architecture. He divides his time between [[Chicago]], [[Maastricht]], [[Berlin]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Zürich]], living and working in each city. He is married and has two children. Arets' work is generally characterized by a [[minimalist]], geometric and austere approach that responds to local contingencies in a flexible way, with Arets explaining: &lt;blockquote&gt;'We want our buildings to fit into the existing context, yet remain flexible and open to change'.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. "AA Files No. 21". Architectural Association London, 1991, pp.16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his studies at the Technical University of Eindhoven (TU/e) Arets became fascinated by the works and words of [[Paul Valéry]], [[Giorgio Grassi]] and Cesare Cattaneo, quickly developing his admiration for 'the dialogue' as an operative method, best exemplified by [[Paul Valéry|Valéry's]] 'Eupalinos' and Cattaneo's 'Giovanni e Giuseppe'.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; While studying Arets co-founded the architectural journal ''Wiederhall'' and organized a series  of visiting lecturers at the TU/e that included the architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Tadao Ando]] and [[Peter Eisenmann]], among others. Subsequently, Arets organized the first European exhibition of [[Tadao Ando|Tadao Ando's]] work.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; It was during this period that Arets 'rediscovered' the work of Dutch architect [[Frits Peutz]], who transformed the city of Heerlen from an industrial coal mining hub and into a modern city through his many built commissions funded by the [[coal]] industry, most recognizably the [[Glaspaleis]]. With the decline of industry the city lost most of its status as an industrial area in [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] and Frits Peutz faded from architectural prominence.

As a student Arets undertook extensive research in the archives of Peutz's office, eventually producing the monograph 'F.P.J Peutz Architekt 1916-1966' (1981) and an accompanying traveling exhibition.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; After graduating from the TU/e in 1983 Arets travelled extensively throughout Russia, the United States and Japan. While in Japan Arets visited and interviewed several prominent architects including [[Fumihiko Maki]], [[Kazuo Shinohara]], [[Itsuko Hasegawa]] and [[Tadao Ando]], later publishing these interviews and articles in the Dutch architecture magazine ''de Architect''.&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt; Arets first garnered international architectural attention with the completion of the [[Academie Beeldende Kunsten Maastricht|Maastricht Academy of Art and Architecture]] in 1993, described by [[Kenneth Frampton]] as: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Revitalizing an existing institution within the old urban core in such a way as to transform both the institution and the urban fabric...All of this was achieved without abandoning for the moment the minimalist expression of an architecture degree zero, derived in part from [[Sol LeWitt]] and in part from [[Tadao Ando]].'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Utrecht University library.jpg|thumb|{{Interlanguage link multi|Utrecht University Library|nl|3=Universiteitsbibliotheek Utrecht}}]]
In 2004 Arets completed the [[library]] of [[Utrecht University]], situated in the [[Uithof]] area of the campus designed by [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]] which dictated a strict orthogonal requirement for all buildings. The library's exterior glazing is screen printed with an image of bamboo shoots created by the photographer [[Kim Zwarts]], returning as a tactile imprinted surface pattern on the library's interior prefabricated concrete panel walls, which are painted black. This 'tactility' has since returned to more of Arets' projects in the form of imprinted-concrete or screen printed glass exteriors.&lt;ref name=LivingLibrary/&gt; [[Kazuyo Sejima]] of [[SANAA]] remarks of the library:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The building is fascinating in many ways, but most of all I feel some warm humanism from it. Within its crisp black envelope Wiel Arets has carved out an arsenal of different spaces&amp;nbsp;– some low, some high, some wide, some spacious, some compressed, some bright, some dark. This is a building that would never appear dull. It offers a moment for everyone.'&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2011 Arets' studio won an international competition to design the IJhal at [[Amsterdam Centraal railway station|Amsterdam Centraal Station]], part of the city's plan to revitalize the waterfront by reconnecting it to the river [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Theoretical position==
In 1991 Arets published his first theoretical text, 'An Alabaster Skin', in a monograph of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Arets, Wiel. ''An Alabaster Skin''. 010 Publishers, 1991, pp. 5-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The text merged Arets' fascinations of his studies and early career, including: [[cinematography]], [[photography]], the '[[city]]', technology of the 20th century, the membrane or [[skin]] of a building, [[biology]] and the act of [[cutting]] and [[editing]] (in regards to cinematography), as well as the [[Postmodern architecture]] of the 1980s. [[Greg Lynn]] interprets the piece as so:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'A precedent for this [[alabaster]] [[urbanism]] is [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill|Skidmore Owings and Merrill’s]] [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Library]] at [[Yale University]] that utilizes an alabaster curtain wall that breaks down the boundary between the interior and exterior without transparency. Light is admitted from the outside during the day and the interior emanates a glowing light at night. The polished surface of the blank curtain wall reflects the adjacent buildings while allowing permeability. Likewise, in Arets’ work there is the stealth of a [[chameleon]].'&lt;ref name="autogenerated40"&gt;Lynn, Greg.

Arets was Dean of the [[Berlage Institute]] from 1995-2002 where he changed the school to a research based institute focusing on 'progressive-research', public lectures, publications, field trips, and intensive debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlage-institute.nl/persons/wiel_arets |title=Wiel Arets / Persons / The Berlage |publisher=Berlage-institute.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that position he was and is a professor or guest professor at many architecture schools, mostly within [[Europe]] and the United States, and was until 2012 the 'Professor of Building Planning and Design' at the [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (UdK), Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.udk-berlin.de/arets ] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the UdK 'Tokyo Utopia/TOUT',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mastercollectivehousing.com/tag/wiel-arets/ |title=Wiel Arets - Master of Architecture MCH |publisher=Mastercollectivehousing.com |date=2014-04-13 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Arets' research theme, and he has previously used other research themes, such 'Double Dutch', to structure output and debate while teaching; they often return to give content and context to publications such as ''HUNCH''.&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the importance of such a 'progressive-research' based theme Arets states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'That's why, when I became Dean, I changed the name to the [[Berlage Institute|Berlage Institute Laboratory for Architecture]], I wanted to invite people to come do their research alongside students and to publish their work with the studios. The research, the production of the students, the publication, the seminars, the field trips, the lectures that were happening&amp;nbsp;– all had to be part of one thing. I think laboratory simply means you have a theme, and you collectively do investigations and research. And then, at the end of the year, you have a result, which is presented in the school's publication, ''HUNCH'', which was originally edited by [[Jennifer Sigler]]. This was, and still is, not just a publication of only student work; rather, ''HUNCH'' was where we also published the work of guest lecturers, the important research of the trips, and everything we thought belonged to the year theme.'&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotes==
*"Architecture is therefore a between, a membrane, an alabaster skin, a thing that is at once opaque and transparent... It can only become part of the world by entering into a marriage with its surroundings."&lt;ref name="autogenerated40"/&gt;

* On his line of Dot bathroom fittings for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]]: "We were very clear that we didn’t want to do something fashionable, we wanted it to still look new in ten years."&amp;nbsp;— ''[[Wallpaper*]]'', 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Design / 2 Oct 2007 / |url=http://www.wallpaper.com/interiors/wiel-arets-interview/1777 |title=Wiel Arets, 2007 |publisher=Wallpaper.com |date=2007-10-02 |accessdate=2014-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On his idea of the emerging global metropolis: "To understand the world we are living in at this moment, we have to redefine the 'Map of the world', a mental construct which at least since 1492 has undergone many reinperpretations. We could read the world anno 2020 as a collective living space for us all, in which all the continents are in reach within 288 minutes, and the maximum travel distance at each continent will be 72 minutes, the time in which every city on each continent will be able to be reached."&lt;ref name=STILLS/&gt;
*"Sometimes in spring there are beautiful trees that bloom, and suddenly, there are white blossoms everywhere. You don't look at one particular spot. And I personally think that's also true in architecture."&lt;ref&gt;McCarter, Robert. ''Wiel Arets: Autobiographical References''. Birkhäuser, 2012, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;
