'''Aniceto Lacson y Ledesma''' (April 17, 1857 in [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]], [[Iloilo]], [[Philippines]] – February 3, 1931 in [[Talisay City, Negros Occidental|Talisay]], [[Negros Occidental]], Philippines) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[revolutionary]] general, sugar baron, and  businessman.&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|476}}  He is notable for leading the [[Negros Revolution]] along with [[Juan Araneta]], and for being the President of the short-lived [[Republic of Negros]].

==Early life==
Lacson was the fifth son of seven children of Lucio Petronila Lacson and Clara Ledesma of Iloilo who migrated to [[Negros (island)|Negros]] when he was still young. His early education began under private tutelage in Molo, Iloilo. He later studied commerce at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]], where his classmates included future general and comrade [[Juan Araneta]], [[José Rizal]], and other [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] who later figured in the [[Philippine Revolution]].

While a student in [[Manila]], he had the opportunity to meet the founder of the [[Katipunan]], [[Andrés Bonifacio]], with whom he had a secret [[Blood Compact|blood compact]]. He was the only Negrense who had this honor and consequently became a member of the revolutionary society.

==Family==
[[File:Alacsonwife.jpg|thumb|Rosario Araneta, first wife of Aniceto Lacson]]
Aniceto first married Rosario Araneta, a direct descendant of the [[Kabungsuan]] royal family of [[Mindanao]], daughter of Patricio Cabunsol Araneta and Leoncia Araneta, with whom he sired eleven children. They were: 
# Jesusa, the eldest, married Jose Maria Arroyo y Pidal, her second cousin. Jesusa and Jose are the grandparents of Atty. [[Jose Miguel Arroyo]],husband of President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]];
# Emilio and
# Clotilde, both died at an early age;
# Carmen, married Ricardo Claparols, a Spaniard
# Enriqueta, married Domingo Lacson III, a first cousin;
# Isaac, who became governor of Negros, then congressman and senator of the Republic married Carmen Paterno;
# Mariano, married Lilia Montilla;
# Perfecta, married Santiago Franco;
# José, died young;
# Aniceto, Jr., married Aurora Lacson, a cousin; and
# Dominador, married Visitación Lacson, another cousin.

With his second wife, Magdalena Torres, he had 10 children. They were:
# Resurección, married Carlos Sackermann;
# Margarita, a former Miss Negros Occidental, married William Gemperle;
# Leonila, married Angel Gamboa;
# Leoncia, single born 6 December 1903  died 29 June 1981;
# Nicolas, married Amparo Lacson, sister of [[Arsenio Lacson]], Mayor of Manila, parents of the famous and controversial [[Rose Porteous]] of Perth, Australia;
# Juan, married Reymunda Villareal;
# José, married Estelita Adrias; had 6 sons- Aniceto, Jose Douglas, Rizal, William, Alex, Anthony.
# Lucio, a Marine Engineer married to Consuelo Flores; had 6 daughters -Jennifer Lacson Snyder, Christie Lacson Eccleston, Kathleen Lacson Griffith, Vivienne Lacson Pascual, Grace Lacson Hosseini, May Lacson.  He died in 1989.
# Luis, married Lily Distajo; had 8 daughters and 7 sons - Ma. Elena Lacson de Gracia( died at age 36), Ma. Luisa Lacson Marte, Ma. Carmen Lacson Escutin, Luis Distajo Lacson, 
Manuel Distajo Lacson, Sebastian 
Distajo Lacson, Ma. Corazon Lacson Mirasol, her twin sister Ma. Gloria Distajo Lacson died when she was only 3 months old, Ma. Rita Lacson, Ana Maria Distajo Lacson, 
Aniceto Miguel Distajo Lacson, Jacinto Distajo Lacson, and Ma. Asuncion Distajo Lacson who died at age 50 on Nov. 2, 2014.

# Consuelo, married Sebastian Corro.

==Properties==
When his father became bedridden, Lacson took charge of all the work in the [[hacienda]]s and did much to improve the properties. As a result, through his efforts his father became one of the richest men in Negros and the Philippines. When the time came to divide his father’s properties his other brothers chose the best haciendas. He, for his part, chose the uncultivated ones. Thus, he received more land from his father than his brothers. Through hard work, he improved all the land and turned it into one of the best producing haciendas in [[Negros Island|Negros]].

In the later 19th century, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] businessman by the name of Luchinger decided to sell his vast properties in Matabang, Talisay, which he earlier purchased from [[Nicholas Loney]], the biggest sugar cane producer in Negros at that time. It was offered to Aniceto Lacson, but he did not have enough ready cash. Luchinger was willing to sell it on installment but Aniceto’s father Lucio refused as the venture appeared risky. Aniceto negotiated with Luchinger to agree to sell it to him without guarantor. Knowing that Aniceto was hardworking, honest and followed through with his business commitments, Luchinger agreed.

His home in Talisay City, Negros Occidental is owned by his descendants the Claparols family.

==The Republic of Negros==
The Spanish Governor of Negros Island, Isidro Castro, surrendered to forces under Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta at Bacolod on 6 Nov. 1898.&lt;ref name=Foreman/&gt;{{rp|476}}  The Cantonal Republic of Negros was established with Aniceto Lacson as its President from November 27, 1898 until March 4, 1899 when the Negros revolutionaries surrendered to the [[United States of America|United States]] General [[James Francis Smith]]. The government lasted for three months and four days.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8637">'''Business tourism''' or '''business travel''' is a more limited and focused subset of regular [[tourism]].&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt; During business tourism (traveling), individuals are still working and being paid, but are doing so away from both their workplace and home.&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;

Some definitions of tourism exclude business travel.&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-118"/&gt; However, the [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) defines tourists as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".&lt;ref name="unwto1034"/&gt;

Primary business tourism activities include meetings, and attending conferences and exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt; Despite the term business in business tourism, when individuals from government or non-profit organizations engage in similar activities, this is still categorized as business tourism (travel).&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;

==Significance==
Historically, business tourism takes the form of traveling to, spending money and staying abroad, being away for some time, and has a history as long as that of [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-253"/&gt; In late 20th century, business tourism was seen as a major industry.&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-254"/&gt;

According to the 1998 data from the [[British Tourist Authority]] and [[National Tourist Boards]], business tourism accounted for about 14% of all trips to or within the UK, and 15% of the tourist market within the UK.&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-107"/&gt; A 2005 estimate suggested that those numbers for UK may be closer to 30%.&lt;ref name="RobinsonHeitmann2011"/&gt; Sharma (2004) cited a UNWTO estimated that business tourism accounts for 30% of international tourism, through its importance varies significantly between different countries.&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-253"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Compared to regular tourism, business tourism involves a smaller section of the population, with different motivations, and additional freedom-of-choice-limiting constraints imposed through the business aspects.&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-106"/&gt; Destinations of business tourism are much more likely to be areas significantly developed for business purposes (cities, industrial regions, etc.).&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-106"/&gt; An average business tourist is more wealthy than an average leisure tourist, and is expected to spend more money.&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-253"/&gt;

Business tourism can be divided into primary and secondary activities. Primary ones are [[business]] (work)-related, and included activities such as consultancy, inspections, and attending meetings. Secondary ones are related to tourism ([[leisure]]) and include activities such as dining out, recreation, shopping, sightseeing, meeting others for leisure activities, and so on.&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-118"/&gt;&lt;!-- citing  Chadwick, RA. (1994) 'Concepts, definitions and measures used in travel and tourism research', in R.B. Ritchie and CR. Goeldner (eds). Travel, Tourism and Hospitality Research, page range unknown --&gt; While the primary ones tend to be seen as more important, the secondary ones are nonetheless often described as "substantial".&lt;ref name="WeberChon2002-20"/&gt;

Business tourism can involve individual and small-group travel, and destinations can include small to larger meetings, including [[Convention (meeting)|conventions and conferences]], [[trade fair]]s, and [[exhibition]]s.&lt;ref name="Lennon2003-106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WeberChon2002-20"/&gt; In the US, about half of business tourism involves attending a large meeting of some kind.&lt;ref name="WeberChon2002-20"/&gt;

Most tourist facilities, such as airports, restaurants and hotels, are shared between leisure and business tourists, through a seasonal difference is often apparent (for example, business tourism may use those facilities during times less attractive for leisure tourists, such as when the weather conditions are less attractive).&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RobinsonHeitmann2011"/&gt;

Business tourism can be divided into:
* traditional business traveling, or meetings - intended for face-to-face meetings with business partners in different locations&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shamail2004-256" /&gt;
* incentive trips - a job perk, aimed at motivating employees (for example, approximately a third of UK companies use this strategy to motivate workers)&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-254"/&gt;
* conference and exhibition traveling - intended for attending large-scale meetings. In an estimated number of 14,000 conferences worldwide (for 1994), primary destinations are Paris, London, Madrid, Geneva, Brussels, Washington, New York, Sydney and Singapore&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma2004-255"/&gt;
The words meetings, incentive, conferences and exhibition in the context of business tourism are abbreviated as MICE.&lt;ref name="Robinson2012"/&gt;

'''CNNfn''' (fn = '''f'''inancial '''n'''ews) was an American [[cable television]] [[news]] network operated by the [[CNN]] subsidiary of the media conglomerate [[Time Warner]] from November 29, 1995, and of [[AOL-Time Warner]] until December 15, 2004. The network was dedicated to covering [[financial markets]] and business news, similar to [[CNBC]].

It was available in a number of markets, including the U.S. and Australia. In Canada, much of its content was aired on [[Business News Network|ROB TV]] (now BNN).

After years of struggling to attract an audience, Time Warner folded CNNfn in late 2004. On some U.S. cable television systems, its slot was given to [[CNN International]] on a full-time basis; previously, CNN International filled CNNfn's schedule in late nights and weekends. However, many cable companies ended their carriage of the channel and did not take CNN International.

The website CNNfn.com survives today as the [[CNNMoney.com]] website, a joint venture with Time Inc.'s [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] and [[Money (magazine)|''Money'']] magazines.

==Network history==
In 1995, [[Lou Dobbs]] and [[Ted Turner]] were having heated internal discussions about the direction of CNN. Dobbs was able to convince Turner that letting him start a new channel would be a way to solve both issues. Turner would keep Dobbs working for CNN while giving him his own network to run.

In July 1999, Dobbs quit CNNfn and started his own company, [[Space.com]], and eventually returned to CNN to host ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]''.

From the start, CNNfn struggled to be picked up by local and national cable operators. In 2004, the official CNNfn network was shut down. However the technologies invented in the early CNNfn days helped launch CNN and the entire broadcasting industry into a new digital era. The CNNfn.com website continued on, and in 2001 merged with ''[[Money (magazine)|Money Magazine]]'' to form CNNMoney.

==Schedule==
The schedule below is taken from the now-defunct site of CNNfn as at 2001 (only from Monday to 12 am on Friday).  All the times '''ET'''.

==Technological advances==
CNNfn inaugurated many innovations on TV and online.  Many of these helped the Internet and broadcasting industry become what they are today.  Just a few of these accomplishments include:
*The first fully digital studio in the world.  From the digital cameras to the production room and beyond, the CNNfn network was the first fully digital professional broadcasting studio. Unlike all other studios at the time, CNNfn could control all cameras with a single joystick. CNNfn claimed the joystick operator was a computer-trained worker, not a [[camera operator]]. To make this happen, CNNfn worked closely with [[Avid Systems]] in creating some of their own first generation broadcasting solutions. Additionally CNNfn and Avid Systems worked with [[Apple Computer]] to create a hacked version of the [[classic Mac OS|Mac operating system]] as no other system at that time could handle the throughput requirements of real-time digital video editing. Due to these advancements, CNNfn had many issues with [[labor unions]]. The unions claimed that the joystick operator should be worth four times as much as a normal camera operator and thus unionized workers should be paid accordingly.
*The first online stock quote engine. CNNfn worked with [[S&amp;P Comstock]] and [[Townsend (company)|Townsend]] to convert what was then a special direct connection to the stock market into a real-time data feed that could be used by the CNNfn.com website. Prior to this, [[ticker symbol]] lookups were typically reserved for private firms and not generally available.
*The first automated on-air [[News_ticker|stock ticker]]. Other broadcasters were showing a moving ticker, however the data from these were edited and typed by hand.  Therefore, the lag time in the data being displayed to a view was unpredictable. CNNfn was the first to automatically tap into the ticker feed and create an engine that would "auto-select" hot stocks and otherwise prioritize the display to show the most relevant stocks.
*The first with advertising campaign management. The online advertising market was just being invented while CNNfn's website was being launched.  Prior to CNNfn, the online advertising market primarily used weighting for [[ad rotation]]s. This would provide a specific advertiser a percentage of views for each page the ad was displayed. CNNfn worked with industry leader [[NetGravity]] to develop the first policy engine that would allow CNNfn.com to target advertisements based on user demographics.
*The first to utilize [[streaming media]] with broadcast video. At the time, [[RealNetworks]], VDONet, and [[VXtreme]] were startups in the streaming media space. No broadcaster saw the Internet as a viable way to reach their audience and they all believed their content to be too valuable to broadcast over the Internet for free. In late 1996, CNNfn.com published 1–2 hours of its programming each day within minutes after the actual show had aired on TV.
*The first to utilize [[Layer 7]] [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] to scale. At the time, [[round-robin DNS]] with weighted nodes to account for servers with more or less power or connectivity was the only way to scale a [[Server farm|web farm]]. CNNfn was working closely with [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] by also helping the write portions of their software which was incorporated into their 2.x product line. Round robin was not fast enough at taking a server out of rotation when Netscape would crash. Thus CNNfn worked with a few vendors to implement a Layer 7 solution that would instantly know when a server was up or down. This dramatically increased the speed and quality of the CNNfn and CNN websites.
*The first to fully automate publishing. By working with [[Lotus Software]], CNNfn was the first to use a database [[Front and back ends|back-end system]] to automate the work flow of a publishing system. At that time, even the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', another startup, used web masters to hand convert articles from the editors into [[HTML]] and to get them approved by hand through e-mail or visual confirmation from a manager. The web master would then post the story onto the website and edit the referring page to add a link to the new document. CNNfn worked with Lotus's [[Lotus Domino|Domino]] product to fully automate the draft, approval, and publishing of its articles.  The website was completely automated in re-writing its static home page with the latest stories.  As an industry first, this method was published in a few major magazines and studies by others.  Within months after its initial deployment, CNN revamped its own website's publishing methods and reduced its webmasters from 15 to 3.

In the summer of 1996 the top two technology members of Lou Dobb's team, Sam Edge and [[Nils Lahr]], threatened to quit CNNfn if changes were not made to allow them more creative control in implementing new technologies. Additionally, they wanted some level of credit and increased internal recognition through proposed promotions. Dobbs tried to keep these key members of the team at CNNfn by offering them higher wages and even went as far as to suggest that he would create an entire company dedicated to high-technology research in connection with [[Gartner]] such that the advancements that were made would become knowledge that could be sold to others. However Dobbs was unable to make this happen quickly inside of CNN as there was resistance from Turner and others. In late 1996, Edge moved to CNN in [[Atlanta Georgia Temple|Atlanta, Georgia]], and Lahr left to join the startup [[VXtreme]] (which was later purchased by [[Microsoft]] and became what is now the [[Windows Media]]). Dobbs made a last-ditch attempt to keep Nils inside CNN by attempting to sue him, claiming there were "important" and "unfinished" duties that required his attention at CNNfn. The lawsuit, however, was thrown out and Lahr was allowed to leave. Shortly after Dobbs quit CNNfn and as promised started his own company Space.com.

The '''Cambridge Science Park''',  founded by [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[[#BPGCSE]]&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest [[science park]] in the United Kingdom. It is a concentration of science and technology related businesses, and has strong links with the nearby [[University of Cambridge]].

The science park is situated about 3&amp;nbsp;km to the north of [[Cambridge]] city centre, by junction 33 of the [[A14 road (Great Britain)|A14]], in the parish of [[Milton, Cambridgeshire|Milton]], contiguous with Cambridge itself. The park is served by [[Cambridge North railway station]] and by the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]. It is directly adjacent to [[St John's Innovation Centre]] and [[Cambridge Business Park]].

==History==

The land was originally given to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] when the latter was founded by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1546. The land was used for farming until the [[Second World War]], when it was requisitioned by the [[US Army]] and used to prepare vehicles and tanks for [[D-Day]]. After the war, the land was left derelict until 1970, when, at the suggestion of [[Tony Cornell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Ghostbuster-who-had-the-spirit-to-persevere.htm|title=Ghostbuster who had the spirit to persevere|publisher=Cambridge Evening News|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=24 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322082346/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/Ghostbuster-who-had-the-spirit-to-persevere.htm|archivedate=22 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and under the supervision of [[John Bradfield (scientist)|Sir John Bradfield]], the college worked with Sir Francis Pemberton of [[Bidwells]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Great-man-Sir-Francis-dies-at-95-04112011.htm|title='Great man' Sir Francis dies at 95|publisher=Cambridge Evening News|date=6 November 2011|accessdate=21 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201174558/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Great-man-Sir-Francis-dies-at-95-04112011.htm|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop it into a new centre for scientific enterprise and innovation.

In 2017, following decades of rapid expansion in Cambridge, the park appointed its first director and announced a large investment intended to improve facilities and reduce traffic congestion.&lt;ref name="ci"/&gt;

==Cambridge Fun Run==

The Cambridge Fun Run is a charity race for [[Children in Need]] organised and mainly entered by employees of businesses based in and around the Science Park.

'''Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward''' (November 10, 1890 in [[Altona, Hamburg]]&amp;nbsp;– July 28, 1963 in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]]) was a German engineer and designer and the creator of the [[Borgward]] group, based in Bremen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndrtv.de/doku/20020617_borgward_bio.html Das Erste online - Carl F.W.

==Biography==
He was of modest extraction, the son of a coal retailer, Wilhelm Borgward, and had twelve brothers and sisters. He undertook mechanical engineering studies, and obtained his engineering diploma from [[University of Hanover|Hanover Technical University]] in 1913.

He was wounded during [[World War I]]. In 1919 he became one of the partners of ''Bremer Reifenindustrie''. The company was restructured and in 1920 became ''Bremer Kühlerfabrik Borgward &amp; Co.

In 1924 and 1925 the company started to produce the small three-wheel trucks ''Blitzkarren'' and ''Goliath''. With his partner Wilhelm Tecklenborg, in 1928 he created the company ''Goliath-Werke Borgward &amp; Co''. When the two associates took over ''Hansa-Lloyd-Werke'' in 1931, this became the [[Borgward]] Group.

On September 23, 1938, the ''Carl F. W. Borgward Automobil- und Motorenwerke'' factory was opened in Sebaldsbrück near Bremen. At that time, 22,000 people were working in the company.  Until the end of the war the production of Borgward was mostly military vehicles and trucks.

When the factory was destroyed by bombing in 1944, half of the workers were prisoners of war and forced laborers. Carl Borgward was interned until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Borgward#Leben]]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, just one year after being freed, he was already again a member of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Bremen.

In 1949, the first ''[[Lloyd (car)|Lloyd]] LP 300'' had been designed and produced. In Germany this car was nicknamed the ''Leukoplastbomber'' (''Band-aid Bomber''). The small car with a plywood body on a wooden chassis had a [[two-stroke engine]] and was in the market segment under the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], and kept this position for more than a decade.

In 1949 Borgward had also presented the large [[Hansa (car)|Hansa]] sedan, which was the first European car with a pontoon body. He had taken ideas from American magazines, which he read when under detention.

The largest success came in 1954 with the [[Borgward Isabella]]. The Borgwards met the spirit of the time: the German customers wished for American type styling and rich chrome decoration with European compact dimensions. Borgward participated in detail in the design of all the car models.

Increased competition on the segment of mid-sized cars, and the too broad and uneconomical range of models, as well as wrong financial and tactical choices by the management, led the company into crisis at the end of the fifties. The new model [[Lloyd Arabella|Borgward-Lloyd Arabella]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Lloyd Arabella]]&lt;/ref&gt; should have eased the difficulties, but it was handicapped by quality problems.

In 1961, Borgward underwent one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in the history of Germany. The company went to the Land of Bremen, which had it liquidated, and part of the factory went to [[Hanomag]]. Years after the bankruptcy was closed, it came out that it had not been reasonable: All debts had been paid to the last cent.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Borgward#Konkurs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Borgward died of a heart attack at the age 72 on July 28, 1963.

His life work might continue: 50 years after closing down his grandson, Christian Borgward, together with his partner Karlheinz L. Knöss and with assistance from Chinese investors unveiled the company's first new car in over 40 years, the [[Borgward BX7|BX7]] at the 2015 [[International Motor Show Germany|International Motor Show]] in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/article1561851/Borgward_kehrt_zurueck_auf_die_Strassen.html Luxus-Automobile: Borgward drängt zurück auf die Straßen - Nachrichten Wirtschaft - WELT ONLINE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community Inspiring Today’s Youth''' or '''The CITY''' is a [[Los Angeles]] based [[non-profit organization]] founded in 2013. Their primary focus is to develop entrepreneurship programs and mentor opportunities for troubled or previously incarcerated youth. The organization is notable for its annual star-studded [[CITY Gala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Chris|title=Richard Branson Booked for Keynote Address at City Gala's Playboy Mansion-Set Fundraiser|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/richard-branson-booked-keynote-address-855253|accessdate=12 February 2016|agency=The Hollywood Reporter|date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The pilot program for ''The CITY'' began in 2006 by Southern California native, ''Chandra Stovall'', who now serves as the executive director. Stovall developed several youth entrepreneurship programs in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Through these programs, ''The CITY'' was able to produce an entirely youth-generated revenue that reached over $6000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TheCITY official site|url=http://www.tcpyouth.org/#!board-of-directors/cut2|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was officially enacted in 2013 and its official launch ceremony, [[Fame and Philanthropy]] was attended by several notable [[:wikt:cynosure|cynosure]]s including [[Charlize Theron]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Halle Berry]], and a keynote speech from director [[James Cameron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gray|first1=Tim|title=Oscars Parties: Governors Ball, Elton John and the Inaugural Fame &amp; Philanthropy Party|url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/awards/oscar-parties-academy-awards-governors-ball-elton-john-fame-philanthropy-1201124479/|accessdate=12 February 2016|agency=Variety Magazine|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Jenny|title=Oscar Parties 2014: The Ultimate Guide|url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/awards/oscar-parties-2014-the-ultimate-guide-1201111326/|accessdate=12 February 2016|agency=Variety Magazine|date=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is noted to have raised enough money to provide operating expenses for the entire organization for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buonantony|first1=Jennifer|title=FAME AND PHILANTHROPY OSCAR PARTY: JAMES CAMERON, CHARLIZE THERON, HALLE BERRY &amp; MORE|url=http://www.presspassla.com/fame-philanthropy-oscar-party/|accessdate=12 February 2016|agency=PressPass LA|date=5 March  2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yahoo Finance|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upper-street-marketing-subsidiary-magmo-131500284.html;_ylt=AwrXgiLAcr5WdF0AU1iTmYlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTByZDNzZTI1BGNvbG8DZ3ExBHBvcwMyBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|accessdate=13 February 2016|agency=Upper Street Marketing subsidiary MagMo (Magazine Moment) Partners with Fame and Philanthropy for Upcoming Celebrity Fundraising Event|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

Since its conception, The CITY had provided students in [[South Central Los Angeles]] with a unique "Micro-Entrepreneurship" program that lasts 46 weeks. This program encourages students not "enter the field or trade" but to start their own business. They offer specific technical training in several different categories including jewelry design, photography, graphic arts &amp; design, and interior &amp; exterior painting.

In these programs, inner city youth develop a product or service, and obtain mentor-ship from a notable leader in that particular field or an industry professional.

==CITY Gala==

Since the Fame and Philanthropy gala, The CITY has hosted an annual awards ceremony and speaker summit known as the [[CITY Gala]]. This annual gala features speeches from top leaders in the entertainment industry, musical performance from A-list celebrities, and worldwide media coverage.

'''Deutscher Konsumentenbund''' (German Consumers' Federation) is a European consumer [[advocacy group]] based in [[Kassel]]. It is a non-profit organization and registered with the [[European Commission]] to be a consumer rights lobby group&lt;ref&gt;[https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/transparency/regrin/consultation/listlobbyists.do?reset= Lobby-Register der EU-Kommission, Nr. 15615763186-36], visited 07/30/2011&lt;/ref&gt; with claimed 2,500 members.&lt;ref name="Impressum"&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/anbieterkennzeichnung Selbstdarstellung des Verbandes] visited 07/30/2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;  It submits stakeholder opinions to European Commission and appeared before the State government of [[Hesse]] in stakeholder hearing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/blog/expertenanh%C3%B6rung-landeskartellbeh%C3%B6rde-ver%C3%B6ffentlicht-expertisen Expertenanhörung: Landeskartellbehörde veröffentlicht Expertisen], 07/30/2011 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hessian anti-trust state authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hessen.de/irj/HMWVL_Internet?cid=5108cc51bcc241ce5b4d378fc7c00c88 Vorträge der Veranstaltung Wasserpreise und -gebühren 09. Mai 2011] (right column), zip file)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
The organisation is one of the few [[Europe]]an non-industrially backed groups that advocate [[free market|free market solutions]]&lt;ref name="Leitmotiv"&gt;[http://www.konsumentenbund.de/leitmotiv Leitmotiv des Deutschen Konsumentenbunds] visited 7/30/20111 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; that enhance transparency instead of tightening regulations and imposing paternalistic measures.

Also the organization strongly criticizes state-run monopoly structures, e.g. when supplying goods that are regarded "public goods", especially if reward is made by collection taxes (local rates) rather than demanding prices. It has been very active lobbying in favor of a reform on anti-trust laws to allow anti-trust authorities to control local monopoly structures by means of prices comparison and simulated competition in cases where no state of competition can be reached.

Deutscher Konsumentenbund criticizes local community tax laws currently in effect in Germany and has formed a coalition to alter or abolish the current legal structures.

==General consumer information and protection==
The organization offers general consumer information and consumer protection services publishing Rapex warnings in German language and offering assistance with so called "subscription traps" and Airline passenger rights.

==Fair Water Group==
Deutscher Konsumentenbund established a "Fair Water Group" that organizes grass root movements, individuals and organizations critical of the current legal framework for community taxation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">A '''duvet day''' is a formal allowance of time off given by some employers, most commonly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1099138.stm |title=E-CYCLOPEDIA &amp;#124; Duvet days: A snooze button for life |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-01-03 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/duvetday.asp |title=duvet day |publisher=Word Spy |date=2001-06-25 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to [[duvet|the item of bedding]].

Duvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997,&lt;ref name="wordspy"/&gt; and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a [[contract of employment]] and is considered part of the remunerations package along with [[holiday]] allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason (such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday) even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.

In the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a '''casual leave'''.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off (usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees). These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than 50 years.

'''''E.O.S.: Earth Orbit Stations''''' is a [[space station]] [[construction and management simulation games|management simulation]] game developed by Karl Buiter,&lt;ref name="giantlist"/&gt; with [[Joe Ybarra]] as producer, for [[Electronic Arts]]. It was released for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple II]] in 1987.

==Gameplay==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

The game focuses on both the material and economic challenges of building a permanent, fully functioning space station in [[geocentric orbit]].

The game was set in 1996, and the player is given various selected scenarios to fulfill, from mundane tasks such as setting up a simple space station to developing and supplying a specified amount of high-grade, [[zero G]] [[pharmaceutical]]s to being the first to contact alien life. The game also is a cutthroat strategy game in multiplayer, as players compete over finite resources and resource management.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1987 gave the game a mixed review. While the single-player portion was praised, the review felt the game had too high a learning curve to be really suitable for multiplayer. The user interface was particularly bothersome, described as "a textbook case of how ''not'' to design a window/menu/graphics interface." The documentation was similarly described as poorly organized and cryptic.&lt;ref name = "CGW"&gt;{{citation | date = October 1987 | last = Williams | first = Gregg | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Earth Orbit Stations  | pages = 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title two-plus stars of five, calling it "An interesting failure ... the logistics just are not that much fun".&lt;ref name="brooks199211"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=100 | title=Strategy &amp; Wargames: The Future (2000-....) | work=Computer Gaming World | date= November 1992 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M.

The '''Federation of Enterprises in Belgium''' ({{lang-nl|Verbond van Belgische Ondernemingen}}, VBO, {{lang-fr|Fédération des Entreprises de Belgique}}, FEB) is the only [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[non-profit organization]] representing companies in all three regions of Belgium. Its members, the different Belgian [[List of recognized economic sectors|sector]]ial [[employers' organization]]s, represent companies in key industrial and service sectors. All in all, it represents more than 30,000 businesses, of which 25,000 are small or medium-sized enterprises. Since May 2012, [[Pieter Timmermans]] is CEO of the Federation of Belgian Enterprises, and since March 2017, [[Bernard Gilliot]] of [[Tractebel]] is the President.

The VBO/FEB aims to help create jobs for the future and ensure that these jobs complement each other, especially in the service, industrial and construction sectors. In terms of jobs, the VBO/FEB represents approximately 1.5 million workers in the private sector.

==History==
It was founded in 1973 after a merger of the ''Federation of Belgian Industries'' and the ''Federation of Non Industrial Enterprises of Belgium''. The VBO/FEB is the voice of business in Belgium. It aims to: work towards creating an optimum business environment, promote business interests at federal, European and international level (in 150 bodies) and to ensure consistency in the message entrepreneurs deliver and the actions they take.

The phrase '''government-owned and controlled corporation''' (GOCC), sometimes with an "and/or",&lt;ref name="OfficialGaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/directory/government-owned-andor-controlled-corporations|title=Government-Owned and/or Controlled Corporations|last=|first=|date=|website=Official Gazette|publisher=Republic of the Philippines|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526091508/http://www.gov.ph/directory/government-owned-andor-controlled-corporations|archive-date=26 May 2015|dead-url=yes|accessdate=29 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term in the [[Philippines]] used to describe [[government-owned corporation]]s that conduct both commercial and non-commercial activity.  Examples of the latter would be the [[Government Service Insurance System]], a [[social security system]] for government employees.  There are over 200 GOCCs.&lt;ref name="BW2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Nation&amp;title=state-run-corporations-only-remitted-a-tenth-of-dividends&amp;id=108478|title=State-run corporations only remitted a tenth of dividends|last=Lopez|first=Melissa Luz T.|date=25 May 2015|work=|publisher=BusinessWorld|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GOCCs both receive subsidies and pay dividends to the national government.

Under the '''GOCC Governance Act''' (Republic Act 10149; Government Owned and Controlled Corporations (GOCC) Governance Act of 2011), GOCCs are overseen by the '''Governance Commission for Government-Owned or Controlled Corporations''' (GCG).&lt;ref name=Inq2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=House passes DBP, LBP merger bill|url=http://business.inquirer.net/192501/house-passes-dbp-lbp-merger-bill|accessdate=26 May 2015|agency=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Governance Commission is the "government’s central advisory and oversight body over the public corporate sector" according to the Official Gazette of the Philippine government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gov.ph/2014/10/22/president-aquino-approves-closure-of-7-nonperforming-goccs/|title=President Aquino approves closure of 7 nonperforming GOCCs|last=|first=|date=22 October 2014|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024142841/http://www.gov.ph/2014/10/22/president-aquino-approves-closure-of-7-nonperforming-goccs/|archive-date=24 October 2014|dead-url=|publisher=|agency=Official Gazette|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Governance Commission among other duties prepares for the [[President of the Philippines]] a [[shortlist]] of candidates for appointment by the president to GOCC boards.&lt;ref name=Inq2015 /&gt;

Many but not all GOCCs have their own charter or law outlining its responsibilities and governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gov.ph/2014/06/06/gcg-marks-third-year-as-overseer-of-gocc-sector/|title=GCG marks third year as overseer of GOCC sector|last=|first=|date=6 June 2014|work=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618150849/http://www.gov.ph/2014/06/06/gcg-marks-third-year-as-overseer-of-gocc-sector/|archive-date=18 June 2014|dead-url=yes|publisher=|agency=Official Gazette|accessdate=26 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erik Gustaf Larson''' (8 July 1887 – 4 July 1968) was a Swedish [[automotive engineer]] and the co-founder of [[Volvo]]. He held a Master of Science (M. Sc.) degree in [[Mechanical Engineering]] from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.

==Biography==
Larson was responsible for the technical design of the first Volvo model [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], introduced on 14 April 1927. He and [[Assar Gabrielsson]] founded Volvo. He was appointed vice president and technical manager for AB [[Volvo]] in Gothenburg, from the time the company was founded 1927. He worked for Volvo until his death in 1968.

===Invention and development===
In June 1924 when Gustav Larson met his old friend [[Assar Gabrielsson]] in Stockholm, Gabrielsson unveiled his plans to try to establish the manufacturing of a new Swedish automobile. Gustav Larson had worked for SKF between 1917-1919 but now worked for the company AB Galco in Stockholm. They made a verbal agreement in August 1924 at the [[Sturehof]] restaurant in Stockholm, then signed a written contract more than one year later, on 16 December 1925. In this contract Gustav was to carry out the engineering work for a new car, as well as an investment plan for a complete new manufacturing plant, but would only be rewarded for that work in case the project would turn out well. Well meant after at least 100 produced cars and in the case this was achieved before 1 January 1928. This famous contract shows that Assar Gabrielsson "owned" the project and that it was a high-risk project without any guarantees. Gabrielsson took the economic risks himself and Gustav, in the worst case, would have worked on the project without being rewarded, but still would have had his salary from AB Galco in Stockholm. Most of the capital that Gabrielsson intended to use for the project initially was actually extra sales commissions that he had saved from the time he was the [[managing director]] for the SKF subsidiary in [[Paris]] in 1921-22.
 
Gabrielsson had  decided to build a test series of ten vehicles with his own financing and later present the car and an entire investment plan to SKF. The idea to build a pre-series of ten vehicles was most certainly related to the fact that no company would have given he and Larsen an offer for the components (engines, gearboxes, chassis components etc.) With less quantity they were certain that SKF would approve plans in due time. Engineering, documentation and investment planning was carried out exactly in the same way, as if it had been carried out by SKF in order to prepare for the set up of a new automobile company. Gabrielsson most certainly had the full support from the managing director of SKF, Mr. [[Björn Prytz]], at that time, as long as his 'private' project did not interfere with his work as sales manager for SKF.

The first ten pre-series vehicles, model [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], were designed and assembled in Stockholm at AB Galco under the supervision of Gustav Larson, at that time still having his other work at AB Galco to attend to. A "design-office", often called "Volvo's first design-office", was established in one room of Larson's private apartment at [[Rådmansgatan]] 59. The design work started in the autumn of 1924 and a number of engineers were involved, among them engineer [[Jan G. Smith]], that had returned from America in 1924, and later engineer Henry Westerberg. All the invoices related to the project was sent to Gabrielsson's private address at Kungsportsavenyn 32 in Gothenburg. In a lot of orders that Gustav Larsson made himself, he referred to Gabrielsson as a "guarantee" so that the deliveries would be paid by him personally. These details shows that the Volvo automobile project in the beginning was a true private project, not sponsored by SKF from an economic point of view.

The first prototype car was ready in June 1926. Larsen and Gabrielsson took it and drove themselves, on bumpy roads, down to SKF in Gothenburg to show the SKF-board and now present the final investment plan.

===AB Volvo founded ===
At a board meeting held in [[Hofors]], Sweden on 10 August 1926, SKF decided to use the old subsidiary company Volvo AB, for the automobile project. AB Volvo, that was first registered in 1915 on the initiative of Björn Prytz, was originally set up to be used for a special series of ball bearings for the American market but it was never really used for this purpose. A small series of ball bearings stamped with Volvo was manufactured but it was never introduced on a larger scale.

A contract was signed on 12 August 1926 between SKF and Gabrielsson, stipulating that all ten prototype cars, engineering drawings, calculations etc. should be handed over to Volvo AB, and Gabrielsson in return would be refunded most of his private investments for the prototype cars.  The contract was signed by [[Björn Prytz]], managing director of SKF and Gabrielsson. Gustaf Larsson finally got paid for the initial engineering work with the ÖV4 according to the 'private' contract he and Gabrielsson had signed on 16 December 1925. That 1925 contract had stated that the automobile project may be sold to any company that would be interested, but they hoped that SKF would be the company to first offer.

Gustav Larson was appointed vice president and technical manager on 1 January 1927, and left his employment at AB Galco in Stockholm.

=== First production Volvo===
On 14 April 1927, at about 10 p.m., the first series production model, the [[Volvo ÖV 4|ÖV 4]], left the newly established factory on [[Hisingen]] in [[Gothenburg]].

The ten prototype cars that had been assembled in Stockholm were never sold, except for one that was sold to Volvo's photographer Sven Sjöstedt and was later donated to the [[Volvo Museum|Volvo Industrial Museum]] around 1930. However it was used as transportation vehicles within the manufacturing plant and as 'test benches' for new developed components during the first years.

=== Economic problems ===
The new company did not show any profit for the first couple of years and SKF invested more money to keep the company running. In 1928 the production of [[truck]]s began with the basic chassis components from ÖV4. The production of trucks was on a small scale, but the concept was successful from start.

However, in late 1929 SKF nearly sold the company to [[Charles W. Nash|Charles Nash]], president of [[Nash Motors]] in the [[United States]]. Björn Prytz and Gabrielsson managed to convince the SKF board to call the deal off, just one day before Charles Nash arrived by boat in [[Gothenburg]].  At the end of 1930 AB Volvo showed a small profit for the first time. In 1935 SKF came to the conclusion that Volvo now was ready to stand on its own feet. Volvo was introduced on the [[Stockholm stock exchange]] and SKF sold most of its shares. SKF could now concentrate on their core business, development and manufacturing of bearings, and still are, more than 100 years after the company was founded in 1907.

=== Sales success ===
In 1941, the 50,000th Volvo car was delivered. It took ten years to produce the first 25,000 cars but only four years for the next 25,000 cars. In 1944-45, just after the end of the [[Second World War]], the modern styled family car [[PV444]], with a completely new design, was introduced and the car was a sales success. The company now stood on solid ground and the production of both cars and trucks continued to increase for the rest of Larsen's life.

==Family==
Gustaf Larson was married to Elin Octavia Fröberg in 1918. They had four children: Erik, Anders, Gunnel, and Britt.

Gustaf Larson died on 4 July 1968, and is buried at the family tomb in [[Båstad]], Sweden.

F. B. Hawley offered his '''risk theory of profit''' in 1893. According to Hawley, [[risk]] in [[business]] arose from product [[obsolescence]], a sudden [[Deflation (economics)|fall in prices]], [[Deprecation|superior substitutes]], [[natural disaster|natural calamities]], or scarcity of certain crucial materials.

==Background==
Risk taking was an inevitable component of dynamic [[Production (economics)|production]], and those who took risk in business had a right to a separate reward known as "[[profit (economics)|profit]]". According to Hawley, profit is the price paid by society for assuming [[business risk]]. A businessman would not take a risk without expecting [[Financial compensation|compensation]] in excess of actuarial value- i.e., a premium on calculable risk. The reason that expected profit must be more than actuarial risk is the assumption that risk gives rise to dis-utilities of various kinds. Therefore, assuming risk gives the [[entrepreneur]] a claim to a [[wikt:reward|reward]] in excess of the actuarial value of the risk.

Hawley stated that profit was composed of two parts: one part represents compensation for average [[Pure economic loss|loss]] incidental to the various causes of risk, and the other part represents an inducement to suffer the [[wikt:consequence|consequence]]s of being exposed to the risk. Hawley believed that profits arose from the factor of [[ownership]], as long as the ownership included risk. If the entrepreneur avoided [risk] by [[insurance|insuring]] against it, he ceased to be an entrepreneur and should not receive profits. According to Hawley, profit arose out of uninsured risk. The uncertainty ends with sale of the entrepreneur's product. Profit thus is a residue. Hawley's theory is also known as the "residual theory of profit" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diwedi|first=D.N|title=Managerial Economics|year=2002|publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt.

The organization was formally established in 1965 by the collaborative merger of the Industrial Designers Institute (IDI), the American Society of Industrial Designers (ASID), and the Industrial Designers Education Association (IDEA). However, its origins can be traced back to the 1920s, prior to the founding in 1938 of the American Design Institute (ADI), which was the predecessor of IDI.&lt;ref&gt;Dubofsky, Melvyn (ed.) (2013).

The '''Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria''' ('''ICAN''') is a [[professional accountancy body]] in  [[Nigeria]].  
It is one of the two professional accountancy associations with regulatory authority in [[Nigeria]], the other being the [[Association of National Accountants of Nigeria]] (ANAN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ICAN was created by an Act of Parliament No. 15 of 1 September 1965 from existing accounting and auditing organizations including the AAN.&lt;ref name=Forrest1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oregan2003/&gt;
At time of foundation, ICAN had 250 members.&lt;ref name=Ekeoba20110512/&gt;

ICAN has the mission statement: "To Produce World-Class Chartered Accountants, Regulate and Continuously Enhance Their Ethical Standards and Technical Competence in the Public Interest".&lt;ref name=AboutICAN/&gt;
It has headquarters in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By 2003 ICAN had over 12,000 members.&lt;ref name=Oregan2003/&gt;
In August 2004 the ICAN began providing training on Information Technology for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On 11 May 2011, ICAN admitted 1,494 new members who had successfully passed their qualifying examination, bring total membership to 32,722.&lt;ref name=Ekeoba20110512/&gt;

In May 2011 Major General Sebastian Achulike Owuama (retired), the 46th President of ICAN and the 16th President of the [[Association of Accountancy Bodies in West Africa]], was elected President of the newly created [[Pan-African Federation of Accountants]] (PAFA), or Fédération Panafricaine des Experts-Comptables (FEPEC).
He was elected during the inaugural meeting of PAFA in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Standards and authority==

ICAN has based its practices on those of British chartered accountancy institutes. 
Nigeria adopted [[International Accounting Standards]] with little modification.&lt;ref name=Oregan2003/&gt;
ICAN is a member of the [[International Accounting Standards Committee]] (IASC) and periodically adopts IASC standards. 
Any deviation from these standards must be disclosed in a company's financial statements.&lt;ref name=Tesfagiorgis1993/&gt;
In the 1990s ICAN was dominated by members holding qualifications from the [[London]]-based [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA). Although the ICAN claimed complete independence of the ACCA, it was under attack for defending the status quo in accountancy practices and for suppressing changes to address local requirements.&lt;ref name=Lehman2004/&gt;

In August 2010 the Federal Government approved migration to [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |title=IFRS convergence and financial sector reforms
 |journal=[[Nigerian Tribune]]
 |author=Odidison Omankhanlen
 |date=30 August 2010
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2011 Joshua Okeowo, chairman of the Ikeja District of ICAN, said adoption of the IFRS would encourage foreign investment in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |url=http://www.businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/typography/the-news/21792-ican-wants-lfrs-adopted-for-net-investment-inflows
 |journal=[[Business Day (Nigeria)]]
 |title=ICAN wants lFRS adopted for net investment inflows
 |date=21 May 2011
 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He said IFRS would also "reduce cash transactions in the economy, thereby reducing the incidence of armed robbery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |journal=[[Next (Nigeria)]]
 |title=Institute wants 'International Financial Reporting Standard' adopted
 |date=May 23, 2011
 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Companies Act of 1968 required that all limited liability companies are audited by a duly recognized auditor.
As of 1993, only members of the ICAN qualified to be auditors. They had to pass ICAN examinations to gain a practicing certificate.
In effect, the ICAN had full control over entry to the profession.&lt;ref name=Tesfagiorgis1993/&gt;
Although a growing number of financial analysts in Nigeria are designated Certified Financial Analysts, there is no body in Nigeria that certifies analysts to produce research reports. Most such reports are prepared by members of ICAN or the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In March 2011 Professor [[Oladapo Afolabi]], Head of the Civil Service, said that professional certificates of associations such as ICAN and ACCA could be used in recruitment and advancement in the public service, but could not be required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Relationship with ANAN==

The Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) was chartered on 25 August 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.publicaccountants.org.au/media/123844/nia%20strengthens%20international%20ties%20with%20nigerian%20accounting%20body.pdf

 |title=NIA STRENGTHENS INTERNATIONAL TIES WITH NIGERIAN ACCOUNTING BODY
 |publisher=[[Institute of Public Accountants]]
 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The government had given ANAN the mandate to compete with ICAN, and by 1994 the two organizations were fighting for control of the Chartered Accountants profession in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Lehman2004/&gt;
In 2002 ICAN applied to the courts to disqualify and/or bar Mr Clement Akpamgbo from representing ANAN, and the matter was referred to a lower court. ANAN appealed the decision, but the appeal was dismissed for lack of merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |title=ANAN's Appeal Against ICAN Suffers Setback
 |journal=[[Daily Champion]]
 |date=25 June 2002
 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 2007 a Federal High Court in [[Lagos]] dismissed a suit by ICAN requesting the court to declare that the decree establishing ANAN was void.&lt;ref name=DTrust20071123/&gt;

In March 2009, ANAN President Dr Samuel Nzekwe rejected an attempt by ICAN to set auditing standards for its members.
He said that the [[Nigerian Accounting Standards Board]] (NASB) Act 2003 said that only the board could set standards for the accounting profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |date=29 March 2009
 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2010 Mr. Godson Nnadi, Executive Secretary of Nigeria Accounting Standards Board, spoke in favor of a new body to set accounting and auditing standards for Nigeria and other African nations. The new body would be independent of both ANAN and ICAN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

ANAN ICAN are now set to settle dispute out of court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ican-ngr.org/news.php ANAN/ICAN legal battle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other professional bodies==

In May 2008 the House of Representatives rejected a bill to establish the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants of Nigeria (CIMA) as an alternative to ANAN and ICAN. The House was concerned about proliferation of accounting bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ICAN was strongly opposed to establishment of CIMA, while ANAN said it supported the proposal given the dynamics of the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In December 2009 there were delays in passage by the [[Senate of Nigeria|Senate]] of bills on the Institute of Chartered Public Accountants (CPA) and the Chartered Institute of Management and Cost Accountants (CIMCA).&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
The bills had been approved by both houses during the administration of President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], but he had failed to sign them into law before the end of his term.  As a result, President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] had to resubmit the bills when he took office in 2007.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20100311/&gt;
ANAN did not object to the new organizations but ICAN expressed concerns on the grounds of proliferation.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20091206/&gt;
As of March 2010 the bills had still not cleared the Senate.&lt;ref name=Odiakose20100311/&gt;

In May 2011 Sebastian Owuama, President of ICAN, attended the annual tax conference of the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria]] (CITN) in [[Abuja]] where he called for an end to the squabble between ICAN and the CITN. The move was welcomed by CITN president [[Rasaq Adekunle Quadri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Controversy==

A storm over banking malpractices blew up in 2009, with the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) leading investigations that led to bank closures and dismissal of directors, some of whom were arrested by the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]]. 
Olutoyin Adepate, the ICAN registrar, said "the current crises should be fully investigated and persons found guilty sanctioned according to the laws of the nation... the larger interest of the national economy and the Nigerian people must be defended at all cost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 |date=30 August 2009
 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2009 [[Sanusi Lamido Sanusi]], governor of the CBN, addressed the ICAN annual conference. He revealed a number of improprieties in direction of eight of the banks, including loans made to directors with inadequate security. Sanusi said "While these were happening, where were the accountants, the auditors? While these were happening, someone was reporting profits, paying dividends out of operations that could not by any standards be said to be profitable. That is why we are where we are". Speaking later Elizabeth Adegite, President of ICAN, called on chartered accountants to play a more critical role in ensuring good corporate governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As of 2010 Emmanuel Ikhazobor, sole administrator of the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]] (NSE), was threatening to delist companies that did not comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Companies were failing to submit their audited reports when auditors noted the possibility of misappropriation of funds. For example, FAMAD Plc, which had the first female president of ICAN as chairman of its board, had not held annual general meetings for about four years because the auditors had queried financial transactions and therefore the annual reports had not been submitted.
Apparently there had been massive [[asset stripping]] in the company before it was finally de-listed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Iron Ore Company of Canada''' (often abbreviated to '''IOC''') ({{lang-fr|Compagnie Minière IOC}}) is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-based producer of [[iron ore]]. The company was founded in 1949 from a partnership of Canadian and American [[M.A. Hanna Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollinger, M.A. Hanna, Labrador Mining, National Republic, Armco, Youngston and Wheeling-Pittsburg&lt;/ref&gt; It is now owned by a new consortium,&lt;ref&gt;Mitsubishi Corp., Rio Tinto Limited, LIORIF and IOC Ore Sales Company&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Mitsubishi]] and [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] corporations. Rio Tinto is the majority shareholder in the venture, with 58.7% of the joint stock as of October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.financialpost.com/2013/10/15/rio-tinto-to-complete-iron-ore-company-of-canada-expansion-by-mid-2014/ FP: "Rio Tinto to complete Iron Ore Company of Canada expansion by mid-2014" 15 Oct 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitsubishi controlled 26.2% of the investment as of March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/dented-by-aluminum-rio-tinto-aims-to-unload-iron-ore-co/article9201005/ G+M: "Dented by aluminum, Rio Tinto aims to unload Iron Ore Co" 1 Mar 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], IOC currently has mining and concentrator operations in [[Labrador City]], and operates the [[Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway]] to ship ore concentrate from the mines, such as [[Wabush]], to the port of [[Sept-Îles, Quebec|Sept-Îles]], [[Quebec]].

During 1977 to 1983, the president of the company was [[Brian Mulroney]], who later served as [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] from 1984 to 1993.

The '''Jasmine''' family is an [[United States|American]] family notable for its entrepreneurial endeavors in the [[Northeastern United States|U.S. Northeast]].{{Cn|date=January 2015}}  The family garnered modest prominence through its business as the major distributor of fresh produce in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era [[New York City]].  Until the 1920s, the Jasmine food goods trade became an innovator in using the railroads to carry produce, preserved foods, and wine from [[California]] to markets and vendors in the [[Tri-State Region|New York tri-state area]].  Most early Jasmine family interests were sold and incorporated into [[the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company]] in 1899, allowing that company to vastly expand its holdings and stores in the [[New York metropolitan area]].  Since the 1920s, the Jasmine family has been involved in philanthropy, including support for [[Catholic schools]] and education.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

==History==
The progenitor of the Jasmines in the United States was Gaetano Jasmine.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}  Upon arrival in America, Jasmine stayed briefly in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]] at the insistence of [[Henry Tighlman Paca]], a descendant of [[William Paca]], before setting out for [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] where he began to organize his food trade.  After the war, he became a [[citizenship|citizen]] and settled on East 89th Street in New York's [[Upper East Side]].{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

==History==
===Founding===
In 1909, [[Eugène Schueller|Eugène Paul Louis Schueller]], a 
young [[French people|French]] [[chemist]] of [[Germany|German]] [[Ancestry|descent]],&lt;ref&gt;.[http://thefashionfoot.com/2013/02/18/eugene-schueller-founder-of-loreal/ The Fashion Foot.]&lt;/ref&gt; developed a hair dye formula called ''Auréale''. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to [[Paris]]ian hairdressers.
On 31 July 1919, Schueller registered his company,&lt;ref&gt;[https://prezi.com/a2vt6eplmrmn/corporate-financial-reporting/ Corporate financial reporting by Amberr Aslamm on Prezi]. Prezi.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists. By 1950, the team was 100 strong; that number reached 1,000 by 1984 and is nearly 82,000 today.

Schueller provided financial support and held meetings for [[La Cagoule]] at L'Oréal headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French [[fascist]]-leaning and anti-[[communist]] group whose leader formed a political party [[Mouvement Social Révolutionnaire]] (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement) which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |title=The Color of Money |date=28 March 2011 |work=[[The New Yorker]] |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505045702/http://gladwell.com/2011/2011_03_28_a_color_of_money.html |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal hired several members of the group as executives after [[World War II]], such as [[Jacques Corrèze]], who served as [[CEO]] of the [[United States]] operation. This involvement was extensively researched by [[Michael Bar-Zohar]] in his book, ''Bitter Scent''.

L'Oréal got its start in the hair-colour business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Oréal currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair colour, permanents, [[Hairstyle|hair styling]], body and skin care, [[Cleanser|cleansers]], makeup and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to hyper - and supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies and direct mail.

===Research and development facilities===
L'Oréal has six worldwide [[research and development]] centres: two in France: [[Aulnay-sous-Bois|Aulnay]] and [[Chevilly-Larue|Chevilly]]; one in the [[United States|U.S.]]: [[Clark, New Jersey|Clark]], [[New Jersey]]; one in [[Japan]]: [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; in 2005 one was established in [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], and one in [[India]]. A future facility in the US will be in [[Berkeley Heights, New Jersey]].

===Media===
From 1988 to 1989, L'Oréal controlled the film company [[Paravisión|Paravision]], whose properties included the [[Filmation]] and [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group|De Laurentiis]] libraries. [[StudioCanal]] acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.

==Acquisitions==
L'Oréal purchased Synthélabo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synthélabo merged with [[Sanofi]] in 1999 to become [[Sanofi-Synthélabo]].  Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with [[Aventis]] in 2004 to become [[Sanofi-Aventis]].

On 17 March 2006, L'Oréal purchased cosmetics company [[The Body Shop]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]562 million.

L'Oréal's [[advertising slogan]] is "Because I'm worth it". In the mid 2000s, this was replaced by "Because you're worth it". In late 2009, the slogan was changed again to "Because we're worth it" following motivation analysis and work into consumer psychology of Dr. Maxim Titorenko. The shift to "we" was made to create stronger consumer involvement in L'Oréal philosophy and lifestyle and provide more consumer satisfaction with L'Oréal products. L'Oréal also owns a Hair and Body products line for kids called [[L'Oréal Kids]], the slogan for which is "Because we're worth it too".

==Marketing==
In 1987, during the growth years of the mail order business, L'Oréal and [[3 Suisses]]  founded Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agnès b., Cosmence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others.  In March 2008, L'Oréal acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmeticsdesign-asia.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-buys-stake-in-beauty-brand "L'Oreal buys stake in beauty brand"], ''Cosmetics Design Asia''. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, L'Oréal announced that Le Club des Créateurs de Beauté would cease activity in the first half of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-to-end-the-activity-of,6187|title=L'Oréal to end the activity of Beauté Créateurs its mail-order subsidiary|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, L'Oréal inaugurated the largest factory in the [[Cikarang|Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang]], Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/slideshows/day-in-pics/november-08-2012/loreal-opens-largest-factory-in-cikarang/slideshow/17140910.cms "L'Oreal opens largest factory in Cikarang"], ''The Economic Times'', India, 8 November 2012. Retrieved on 13 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The production will be absorbed 25 percent by domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred at Indonesia with 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianewsnet.net/home/news.php?id=17498&amp;sec=2 L'Oreal to build its largest factory worth $50m in Indonesia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other acquisitions===
In January 2014, L'Oréal finalised the acquisition of major [[China|Chinese]] beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/loreal-acquires-chinese-beauty-brand-magic-holdings-for-840m L'Oréal Acquires Major Chinese Beauty Brand]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2014 it was announced that L'Oreal had sealed a deal worth €3.4bn to buy back 8% of its shares from Swiss consumer goods giant Nestle. As a result of the deal, Nestle's stake in L'Oreal will be reduced from 29.4pc to 23.29pc while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake will increase from 30.6pc to 33.2pc. Nestle has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974 when it bought into the company at the request of [[Liliane Bettencourt]], the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal and world's richest woman, who was trying to prevent the French state's intervention in the company.

On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L'Oréal for €227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).&lt;ref name="Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/financial/shiseido-sells-carita-declor-to-loral-7487620?src=n/newsAlert/20140219-7 | title=Shiseido Sells Carita, Decléor to L'Oréal | publisher=WWD | date=19 February 2014 | accessdate=20 February 2014 | author=Kaiser, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate social responsibility===

====Group-wide sustainability plan====
L'Oreal announced a new sustainability plan in 2013, which they hope will help reach the goal of 1 billion new consumers by 2020 by producing more products with less environmental impact and helping customers make sustainable lifestyle choices. The main commitments to achieve by 2020 include: aiming for 100 percent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 percent; and empowering consumers to make sustainable consumption choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/loral-outlines-2020-sustainability-goals/4008356.article|title=L'Oréal Outlines 2020 Sustainability Goals|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sustainable development====
In 2009, L'Oréal declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2009/04/23/loreal-to-reduce-ghg-emissions-water-consumption-and-waste-by-50/|title= L'Oreal to Reduce GHG Emissions, Water Consumption and Waste by 50%|publisher= Environmental Leader|date= 23 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a deduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/L-Oreal-wants-to-cut-its-CO2-emissions-in-half-by-2015,60830.html#.UimqX9K8Bag|title= L'Oréal wants to cut its CO2 emissions in half by 2015|publisher= Fashionmag.com|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% deduction in C02 Emissions, a 24% deduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by [[Climate Counts]] for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/34964-L-Or-al-Recognized-by-Climate-Counts-as-Sector-Leader-for-Managing-Reporting-and-Reducing-its-Carbon-Emissions| title= L'Oréal Recognized by Climate Counts as Sector Leader for Managing, Reporting and Reducing its Carbon Emissions |publisher= CSR Wire|date= 5 December 2012|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, L'Oréal made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Business-Financial/L-Oreal-reiterates-sustainability-importance-with-zero-deforestation-commitment| title= L'Oréal reiterates sustainability importance with ‘zero deforestation' commitment |publisher= Cosmetics design-europe.com|date= 15 January 2014|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was included in the Corporate Knights "Global 100" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.&lt;ref name=cosmeticsdesigneurope/&gt;

====Position on animal testing====
Since the 80s, L'Oréal has invested €900 million in researching [[alternatives to animal testing]] for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, like the Episkin model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities |title=L'Oreal builds on skin testing capabilities|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at their research centers in Gerland, France, and [[Pudong]], China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://answers.loreal.com/animaltesting/en/our-position/|title=Our Position|publisher=L'Oréal Answers|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,&lt;ref name=bweekchina&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-08-21/china-animal-testing-complicates-l-oreal-s-expansion-retail|title=China Animal Testing Complicates L'Oreal's Expansion|date=21 August 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where animal testing of all cosmetics for human use is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181468/Big-beauty-brands-dropping-cruelty-free-animal-testing-policies-sell-products-China.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=L'Occitane and Yves Rocher: The big-name beauty brands among those ditching cruelty-free animal testing policies to sell their products to China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmetics by brands such as [[The Body Shop]], which refuses to do [[animal testing]], are thus not available for sale in the Chinese market.

In 2013, L'Oréal was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/animal-testing-talk-about-medical-research|title=Animal testing – it's time to talk about it again|author=Bibi van der Zee|publisher=The Guardian|date=18 July 2013|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community involvement and awards===
In 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the [[The Brand Trust Report|Brand Trust Report]] 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |title=India's Most Trusted Brands 2014 |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502221904/http://www.trustadvisory.info/allindia_2014.html |archivedate= 2 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, L'Oréal was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trendence.de/fileadmin/pdf/ESB_2008.pdf|title=The European Student Barometer 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.

The [[L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science]] was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.

The awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Oréal and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and carry a grant of $100,000 USD for each laureate.

The same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Oréal International Fellowships, providing up to $40,000 USD in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=14633&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html/ UNESCO/L'ORÉAL Co-Sponsored Fellowships for Young Women in Life Sciences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010122943/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D14633%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |date=10 October 2014 }}. Portal.unesco.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

L'Oréal organises the yearly L'Oréal Brandstorm, a business game for students in 43 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, a second prize of $5,000 and a third prize of $2500.

L'Oréal is also a founding member of the "Look Good...Feel Better" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.

In 2015, [[Standard Ethics Aei]] gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403113833/http://standardethicsindices.eu/standard-ethics-french-index.html |archivedate=3 April 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and innovation==

===Episkin===
Episkin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Oréal France to provide an alternatives to animal testing.&lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Animal%20Testing/SkinReplacesAnimTests.htm | work= Animal Liberation Front|title= Human Skin to Replace Animal Tests|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[skin cells]] left over from breast surgery &lt;ref name="Skin Replaces Animal Tests" /&gt; are developed under [[in vitro]] laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com/Formulation-Science/L-Oreal-builds-on-skin-testing-capabilities | work=Cosmetic Design Europe| title=L'Oréal Builds on Skin Testing Capabilities| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colours, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.&lt;ref name="Build on Animal Testing" /&gt;
In 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading [[tissue engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.euroinvestor.fr/actualites/2006/02/28/loreal-episkin-subsidiary-of-loreal-acquires-skinethic-leader-in-tissue-engineering/9331794 | work=Euro Investor| title=L´OREAL : EPISKIN, SUBSIDIARY OF L´OREAL, ACQUIRES SKINETHIC, LEADER IN TISSUE ENGINEERING| date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim for L'Oréal is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.&lt;ref name="GCI"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.gcimagazine.com/business/management/innovation/111854374.html?page=1| work=GCI| title=L'Oréal Unveils New Research and Innovation Strategy| date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these research methods L'Oréal aims to tap into one billion new consumers &lt;ref name="GCI" /&gt; in these markets for the upcoming years.

In 2003, the L'Oréal Institute for Ethnic Hair &amp; Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/lifestyle/2012/11/09/4th-loreal-workshop-on-african-hair-and-skin-currently-underway/| work=LIFESTYLE Mahazine| title=4th L'Oreal workshop on African hair and skin currently underway | date=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The L'Oréal Group opened ''the Predictive Evaluation Center'' in Lyon, France in 2011.

In 2011, L'Oréal announced its intention to build a ''Research and Innovation Center'' in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]. Estimated at 30 million euros (70,000,000 reals), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.premiumbeautynews.com/en/l-oreal-a-new-research-and,3682| work=Premium Beauty News| title=L'Oréal: a new research and innovation centre in Rio| date=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen opened in March 2012.

===Human skin 3D printing===
L'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup [[Organovo]] to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. "We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with," said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-18/l-oreal-s-plan-to-start-3d-printing-human-skin| work=Bloomberg| title=L'Oreal's Plan to Start 3D Printing Human Skin| date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modiface===
On 16 March 2018, L'Oréal announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses [[augmented reality]] to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17131260/loreal-modiface-acquire-makeup-ar-try-on|title=L’Oreal acquires Modiface, a major AR beauty company|work=The Verge|access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

===Advertising===
In May 2007, L'Oréal was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lancôme)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Beauty and the publicity beast|date = 9 May 2007|last = Costello|first = John|work = The Evening Herald|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163157135.html|accessdate = 14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered by the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the [[wrinkle (skin)|wrinkle]] removal capabilities of their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrinkle creams are a rip-off|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,21682971-36557,00.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)]]|date=7 May 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, L'Oréal has faced criticism from [[OFCOM]] regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its "Telescopic" [[mascara]], featuring [[Penélope Cruz]], stating, "it will make your [[eyelash]]es 60% longer." In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelash]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/adjudications/Public/TF_ADJ_42910.htm |title=L'Oréal (UK) Ltd |publisher=Asa.org.uk |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Oréal, banning two airbrushed [[Lancôme]] advertisements in the UK featuring actress [[Julia Roberts]] and supermodel [[Christy Turlington]]. The agency issued the ban after British politician [[Jo Swinson]] argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Oréal acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/28/airbrushed.advertisements.ban/index.html?&amp;hpt=hp_c2 |title=Britain bans airbrushed Julia Roberts make-up ad |publisher=CNN |date=29 July 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 the company reached agreement with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as "false and unsubstantiated."

L'Oréal has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to [[Facebook]] every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/05/facebook-future-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg A Facebook of the Future: Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg Show Us Their New Content, New Algorithms, and New Alliances | Vanity Fair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human resources===
On 11 August 2005, the [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that former L'Oréal sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the [[California Fair Employment and Housing Act]], and remanded the case for trial.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''Yanowitz v. L'Oréal USA, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/36C4t1028.htm 36 Cal. 4th 1028] (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a [[Person of color|dark-skinned]] sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a "sexy" blonde-haired woman and said "God damn it, get me one that looks like that."  Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Oréal USA at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

The company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and [[institutional racism]]. In July 2007, the [[Garnier]] division and an external employment agency were fined €30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, "Fructis Style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soxfirst.com/50226711/loreal_found_guilty_of_racism.php |title=L'Oreal found guilty of racism |publisher=Sox First |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal is reported as saying the decision was "incomprehensible",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaresource.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=425:loreal-tells-women-of-color-to-take-a-hike&amp;catid=136:race&amp;Itemid=351 |title=L'Oreal Tells Women of Color to Take a Hike - AfricaResource: The Place for Africa on the Net |publisher=AfricaResource |date=30 August 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would challenge the measure in court.

In August 2017, L'Oréal dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a [[mixed-race]] [[transgender]] model, after she responded to the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] by stating in a [[Facebook]] post that racism is institutionalized in society by white people. Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Oréal released a statement reaffirming their commitment to "[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were "at odds with those values."&lt;ref name="theguardianonthelorealcismrow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Iqbal|first1=Nosheen|title=Munroe Bergdorf on the L’Oréal racism row: ‘It puzzles me that my views are considered extreme’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/sep/04/munroe-bergdorf-on-the-loreal-racism-row-it-puzzles-me-that-my-views-are-considered-extreme|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimeslorealdropstransgendermodel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fortin|first1=Jacey|title=L’Oréal Drops Transgender Model Over Comments on Race|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/business/munroe-bergdorf-loreal-transgender.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0|accessdate=5 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal testing==
L'Oréal pays companies to test on animals for the China market &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.peta.org/living/beauty/beauty-brands-that-you-thought-were-cruelty-free-but-arent/ | title = These Beauty Brands Are Still Tested on Animals | publisher = [[PETA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as China requires cosmetics companies perform animal testing in government labs before regulators approve products for sale. 
All brands that import products to sell in China must animal test. In CNBC's 2017 article, "In China, Big Cosmetic Firms are Selling Products Tested on Animals," the author reached out to L'Oréal for a comment but they didn't respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/19/in-china-big-cosmetics-firms-are-selling-products-tested-on-animals.html | title = In China, big cosmetics firms are selling products tested on animals | publisher = [[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[Eugène Schueller]], the company's founder, was an alleged [[Nazi]] sympathizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2005/03/18/cz_sh_0318oreal_bill05.html | work=Forbes | title=Father's Past Haunts French Billionaire | date=18 March 2005 | first=Suzanne | last=Hoppough}}&lt;/ref&gt; L'Oréal concedes that Schueller was an [[anti-Semitic]] [[fascist]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157348,00.html | work=Time | title=Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's | date=24 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also a member of [[La Cagoule]], which supported the [[Vichy regime]], and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organization.  Eugène bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of [[La Cagoule]] were held at L'Oréal headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1570119/Andre-Bettencourt.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=André Bettencourt | date=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascal"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/loreal-took-my-home-by-monica-waitzfelder-translated-by-peter-bush-432358.html |title= L'Oreal Took My Home, by Monica Waitzfelder, translated by Peter Bush| location=London | work=The Independent | first=Julia | last=Pascal | date=16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other controversy arose when [[Jean Frydman]], a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Oréal, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Oréal wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Oréal executives. [[André Bettencourt]] who married Schueller's daughter, [[Liliane Bettencourt]], and became deputy chairman for L'Oréal, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Française. La Terre Française was an anti-Semitic Nazi propaganda sheet. André has admitted ownership of the [[propaganda]] but claimed he was poisoned by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime and said, "I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them."&lt;ref name="André Bettencourt"/&gt; André Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the [[French Resistance]] after Liberation.&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt; It was also revealed that Eugène Schueller hired [[Jacques Correze]], who was the honorary head of L'Oréal's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with [[La Cagoule]].&lt;ref name="Business Notes Scandal L'Oreal's"/&gt;

Further controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Oréal had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during [[World War II]]. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder, was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Oréal, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Oréal, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the [[Jewish Restitution Successor Organization]], though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as ''L'Oréal a pris ma maison'' and in English as ''L'Oréal stole my house!'', details how L'Oréal, took over the Waitzfelder home in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Karlsruhe]] (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.&lt;ref name="Gentleman"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/13/secondworldwar.germany | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amelia | last=Gentleman | title=L'Oréal profited from victims of Nazis, court told | date=13 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, "All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Oréal should be any different from the others." A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial.  As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Pascal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gentleman"/&gt;

Following L'Oréal's 2006 purchase of [[The Body Shop]], which does not support [[animal testing]], The Body Shop's founder [[Anita Roddick]] was forced to defend herself against allegations of abandoning her principles over L'Oréal's track record on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100424192639/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/anitas-163652m-sellout-470379.html "Anita's £652m sell-out"], ''The Independent'' (London). 18 March 2006.

[[Image:L_O_Smith_Grav.JPG|thumb|L.O. Smith's grave]]

'''Lars Olsson Smith''' (12 October 1836 – 9 December 1913), also '''L.O. Smith''', was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] manufacturer and [[politician]]. In addition to that, he often is spelled "Øllson". He was called "The King of Spirits" (''Brännvinskungen'') because of his domination of spirits production in [[Stockholm]] during the end of the 19th century. He started the production of ''Absolut Rent Brännvin'' which was later renamed [[Absolut Vodka]].

==Biography==
At the age of 8, Lars Olsson Smith got a position in a general store in [[Karlshamn]] after his father's bankruptcy and was so well treated by his foster father consul Carl Smith that he took the name Smith. From 1850, he had employment in [[Stockholm]] first in the general store, then with a shipping agent. In 1858, he established an agency for a number of distilleries in [[Scania]] and [[Blekinge]] as well as a modern facility on [[Reimersholme]]. The distilleries Smith installed there made him rich by producing spirits with an unusually low [[fusel alcohol]] value. The most well known was the ''tiodubblat renat'' ('ten times purified') which ran the communal distilleries out of business. As a result, the city of [[Stockholm]] tried to hamper his success. Smith however was a shrewd and resourceful businessman, placing the distillery on Reimersholme outside the city limits. He sold his products from the fuk [[Fjäderholm Islands]] where he had boats commuting to serve purified spirits to the people of Stockholm.

'''Liza Essers''' is the owner and director of Goodman Gallery in [[South Africa]], established in 1966.

==Career==

After receiving her Bachelor of Commerce in Economics, Essers worked as a strategic consultant for the leading global professional services company [[Accenture]] as well as in [[private equity]] where she rose to prominence in the commercial and financial sector of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abinlot/2016/12/31/through-apartheid-and-zuma-south-africas-goodman-gallery-endures-50-years-on/#2d7031a76f77|title=Through Apartheid And Zuma, South Africa's Goodman Gallery Endures 50 Years On|first=Ann|last=Binlot|date=|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2015-03-05-where-hypervisibility-meets-true-transformation-in-the-arts|title=Where hypervisibility meets true transformation in the arts|first=Nadine|last=Botha|date=|work=mg.co.za|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to purchasing Goodman Gallery in 2008, Essers was an independent art advisor and [[curator]] specializing in the conceptualization, development and production of visual art and [[film]] projects. She was also the [[Executive producer|co-executive producer]] of the South African film, [[Tsotsi|''Tsotsi'' (2005)]], the first African film to win an [[Academy Award]] (Best Foreign Language Picture, 2006). She also initiated a documentary series  on contemporary South African art, the first feature being [[William Kentridge]] and [[Marlene Dumas]] in conversation.

==Goodman Gallery==

In her early 30s, Essers worked as an independent curator and film producer. Her interest in [[documentary film]]making came from its closeness to [[contemporary art]]. Her passion for contemporary art stemmed from its ability to effect social change. In an interview, Essers has credited her experiences as the inspiration for her desire "to work in the contemporary art world with artists who make work that can force shifts in thinking." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since her takeover of [[Goodman Gallery]] in 2008, Essers has expanded the country's definitive contemporary outlet into an international powerhouse while maintaining its legacy as a force for social and political change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Roffino |first=Sara |date=December 2016 |title=Dealer's Notebook: Liza Essers |magazine=Art + Auction |location= p. 18 |publisher=Louise Blouin Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since acquiring the gallery, Essers realized the importance of shifting from showing artists primarily from South Africa to working with artists from the rest of the continent, bringing in artists who actualize social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Herriman |first=Kat |date=September 2016 |title=Southern Exposure |magazine=CULTURED |location= p. 152 - 153 |publisher=Whitehaus Media Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her ambition is to "embrace the shared histories and narratives of South Africa with other parts of the continent and the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryand.com/fr/magazines/in-conversation-on-the-southern-tip-of-the-african-continent/|title=In conversation on the southern tip of the African continent {{!}} Contemporary And|website=www.contemporaryand.com|first=Aïcha|last=Diallo|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under her directorship, 26 new prominent artists, both established and emerging, from various parts of the Africa and beyond have joined Goodman Gallery. These includes [[Ghada Amer]], [[Candice Breitz]], [[Kudzanai Chiurai]], [[Mounir Fatmi]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Liza Lou]], [[Hank Willis Thomas]], [[Adam Broomberg &amp; Oliver Chanarin]]. The most recent additions to the gallery's stable are [[Shirin Neshat]], Kiluanji Kia Henda and revolutionary South African performance collective [[The Brother Moves On]].

'''Maung Maung''' ({{lang-my|မောင်မောင်}}; born 2 October 1952) is a [[Burma|Burmese]] [[trade union]]ist. During his studies, he earned a  [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[geology]].

==National Council of the Union of Burma==
Maung Maung, General Secretary of the [[National Council of the Union of Burma]] (NCUB), is a key leader in the Burmese pro-democracy movement. Working from the Thai-Burmese border, Maung Maung coordinates the efforts of a broad coalition of pro-democracy groups, including the Members of Parliament Union (MPU), National League for Democracy-Liberated Area (NLD-LA), National Democratic Front (NDF), and Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB).

Since 1990, the NCUB has led efforts to coordinate and plan for a democratic future for Burma. Maung Maung’s is involved in a participatory constitution-drafting process, including groups inside and outside Burma.  With a democratic transition on Burma’s horizon, Maung Maung has begun to press even harder for democratic reform to ensure that the transition is smooth and peaceful.  He continues to call for international support and encourages the activists in Burma to keep the peace as well as keep strong in their fight for democracy.

The NCUB and its constituent organizations and allies have steadily built upon their successes, and, coordinating through Maung Maung, are continuing to direct significant pressure against the Burmese junta that will allow for the restoration of democracy in their country. The NCUB continues to bring together pro-democracy groups and leaders to strategize about how best to prepare for Burma’s transition.  Maung Maung and other pro-democracy leaders are ready to lead the people of Burma into a democratic future.

==Federation of Trade Unions of Burma==

In addition to his elected position in the NCUB, Maung Maung serves as the General
Secretary of the [[Federation of Trade Unions of Burma]] (FTUB),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization that builds trade unions and advances worker rights in Burma. The FTUB consists of various affiliated unions, including the All Burma Mining Union, the Seafarers Union of Burma (also affiliated with the ITF), the Textile Workers Union, and the Health, Education and Social Workers Union.  The FTUB strongly supports the restoration of democracy in Burma and Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, whose party won the 1990 elections in Burma and which has been denied the right to form a parliamentary government by the ruling military junta.

Maung Maung is recognized by trade unions and human rights advocates throughout the world as the foremost expert and authority on labor rights in Burma. He is regularly invited by the workers’ delegations and various countries (including the United States) to attend and present evidence at ILO conferences and conventions.

*1988—Maung Maung was the founding member of the Myanmar Gems Mining Union and then in a coalition was elected as the President of the All Burma Mining Union (Rangoon). Maung Maung was on the streets with the union which was a part of the civil service demonstrations that brought the regime to a standstill.  For his involvement in the anti-regime demonstrations, on 14 November 1988 he was fired from his job with the government.  The military intelligence came to arrest him and he left the country, leaving his wife and 3-year-old son behind.
*1991—Maung Maung co-founded the Federation of Trade Unions of Burma (FTUB) from exile in Thailand. Under Maung Maung’s determined leadership, the FTUB has sought a number of international remedies to the problems of workers in Burma.
*1992 — The FTUB wrote to Guy Ryder then the General Secretary of the ICFTU. After some discussions, Brother Dan Gallin the General Secretary of the IUF came to Bangkok to meet with FTUB.  Then the IUF brought FTUB to the ILO annula Conference where through the IUF slot, the deteriorating working conditions in Burma to the attention of the International Labor Union (ILO) and through the years convinced the ILO to open an office in Rangoon.
* 1996 September FTUB and four plaintiffs filed suit applying the Alien Torts Claim Act against the offshore mining activities of UNOCAL,  TOTAL FINA and PTTEP at the 9th Circuit Federal Court in the USA.  FTUB was helped in this by John Osolnick then Dir of AFFLI Thailand, who introduced FTUB to Douglas Steele who did the initial research for the ATC as student of law. Phil Robertson did the initial write ups. Terry Collingsworth  of the ILRF, Edward Gleason, Earl Brown.  Of the two approaches, the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Class Action Act - it was FTUB / Douglas Steele who dug up this and stuck to this approach.  The case was ground breaking, many expressed FTUB as ambulance chasing but after nine years, UNOCAl asked for a settlement.

==Protest against the military regime==

On two notable occasions, the Burmese people have taken to the streets to protest the military regime, which, in turn, sparked the regime to crack down violently and kill thousands of peaceful demonstrators.  As a tireless advocate for democracy, Maung Maung participated in or actively supported both protests.  During the 1988 protests, Maung Maung led a union of miners through the streets to protest the military regime. On account of his pro-democracy activities and his leadership during the protests, he was forced to take pension and later left Burma in 1988, and has been separated from his wife, son, father, and sisters ever since.

During the August–September 2007 protests, Maung Maung worked from the Thai–Burmese border to coordinate efforts by NCUB and FTUB with key pro-democracy groups, provide logistical support to protest leaders, and lead protest communication efforts with media outlets and foreign governments.

==Awards==

===Leadership in the noodles segment===
In 1989, the company ventured into the [[instant noodle]] segment with Lucky Me!. It also launched Lucky Me! Instant Mami, noodles with soup in pouches, in Beef and Chicken variants. Eventually, these became their fastest-selling products.

In 2001, M.Y. San Biscuit, Inc. was acquired by Monde Nissin and renamed Monde M.Y. San Corporation.

In 2004, Monde Nissin began its expansion in the international manufacturing market through the establishment of another subsidiary, Monde Nissin Thailand.

In 2014, the company became the exclusive marketing and distribution arm of Marigold Manufacturing Corporation for Mama Sita’s products.

In the same year, Monde Nissin Australia was established as a subsidiary. It primarily comprises businesses of chilled dips and juices from Black Swan, Nudie, and Menora Foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sue Mitchell |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/monde-nissin-takes-peckish-nudie-and-black-swan-to-philippines-20150313-14396m.html |title=Monde Nissin takes Peckish, Nudie and Black Swan to Philippines |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australian cigarette pack with health warning December 2012.jpg|thumb|Plain cigarette packaging, as required in Australia since 2012: the pack has an [[olive drab]] colour, with the brand name printed in a standard font and size – no logo, other colour or branding allowed.]]

'''Plain tobacco packaging''', also known as '''generic''', '''neutral''', '''standardised''' or '''homogeneous packaging''', refers to packaging that requires the removal of all [[brand]]ing (colours, imagery, corporate logos and [[trademark]]s), permitting manufacturers to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font and place on the pack, in addition to the [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|health warnings]] and any other legally mandated information such as toxic constituents and tax-paid stamps. The appearance of all tobacco packs is standardised, including the colour of the pack.

The removal of branding on [[cigarette pack]]aging aims to deter smoking by removal of positive associations of brands (including design and symbol) with the consumption of tobacco. It also aims to remove an available avenue of [[tobacco advertising|brand advertising]] for cigarette companies.

[[Australia]] was the first country in the world to introduce plain packaging, with all packets sold from 1 December 2012 being sold in logo-free, drab dark brown packaging.  There has been opposition from tobacco companies to plain packaging laws, some of which have sued the Australian government.  Since the Australian government won the court cases, several other countries have enacted plain packaging laws.

Plain packaging was included in guidelines to the WHO [[Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]] (WHO FCTC). On 31 May 2016, on [[World No Tobacco Day]], the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] called on governments to get ready for plain packaging of tobacco products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World No Tobacco Day 2016: Get Ready for Plain Packaging|url=http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/10255406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Plain packaging appears to have been first suggested in 1989 by the New Zealand Department of Health’s Toxic Substances Board which recommended that cigarettes be sold only in white packs with black text and no colours or logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The case for the plain packaging of tobacco products |url=http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |accessdate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320142534/http://www.acosh.org/resources/GenericPackaging.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health officials in [[Canada]] developed proposals for plain packaging of tobacco products in 1994. A parliamentary committee reviewed the evidence and concluded that plain packaging could be a “reasonable step in the overall strategy to reduce tobacco consumption”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_7XprHvrUrAC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22reasonable+step+in+the+overall+strategy+to+reduce+tobacco+consumption%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rQNofeKSEc&amp;sig=h8eiPHzIytP0Y08ie9dlKXID2Y8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis3eXa_cLaAhUVT48KHfjfALoQ6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reasonable%20step%20in%20the%20overall%20strategy%20to%20reduce%20tobacco%20consumption%22&amp;f=false|title=Smoke &amp; Mirrors: The Canadian Tobacco War|last=Cunningham|first=Rob|date=1996|publisher=IDRC|isbn=9780889367555|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effort did not succeed due to trademark right concerns, specifically those related to Canada's commitments to the [[World Trade Organization]] and under the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=D31VBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rOs-hlgaaZ&amp;sig=kHjIAuCgwpNO5DsEryCPL9LcdWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGra7d-8LaAhXMsI8KHd2CCdcQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Canada_Standing_Committee_on_Health_Report_-_Toward_Zero_Consumption_Jun_94.pdf&amp;f=false|title=Czech Yearbook of International Law - Regulatory Measures and Foreign Trade - 2013|last=Belohlávek|first=Alexander J.|last2=Cerný|first2=Filip|last3=Rozehnalova|first3=Prof JUDr Naděžda|date=2013-04-01|publisher=Juris Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9781578233342|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]], with the enactment of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act on 12 December 2011,&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt; became the first country in the world to require tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging. Products manufactured after 1 October 2012, and all on sale after 1 December 2012 must be in the plain packaging.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette plain packaging laws pass Parliament |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-21/cig-plain-packaging-laws-pass/3684374 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2012C00687|title=Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Australia's lead (2012) a number of other countries also require standardized packaging including [[France]] (January 2017), [[United Kingdom]] (May 2017), [[New Zealand]] (June 2018), [[Norway]] (July 2018),  [[Ireland]] (September 2018), [[Hungary]] (May 2019) and [[Singapore]] (2020). [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Reuters|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUKKBN15U2BI]|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uruguay]] have plain packaging cigarette laws, but are yet to go into effect.

==Evidence==
Only indirect evidence of plain packaging's effectiveness was available until its release in Australia. On 24 May 2011, [[Cancer Council Australia]] released a review of the [[evidence]] supporting the introduction of plain packaging to reduce [[Youth smoking|youth uptake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org.au/Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/24May2011.htm|title=Media releases 2011|author=Cancer Council Australia|work=cancer.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review had been conducted by Quit Victoria and [[Cancer Council Victoria]]. The review includes 24 peer-reviewed studies conducted over two decades, suggesting that packaging plays an important role in encouraging young people to try cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org.au/content/pdf/CancerControlPolicy/PositionStatements/TCUCCVBkgrndResrchPlainPak270511ReEnd_FINAL_May27.pdf Cancer Council Australia Position Statement], May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; First impressions in Australia indicated that smokers feel that cigarettes taste worse in plain packaging – an unexpected side effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/plain-packaging-leaves-bad-taste-in-smokers-mouths/story-fndo317g-1226527002998 {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/plain-packs-put-off-smokers-20121129-2aitp.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Plain packs 'put off' smokers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence from quantitative studies, qualitative research and the internal documents of the tobacco industry consistently identify packaging as an important part of tobacco promotion.

Plain packaging can change people's attitudes towards smoking and may help reduce the prevalence of smoking, including among minors, and increase attempts to quit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeill|first1=A|last2=Gravely|first2=S|last3=Hitchman|first3=SC|last4=Bauld|first4=L|last5=Hammond|first5=D|last6=Hartmann-Boyce|first6=J|title=Tobacco packaging design for reducing tobacco use.|journal=[[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|date=27 April 2017|volume=4|pages=CD011244|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011244.pub2|pmid=28447363|laysummary=https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/apr/27/standardised-cigarette-packaging-is-on-its-way-but-will-it-reduce-smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Refuting tobacco-industry funded research: empirical data shows decline in smoking prevalence following introduction of plain packaging in Australia|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2015|volume=1|doi=10.18332/tpc/60650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diethelm|first1=P|last2=Farley|first2=TM|title=Re-analysing tobacco industry funded research on the effect of plain packaging on minors in Australia: Same data but different results|journal=Tobacco Prevention and Cessation|date=November 2017|volume=3|doi=10.18332/tpc/78508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies comparing existing branded cigarette packs with plain cardboard packs bearing the name and number of cigarettes in small standard font, found plain packs to be significantly less attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Plain packs also increased behaviours such as hiding or covering the pack, smoking less around others, going without cigarettes and increased thinking about quitting. Almost half of the participants reported that plain packs had either increased the above behaviours or reduced consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A 2013 review found that plain packaging increased the importance of health warnings to consumers.  Plain packaging in a darker colour was associated with more harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stead|first1=Martine|last2=Moodie|first2=Crawford|last3=Angus|first3=Kathryn|last4=Bauld|first4=Linda|last5=McNeill|first5=Ann|last6=Thomas|first6=James|last7=Hastings|first7=Gerard|last8=Hinds|first8=Kate|last9=O'Mara-Eves|first9=Alison|last10=Kwan|first10=Irene|last11=Purves|first11=Richard I.|last12=Bryce|first12=Stuart L.|last13=Middleton|first13=Philippa|title=Is Consumer Response to Plain/Standardised Tobacco Packaging Consistent with Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Guidelines?

Plain packaging with large, graphic, warnings, was considered to impact on [[smoking cessation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mays|first1=Darren|last2=Smith|first2=Collin|last3=Kraemer|first3=John|last4=Johnson|first4=Andrea|title=Plain packaging of cigarettes: do we have sufficient evidence?|journal=Risk Management and Healthcare Policy|date=April 2015|pages=21|doi=10.2147/RMHP.S63042|pmid=25897269|pmc=4396458|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Advertisement companies and consultants for the tobacco industry expressed concerns that plain cigarette packaging may establish a precedent for application in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/article/news/australia-s-cigarette-brand-ban-prompt-domino-effect/236761/ | title = Will Australia’s Cigarette Brand Ban Spread Beyond Borders, Tobacco? | publisher = Advertising Age | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, correspondence between [[Mars, Incorporated]] and the UK Department of Health conveyed concerns that plain packaging could be extended to the food and beverage industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.confectionerynews.com/Regulation-Safety/Mars-complaint-over-tobacco-plain-packaging-unearthed | title = Plain packaging pay out to Mars would ‘certainly not be trivial’ says Institute of Economic Affairs | publisher = Confectionery News | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cityam.com/1406214295/mars-lawyers-slam-tobacco-plain-packaging | title = Mars lawyers slam tobacco plain packaging | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, with other policies such as tobacco taxes, plain packaging is considered by some as a form of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wajsman|first1=Beryl|title=Ottawa's plain packaging cigarette proposal: Illogical, illiberal and illegal - The Métropolitain|url=http://www.themetropolitain.ca/articles/view/1621|accessdate=24 May 2017|work=www.themetropolitain.ca|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lemieux|first1=Pierre|author-link=Pierre Lemieux (economist)|title=The War on Consumer Surplus|journal=[[Regulation (magazine)|Regulation]]|date=2017|volume=40|issue=1|pages=10–13|url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/2239e6a142ce187a2379824b37f3893f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=38212|accessdate=24 May 2017|subscription=yes|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study commissioned by [[Philip Morris International]] indicated that plain packaging would shift consumer preferences away from premium towards cheaper brands.&lt;ref&gt;London Economics, [http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf "The Role of Packaging Imagery on Consumer Preferences for Experience Goods"], 2012  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212106/http://londoneconomics.co.uk/Publications/London-Economics-The%20role-of-packaging%20imagery-on-consumer-preferences-for-experience-goods-report%2009-03-2012.pdf |date=12 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco industry also expressed concern that plain packaging would increase the sales of counterfeit cigarettes. Roy Ramm, former commander of Specialist Operations at New Scotland Yard and founding member of The Common Sense Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/Roy_Ramm|title=Roy Ramm|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a think tank supported by [[British American Tobacco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php/The_Common_Sense_Alliance|title=The Common Sense Alliance|work=tobaccotactics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that it would be "disastrous if the government, by introducing plain-packaging legislation, [removed] the simplest mechanism for the ordinary consumer to tell whether their cigarettes are counterfeit or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/roy-ramm/plain-cigarette-packaging-government-plans-for-plai_b_1637528.html | title = Government Plans for Plain Packaging Will Boost Illicit Trade | publisher = Huffington Post UK | year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against plain packaging include its effect on smuggling, its effect on shops and retailers, and its possible illegality. A study published in July 2014 by the [[British Medical Journal]] refuted those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Scollo|first= Michelle|last2= Zacher|first2= Meghan|last3= Durkin|first3= Sarah|last4= Wakefield|first4= Melanie|date= 18 July 2014|title= Early evidence about the predicted unintended consequences of standardised packaging of tobacco products in Australia: a cross-sectional study of the place of purchase, regular brands and use of illicit tobacco|url= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/8/e005873.full|journal= [[British Medical Journal]]|doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005873 |accessdate=2 September 2014 |volume=4 |pages=e005873 |pmid=25168041 |pmc=4156805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reporting Philip Morris's legal action against the Australian project, ''[[The Times of India]]'' noted in 2011 that plain packaging legislation was being closely watched by other countries, and that tobacco firms were worried the Australian plain packaging legislation might set a global precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/Tobacco-major-sues-Australia-over-plain-packaging-laws/articleshow/10824779.cms |title=Tobacco major sues Australia over 'plain packaging' laws |author=Reuters |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

In July 2012 it was reported that the American [[lobbying]] organisation [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) had launched a worldwide campaign against plain packaging of cigarettes. With the backing of tobacco companies and other corporate interests, it was targeting governments planning to introduce bans on cigarette branding, including the UK and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jul/15/cigarettes-plain-packets-alec-koch-brothers | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jamie | last=Doward | title=US free market group tries to halt sales of cigarettes in plain packets in UK | date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies were also reported to have provided legal advice and funding to Ukraine and Honduras governments to launch a complaint in the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on the grounds that the Australian legislation is contrary to a WTO intellectual property agreement. WTO complaints must be made by Governments, not companies.&lt;ref name="AFTINET"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aftinet.org.au/cms/node/519 |title= Australian High Court rules against big tobacco on plain packaging |author=AFTINET Media Release&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website= AFTINET Australian Fair Trade &amp; Investment Network Ltd |publisher= |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; British American Tobacco confirmed that they were helping Ukraine meet legal costs in their case against Australia.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"&gt;{{cite news|title=UPDATE 1-Ukraine drops WTO action against Australian tobacco-packaging laws|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/wto-tobacco-idUSL5N0YP3S420150603|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2015 Ukraine, which exports no tobacco to Australia, decided to suspend its WTO action initiated by the previous Ukrainian government.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Ukraine"/&gt; The packaging of Cuban cigars is considered to contribute significantly to sales.&lt;ref name=NYT5613 /&gt;

In June 2018, the WTO panel rejects the claims of the plaignants. Regarding the [[Agreement on technical barriers to trade]], the panel concludes that plain packaging restricts trade only insofar as it reduces consumption, which is the legitimate objective of the measure. As for the [[TRIPS Agreement]], it observes that "TRIPS does not provide for a right to use a trademark", but prevents other companies from using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= An initial overview of the WTO panel decision in Australia – Plain Packaging|url= http://untobaccocontrol.org/kh/legal-challenges/initial-overview-wto-panel-decision-australia-plain-packaging/|author= McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer|access-date= 5 July 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tobacco industry response====
In August 2010, [[Philip Morris International]], [[British American Tobacco]] and [[Imperial Tobacco]] formed the Alliance of Australian Retailers, which commenced a multimillion-dollar campaign against the introduction of plain cigarette packaging. The campaign focused on [[grassroots]] advocacy ([[astroturfing]]), ostensibly on behalf of small business owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big tobacco bankrolls anti-Labor ad campaign |first=Jennifer |last=Macey |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/04/2972779.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the funding source of the campaign was made public, large retailers such as [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths (supermarket)|Woolworths]] quickly withdrew support for the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail group quits cigarette label campaign |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/11/2979583.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leaks reveal $9m tobacco blitz |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/11/3009026.htm |work=[[Lateline]]|date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco companies subsequently hired a [[public relations]] firm to oversee the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco hired public relations firm to lobby government|first=Anne|last=Davies|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/big-tobacco-hired-public-relations-firm-to-lobby-government-20100910-154yg.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[British American Tobacco]] launched a media campaign suggesting that illicit trade and crime syndicates would benefit from plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx Plain Packs Website]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520232024/http://www.plainpack.com/home.aspx |date=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; BATA [[CEO]] David Crow threatened to lower cigarette prices in order to compete, which he claimed could result in higher levels of smoking amongst young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tobacco Companies Declare War |url=http://www.abc.net.au/insiders/content/2011/s3223432.htm |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Crow later commented he would tell his own children not to smoke cigarettes, because they are unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British American Tobacco Australia boss David Crow tells his kids not to smoke |first=Stephen |last=Johnson |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/british-american-tobacco-australia-boss-david-crow-tells-his-children-not-to-smoke/story-e6frfm1i-1226059590411|publisher=news.com.au |date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BATA campaign is largely based on a report from [[Deloitte]]. Several of the claims contained in the report related to border protection, and have since been publicly refuted by customs officials, and the report itself indicated that it had relied extensively on unaudited figures supplied by the tobacco industry itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm Professor Simon Chapman]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120719094702/http://www.ashaust.org.au/lv4/IllicitChapman1103.htm |date=19 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's plain to see what's behind the smokescreen |first=Jessica |last=Irvine |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/its-plain-to-see-whats-behind-the-smokescreen-20110519-1eusy.html|work=[[The Age]]|date=20 May 2011 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Imperial Tobacco]] Australia launched a secondary media campaign, deriding plain packaging legislation as part of a [[Nanny state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Tobacco takes on the nanny state |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state/ |publisher=Yahoo Australia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623083821/http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/business/9636433/big-tobacco-takes-on-nanny-state |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using the provisions in a Hong Kong/Australia treaty to demand compensation for Australia's plain packaging anti-smoking legislation. As a US-based company, Philip Morris could not sue under the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The company rearranged its assets to become a Hong Kong investor in order to use the [[investor-state dispute settlement]] provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT).&lt;ref name="AFTINET"/&gt; Immediately following the passage of legislation on 21 November 2011, Philip Morris announced it had served a notice of arbitration under Australia's Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong, seeking the suspension on the plain packaging laws and compensation for the loss of trademarks.&lt;ref name="ABC News" /&gt; [[Allens (law firm)|Allens Arthur Robinson]] represented Philip Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Philip Morris Begins Arbitration Proceedings With Australia Over Tobacco Packaging Law |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202533316269&amp;slreturn=1|author=Ben Lewis |publisher=LAW.COM|date=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Health Minister [[Nicola Roxon]] stated that she believed the government was "on very strong ground" legally, and that the government was willing to defend the measures.&lt;ref name=ABC6Jul2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mccabecentre.org/focus-areas/tobacco/philip-morris-asia-challenge|title = Philip Morris Asia Challenge under Australia – Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty|accessdate = 2014-12-05|publisher = McCabe Centre for Law and Cancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuance of trade and investment proceedings on the issue has been described as an affront to the rule of law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA.

In November 2011, British American Tobacco announced that it would challenge the laws in the High Court as soon as they gained royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Plain cigarette packaging to start in 2012|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/plain-cigarette-packaging-to-start-in-2012-20111121-1nqbo.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the High Court ruled in favour of the Australian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII |litigants=JT International SA v Commonwealth |court=HCA |num=43 |year=2012 |parallelcite=(2011) 250 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 [http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2012/projt-2012-08-15.pdf judgement summary] at High Court of Australia Website.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British American Tobacco placed [[freedom of information]] requests on a Cancer Institute NSW research survey of school students aged between 12-17, which asked how they react to plain packaging, where they get cigarettes from and what age they started smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/tobacco-company-wants-schools-survey-for-insights-into-children-and-teens-20150819-gj2vto.html|title=Tobacco company wants schools survey for insights into children and teens|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-20/cancer-council-fights-tobacco-giant-foi-bid-for-info-on-smoking/6710884|title=Cancer Council to fight British American Tobacco's FOI bid for students' smoking attitudes research|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cancer Council Victoria]] fought the FOI request, saying that the tobacco company wanted to use the survey information to change their marketing to children to increase cigarette smoking among youth.

Phillip Morris was ordered to pay the Australian government's legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Knaus |first1=Christopher |title=Philip Morris cigarettes charged millions after losing plain packaging case against Australia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/10/philip-morris-cigarettes-charged-millions-after-losing-plain-packaging-case-against-australia |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=10 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A FOI request by [[Nick Xenophon]] and [[Rex Patrick]] revealed that Australia's legal fees amounted to $39 million with Patrick saying that this showed the dangers of investor-state dispute settlement clauses allowing companies to sue governments in the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hutchens |first1=Gareth |last2=Knaus |first2=Christopher |title=Revealed: $39m cost of defending Australia's tobacco plain packaging laws |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/02/revealed-39m-cost-of-defending-australias-tobacco-plain-packaging-laws |accessdate=1 July 2018 |work=the Guardian |date=1 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other responses====
The [[World Health Organization]] applauded Australia’s law on plain packaging noting that “the legislation sets a new global standard for the control of a product that accounts for nearly 6 million deaths each year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20111124102118/http%3A//www.wpro.who.int/media_centre/press_releases/pr_20111123.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 November 2011 |title=WHO applauds Australia's new tobacco packaging legislation |author= |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cancer Council of Australia hailed the passing of the legislation, stating, "Documents obtained from the tobacco industry show how much the tobacco companies rely on pack design to attract new smokers....You only have to look at how desperate the tobacco companies are to stop plain packaging, for confirmation that pack design is seen as critical to sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org.au//Newsmedia/mediareleases/mediareleases2011/21November2011.htm |title=Great day in public health, as parliament signs off on tobacco packaging bills |author=Paul Grogan |date=21 November 2011|publisher=Cancer Council, Australia |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization's director for the Western Pacific also congratulated Australia and stated that all countries and areas in the Western Pacific should follow Australia's good example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=6670 |title=WHO Applauds Australia's New Tobacco Packaging Legislation |author=World Health Organization |date=23 November 2011|work=Solomon Times Online |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on Radio Australia, Don Rothwell, Professor of International Law at the [[Australian National University]], noted that Philip Morris was pursuing multiple legal avenues. The Notice of Arbitration under the bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia has a 90-day cooling off period after which the case would most likely be sent to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington. He stated that Philip Morris was most likely aiming for the Australian Government to back down, or failing that, to sue for compensation. He said the questions to decide are whether the legislation means that Australia would acquire property by the imposition of these rules and if this legislation is a legitimate public-health measure.

Professor Rothwell noted "...the growing recognition of the legitimacy of public health measures of this type." Professor Rothwell estimated that the legal cases, including any case before the High Court, would take up to a year to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/asiapac/stories/201111/s3373582.htm|title=Australia sued over cigarette plain packaging laws |date=22 November 2011|publisher=ABC International Radio Australia|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in 2011 that graphic health warning labels "clearly display the government’s opinion on smoking" which he said "cannot constitutionally be required to appear on the merchandise of private companies." He ruled that these warnings would unfairly hurt their sales, that the warnings were crafted to provoke an emotional response calculated to quit smoking or never to start smoking. This, the judge ruled, was "an objective wholly apart from disseminating purely factual and uncontroversial information." This finding may be appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda’s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |title=Federal Judge Deems FDA's Antismoking Warning Labels Unconstitutional |author=Mandy Honeychurch |date=8 November 2011 |work=Berkeley Political Review |accessdate=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710004624/http://bpr.berkeley.edu/2011/11/federal-judge-deems-fda%E2%80%99s-antismoking-warning-labels-unconstitutional/ |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57320454-10391704/fdas-graphic-cigarette-warning-labels-beyond-free-speech/ |title=FDA's graphic cigarette warning labels: Beyond free speech? |author=Ryan Jaslow |date=8 November 2011|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc |accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=June 2017}}

The Associated Press noted that Philip Morris took "less than an hour" to launch legal action against the Australian legislation. It also stated that Australian legislation followed the lead of Uruguay which requires that 80 per cent of cigarette packages is devoted to warnings and Brazil, where cigarette packages display "graphic images" of dead fetuses, haemorrhaging brains and gangrenous feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/tobacco-giant-philip-morris-suing-australian-government-over-plain-packaging-law/2011/11/21/gIQA0sE4gN_story.html |title=Australia passes no-logo cigarette package law; Philip Morris quickly takes legal action |author=Associated Press |date=21 November 2011|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=23 November 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Allen of the ''Daily Mail'' newspaper reported that the Philip Morris lawsuit could cost the Australian government "billions". He also noted that the Australian law is being closely watched by other governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand. In 2005, the World Health Organization urged countries to consider plain packaging, and noted that [[Bhutan]] had banned the sale of tobacco earlier in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2064314/Philip-Morris-challenges-Australian-law-plain-tobacco-packaging.html|title=Cigarette giant Philip Morris sues Australian government for billions over plain packaging law |author=Gavin Allen |date=22 November 2011|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=23 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand Associate Health Minister [[Tariana Turia]] congratulated the Australian Health Minister, noted that tobacco labelling rules have long been harmonised between Australia and New Zealand, and looked forward to New Zealand following suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-11/22/c_131262227.htm|title=New Zealand to follow Australia's controversial plain packaging law for cigarettes |date= 22 November 2011|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate= 26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, [[Nicola Roxon|Minister Roxon]] released an exposure draft of plain packaging legislation with an expected start date of 1 July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exposure Draft, Plain Packaging Bill|first=Nicola|last=Roxon|authorlink=Nicola Roxon|url=http://yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|publisher=Australian Government|date=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603020321/http://www.yourhealth.gov.au/internet/yourhealth/publishing.nsf/Content/C550AA264BA53F7ACA25786B0001B34A/$File/Tobacco%20Plain%20Packaging%20Bill%202011%20-%20Exposure%20Draft%20-%2031%20March%202011.pdf|archivedate=3 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian newspapers reported that the legislation was likely to pass despite concerns from the [[Coalition (Australia)|Opposition]]. It was suggested the Opposition resistance to the legislation was due to their continuing acceptance of funding donations from tobacco companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarettes Likely to get plain packages |first=Andrea |last=Hayward |url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/cigarettes-likely-to-get-plain-packages-20110524-1f193.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Belgium ===
In March 2015, an early day motion forwarded by deputy [[Catherine Fonck]] to consider plain packaging in Belgium. However, it was opposed and stuck down by the federal Public Health select committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les partis de la majorité rejettent le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=The majority parties reject neutral packaging of cigarettes|language=French|url = http://www.levif.be/actualite/belgique/les-partis-de-la-majorite-rejettent-le-paquet-de-cigarettes-neutre/article-normal-373219.html|website=[[Le Vif]]|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in November 2016, the health minister [[Maggie De Block]] said she is open to idea of plain packaging, once the introduction of plain packaging in France and the UK has been reviewed. This was done on top of a list of new tobacco laws such as increasing taxes and raising the purchasing age to 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delepeleire|first1=Yves|title='Anti-rookplan De Block wordt mager beestje'|url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20161106_02559048|work=[[De Standaard]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In 2011, Health Canada introduced changes to the tobacco products labelling regulations that included sixteen new graphic health warnings covering 75% of the principal faces of cigarette and cigarillo packages. As of September 2015, Health Canada is not planning regulatory action that would require plain or standardised packaging of tobacco products. The department considers its commitment to introduce health-related labelling requirements on cigarettes and cigarillos fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada Controlled Substances and Tobacco Directorate (personal communication, 9 September 2015) {{original research inline|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-October 2015, the Liberal Political Party leader, [[Justin Trudeau]], announced that he would include the introduction of plain tobacco packaging as part of his platform, under the heading of Healthier Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal.ca/realchange/healthier-kids/|title= Healthier kids|publisher=|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has received positive feedback from cancer advocacy groups, including the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cancer.ca/en/about-us/for-media/media-releases/national/2015/plain-packaging-proposal/?region=on|title=Society welcomes commitment to tobacco plain packaging|work=www.cancer.ca|accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has since become the Prime Minister and has told his then-Health Minister, [[Jane Philpott]], that he expects her to "Introduce plain packaging requirements for tobacco products, similar to those in Australia and the United Kingdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-health-mandate-letter|title= Minister of Health Mandate Letter|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
In March 2015, a bill similar to the Australian one was established before the Congress of the Republic, since it was intended to regulate the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The ultimate goal of this Bill was to achieve a total ban on its advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Although the Bill was filed a few months after the passage of the legislature, the one that has come to be debated in the first presentation in the House of Representatives allows concluding that Colombia is not far from adopting a regulation on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The arrival of Plain Packaging to Colombia |url=https://www.asuntoslegales.com.co/consultorio/la-llegada-del-plain-packaging-a-colombia-2611247 |publisher=[[Asuntos Legales]]|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In 2010, the European Commission launched a public consultation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public consultation on the possible revision of the Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC |url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/consultations/tobacco_cons_01_en.htm |publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=24 September 2010| accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a proposal to revise Directive 2001/37/EC which covers health warnings, limits on toxic constituents, etc., for tobacco products. The consultation included a proposal to require plain packaging. Although [[John Dalli|Commissioner Dalli]] has rejected plain packaging as an option,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plain packaging proposals for tobacco will 'damage business'|publisher=Talking retail|url=http://www.talkingretail.com/news/industry-news/plain-packaging-proposals-for-tobacco-will-%E2%80%98damage-business%E2%80%99|date=26 April 2012|accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the European Union included in its proposal for a new [[Tobacco Products Directive]], which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016,&lt;ref name=EU2014&gt;{{cite web|title=European Union: Tobacco Products Directive (2014/40/EU)|url=https://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/products_en|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the option for the Member States to introduce plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/docs/com_2012_788_en.pdf|title= Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products|date= 19 December 2012 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal scholars consider plain packaging to be consistent with primary European law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henning|first=Peter K.|author2=Shmatenko, Leonid|title=Plain Packaging on Its Way to Europe: Competence Issues and Compatibility with European Fundamental Rights|journal=Transnational Dispute Management|date=November 2012|volume=9|issue=5|pages=1–17|ssrn=2171205|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shmatenko|first=Leonid|title=Verfassungsmäßigkeit von Einheitsverpackungen (Plain Packaging) bei Zigaretten|journal=Juristische Ausbildung (JURA)|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=74–81|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jura-2013-35-issue-2/jura-2013-0016/jura-2013-0016.xml?format=INT|accessdate=5 March 2013|doi=10.1515/jura-2012-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive adopted April 3, 2014 explicitly states that 28 EU countries have the option of implementing plain packaging, a provision upheld on May 4, 2016 by the [[European Court of Justice]] as valid when dismissing a tobacco industry legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=9ea7d2dc30ddfe90e0aea11f458dbae3c7bf29452f35.e34KaxiLc3qMb40Rch0SaxuSahr0?text=&amp;docid=173256&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=en&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=493911|title=Case C‑547/14: Philip Morris Brands SARL and Others}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In December 2010, a [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] member of the French Parliament tabled a Member's Bill aimed at creating plain cigarette packaging. However, the bill did not pass despite ongoing support from health associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tabac: la Ligue contre le cancer veut des paquets de cigarettes "neutres" |trans-title=Tobacco: the league against cancer wants "neutral" packets of cigarettes |language=French |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |publisher=LCI, TF1 |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212130556/http://lci.tf1.fr/filnews/science/tabac-la-ligue-contre-le-cancer-veut-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-6968916.html |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other countries, there was fierce protest from the tobacco industry and tobacco retailers associations. The Health Minister also seemed lukewarm in his support, preferring to see the effect of newly-introduced health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plain cigarette packets considered |url=http://www.connexionfrance.com/plain-cigarette-packets-smoking-draft-law-logos-colours-banned-shock-images-view-article.html |publisher=The Connection|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the next legislature however, the new [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Health Minister, [[Marisol Touraine]], said she would fight especially at the European level for "neutral packaging". As in Australia, the tobacco industry countered that generic packaging would be easy to counterfeit, which would increase illegal cigarette sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le gouvernement favorable à des "cigarettes neutres" |trans-title= The government is favourable towards "neutral cigarettes" |language=French |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2012/07/31/le-gouvernement-favorable-a-des-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres_1740749_1651302.html |work=[[Le Monde]]|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU directive eventually contained no explicit measures regarding plain packaging. In reaction, the French government announced the introduction of a bill containing provisions for generic cigarette packaging on 25 September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Encadrement du vapotage, mise en place du paquet " neutre " : les annonces du plan anti-tabac |trans-title=Supervision of vaping, implementation of the "neutral" packet: announcements of the plan against tobacco |language=French|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sante/article/2014/09/25/encadrement-du-vapotage-mise-en-place-du-paquet-neutre-les-annonces-du-plan-anti-tabac_4494262_1651302.html|work=Le Monde|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was passed on 17 December 2015. The tobacco industry promptly attacked it in court, but lost its case.
This legislation was upheld on 21 January 2016 as constitutional by France’s [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/francais/les-decisions/acces-par-date/decisions-depuis-1959/2016/2015-727-dc/decision-n-2015-727-dc-du-21-janvier-2016.146887.html|title=Décision n° 2015-727 DC du 21 janvier 2016 sur la loi de modernisation du système de santé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 1 January 2017 must be put in plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La France adopte le paquet de cigarettes neutre|trans-title=France adopts neutral cigarette packaging|language=French|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1072520/article/actualite/fil-info/fil-info-monde/2015-12-17/france-adopte-paquet-cigarettes-neutre|date=17 December 2015}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
The Decree of 16 August 2016 requires that new cigarette and tobacco brands that will be introduced on the Hungarian market after 20 August 2016 has to be in a uniform plain packaging, void of brand logos. Eventually, all cigarette and tobacco products are to be sold in uniform packs from 20 May 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hungary: Larger pictorial warnings and plain packaging required by the new Government Decree|url=http://apps.who.int/fctc/implementation/database/groups/hungary-larger-pictorial-warnings-and-plain-packaging-required-new-government-decree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 2017, the first cigarettes with unified plain packaging hit the Hungarian market. From 20 August 2016 onwards, new brands have to be sold in plain packaging, one new cigarette brand of Von Eicken GmbH was forced to be launched with such unified package. This makes Hungary the fourth country in the world, where plain packaging is enforced; after Australia, France and the UK.

As of August 2012, India is believed to be considering plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/business/tobacco-fight-not-over-phillip-morris-says-20120815-2488s.html "Tobacco fight not over, Phillip Morris says"], by Chris Zappone, ''[[The Age]]'', 15 August 2012.

Retailers were given one year (until 1 July 2018) to transition to the new standardised cigarette packages and smokeless tobacco boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''Norway'' Tobacco labelling Resource Centre|url=http://www.tobaccolabels.ca/countries/norway/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panama===
Since 2017, the National Assembly has discussed draft Law 136 on plain packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama advocates neutral packaging of cigarettes |url=https://www.prensa.com/salud_y_ciencia/Panama-aboga-empaquetado-neutro-cigarrillo_0_4502549836.html |publisher=[[La Prensa (Panama City)|La Prensa]]|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes that the color of the packs be dark matt gray and that the mark be presented in white Arial font, size 20, highlighted in bold. Panama ranks second in having the lowest prevalence in the world of consumption, since only 6.4% of adults in the isthmus smoke.

===Philippines===
Anti-smoking group New Vois Association of the Philippines favored the introduction of plain cigarette packaging in the Philippines as part of their campaign on the 2016 [[World No Tobacco Day]] and urged then-presumptive president [[Rodrigo Duterte]] to implement a law to standardize cigarette packs. The [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] (DOH), however, is not ready to implement plain cigarette packaging, and rather focus on enforcing [[Tobacco packaging warning message|graphic health warnings]] on cigarette packs under the Graphic Health Warning Act of 2014 that took effect in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-smoking group urges Duterte to adopt plain-packed cigarettes|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2016/05/30/anti-smoking-group-urges-duterte-adopt-plain-packed-cigarettes-476525|newspaper=[[Sun.Star]]|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slovenia===
On the 15 February 2017, the [[Parliament of Slovenia]] passed a law for the introduction of plain packaging from 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slovenia passes law enforcing plain tobacco packaging from 2020|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-slovenia-tobacco-idUSKBN15U2BI|website=Reuters|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland === 
On 5 December 2014, [[National Council (Switzerland)|Swiss parliamentarian]] Pierre-Alain Fridez tabled a motion for plain packaging in Switzerland. A few days later, [[Federal Council of Switzerland|the Federal Council]] said it was opposed to this, saying such a measure "goes too far".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lematin.ch/suisse/Le-Conseil-federal-s-oppose-aux-paquets-de-cigarettes-neutres/story/31905395|title=Le Conseil fédéral s'oppose aux paquets de cigarettes neutres|trans-title=The Federal Council opposes neutral packets of cigarettes|language=French|work= [[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In September 2011, ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' reported that the Turkish government was working on plain packaging regulations. An Istanbul-based newspaper, ''[[Milliyet]]'', reported that under the proposal all branding elements would disappear and cigarettes would come in "numbered black boxes" excluding any imagery other than health warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey Working on Cigarette Branding Ban Law, Milliyet Says |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-07/turkey-working-on-cigarette-branding-ban-law-milliyet-says.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=7 September 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Health Minister [[Recep Akdağ]] stated that Turkey will "introduce plain packaging where the brand of cigarettes will almost be invisible and sellers will be obliged to store the cigarettes in closed cases instead of transparent displays" in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New restrictions on cigarette sales in the works|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/2016/11/15/new-restrictions-on-cigarette-sales-in-the-works|website=The Daily Sabah|accessdate=21 April 2017|location=Ankara, Turkey|date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In November 2013, the UK Government announced an independent review of cigarette packaging in the UK, amid calls for action to discourage young smokers.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Cigarette packaging: Ministers launch fresh review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25126673|accessdate=28 November 2013 | work=BBC News |date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public Health Minister Jane Ellison rejected [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] calls for immediate regulation rather than a review, saying: "It's a year this weekend since the legislation was introduced in Australia. It's the right time to ask people to look at this."

The "Plain Packs Protect" campaign by an alliance of health organisations set out the case for tobacco plain packaging in the UK, as did Cancer Research UK's "The Answer Is Plain" campaign, which was launched soon after the government consultation was announced. Opposing this was the smokers' rights group [[FOREST]], which launched a counter-campaign titled "Hands Off Our Packs".&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

In March 2015, the House of Commons voted 367–113 in favour of introducing plain cigarette packaging. Plain packaging is required for cigarettes manufactured after 20 May 2016 or sold after 21 May 2017.&lt;ref name="UK-vote"&gt;{{cite news|title=MPs pass legislation to introduce standardised cigarette packaging|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/11/mps-pass-legislation-introduce-standardised-cigarette-packaging|date=11 March 2015|accessdate=29 March 2015|publisher=''The Guardian''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government Legislation: The Standardised Packaging of Tobacco Products Regulations 2015|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/829/contents/made|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK regulations forbid "logos or promotional images … inserts … discounts … offers … information about nicotine, tar or carbon monoxide … lifestyle or environmental benefits [and] mentions or depictions of taste, smell or the absence thereof", while mandating "drab dark brown coloured packaging", specific package shapes and a specific font (Helvetica 14-point) for brand names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government: Guidance: Packaging of tobacco products|accessdate=29 October 2018|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/packaging-of-tobacco-products}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also bound by the EU's Tobacco Products Directive (2014) which included a requirement for combined health warnings (picture, text and information on how to stop) covering 65 per cent of both the front and back of packaging.&lt;ref name=EU2014 /&gt;

Like most e-procurement solutions available, Procurify focuses on providing users features including digital purchase order submission and accounts payable automation. Procurify is hosted on the [[Amazon Web Services]] and is built using [[Django (web framework)|Django]].  The solution is available as a [[SaaS]]. Procurify is offered as a browser-based and [[mobile procurement]] software.

== Company history ==
The company founders are [[BCIT School of Business]] alumni who graduated together in Operations Management in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBA Owner Invests With BCIT Alumni|url=http://commons.bcit.ca/update/2013/08/nba-owner-invests-with-bcit-alumni/|publisher=BCIT|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Got Mark Cuban To Invest In Our Company|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-money/business-funding/how-we-got-mark-cuban-to-invest-in-our-company/article13524012//|publisher=Globe and Mail|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for Procurify came from a BCIT class project where the founders Aman Mann - CEO, Eugene Dong - CTO, and Kenneth Loi - COO were randomly placed together to consult a Vancouver-based business on their internal processes.

In November 2012, they joined the Growlab Accelerator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Announces Its Five Winter 2012 Cohort Companies|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/growlab-announces-its-five-winter-2012-cohort-companies-2012-11-20|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=714 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2013, Procurify graduated from Vancouver-based incubator program GrowLab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GrowLab Companies on GlobalBC and ShawTV!|url=http://growlab.ca/growlab-companies-on-globalbc-and-shawt|publisher=GrowLab|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2014, Procurify raised a total of 1.2 Million seed round from venture capitalists Nexus Ventures, BDC and Mark Cuban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Knowlton|title=Vancouver's Procurify Raises $1.2 Million Seed Round from BDC, Mark Cuban|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/procurify-seed-round-mark-cuban-2014-04-16|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=BDC Venture Capital Invests in All Four GrowLab Graduates|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/bdc-invests-in-growlab-graduates-2013-03-01|publisher=TechVibes|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koetsier|first=John|title=Procurify is securing a $400K Mark Cuban investment even before graduating from GrowLab|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/20/procurify-is-securing-a-mark-cuban-investment-even-before-graduating-from-growlab/|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2015, Procurify raised another seed round totaling $4 Million from Point Nine Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC). Hootsuite’s CEO Ryan Holmes and its chief revenue officer Steve Johnson also participated in this round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|title=Procurify Raises $4M To Make Purchasing Easier For Businesses|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/22/procurify-raises-4m-to-make-purchasing-easier-for-businesses/#.emr7vl:6MaY|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12836">'''Regulatory technology''', also known as a "RegTech" is a new field within the [[financial services]] industry that utilizes [[information technology]] to enhance regulatory processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.heg-fr.ch/EN/School-of-Management/Communication-and-Events/events/Pages/EventViewer.aspx?Event=patrick-schuffel.aspx|title=The Concise Fintech Compendium|last=Schueffel|first=Patrick|publisher=School of Management Fribourg|year=2017|isbn=|location=Fribourg, Switzerland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It puts a particular emphasis on regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance and is thus benefiting the finance industry. The objective of RegTech is to enhance transparency as well as consistency and to standardize [[Regulatory Processes|regulatory processes]], to deliver sound interpretations of ambiguous regulations and thus to provide higher levels of quality at lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.deloitte.ch/banking/2017/11/is-regtech-the-next-big-thing-first-part.html|title=Is Regtech "The next big thing"? – First part - Banking blog|website=blogs.deloitte.ch|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes RegTech companies utilize the [[Cloud computing|cloud]] through [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]].

RegTech to date has been focused on the [[digitization]] of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of [[Know your customer]] requirements. This offers significant cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, a 2016 academic paper suggested that the potential of RegTech is far greater stating that "it has the potential to enable a close to real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while also facilitating far more efficient regulatory compliance".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law &amp; Business, Forthcoming|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2847806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report goes on to suggest that RegTech transformative potential will only be fully captured by a new and different regulatory framework situated at the nexus of data and [[digital identity]]. The developments in [[Financial technology|FinTech]], the tremendous changes in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators (for instance with the development of regulatory sandboxes), may potentially combine to facilitate a transition from one regulatory model to another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Origin ==
At a governmental level, the [[Financial Conduct Authority|FCA]] was the first governmental body to establish and promote the term RegTech, defining this as: "''RegTech is a sub-set of FinTech that focuses on technologies that may facilitate the delivery of regulatory requirements more efficiently and effectively than existing capabilities".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://innovate.fca.org.uk/innovation-hub/regtech-programme|title=RegTech|last=FCA|first=|date=2016-02-23|website=innovate.fca.org.uk|publisher=Financial Conduct Authority|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, a report by the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser, stated that "''FinTech has the potential to be applied to regulation and compliance to make financial regulation and reporting more transparent, efficient and effective – creating new mechanisms for regulatory technology, RegTech''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fintech-blackett-review|title=FinTech: Blackett review - Publications - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the vision of a technology led regime has already been proposed as early as 2014, by Andy Haldane, during a keynote address at  Birmingham University

''I have a dream. It is futuristic, but realistic. It involves a Star Trek chair and a bank of monitors. It would involve tracking the global flow of funds in close to real time (from a Star Trek chair using a bank of monitors), in much the same way as happens with global weather systems and global internet traffic. Its centerpiece would be a global map of financial flows, charting spill-overs and correlations.''&lt;ref&gt;Andy Haldane, Chief Economist, Bank of England, Speech at the Maxwell Fry Annual Global Finance Lecture: Managing Global Finance as a System, Birmingham University 10 (Oct. 29, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the private sector side, two pressure points have facilitated the development of RegTech. On the expense side, post-crisis fines have exceeded US$200 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/misbehaving-banks-have-now-paid-204b-in-fines.html|title=Misbehaving banks have now paid $200B+ in fines|first=Jeff|last=Cox|date=30 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ongoing cost of regulation and compliance has become a primary concern industry-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomsonreuters.com/en/press-releases/2015/05/cost-of-compliance-survey-shows-regulatory-fatigue-resource-challenges-personal-liability-to-increase.html|title=Thomson Reuters Annual Cost of Compliance Survey Shows Regulatory Fatigue, Resource Challenges and Personal Liability to Increase Throughout 2015|date=13 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the revenue side, competition from FinTech companies is expected to put US$4.7 trillion of revenues at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21650546-wave-startups-changing-financefor-better-fintech-revolution|title=The fintech revolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expense and revenue factors are driving the development of RegTech. As with FinTech,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?|journal=D.Arner, J.Barberis &amp; R.Buckley|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2676553}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2008 GFC represented a turning point in the development of RegTech. However, the factors underlying, and the beneficiaries of, RegTech are quite different. FinTech growth has been led by start-ups (now increasingly partnering with, or being acquired by, banks and other traditional financial institutions),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/29443/banks-rushing-to-collaborate-with-fintech-startups|title=Banks rushing to collaborate with fintech startups|first=|last=Finextra|date=16 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/1-in-5-european-banks-would-buy-fintech-startups-2016-6/?r=AU&amp;IR=T EY, Fintech: Are Banks Responding Appropriately? (2015); Andrew Meola, ''1 in 5 European Banks Would Buy FinTech Startups'', Business Insider (July 17, 2016),]&lt;/ref&gt; whilst RegTech developments to date are primarily a response to the huge costs of complying with new institutional demands by regulators and policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;[[# ftnref7|[7]]] ''See'' Gregory Roberts, ''FinTech Spawns RegTech to Automate Compliance'', [https://www.bloomberg.com/enterprise/blog/fintech-spawns-regtech-automate-compliance-regulations/ Bloomberg (June 28, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the financial services industry, the cost of regulatory obligations has dramatically increased, such that 87% of banking CEOs in one survey consider these costs as a source of disruption. This provides a strong economic incentive for more efficient reporting and compliance systems to better control risks and reduce compliance costs. Furthermore, the massive increases in the volume and types of data that have to be reported to regulatory authorities represent a major opportunity for the automation of compliance and monitoring processes. For the financial services industry, the application of technology to regulation and compliance has the scope to massively increase efficiency and achieve better outcomes.

[[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]], which hosted a RegTech innovation lab, quoted recently, "Regtech solutions also allow banks to boost their responsiveness to regulatory changes, because they are, in theory, designed to adapt dynamically to new requirements in an almost immediate manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://info.bbva.com/en/news/general/10-keys-understand-regtech/|title=10 keys to understand what regtech is all about - BBVA NEWS|last=BBVA|date=2016-05-23|website=NEWS BBVA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in March 2016, BBVA made the following statement in its paper titled "Banking Outlook":

"''The term RegTech refers to a set of companies and solutions that marry innovative technology and regulation to address regulatory requirements across industries, including financial services. RegTech companies focus on the automation of manual processes and the links between steps in analytical/reporting processes, the improvement of data quality, the creation of a holistic view of data, the automated analysis of data with applications that are able to learn during the process, and the generation of meaningful reports that can be sent to regulators and used internally to improve key business decision making.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Banking-Outlook-Q116.pdf|title=Banking Outlook|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=BBVA|publisher=BBVA FINANCIAL SYSTEMS UNIT|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, FinTech Global conducted a comprehensive review of the RegTech landscape globally, and selected the world most innovative 100 RegTech companies as RegTech 100 that every financial institutions should know about in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://regtech100.com/|title=RegTech 100 – The world’s most innovative RegTech companies that every financial institution needs to know about|website=regtech100.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key characteristics ==
Here are some of the key characteristics&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/financial-services/articles/RegTech-is-the-new-FinTech.html|title=Is RegTech the new FinTech? {{!}} Deloitte Ireland {{!}} Finance, Technology|website=Deloitte Ireland|access-date=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of RegTech:
# Agility – cluttered and intertwined data sets can be decoupled and organised through ETL (Extract, Transfer Load) technologies
# Speed – reports can be configured and generated quickly
# Integration – short timeframes to get solution up and running
# Analytics – RegTech uses analytic tools to intelligently mine existing “big data” data sets and unlock their true potential e.g. using the same data for multiple purposes.

== Applications ==
RegTech can have applications such as: 
* Legislation/Regulation gap analysis tools
* Compliance universe tools
* Health Check tools
* Identity verification
* Management Information tools
* Transaction reporting tools
* Regulatory reporting tools
* Activity monitoring tools
* Training tools
* Risk data warehouses
* Case management tools
* Horizon scanning
* Transaction monitoring

== Startup developments ==
As soon as RegTech sub-set first appeared, a number of companies have been spawning in order to tackle various regulatory problems. [[Deloitte]] published a report on RegTech Universe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/technology/articles/regtech-universe.html|title=RegTech Universe|website=Deloitte Luxembourg}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017 listing more than 150 RegTech startups globally.  In January 2017, [[Citigroup|Citi]] has also published a report under Global Perspectives &amp; Solutions&lt;ref&gt;https://ir.citi.com/FIanoC50Aw5dWM7kPzoLKU3buhKF1LETHM1deMYw1%2F2zNzWFg8zmYw%3D%3D&lt;/ref&gt; where it identified 24 KYC FinTech startups in the RegTech space globally.

In 2017, FinTech Global released a list of the top 100 RegTech companies in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://regtech100.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salem bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden''' ({{lang-ar|سالم م. بن لادن}}) (4 January 1946 – 29 May 1988) was a [[Saudi Arabia]]n investor and businessman.

==Life==
Considered the eldest son of [[Mohammed bin Laden]], the founder of [[Saudi Binladin Group]] and a half-brother of [[Osama bin Laden]]. Bin Laden was educated at [[Millfield]] and acted as the patriarch of the [[bin Laden family]] after the 1967 death of his father. Salem managed the family's extensive investment portfolio and was in charge of family income distribution. He also oversaw the individual education plans for each of his (half-) brothers and (half-) sisters. Just like his father, he highly valued close relationship of the bin Ladens with the [[Saudi royal family]]. He provided means and support to the family during the [[Grand Mosque Seizure|Mecca uprising of 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Bin Ladens: an Arabian family in the American century |last1= Coll|first1=Steve |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher= Penguin Press |location= United States |isbn= 978-1-59420-164-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1_cjb96LrJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bin+Ladens#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He owned a house in [[Orlando, Florida]], and often used it for vacation stays.&lt;ref name="pete"&gt;[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], "[[Holy War, Inc.]]", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/books/20080401_COLL_EXCERPT.html ‘The Bin Ladens’]
By Steve Coll, March 31, 2008, [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Salem bin Laden died on 29 May 1988, when he accidentally drifted into high voltage electrical power lines adjacent to the Kitty Hawk Field of Dreams Ultra-Lite Flying Field at the edge of [[Schertz, Texas|Schertz]], a northeastern [[San Antonio]] suburb. The Sprint [[Ultralight aircraft (United States)|ultralight aircraft]] he was flying fell 115 feet to the ground after the wire strike. Salem, who was not wearing a safety helmet, died of head injuries from the resulting fall. The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] did not conduct an accident investigation since the aircraft was an ultralight aircraft, which was not covered under their mandate due to exemption while operating under [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]] Part 103 Provisions required by Federal law. The Schertz Police, who attended to the incident, stated in the report that Salem died in a freak accident.

This was the second plane crash-related death in the [[bin Laden family]], as Salem's father [[Mohammed bin Laden]] was also killed in a plane crash in 1967.

A third plane crash claimed more members of the bin Laden family on 31 July 2015 when a business jet carrying Osama bin Laden's half sister, Sana, and his stepmother, Rajaa Hashim, crashed at Blackbushe airport in Hampshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/11777536/Osama-bin-Ladens-sister-and-stepmother-feared-dead-in-Hampshire-plane-crash.html|title=Osama bin Laden's sister and stepmother killed in Hampshire plane crash|first=Patrick|last=Sawer|date=1 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WeeklySchedule.png|thumb|300px|An example of a weekly workplace schedule]]

A '''schedule''', often called a '''rota''' or '''roster''', is a list of [[employment|employees]], and associated information e.g. location, working times, responsibilities for a given time period e.g. week, month or sports season. 

A schedule is necessary for the day-to-day operation of many businesses e.g. [[retailing|retail store]], [[manufacturing]] facility and some [[offices]]. The process of creating a schedule is called '''scheduling'''. An effective workplace schedule balances the needs of stakeholders such as management, employees and [[customer]]s.

A ''daily'' schedule is usually ordered [[chronology|chronologically]], which means the first employees working that day are listed at the top, followed by the employee who comes in next, etc.  A ''weekly'' or ''monthly'' schedule is usually ordered [[collation|alphabetically]], employees being listed on the left hand side of a grid, with the days of the week on the top of the grid.{{cn|date=October 2014}}  In [[shift work]], a schedule usually employs a recurring [[shift plan]].

A schedule is most often created by a [[Management|manager]]. In larger operations, a [[human resources]] manager or scheduling specialist may be solely dedicated to creating and maintaining the schedule. A schedule by this definition is sometimes referred to as [[workflow]].{{cn|date=October 2014}}

Software is often used to enable organizations to better manage staff scheduling. Organizations commonly use [[spreadsheet]] software or [[employee scheduling software]] to create and manage shifts, assignments, and employee preferences. For large organisations employee scheduling can be complex,{{cn|date=October 2014}} and optimising this is framed as the [[Nurse scheduling problem]] in Operations Research.&lt;ref&gt;Math.edu [http://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/Teaching/OR2/Projects/P23/ORProject_Final_Copy.pdf "Nurse scheduling problem"]&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced employee scheduling software also provides ways to connect with the staff, ask for their preferences and communicate the schedule to them.&lt;ref name=NYT102812&gt;{{cite news|title=A Part-Time Life, as Hours Shrink and Shift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/business/a-part-time-life-as-hours-shrink-and-shift-for-american-workers.html|accessdate=October 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2012|author=Steven Greenhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== On-call scheduling ==
An [[On call shift]] or On-call scheduling is a practice which requires employees to be available to be called onto last-minute shifts without pre-scheduling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2015/08/gap-ends-on-call-scheduling-gps-worker-bill-rights.html|title = Gap decides not to keep its store workers waiting|last = Sciacca|first = Annie|date = August 27, 2015|work = [[San Franc. Bus. Times|San Francisco Business Times]]|access-date = August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, the practice has been opposed by [[labor rights]] groups as "unfair and detrimental to employees."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early life==
Matsui was born in 1963 and started training in Kyokushin karate at age 13.&lt;ref name="SOKK"/&gt; In 1976, he joined the Kita Nagare-Yama Dojo in [[Chiba Prefecture]] and attained the rank of 1st ''dan'' [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in a little over one year.&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt;

==Later years==
Matsui completed the [[100-man kumite]] in 1987, when ranked 4th ''dan''.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;[http://www.shihancollins.com/nyhemsida/sosaistory.html Shihan Collins: 100 men kumite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329092322/http://www.shihancollins.com/nyhemsida/sosaistory.html |date=2009-03-29 }} Retrieved on 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, Matsui opened his own ''dojo'' in [[Asakusa]], Tokyo,&lt;ref name="HabersetzerHabersetzer2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt; and was later appointed as a Branch Chief by Oyama.&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt;

Near the end of his life, some say that Oyama named Matsui (then ranked 5th ''dan'', and clearly junior in rank to several senior instructors) to succeed him in leading the IKO. However this has been disputed with his family and Matsui.&lt;ref name="SOKK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt; Reportedly, a letter by senior Kyokushin instructor [[Peter Chong (karateka)|Peter Chong]] noted that Matsui was surprised to hear that he had been appointed to succeed Oyama, but also that Oyama had earlier named Matsui before several other people as the leading candidate to succeed him.&lt;ref name="KKC"&gt;[http://www.kyokushincanada.com/LegalMatter_Kyokushin.htm Kyokushin Karate Canada: What has happened with the Kyokushin organization?] Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Matsui then became ''Kancho'' (Director). Following a dispute over the veracity of Oyama's will, Kyokushin karate as an organization divided into three main groups, led by Matsui, [[Kenji Midori]], and Yoshikazu Matsushima.&lt;ref name="Yussof2006"&gt;Yussof, S.

'''SSPC: The Society for Protective Coatings''' (SSPC) is a professional association for the [[industrial protective and marine coatings]] industry.  It was founded in 1950 as the '''Steel Structures Painting Council''', a non-profit association concerned with the use of [[coatings]] to protect steel structures such as bridges, ships, water tanks, and locks and dams. Since the original mission of the organization evolved over the years to include structures built with materials other than steel (concrete, composite materials, etc.), the name was changed in 1997 to SSPC: The Society for Protective Coatings.

As of the end of 2016, there are approximately 11,500 members worldwide.  There are also approximately 960 corporate members. [[Industrial painting contractors]] are a primary beneficiary of SSPC's efforts.

SSPC develops and publishes widely used industry standards for surface preparation, coating selection, coating application, painting contractor certification, and testing.  Standing committees periodically review and update the standards as required. The "official voice of SSPC" is the [[Journal of Protective Coatings &amp; Linings]], published monthly by Technology Publishing Company in Pittsburgh, PA.  In addition to standards and the JPCL, SSPC produces books, technical manuals, training courses, professional certification programs and information regarding environmental regulations and health and safety issues that affect the protective coatings industry.  SSPC has also begun developing resources for the commercial-light industrial industry. In 2011, following the discontinuation of the annual PACE conference, SSPC launched the '''SSPC Annual Conference featuring GreenCOAT''', which is held in the United States each year for SSPC members and affiliates.  Other regional meetings are held throughout the USA and other parts of the world via [http://www.sspc.org/chapters/ SSPC's Chapter system].

{{Financial risk types}}
A '''systemically important financial institution''' ('''SIFI''') or '''systemically important bank''' ('''SIB''') is a [[bank]], [[insurance]] company, or other [[financial institution]] whose failure might trigger a [[financial crisis]]. They are colloquially referred to as "[[too big to fail]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsb.org/what-we-do/policy-development/systematically-important-financial-institutions-sifis/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
As the [[2007-2012 global financial crisis]] has unfolded, the international community has moved to protect the [[global financial system]] through preventing the failure of SIFIs, or, if one does fail, limiting the adverse effects of its failure. In November 2011, the [[Financial Stability Board]] published a list of global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_111104bb.pdf |title= List of Systemically Important Financial Institutions |author= Financial Stability Board |date=November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] introduced new regulations (known as [[Basel III]]) that also specifically target SIFIs. The main focus of the regulations is to increase bank capital requirements and to introduce capital surcharges for systemically important banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs207.htm |title=Global systemically important banks: Assessment methodology and the additional loss absorbency requirement – final document |author=BCBS |date=November 2011 |work= |publisher=BIS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some economists have warned that the tighter Basel III capital regulation, which is primarily based on [[risk-weighted asset]]s, may further negatively affect the stability of the financial system.&lt;ref name="OECDSlovikfeb2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kg0ps8cq8q6-en |title=OECD study on regulation of systemically important banks |publisher=OECD |date= February 2012 |author=Slovik, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repec_SlovikFeb2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/oec/ecoaaa/916-en.html |title= Abstract: Systemically Important Banks and Capital Regulation Challenges |first=Patrick |last=Slovik |publisher=Research Division of the Federal Reserve Bank (RePec)|location=St. Louis |date= February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that both the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee are only policy research and development entities. They do not establish laws, regulations or rules for any financial institution directly. They merely act in an advisory capacity. It is up to each country's specific lawmakers and regulators to enact whatever portions of the recommendations they deem appropriate. Each country's internal financial regulators make their own determination of what is a ''Systemically Important Financial Institution''. Once those regulators make that determination, they may set specific laws, regulations and rules that would apply to those entities.

Virtually every Systemically Important Financial Institution operates at the top level as a holding company made up of numerous subsidiaries. It is not unusual for the subsidiaries to number in the hundreds. Even though the uppermost holding company is located in the home country, where it is subject, at that level, to that home regulator, the subsidiaries may be organized and operating in several different countries. Each subsidiary is then subject to potential regulation by every country where it actually conducts business.

At present (and for the likely foreseeable future) there is no such thing as a global regulator. Likewise there is no such thing as global insolvency, global bankruptcy, or the legal requirement for a global bail out. Each legal entity is treated separately. Each country is responsible (in theory) for containing a financial crisis that starts in their country from spreading across borders. Looking up from a country prospective as to what is a Systemically Important Financial Institution may be different than when looking down on the entire globe and attempting to determine what entities are significant.

The degree of interconnectedness between financial institutions is almost completely unknown at any specific point in time. When trouble breaks out, fear and contagion effects are extremely unpredictable. Therefore, determining exactly what entities are ''significant'' is a difficult assignment, as the real certainty is determinable only well after the fact.

== Definition ==
As of November 2011, a standard definition of ''systemically important financial institution'' had not been decided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/06/banks-disappointed-not-on-g-sifi-list |title=Some banks will be disappointed not to be on the G-Sifi list for regulation |date=6 November 2011 |publisher=The Observer |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Basel Committee has identified factors for assessing whether a financial institution is systemically important: its size, its complexity, its interconnectedness, the lack of readily available substitutes for the financial infrastructure it provides, and its global (cross-jurisdictional) activity. In some cases, the assessments of experts, independent of the indicators, will be able to move an institution into the SIFI category or remove it from SIFI status.

==Banks==
{{further information|List of systemically important banks|List of bank stress tests}}

===Asia===
Banks in Japan deemed systemically important are stress tested by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). Banks in China are mostly state run and are stress tested by the national banking authority.

===European Union===
Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) are determined based on four main criteria: (a) size, (b) cross-jurisdiction activity, (c) complexity, and (d) substitutability. The list of G-SIBs is published annually by the [[Financial Stability Board]] (FSB). The G-SIBs must maintain a higher capital level – capital surcharge – compared to other banks.

In November 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_131111.pdf 2013 update of group of global systemically important banks(G-SIBs)]&lt;/ref&gt; the FSB updated the list of G-SIBs, and the following banks were included: [[Bank of America]], [[Bank of China]], [[The Bank of New York Mellon|Bank of New York Mellon]], [[Barclays]], [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria|BBVA]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Citigroup]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[Groupe BPCE]], [[Crédit Agricole]], [[HSBC]], [[ING Group|ING Bank]], [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]], [[Mizuho Financial Group]], [[Morgan Stanley]], [[Nordea]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Banco Santander]], [[Société Générale]], [[Standard Chartered]], [[State Street Corporation|State Street]], [[Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group|Sumitomo Mitsui FG]], [[UBS]], [[UniCredit]], [[Wells Fargo]].

Compared with the group of G-SIBs published in 2011, three banks have been added: BBVA, Standard Chartered and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited; and three banks removed: Dexia, as it is undergoing an orderly resolution process, and Commerzbank and Lloyds, as result of a decline in their global systemic importance.

===United States===

====Stress testing====
In the USA, the largest banks are regulated by the [[Federal Reserve]] (FRB) and the [[Office of the Comptroller of Currency]] (OCC). These regulators set the selection criteria, establish hypothetical adverse scenarios and oversee the annual tests. 19 banks operating in the U.S. (at the top tier) have been subject to such testing since 2009.  Banks showing difficulty under the stress tests are required to postpone share buybacks, curtail dividend plans and if necessary raise additional capital financing.

====G-SIB Capital Requirements====

In December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued a long-awaited proposal to impose additional capital requirements on the U.S.’s global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/bcreg20141209a1.pdf|title= Federal Reserve Proposed Rule to Further Strengthen the Capital Positions of the Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies |website= http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20141209a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal implements the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) G-SIB capital surcharge framework that was finalized in 2011, but also proposes changes to BCBS’s calculation methodology resulting in significantly higher surcharges for US G-SIBs compared with their global peers. The proposal has not been finalized, and leading experts such a PwC believe it will be finalized in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-g-sib-proposal.pdf|title= G-SIB capital: A look to 2015 |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/g-sib-proposal.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal, which industry experts expect will be finalized in 2015, requires U.S. G-SIBs to hold additional capital (Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWA)) equal to the greater of the amount calculated under two methods. The first method is consistent with BCBS’s framework,and calculates the amount of extra capital to be held based on the G-SIB’s size, interconnectedness,cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity. The second method is introduced by the U.S. proposal, and uses similar inputs but replaces the substitutability element with a measure based on a G-SIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding (STWF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-g-sib-proposal.pdf|title= G-SIB capital: A look to 2015 |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/g-sib-proposal.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market-based bank capital regulation ERNs===
Stress testing has limited effectiveness in risk management. Dexia passed the European stress tests in 2011. Two months later it requested a €90 billion bailout guarantee.{{harv|Goldfield|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/market-based-bank-capital-regulation|title=Market-based bank capital regulation|author1=Jeremy Bulow|author2=Jacob Goldfield|author3=Paul Klemperer|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldfield, a former Senior Partner of Goldman Sachs and Economics Professors, Jeremy Bulow at Stanford and Paul Klemperer at Oxford, argue that ''Equity Recourse Notes''' (ERNs), similar in some ways to [[contingent convertible debt]], (CoCos), should be used by all banks rated SIFI, to replace non-deposit existing unsecured debt. "ERNs would be long-term bonds with the feature that any interest or principal payable on a date when the stock price is lower than a pre-specified price would be paid in stock at that pre-specified price."{{harv|Goldfield|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013" /&gt; Through ERNs, distressed banks would have access to much needed equity as willing investors purchase tranches of ERNs similar to pooling tranches of subprime mortgages. In this case however, the market, not the public takes the risks. Banking can be pro-cyclical by contributing to booms and busts. Stressed banks become reluctant to lend since they are often unable to raise capital equity through new investors.&lt;ref name="FT_Harford28aug2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Markets must force banks, like petulant toddlers, to grow up|author=Tim Harford|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/631f6ce6-0fd1-11e3-a258-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2dMY8rKqf|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{harv|Goldfield et al|2013}}&lt;ref name="voxeu29aug2013" /&gt; claim that ERNs would provide a "counterweight against pro-cyclicality."

====Resolution plans====
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for supervision by the Federal Reserve submit resolution plans annually to the Federal Reserve (FRB) and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC). Each plan, commonly known as a '''living will''', must describe the company's strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2016/04/13/business/13reuters-usa-banks.html U.S. Regulators Fail 'Living Wills' at Five of Eight Big Banks] April 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2014 Category 2 firms will be required to submit resolution plans while category 1 firms will submit their 3rd resolution plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-resolution-planning-wave-1.pdf|title= 2014 Resolution planning: The guidance you won’t receive |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/resolution-planning-wave-1.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, April, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution plan requirement under the Dodd Frank Act in Section 165(d), is in addition to the FDIC's requirement of a separate covered insured depository institution ("CIDI") plan for CIDIs of large bank holding companies. The FDIC requires a separate CIDI resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC’s core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., “material entities”), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold. Similar to the assumptions made for resolution plans, the FDIC recently issued assumptions to be made in CIDI plans including the assumption that the CIDI will fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/2014-resolution-plan-cidis.pdf|title= First take: Ten key points from the FDIC’s resolution plan guidance |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/2014-resolution-plan-cidis.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, December, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Qualified Financial Contracts=====
When a company enters insolvency (either through bankruptcy or FDIC receivership), an automatic stay is triggered that generally prohibits creditors and counterparties from terminating, offsetting against collateral, or taking any other mitigating action with respect to their outstanding contracts with the insolvent company. However, under US law counterparties to QFCs are exempt from this stay and may usually begin to exercise their contractual rights after the close of business the next day. In case of receivership, the FDIC must decide within this time period whether to transfer the QFC to another institution, retain the QFC and allow the counterparty to terminate it, or repudiate the QFC and pay out the counterparty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.pdf |title= Resolution preparedness: Do you know where your QFCs are? |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, March, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the US Secretary of Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPR”) that would establish new recordkeeping requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts (“QFCs”). The NPR requires US systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”) and certain of their affiliates to maintain specific information electronically on end-of-day QFC positions, and to be able to provide this information to regulators within 24 hours if requested. The NPR is intended to help the FDIC with decision-making by making available detailed information on a failed company’s QFCs, given the FDIC’s expanded receivership powers under Dodd-Frank’s Orderly Liquidation Authority (“OLA”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.pdf |title= Resolution preparedness: Do you know where your QFCs are? |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/qualified-financial-contracts-qfcs.jhtml|publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, March, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-bank entities==
The concept of a systemically important financial institution in the U.S. extends well beyond traditional banks and is often included under the term [[Non-banking financial company]]. It includes large hedge funds and traders, large insurance companies, and various and sundry [[Systemically important financial market utility|systemically important financial market utilities]]. For historical background see [[Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate#Arguments for a systemic risk regulator]]

Regarding which entities will be so designated the [[Dodd-Frank Act of 2010]] contains the following in TITLE I—FINANCIAL STABILITY, Subtitle A—Financial Stability Oversight Council, Sec. 113. ''Authority to require supervision and regulation of certain nonbank financial companies'' (2) considerations:
* the extent of the leverage of the company;
* the extent and nature of the off-balance-sheet exposures of the company;
* the extent and nature of the transactions and relationships of the company with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies;
* the importance of the company as a source of credit for households, businesses, and State and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the United States financial system;
* the importance of the company as a source of credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities, and the impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability of credit in such communities;
* the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company, and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse;
* the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company;
* the degree to which the company is already regulated by 1 or more primary financial regulatory agencies;
* the amount and nature of the financial assets of the company;
* the amount and types of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding; and
* any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate.

FSOC subsequently issued clarification under [http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/Documents/Nonbank%20Designations%20-%20Final%20Rule%20and%20Guidance.pdf Final Rule on Authority to Designate Financial Market Utilities as Systemically Important], which includes the following chart recasting the above statutory requirements into a six-category FSOC analytical framework including: 
* size
* interconnectedness
* lack of substitutes
* leverage
* liquidity risk and maturity mismatch
* existing regulatory scrutiny

The following are quotes from the FSOC final rule regarding each element of the six factor framework.

'''Interconnectedness'''
Interconnectedness captures direct or indirect linkages between financial companies that may be conduits for the transmission of the effects resulting from a nonbank financial company's material financial distress or activities.

'''Substitutability'''
Substitutability captures the extent to which other firms could provide similar financial services in a timely manner at a similar price and quantity if a nonbank financial company withdraws from a particular market. Substitutability also captures situations in which a nonbank financial company is the primary or dominant provider of services in a market that the Council determines to be essential to U.S. financial stability.

'''Size'''
Size captures the amount of financial services or financial intermediation that a nonbank financial company provides. Size also may affect the extent to which the effects of a nonbank financial company's financial distress are transmitted to other firms and to the financial system.

'''Leverage'''
Leverage captures a company's exposure or risk in relation to its equity capital. Leverage amplifies a company's risk of financial distress in two ways. First, by increasing a company's exposure relative to capital, leverage raises the likelihood that a company will suffer losses exceeding its capital. Second, by increasing the size of a company's liabilities, leverage raises a company's dependence on its creditors' willingness and ability to fund its balance sheet. Leverage can also amplify the impact of a company's distress on other companies, both directly, by increasing the amount of exposure that other firms have to the company, and indirectly, by increasing the size of any asset liquidation that the company is forced to undertake as it comes under financial pressure. Leverage can be measured by the ratio of assets to capital, but it can also be defined in terms of risk, as a measure of economic risk relative to capital. The latter measurement can better capture the effect of derivatives and other products with embedded leverage on the risk undertaken by a nonbank financial company.

'''Liquidity risk and maturity mismatch'''
Liquidity risk generally refers to the risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs, either through its cash flows, maturing assets, or assets salable at prices equivalent to book value, or through its ability to access funding markets. For example, if a company holds assets that are illiquid or that are subject to significant decreases in market value during times of market stress, the company may be unable to liquidate its assets effectively in response to a loss of funding. In order to assess liquidity, the Council may examine a nonbank financial company's assets to determine if it possesses cash instruments or readily marketable securities, such as Treasury securities, which could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of distress. The Council may also review a nonbank financial company's debt profile to determine if it has adequate long-term funding, or can otherwise mitigate liquidity risk. Liquidity problems also can arise from a company's inability to roll maturing debt or to satisfy margin calls, and from demands for additional collateral, depositor withdrawals, draws on committed lines, and other potential draws on liquidity.

A maturity mismatch generally refers to the difference between the maturities of a company's assets and liabilities. A maturity mismatch affects a company's ability to survive a period of stress that may limit its access to funding and to withstand shocks in the yield curve. For example, if a company relies on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions, it will be subject to significant refunding risk that may force it to sell assets at low market prices or potentially suffer through significant margin pressure. However, maturity mismatches are not confined to the use of short-term liabilities and can exist at any point in the maturity schedule of a nonbank financial company's assets and liabilities.

'''Existing regulatory scrutiny'''
The Council will consider the extent to which nonbank financial companies are already subject to regulation, including the consistency of that regulation across nonbank financial companies within a sector, across different sectors, and providing similar services, and the statutory authority of those regulators.

FSB plan to expand the above list also to include G-SII status for the world's largest [[reinsurance|reinsurers]], pending a further development of the G-SII assessment methodology, to be finalized by IAIS in November 2015. The revised G-SII assessment methodology will be applied from 2016.&lt;ref name="FSB list of G-SIIs per Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/r_141106a.pdf|title=2014 update of list of global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs)|format=PDF|publisher=Financial Stability Board|date=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, IAIS published the first-ever global insurance capital standard entitled ''Basic Capital Requirements (BCR)'', to apply to all group activities (incl. non-insurance activities) of G-SIIs, as a foundation for the ''Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA)'' requirements. Beginning in 2015, the BCR ratio{{#tag:ref|The BCR Ratio is calculated by dividing "Total Qualifying Capital Resources" by "Required Capital", both of which are initially derived from a comparable market adjusted valuation approach using current estimates of insurance liabilities - and both are determined on a consolidated group-wide basis for all financial and material non-financial activities (including all holding companies, insurance legal entities, banking legal entities and any other companies within the group). ''BCR Total Qualifying Capital Resources'' are classified as either core or additional capital. ''BCR Required Capital'' is determined by using a "factor-based" approach with 15 factors applying to defined segments and their specified exposure measures within the main categories of a G-SII’s activity - traditional life insurance, traditional non-life insurance, non-traditional insurance, assets and non-insurance.&lt;ref name="BCR developed by IAIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaisweb.org/view/element_href.cfm?src=1/23745.pdf|title=IAIS Develops Basic Capital Requirements for Global Systemically Important Insurers|format=PDF|publisher=International Association of Insurance Supervisors|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=notes}} will be reported on a confidential basis to group-wide supervisors - and be shared with the IAIS for purposes of refining the BCR as necessary. IAIS currently{{when|date=August 2017}} work to develop the methodology for the introduction of HLA requirements, to be published by end-2015, and to be applied starting from January 2019 towards those G-SIIs being identified in November 2017. From January 2019, all G-SIIs will be required to hold capital no lower than the BCR plus HLA. Subjecting insurers to enhanced supervisory oversight is not up to FSB/IAIS, but up to individual jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="FSB list of G-SIIs per Nov 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCR developed by IAIS"/&gt;

When [[MetLife]]—the United States’s largest life insurer—was designated as a systemically important institution in late 2014 by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) which had been established by the [[Dodd-Frank Act]], they challenged the designation as "arbitrary and capricious" in federal court and won. In April 2016 when judge [[Rosemary Collyer]], found in favor of Metlife in a Federal District Court decision, the value of MetLife stocks rose sharply.&lt;ref name="nyt_2016_04_11"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nyti.ms/1SrYa2N | title=Snoopy the Destroyer | publisher=The New York Times | date=11 April 2016 | accessdate=11 April 2016 |first=Paul |last=Krugman}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2018 a panel of judges on the US Court of Appeals dropped the appeal after the Financial Stability Oversight Council dropped the appeal at the request of the Trump administration.&lt;ref name="wsjjan2318"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clozel|first1=Lalita|title=Court Drops Government’s Appeal of MetLife Case|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/court-drops-governments-appeal-of-metlife-case-1516742046|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsjjan18"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracy|first1=Ryan|title=MetLife Cements Legal Victory in Shedding ‘Systemically Important’ Label|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/metlife-and-fsoc-file-motion-to-dismiss-appeal-in-sifi-litigation-1516325850|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=News Corp|accessdate=23 January 2018|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Americas====
{{Main article|Systemically important financial market utility}}

The U.S. government legislation defines the term ''financial market utilities'' (FMU) for other organizations that play a key part in [[financial markets]] such as [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]]s settlement systems.  They are entities whose failure or disruption could threaten the stability of the financial system.

===Asset Managers===

====United States====
It is widely anticipated {{By whom|date=October 2018}} that the Financial Stability Oversight Council will eventually designate certain significant asset managers as nonbank systematically important financial institutions (Nonbank SIFIs).&lt;ref name="pwc.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-regulatory-brief-nonbank-sifi-asset-manager.pdf |title= Nonbank SIFIs: Up next, asset managers |website=http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/nonbank-sifi-asset-manager.jhtml |publisher= PwC Financial Services Regulatory Practice, October, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSOC recently asked the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) to undertake a study that provides data and analysis on the asset management industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-04-11/pdf/2012-8627.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study analyzed the industry and describes potential threats to U.S. financial stability from vulnerabilities of asset managers.  The study suggested the industry’s activities as a whole make it systemically important and may pose a risk to financial stability. Furthermore, it identified the extent of assets managed by the major industry players. This request for the study is considered by some as a first step in by the FSOC in reviewing the industry and individual player to determine which are systematically important. Once designated as systematically important those entities will be subject to additional oversight and regulatory requirements.&lt;ref name="pwc.com"/&gt;

In 2013, the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research released its report on ''Asset Management and Financial Stability'', the central conclusion was that the activities of the asset management industry as a whole make it systemically important and may pose a risk to US financial stability. Furthermore, in 2014 the Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of Securities Commissions issued the Consultative Document which proposed methodologies for identifying globally active systemically important investment funds. Both reports further the conclusion that is likely the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council will designate a few large US asset managers as systemically important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pwc.com/en_US/us/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/assets/fs-reg-brief-dodd-frank-act-nonbank-sifis-asset-management.pdf|title= Nonbank SIFIs: No solace for US asset managers |website= http://www.pwc.com/us/en/financial-services/regulatory-services/publications/dodd-frank-act-nonbank-sifis-asset-management.jhtml, February, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Baumer''' (born 29 May 1960 in [[Fribourg]] ([[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss economist and expert for [[Intercultural competence]] and [[Psychological evaluation|Personality assessment]]. He developed parts of the ''prognostic personality and abilities assessment'' and coined this term especially within the German speaking countries.

== Personal life ==
Thomas Baumer attended the [[Jesuit]] school [[Stella Matutina (Jesuit School)|Stella Matutina]] in [[Feldkirch, Vorarlberg|Feldkirch]] ([[Austria]]) and studied business economics at the [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences]] in [[Zurich]] (Switzerland).

He is married and father of a son.

== Career ==
From 1986 to 1999 he worked at the former Swiss national airline [[Swissair]], last as division manager and deputy general manager at the Swissair Training Center (recruiting of [[Pilot (aircraft)|pilots]] and management members at Swissair and other companies, formation of pilots and [[flight attendant]]s, human aspects development).
He is founder and chairman of the institute ''CICB Center of Intercultural Competence Ltd.'' which was founded in 2000 and, expanded with the department ''CACB Center for Assessment and Coaching'', runs as an incorporated, multilingual company since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professional-learning.ch/content/presse_service/pressemitteilungen/archiv_resource/archiv_resource/2012/schweizer_hr_gipfel_2012_messe_duo_workshop_und_konferenz/index_ger.html Intensive Staff Course at the Fair Zurich] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131006024049/http://www.professional-learning.ch/content/presse_service/pressemitteilungen/archiv_resource/archiv_resource/2012/schweizer_hr_gipfel_2012_messe_duo_workshop_und_konferenz/index_ger.html |date=2013-10-06 }}, [http://www.professional-learning.ch/content/presse_service/bildmaterial/index_ger.html Keynote-Speaker / Praxisforen], [http://www.professional-learning.ch/ Swiss Professional Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weka-personal.ch/praxisreport_view.cfm?nr_praxisreport=71 Compasso Information portal for employers] In: [http://www.weka.ch/ Weka Gateway for Human Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baumer researches and holds courses, preparations for missions abroad and performed, so far, over 500 assessments and [[coaching]]s (with or without focus on intercultural competence) in English, German, French and Spanish. He developed and coined essential areas of the ''prognostic personality and abilities assessment'' which allows, in extension to the findings with known personality assessment methods (e. g. [[Assessment center]]) and [[Potential analysis]], a concise and verifiable conclusion not only concerning existing abilities and potentials (talents) of someone, but also concerning attainable goals, with the necessary frame conditions and the needed period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cicb.net/images/stories/HR_Today_PA_def.pdf Peer into the future with a prognostic assessment'' (Mit prognostischen Assessments in die Zukunft blicken)] (PDF-File; 211&amp;nbsp;kB) In: [http://www.hrtoday.ch/article/mit-prognostischen-assessments-die-zukunft-blicken HR Today Special 1/2012 (Periodical)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turnkey''' or a '''turnkey project''' (also spelled '''turn-key''') is a type of project that is constructed so that it can be sold to any buyer as a completed product. This is contrasted with [[build to order]], where the constructor builds an item to the buyer's exact specifications, or when an incomplete product is sold with the assumption that the buyer would complete it.

A turnkey project or contract as described by Duncan Wallace (1984) is:&lt;ref name=wallace&gt;{{cite conference |title=Contracts for Industrial Project |last1=Wallace |first1=Duncan |year=1984 |book-title= |pages=3 |location=Kuala Lumpur |conference=Building and Civil Engineering Claims }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|…. a contract where the essential design emanates from, or is supplied by, the Contractor and not the owner, so that the legal responsibility for the design, suitability and performance of the work after completion will be made to rest … with the contractor …. 'Turnkey' is treated as merely signifying the design responsibility as the contractor's.}}

A turnkey computer system is a complete computer including hardware, operating system and application(s) designed and sold to satisfy specific business requirements.

==Common usage==

'''Turnkey'''  refers to something that is ready for immediate use, generally used in the sale or supply of goods or services. The word is a reference to the fact that the customer, upon receiving the product, just needs to turn the ignition key to make it operational, or that the key just needs to be turned over to the customer.&lt;ref name=rics&gt;{{cite web|title=RICS draft guidance note - Comparative construction and engineering contracts": 1.3.5 The 'turnkey' approach|url=https://consultations.rics.org/consult.ti/comparative.construction/view?objectId=2425300|website=RICS Consult|publisher=RICS Consult|accessdate=2 July 2015|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnkey is often used to describe a home built on the developer's land with the developer's financing ready for the customer to move in. If a contractor builds a "turnkey home" they frame the structure and finish the interior. Everything is completed down to the cabinets and carpet. "Turnkey" is commonly used in the construction industry, for instance, in which it refers to the bundling of materials and labour by Home Builder or General Contractor to move into the home without owner involvement. 'Turnkey' is also commonly used in [[motorsports]] to describe a car being sold with [[Powertrain|drivetrain]] (engine, transmission, etc.) to contrast with a vehicle sold without one so that other components may be re-used.

Similarly, this term may be used to advertise the sale of an established business, including all the equipment necessary to run it, or by a business-to-business supplier providing complete packages for business start-up.&lt;ref name=rics/&gt; An example would be the creation of a "turnkey hospital" which would be building a complete medical centre with installed medical equipment.

==Specific usage==

The term turnkey is also often used in the technology industry, most commonly to describe pre-built computer "packages" in which everything needed to perform a certain type of task (e.g. audio editing) is put together by the supplier and sold as a bundle.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This often includes a computer with pre-installed software, various types of hardware, and accessories. Such packages are commonly called [[computer appliance|appliances]]. A website with a ready-made solutions and some configurations is called a turnkey website.

In real estate, '''turnkey''' is defined as a home or property that is ready for occupation for its intended purpose, ie., a home that is fully functional, needs no upgrading or repairs (move-in ready).  In commercial use, a building set up to do auto repairs would be defined as turnkey if it came fully stocked with all needed machinery and tools for that particular trade.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The turnkey process includes all of the steps involved to open a location including the site selection, negotiations, space planning, construction coordination and complete installation. '''Turnkey''' real estate also refers to a type of [[investment]]. This process includes the purchase, construction or rehab (of an existing site), the leasing out to tenants, and then the sale of the property to a buyer. The buyer is purchasing an investment property which is producing a stream of income.

In [[oil well|drilling]], the term indicates an arrangement where a contractor must fully complete a well up to some milestone to receive any payment (in exchange for greater compensation upon completion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=turnkey|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms/t/turnkey.aspx|website=Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawyer and businessman==
Vasily Aleksanyan graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] and the [[Harvard Law School|Law School]] of [[Harvard University]] as a [[Master of Laws]]. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton]]. In 1995–1996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm [[SUN Group]]. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for [[Yukos]].&lt;ref name=kareera/&gt;

On 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President.&lt;ref name=Kommersant6&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skornyakova, Anna|author2=Olga Pleshanova |author3=Yevgeniy Alekseev |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664057|script-title=ru:Новый вице-президент ЮКОСа успел сказать корпоративное управление|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 60|issue=3391|date= April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant7&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trifonov, Vladislad|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664463|script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура сложила президентские полномочия|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 61|issue=3392|date=April 7, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April.&lt;ref name=zoominfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=410002248|title=Biography of Vasily Aleksanyan|publisher=[[ZoomInfo]]}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the [[London]] Yukos headquarters bypassing the [[Moscow]] based offices of [[Yukos RM]] and [[Yukos EP]]. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled [[Rosneft]] instead.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e.g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion [[Russian ruble|ruble]] [[promissory note]].&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

On 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos.&lt;ref name=heared/&gt; According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the [[embezzlement]] of more than 12 billion rubles.&lt;ref name=held&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/04/06/alexsanyan/|script-title=ru:Вице-президент "ЮКОСа" Василий Алексанян задержан|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest was based on the testimonies of [[Svetlana Bakhmina]], a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

==In prison==

After his arrest Aleksanyan started a [[hunger strike]], insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006.&lt;ref name=RIAN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20060502/47120067.html|script-title=ru:ФСИН подтверждает, что Василий Алексанян прекратил голодовку|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=May 2, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to [[HIV]]-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL0748261720080207|title=Russia says will move AIDS prisoner to hospital|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date= February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became almost blind and developed [[cancer]] of the [[liver]] with [[metastasis]] into the [[lymph node]]s.

Despite the grave medical situation demanding urgent [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral treatment]] and [[chemotherapy]] in a hospital, he was denied both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Osadchuk, Svetlana|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2008/02/07/002.html|title=Trial Stops But Judges Won't Free Aleksanyan|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007.&lt;ref name=politru&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.polit.ru/news/2007/12/29/alex.html|script-title=ru:Смертельно больной менеджер ЮКОСа требует перевода из тюрьмы в больницу|publisher=[[Polit.Ru]]|date=December 29, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|script-title=ru:Василий Алексанян просит правозащитников о помощи|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|date=December 27, 2007|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230191213/http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|archivedate=December 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment.

[[Echo of Moscow]]. 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of [[Moscow]] approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had [[cancer]], [[tuberculosis]]  and [[AIDS]] and his [[spleen]] was surgically removed).&lt;ref name=releasedlenta&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2008/12/08/free1/|script-title=ru:Суд освободил бывшего вице-президента "ЮКОСа" Василия Алексаняна|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/russia/08dec2008/alex_zalog.html|script-title=ru:Суд готов освободить смертельно больного Василия Алексаняна - под залог в $2 млн|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid.&lt;ref name=releasedlenta/&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt; Human rights advocates [[Lev Ponomaryov]] and [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money.&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt;

==Release and death==
On 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the ''Aleksanyan v. Russia'' case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vasileva, Vera|url=http://hro1.org/node/4053|script-title=ru:Страсбургский суд принял решение по делу "Алексанян против России"|publisher=hro1.org|date=December 22, 2008|language=Russian|title=Archived copy|access-date=December 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130323/http://hro1.org/node/4053|archive-date=December 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=844609&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=Case of Aleksanyan v.

On 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] was paid,  Aleksanyan was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/international/newsid_7834000/7834678.stm Алексанян выписан из больницы]&lt;/ref&gt; But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings. The case against him was only dropped last year as the statute of limitations ran out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/aleksanyans-death-practically-murder/444834.html Andrew McChesney and Alexandra Odynova in ''The Moscow Times'': Aleksanyan's Death 'Practically Murder']&lt;/ref&gt;

He was then appointed by the [[Idris Jusoh|Chief Minister Dato Idris Jusoh]] to join the State Executive Council holding the State Infrastructure Development, Public Service and Communication Committee portfolio due to his academic qualification and his vast experience in construction business. He was also then elected as the [[UMNO]] Treasurer for the state. However, he lost his seat in the 12th Malaysian General Election with a majority of 31 votes.

The '''working poor''' are working people whose incomes fall below a given [[poverty line]] due to lack of work hours and/or low wages.
Largely because they are earning such low wages, the working poor face numerous obstacles that make it difficult for many of them to find and keep a job, save up money, and maintain a sense of self-worth.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich&gt;{{cite book| last=Ehrenreich |first=Barbara |title=Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America |year=2001| publisher=Holt Paperbacks| location=New York| isbn=0-8050-8838-5 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SfAgn7KXggIC&amp;dq=nickel+and+dimed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official working poverty rate in the US has remained relatively static over the past four decades, but many social scientists argue that the official rate is set too low, and that the proportion of workers facing significant financial hardship has instead increased over the years. Changes in the economy, especially the shift from a [[Secondary sector of the economy|
manufacturing-based]] to a [[Service economy|service-based economy]], have resulted in the polarization of the [[labor market]].  This means that there are more jobs at the top and the bottom of the income spectrum, but fewer jobs in the middle.&lt;ref name=Kalleberg&gt;{{cite book| last=Kalleberg |first=Arne |title=Good Jobs, Bad Jobs: The Rise of Polarized and Precarious Employment Systems in the United States |year=2011 |publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York |isbn=0-87154-431-8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8LHvtgAACAAJ&amp;dq=books+good+jobs+bad+jobs+kalleberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a wide range of [[anti-poverty]] policies that have been shown to improve the situation of the working poor.  Research suggests that increasing [[welfare state]] generosity is the most effective way to reduce poverty and working poverty.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt; 

==Conceptualizing working poverty==
In the United States, the issue of working poverty was initially brought to the public's attention during the [[Progressive Era]] (1890s–1920s).  Progressive Era thinkers like [[Robert Hunter (author)|Robert Hunter]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] saw society's unequal opportunity structure as the root cause of poverty and working poverty, but they also saw a link between moral factors and poverty.  In his study of Philadelphia's African American neighborhoods, W.E.B. Du Bois draws a distinction between "hardworking" poor people who fail to escape poverty due to racial discrimination and those who are poor due to moral deficiencies such as laziness or lack of perseverance.&lt;ref name=DuBois&gt;{{cite book| last=Du Bois| first=W.E.B| title=The Philadelphia Negro|year=1899|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-8122-1573-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfEtAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=the+philadelphia+negro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Great Depression]], [[the New Deal]], and [[World War II]], the United States experienced an era of prosperity during which most workers experienced significant gains in wages and working conditions.  During this period (1930s–1950s), scholars shifted their attention away from poverty and working poverty.  However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s American scholars and policymakers began to revisit the problem.  Influential books like [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]'s ''[[The Affluent Society]]'' (1958)&lt;ref name=Galbraith&gt;{{cite book |last= Galbraith|first=John Kenneth|title=The Affluent Society |origyear=1958|year=2008|publisher= [[Houghton-Mifflin]] | location=New York |isbn=0-395-92500-2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=buihYlwXhuwC&amp;dq=the+affluent+society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Michael Harrington]]'s ''[[The Other America]]'' (1962)&lt;ref name=Harrington&gt;{{cite book| last= Harrington |first= Michael|title=The Other America: Poverty in the United States|year=1962 |orig-year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York| isbn=0-684-82678-X| url=https://books.google.com/?id=sZDgwcHQmkwC&amp;dq=the+other+america}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reinvigorated the discussions on poverty and working poverty in the United States.

Since the start of the War on Poverty in the 1960s, scholars and policymakers on both ends of the political spectrum have paid an increasing amount of attention to working poverty.  One of the key ongoing debates concerns the distinction between the working and the nonworking (unemployed) poor.  Conservative scholars tend to see nonworking poverty as a more urgent problem than working poverty because they believe that non-work is a moral hazard that leads to [[welfare dependency]] and laziness, whereas work, even poorly paid work, is morally beneficial.  In order to solve the problem of nonworking poverty, some conservative scholars argue that the government must stop "coddling" the poor with welfare benefits like [[AFDC]]/[[TANF]].&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Charles|title=Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950–1980|year=1984|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-04233-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-dKvsZb03GgC&amp;dq=losing+ground+murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, liberal scholars and policymakers often argue that most working and nonworking poor people are quite similar.  Studies comparing single mothers on and off welfare show that receiving welfare payments does not degrade a person's desire to find a job and get off of welfare.&lt;ref name="Edin and Lein"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Edin |first=Katherine|author2=Laura Lein  |title=Work, Welfare, and Single Mothers' Economic Survival Strategies| journal= American Journal of Sociology |year=1997 |volume=62|issue=2|pages=253–266| jstor=2657303| doi=10.2307/2657303}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The main difference between the working and the nonworking poor, they argue, is that the nonworking poor have a more difficult time overcoming basic barriers to entry into the labor market, such as arranging for affordable childcare, finding housing near potential jobs, or arranging for transportation to and from work.  In order to help the nonworking poor gain entry into the labor market, liberal scholars and policymakers argue that the government should provide more housing assistance, childcare, and other kinds of aid to poor families.&lt;ref name=briggs&gt;{{cite book |last=de Souza Briggs|first=Xavier|title=Moving to Opportunity |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-539371-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CuJcHoxUxDkC&amp;dq=moving+to+opportunity |first2=Susan J. |last2=Popkin |first3=John |last3=Goering}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions about the alleviation of working poverty are also politically charged.  Conservative scholars and policymakers often attribute the prevalence of inequality and working poverty to overregulation and overtaxation, which they claim constricts job growth.  In order to lower the rate of working poverty, conservatives advocate reducing welfare benefits and enacting less stringent labor laws.&lt;ref name=Murray /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mead&gt;{{cite book| last=Mead| first=Lawrence |title=Beyond Entitlement: The Social Obligations of Citizenship|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7432-2495-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J7VD5plVv_YC&amp;dq=mead+lawrence+beyond+entitlement}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many liberals argue that working poverty can only be solved through increased, not decreased, government intervention.  This government intervention could include workplace reforms (such as higher minimum wages, living wage laws, job training programs, etc.) and an increase in government transfers (such as housing, food, childcare, and healthcare subsidies).&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt;&lt;ref name="Edin and Lein" /&gt;

== Measuring working poverty ==

===Absolute===
According to the [[US Department of Labor]], the working poor "are persons who spent at least 27 weeks [in the past year] in the labor force (that is, working or looking for work), but whose incomes fell below the official poverty level."&lt;ref name="bls"&gt;{{cite web|last=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=A Profile of the Working Poor, 2009|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswp2009.pdf|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words,  if someone spent more than half of the past year in the [[labor force]] without earning more than the official poverty threshold, the US Department of Labor would classify them as "working poor."  (Note: The official poverty threshold, which is set by the US Census Bureau, varies depending on the size of a family and the age of the family members.)  The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] calculates working poverty rates for all working individuals, all families with at least one worker, and all "unrelated individuals."  The individual-level working poverty rate calculates the percentage of all workers whose incomes fall below the poverty threshold.  In 2009, the individual-level working poverty rate in the US was 7%, compared to 4.7% in 2000.  The family-level working poverty rate only includes families of two or more people who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' definition of family-level working poverty, a family is working poor if the combined cash income of the family falls below the poverty threshold for a family of their size.  In 2009, the family-level working poverty rate in the US was 7.9%, compared to 5.6% in 2000.  Finally, the unrelated individual working poverty rate measures working poverty among those who do not currently live with any family members.   In 2009, 11.7% of employed unrelated individuals were poor, compared to 7.6% in 2000.&lt;ref name=bls /&gt;&lt;ref name="bls 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=US Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=A Profile of the Working Poor, 2000|url=http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswp2000.htm|publisher=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative===
In Europe and other non-US, high-income countries, poverty and working poverty are defined in relative terms.  A relative measure of poverty is based on a country's income distribution rather than an absolute amount of money. [[Eurostat]], the statistical office of the [[European Union]], classifies a household as poor if its income is less than 60 percent of the country's median household income.  According to Eurostat, a relative measure of poverty is appropriate because "minimal acceptable standards usually differ between societies according to their general level of prosperity: someone regarded as poor in a rich developed country might be regarded as rich in a poor developing country."&lt;ref name="Eurostat poverty"&gt;{{cite web| last=European Working Conditions Observatory|title=Income Poverty in the European Union| url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/ewco/surveyreports/EU0703019D/EU0703019D_3.htm| publisher=Eurostat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When conducting [[cross-national research]] on working poverty, scholars tend to use a relative measure of poverty.  In these studies, to be classified as "working poor," a household must satisfy the following two conditions: 1) at least one member of the household must be "working" (which can be defined in various ways), and 2) the total household income must be less than 60% (or 50%, or 40%) of the median income for that country.&lt;ref name=Lohmann&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lohmann|first=Henning|title=Welfare States, Labour Market Institutions and the Working Poor: A Comparative Analysis of 20 European Countries|journal=European Sociological Review |year=2009|volume=25|pages=489–504| url=http://esr.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/4/489.short|accessdate=5 November 2011 |doi=10.1093/esr/jcn064 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BFC&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brady|first=David|author2=Andrew Fullerton|author3=Jennifer Moren Cross|title=More Than Just Nickels and Dimes: A Cross-National Analysis of Working Poverty in Affluent Democracies|journal=Social Problems|year=2010|volume=57|pages=559–585|url=http://www.soc.duke.edu/~brady/web/Bradyetal2010.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2011|pmid=20976971|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.4.559|issue=4|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404065006/http://www.soc.duke.edu/~brady/web/Bradyetal2010.pdf|archivedate=4 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brady, Fullerton, and Cross's 2010 cross-national study on working poverty in high-income countries defines a household as working poor if 1) it has at least one employed person and 2) the total household income falls below 50% of the median income for that country.  According to this relative definition, the US's working poverty rate was 11% in the year 2000, nearly double the rate produced by the US government's absolute definition.  For the same year, Canada's working poverty rate was 7.8%, the UK's was 4%, and Germany's was 3.8%.&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt;

==Prevalence and trends==
[[File:Poverty Rates by Sex and Work Status for Americans 65+ in 2006.png|thumb|Poverty rates by gender and work for Americans aged 65 and over]]
Poverty is often associated with joblessness, but a large proportion of poor people are actually working or looking for work.  In 2009, according to the US Census Bureau's official definition of poverty, 8.8 million US families were below the poverty line (11.1% of all families).   Of these families, 5.19 million, or 58.9%, had at least one person who was classified as working.   In the same year, there were 11.7 million unrelated individuals (people who do not live with family members) whose incomes fell below the official poverty line (22% of all unrelated individuals).  3.9 million of these poor individuals, or 33%, were part of the working poor.&lt;ref name=bls /&gt;&lt;ref name="census bureau 2009"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeNavas-Walt|first=Carla|title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=14 December 2011|author2=Bernadette D. Proctor |author3=Jessica C. Smith }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 for a middle-income, two-parent family averaged $226,920 last year (not including college), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up nearly 40% -- or more than $60,000—from 10 years ago. Just one year of spending on a child can cost up to $13,830 in 2010, compared to $9,860 a decade ago.

Using the US Census Bureau's definition of poverty, the working poverty rate seems to have remained relatively stable since 1978.&lt;ref name=bls /&gt;   However, many scholars have argued that the official poverty threshold is  too low, and that real wages and working conditions have actually declined for many workers over the past three or four decades.  Social scientists like [[Arne L. Kalleberg|Arne Kalleberg]] have found that the decline in US manufacturing and the subsequent polarization of the labor market has led to an overall worsening of wages, job stability, and working conditions for people with lower skill levels and less formal education.  From the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s, manufacturing jobs offered many low-skilled and medium-skilled workers stable, well-paying jobs.  Due to global competition, technological advances, and other factors, US manufacturing jobs have been disappearing for decades.  (From 1970 to 2008, the percentage of the labor force employed in the manufacturing sector shrank from 23.4% to 9.1%.&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;{{cite web|last=International Labor Organization|title=Laborsta Internet |publisher=ILO Department of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="labor force trends"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Marlene|title=US Labor Force Trends|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/63.2uslabor.pdf|publisher=Population Reference Bureau|author2=Mark Mather |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  During this period of decline, job growth became polarized on either end of the labor market.  That is, the jobs that replaced medium-pay, low- to medium-skill manufacturing jobs were high-paying, high-skill jobs and low-paying, low-skill jobs.  Therefore, many low- to medium-skilled workers who would have been able to work in the manufacturing sector in 1970 must now take low-paying, precarious jobs in the service sector.&lt;ref name=Kalleberg /&gt;

===US compared to Europe===
Other high-income countries have also experienced declining manufacturing sectors over the past four decades, but most of them have not experienced as much labor market polarization as the United States.  Labor market polarization has been the most severe in [[Economic liberalism|liberal market economies]] like the US, Britain, and Australia.  Countries like Denmark and France have been subject to the same economic pressures, but due to their more "inclusive" (or "egalitarian") labor market institutions, such as centralized and solidaristic collective bargaining and strong minimum wage laws, they have experienced less polarization.&lt;ref name=Kalleberg /&gt;

Cross-national studies have found that European countries' working poverty rates are much lower than the US's.  Most of this difference can be explained by the fact that European countries' welfare states are more generous than the US's.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt;  The relationship between generous welfare states and low rates of working poverty is elaborated upon in the "Risk Factors" and "Anti-Poverty Policies" sections.

The following graph uses data from Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) to show the working poverty rates for a small sample of countries.  Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) accessed this data through the [[Luxembourg Income Study]].  This graph measures household, rather than person-level, poverty rates.  A household is coded as "poor" if its income is less than 50% of its country's median income.  This is a relative, rather than absolute, measure of poverty.  A household is classified as "working" if at least one member of the household was employed at the time of the survey.  The most important insight contained in this graph is that the US has strikingly higher working poverty rates than European countries.

==Risk factors==
There are five major categories of risk factors that increase a person's likelihood of experiencing working poverty: sectoral factors, demographic factors, economic factors, labor market institutions, and welfare generosity.  Working poverty is a phenomenon that affects a very wide range of people, but there are some employment sectors, demographic groups, political factors, and economic factors that are correlated with higher rates of working poverty than others.  Sectoral and demographic factors help explain why certain people within a given country are more likely than others to be working poor.  Political and economic factors can explain why different countries have different working poverty rates.

'''Sectoral tendencies'''&lt;br /&gt;
Working poverty is not distributed equally among employment sectors.  The [[service sector]] has the highest rate of working poverty.  In fact, 13.3%  of US service sector workers found themselves below the poverty line in 2009.&lt;ref name=bls /&gt;   Examples of low-wage service sector workers include fast-food workers, home health aids, waiters/waitresses, and retail workers.

Although the service sector has the highest rate of working poverty, a significant portion of the working poor are [[blue-collar worker]]s in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries.  Most manufacturing jobs used to offer generous wages and benefits, but manufacturing job quality has declined over the years.  Nowadays, many US manufacturing jobs are located in [[right-to-work state]]s, where it is nearly impossible for workers to form a union.  This means that manufacturing employers are able to pay lower wages and offer fewer benefits than they used to.

'''Demographic factors'''&lt;br /&gt;
In her book, ''No Shame in My Game'', Katherine Newman finds that "[t]he nation's young, its single parents, the poorly educated, and minorities are more likely than other workers to be poor" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Katherine|title=No Shame in My Game|year=2000|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0-375-70379-9|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/No_shame_in_my_game.html?id=1jfAhghdH7MC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These factors, in addition to being part of a large household, being part of a single-earner household, being female, and having a part-time (instead of a full-time) job have been found to be important working poverty "risk factors." [[Immigrant workers]] and [[self-employed]] workers are also more likely to be working poor than other kinds of workers.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt;

'''Economic factors'''&lt;br /&gt;
There is a widespread assumption that economic growth leads to tighter labor markets and higher wages.  However, the evidence suggests that economic growth does not always benefit each part of the population equally.  For example, the 1980s was a period of economic growth and prosperity in the United States, but most of the economic gains were concentrated at the top of the income spectrum.  This means that people near the bottom of the labor market did not benefit from the economic gains of the 1980s.  In fact, many have argued that low-skilled workers experienced declining prosperity in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Blank&gt;{{cite journal| last=Blank |first= Rebecca |title=Why Were Poverty Rates So High in the 1980s?|journal=NBER Working Paper No.3878|year=1991|url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/63.2uslabor.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Therefore, changing economic conditions do not have as large of an impact on working poverty rates as one might expect.

'''Labor market institutions'''&lt;br /&gt;
Labor markets can be egalitarian, efficient, or somewhere in the middle.  According to Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010), "[e]fficient labor markets typically feature flexibility, low unemployment, and higher economic growth, and facilitate the rapid hiring and firing of workers.  Egalitarian labor markets are bolstered by strong labor market institutions, higher wages, and greater security" (p562).  The United States has an efficient labor market, whereas most European countries have egalitarian labor markets.  Each system has its drawbacks, but the egalitarian labor market model is typically associated with lower rates of working poverty.  One tradeoff to this is that the "lowest skilled and least employable" people are sometimes excluded from an egalitarian labor market, and must instead rely on government aid in order to survive (p.&amp;nbsp;563).&lt;ref name=BFC /&gt;  If the United States switched from an efficient to an egalitarian labor market, it might have to increase its welfare state generosity in order to cope with a higher unemployment rate.

Centralized wage bargaining is a key component of egalitarian labor markets.  In a country with centralized wage bargaining institutions, wages for entire industries are negotiated at the regional or national level.  This means that similar workers earn similar wages, which reduces income inequality.  Lohmann (2009) finds that countries with centralized wage bargaining institutions have lower rates of "pre-transfer" working poverty.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;   The "pre-transfer" working poverty rate is the percentage of workers who fall below the poverty threshold based on their earned wages (not counting [[government transfers]]).

'''Welfare state generosity'''&lt;br /&gt;
Cross-national studies are in agreement that the most important factor affecting working poverty rates is welfare state generosity.  A generous welfare state spends a higher proportion of its GDP on things like unemployment insurance, social security, family assistance, childcare subsidies, healthcare subsidies, housing subsidies, transportation subsidies, and food subsidies.  Studies on working poverty have found that these kinds of government spending can pull a significant number of people out of poverty, even if they earn low wages.  Lohmann's 2009 study shows that welfare state generosity has a significant impact on the "post-transfer" rate of working poverty.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;  The "post-transfer" rate of working poverty is the percentage of working households that fall below the poverty threshold after government aid has been taken into account.

Different types of transfers benefit different kinds of low-wage families.  Family benefits will benefit households with children and unemployment benefits will benefit households that include workers with significant work experience.  Transfers such as old-age benefits are unlikely to benefit low-wage households unless the elderly are living in the same household.  Sometimes, even when benefits are available, those who qualify do not take advantage of them.  Migrants in particular are less likely to take advantage of the available benefits.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;

==Obstacles to uplift==
The working poor face many of the same daily life struggles as the nonworking poor, but they also face some unique obstacles.  Some studies, many of them [[Qualitative research|qualitative]], provide detailed insights into the obstacles that hinder workers' ability to find jobs, keep jobs, and make ends meet.  Some of the most common struggles faced by the working poor are finding affordable housing, arranging transportation to and from work, buying basic necessities, arranging childcare, having unpredictable work schedules, juggling two or more jobs, and coping with low-status work.

'''Housing'''&lt;br /&gt;
Working poor people who do not have friends or relatives with whom they can live often find themselves unable to rent an apartment of their own.  Although the working poor are employed at least some of the time, they often find it difficult to save enough money for a deposit on a rental property.  As a result, many working poor people end up in living situations that are actually more costly than a month-to-month rental.  For instance, many working poor people, especially those who are in some kind of transitional phase, rent rooms in week-to-week motels.  These motel rooms tend to cost much more than a traditional rental, but they are accessible to the working poor because they do not require a large deposit.  If someone is unable or unwilling to pay for a room in a motel, they might live in his/her car, in a homeless shelter, or on the street.  This is not a marginal phenomenon; in fact, according to the 2008 US Conference of Mayors, one in five homeless people are currently employed.&lt;ref name=Mayors&gt;{{cite web|last=US Conference of Mayors|title=2008 Status Report on Hunger &amp; Homelessness|url=http://usmayors.org/pressreleases/documents/hungerhomelessnessreport_121208.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, some working poor people are able to access [[housing subsidies]] (such as a [[Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher]]) to help cover their housing expenses.  However, these housing subsidies are not available to everyone who meets the Section 8 income specifications.  In fact, less than 25% of people who qualify for a housing subsidy receive one.&lt;ref name=briggs/&gt;

'''Education'''&lt;br /&gt;
The issue with education starts many times with the working poor from childhood and follows them into their struggle for a substantial income. Children growing up in families of the working poor are not provided the same educational opportunities as their middle-class counterpart. In many cases the low income community is filled with schools that are lacking necessities and support needed to form a solid education.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, David. 2000. "Teach the Children: Who Decides." New York Times (September 19): A19.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows students as they continue in education. In many cases this hinders the possibility for America's youth to continue on to higher education. The grades and credits just are not attained in many cases, and the lack of guidance in the schools leaves the children of the working poor with no degree. Also, the lack of funds for continuing education causes these children to fall behind. In many cases, their parents did not continue on into higher education and because of this have a difficult time finding jobs with salaries that can support a family. Today a college degree is a requirement for many jobs, and it is the low skill jobs that usually only require a high school degree or GED. The [[Education inequality|inequality]] in available education continues the vicious cycle of families entering into the working poor.

'''Transportation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Given the fact that many working poor people do not own a car or cannot afford to drive their car, where they live can significantly limit where they are able to work, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;  Given the fact that public transportation in many US cities is sparse, expensive, or non-existent, this is a particularly salient obstacle.  Some working poor people are able to use their social networks—if they have them—to meet their transportation needs.  In a study on low-income single mothers, Edin and Lein found that single mothers who had someone to drive them to and from work were much more likely to be able to support themselves without relying on government aid.&lt;ref name="Edin and Lein" /&gt;

'''Basic necessities'''&lt;br /&gt;
Like the unemployed poor, the working poor struggle to pay for basic necessities like food, clothing, housing, and transportation.  In some cases, however, the working poor's basic expenses can be higher than the unemployed poor's.  For instance, the working poor's clothing expenses may be higher than the unemployed poor's because they must purchase specific clothes or uniforms for their jobs.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;  Also, because the working poor are spending much of their time at work, they may not have the time to prepare their own food.  In this case, they may frequently resort to eating [[fast food]], which is less healthful and more expensive than home-prepared food.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

'''Childcare'''&lt;br /&gt;
Working poor parents with young children, especially single parents, face significantly more childcare-related obstacles than other people.  Often, childcare costs can exceed a low-wage earners' income, making work, especially in a job with no potential for advancement, an economically illogical activity.&lt;ref name="Edin and Lein" /&gt;&lt;ref name=briggs /&gt;   However, some single parents are able to rely on their social networks to provide free or below-market-cost childcare.&lt;ref name="Edin and Lein" /&gt; There are also some free childcare options provided by the government, such as the [[Head Start Program]].  However, these free options are only available during certain hours, which may limit parents' ability to take jobs that require late-night shifts.The U.S. "average" seems to suggest that for one toddler, in full-time day care, on weekdays, the cost is approximately $600.00 per month. But, that figure can rise to well over $1000.00 per month in major metro areas, and fall to less than $350 in rural areas.The average cost of center-based daycare in the United States is $11,666 per year ($972 a month), but prices range from $3,582 to $18,773 a year ($300 to $1,564 monthly), according to the National Association of Child Care Resource &amp; Referral Agencies (NACCRRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much you'll spend on childcare|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-youll-spend-on-childcare_1199776.bc|website=www.babycenter.com|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Work schedules'''&lt;br /&gt;
Many [[low-wage job]]s force workers to accept irregular schedules.  In fact, some employers will not hire someone unless they have "open availability," which means being available to work any time, any day.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;  This makes it difficult for workers to arrange for childcare and to take on a second job.  In addition, working poor people's working hours can fluctuate wildly from one week to the next, making it difficult for them to budget effectively and save up money.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

'''Multiple jobs'''&lt;br /&gt;
Many low-wage workers have to work multiple jobs in order to make ends meet. In 1996, 6.2 percent of the workforce held two or more full- or part-time jobs.  Most of these people held two part-time jobs or one part-time job and one full-time job, but 4% of men and 2% of women held two full-time jobs at the same time.&lt;ref name=Stinson&gt;{{cite journal| last=Stinson |first =John|title=New Data on Multiple Jobholding Available from the CPS|journal=Monthly Labor Review |date=March 1997|url=http://bls.gov/mlr/1997/03/art1full.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be physically exhausting and can often lead to short and long-term health problems.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;

'''Low-Status Work'''&lt;br /&gt;
Many low-wage service sector jobs require a great deal of customer service work.  Although not all customer service jobs are low-wage or low-status,&lt;ref name=Sherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Rachel|title=Class Acts: service and inequality in luxury hotels|year=2007|publisher=UC Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=0-520-24782-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Z5cYjQsFxgC&amp;dq=rachel+sherman+hotel+book}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them are.  Some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that the low status nature of some jobs can have negative psychological effects on workers,&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;  but others argue that low status workers come up with coping mechanisms that allow them to maintain a strong sense of self-worth.&lt;ref name=Newman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamont&gt;{{cite book|last=Lamont|first=Michèle|title=The Dignity of Working Men: Morality and Boundaries of Race, Class, and Immigration|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-00306-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ehXs95d-BU4C&amp;dq=michelle+lamont+the+dignity}}&lt;/ref&gt;   One of these coping mechanisms is called [[boundary-work|boundary work]].  Boundary work happens when one group of people valorize their own social position by comparing themselves to another group, who they perceive to be inferior in some way.  For example, Newman (1999) found that fast food workers in New York City cope with the low-status nature of their job by comparing themselves to the unemployed, who they perceive to be even lower-status than themselves.&lt;ref name="Small and Newman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Mario Luis|author2=Katherine Newman |title=Urban Poverty after The Truly Disadvantaged: The Rediscovery of the Family, the Neighborhood, and Culture|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|year=2001|volume=27|pages=23–45|jstor=2678613|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although the low-status nature of working poor people's jobs may have some negative psychological effects, some, but probably not all, of these negative effects can be counteracted through coping mechanisms such as boundary work.

==Anti-poverty policies==
Scholars, policymakers, and others have come up with a variety of proposals for how to reduce or eliminate working poverty.  Most of these proposals are directed toward the United States, but they might also be relevant to other countries.  The remainder of the section outlines the pros and cons of some of the most commonly proposed solutions.

===Welfare state generosity===
Cross-national studies like Lohmann (2009) and Brady, Fullerton, and Cross (2010) clearly show that countries with generous [[welfare state]]s have lower levels of working poverty than countries with less-generous welfare states, even when factors like demography, economic performance, and labor market institutions are taken into account.  Having a generous welfare state does two key things to reduce working poverty: it raises the [[minimum wage|minimum level of wages]] that people are willing to accept, and it pulls a large portion of low-wage workers out of poverty by providing them with an array of cash and non-cash government benefits.&lt;ref name=Lohmann /&gt;   Many think that increasing the United States' welfare state generosity would lower the working poverty rate.  A common critique of this proposal is that a generous welfare state would not work because it would stagnate the economy, raise unemployment, and degrade people's work ethic.&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt;  However, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, most European countries have a lower [[List of countries by unemployment rate|unemployment rate]] than the US.  Furthermore, although Western European economies' growth rates can be lower than the US's from time to time, their growth rates tend to be more stable, whereas the US's tends to fluctuate relatively severely. Individual states offer financial assistance for child care, but the aid varies widely. Most assistance is administered through the Child Care and Development Block Grants. Check here to find the contact information for your state. Many subsidies have strict income guidelines and are generally for families with children under 13 (the age limit is often extended if the child has a disability). Many subsidies permit home-based care, but some only accept a day care center, so check the requirements. If you need to use an authorized provider, ask if they will put you in touch with an agency that can help you find one.

Some states distribute funds through social or health departments or agencies (like this one in Washington State). For example, the Children's Cabinet in Nevada can refer families to providers, help them apply for subsidies and can even help families who want to pay a relative for care. North Carolina's Smart Start is a public/private partnership that offers funding for child care. Check the National Women's Law Center for each state's child care assistance policy.&lt;ref name="care.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Sources to Help Pay for Child Care|url=https://www.care.com/c/stories/3153/7-sources-to-help-pay-for-child-care/|website=care.com|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wages and benefits===
In the conclusion of her book, ''[[Nickel and Dimed]]'' (2001), Barbara Ehrenreich argues that Americans need to pressure employers to improve worker compensation.&lt;ref name=Ehrenreich /&gt;    Generally speaking, this implies a need to strengthen the [[labor movement]].  Cross-national statistical studies on working poverty suggest that generous welfare states have a larger impact on working poverty than strong labor movements.  The labor movements in various countries have accomplished this through political parties of their own (labor parties) or strategic alliances with non-labor parties, for instance, when striving to put a meaningful [[minimum wage]] in place. The federal government offers a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) that's administered through workplaces.

If your job offers an FSA (also known as a Dependent Care Account), you can put aside up to $5,000 in per-tax dollars to pay for child care expenses. If both you and your spouse have an FSA, the family limit is $5,000—but you could get as much as $2,000 in tax savings if your combined contributions reach the maximum.&lt;ref name="care.com"/&gt;

===Education and training===
Some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that more [[vocational training]] and [[active labour market policies]], especially in growth industries like healthcare and [[renewable energy]], is the solution to working poverty.  To be sure, wider availability of vocational training could pull some people out of working poverty, but the fact remains that the low-wage service sector is a rapidly growing part of the US economy.  Even if more nursing and clean energy jobs were added to the economy, there would still be a huge portion of the workforce in low-wage service sector jobs like retail, food service, and cleaning.  Therefore, it seems clear that any significant reduction in the working poverty rate will have to come from offering higher wages and more benefits to the current, and future, population of service sector workers.

===Child support assurance===
Given the fact that such a large proportion of working poor households are headed by a single mother, one clear way to reduce working poverty would be to make sure that children's fathers share the cost of child rearing.  In cases where the father cannot provide child support, scholars like [[Irwin Garfinkel]] advocate for the implementation of a child support guarantee, whereby the government pays childcare costs if the father cannot. Child support is not always a guarantee if the father or mother does not work. For example, if the parent without custody is not working then the parent with custody does not receive any child support unless the non working parent is employed at their job longer than 90 days, excluding if the non begins to work for its a city or government. Also, the government does not pay for childcare cost if you make more than the cut off range (your gross, per county or state.)

===Marriage===
Households with two wage-earners have a significantly lower rate of working poverty than households with only one wage-earner.  Also, households with two adults, but only one wage-earner, have lower working poverty rates than households with only one adult. Therefore, it seems clear that having two adults in a household, especially if there are children present, is more likely to keep a household out of poverty than having just one adult in a household.  Many scholars and policymakers have used this fact to argue that encouraging people to get married and stay married is an effective way to reduce working poverty (and poverty in general).  However, this is easier said than done.  Research has shown that low-income people marry less often than higher-income people because they have a more difficult time finding a partner who is employed, which is often seen as a prerequisite for marriage.&lt;ref name="wilson, william julius"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=William Julius|title=The Truly Disadvantaged|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0-226-90131-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CT9_ZwEACAAJ&amp;dq=william+julius+wilson+the+truly+disadvantaged}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, unless the employment opportunity structure is improved, simply increasing the number of marriages among low-income people would be unlikely to lower working poverty rates.

Ultimately, effective solutions to working poverty are multifaceted.  Each of the aforementioned proposals could help reduce working poverty in the United States, but they might have a greater impact if at least a few of them were pursued simultaneously.

The '''Worst Forms of Hazards faced by Children at Work''' is a provision in the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation|Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation (No. 190)]] adopted by the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) in 1999. It sets out the framework for examining and assessing, "work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals or children" ([[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|C182]], Article 3d).

This effort is an attempt to complement the earlier [[List of the worst forms of child labour (ILO convention)|list of worst forms of child labour]]. According to the ILO, "hazardous" child labour is the largest category of the "worst forms" of child labour. An estimated 115 million children, aged 5–17, work in dangerous conditions in sectors including agriculture, mining, construction, manufacturing, service industries and domestic service. It is found in both industrialised and developing countries. Kids can take on hazardous work at very early ages. The ILO estimates that some 22,000 children are killed at work every year worldwide. The numbers of those injured or made ill because of their work are not known.

== General guidelines ==

The ILO provides the following guidelines for work considered unsafe for children, such as:

* Involving [[toxicity|toxic]] chemicals or fumes, high-powered equipment or vehicles, cutting, pounding or blasting
* Taking place underground, [[underwater|under water]], at heights, in isolation, at night or in direct sunlight
* Involving long hours without [[break (work)|break]]s
* Carrying heavy loads
* In the presence of alcohol, drugs or crime
* In the presence of dangerous animals or insects
* Absent easy access to [[safe water]] or food
* In jobs with high injury rates

== Examples ==

* [[Hurrying|Hauling wagons]] in underground [[mining]]
* Contact with [[solvent]]s and [[glue]]s in the leather industry
* Glassworks (potential [[Lead poisoning]])
* Gold-mining (potential [[Mercury poisoning]])
* Underwater jobs without protective equipment, such as a wetsuit or air supply, in the fishing industry
* Agriculture (potential [[pesticide]] exposure)
* Bearing heavy loads in the [[construction]] industry
* Exposure to [[radioactive]] materials in the [[nuclear power]] plant
