The '''1972 Olympics Black Power Salute''' was a political protest by two US Olympic runners [[Vincent Matthews (athlete)|Vincent Matthews]] and [[Wayne Collett]] during the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] at the [[Olympiastadion (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]].  This event is sometimes referred to as "The Forgotten Protest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2011/02/01/vince-matthews-and-wayne-collette-1972-the-forgotten-protest/|title=Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett 1972 – The Forgotten Protest?|author=Jimson Lee|work=SpeedEndurance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event came four years after the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/24/sport/olympics-norman-black-power/|title=The third man: The forgotten Black Power hero|author=James Montague, CNN|date=24 April 2012|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the games==
Matthews was a 1968 Olympian who had retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ma/vince-matthews-1.html|title=Vince Matthews|work=Olympics at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was frustrated by problems that included having to pay his own travel to the US Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hartmann | first=D. | title=Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black Athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and Their Aftermath | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-226-31855-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KNvIe2JE0vIC&amp;pg=PA241 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protest==
Both runners refused to stand for the US National Anthem.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite book | last=Schiller | first=K. | last2=Young | first2=C. | title=The 1972 Munich Olympics and the Making of Modern Germany | publisher=University of California Press | series=Weimar and now | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-520-26213-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxEQEqnXdRAC&amp;pg=PT134 | ref=harv | accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They subsequently stroked their beards, and twirled their medals as they left the stadium.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; The crowd booed both runners for their display.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/17/local/la-me-wayne-collett18-2010mar18|title=Wayne Collett dies at 60; UCLA sprinter won silver medal at '72 Olympics|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reaction==
The [[Associated Press]] noted that the casual behavior of Matthews and Collett during the playing of the anthem as "disrespectful," and described the conduct as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Collett, bare-footed, leaped from the No. 2 tier to the No. 1 stand beside his teammate.  They stood sideways to the flag, twirling their medals, with Matthews stroking his chin. Their shoulders slumped, neither stood erect nor looked at the flag. ... As whistles and catcalls continued, Collett raised a clenched fist to the crowd before entering the portal of the dressing room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Milburn, Matthews Win Gold, But U.S. Trails|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gpwcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mWYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5359,2754393&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Markus reported in the Chicago Tribune on September 9, 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/229/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Matthews] was angry at Coach Bill Bowerman-as most of the U.S. trackmen seem to be-because Bowerman had hinted he would like to remove him from the place he had earned in the 400-meter field. He was angry that he had been forced to train on his own in unsuitable facilities, had to travel 4 or 5 times from N.Y. to the west coast in order to get any kind of competition, and had been put down by some of the press as a drag on America's hopes for a 400-meter sweep.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chicago Tribune further reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/09/09/page/227/|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Matthews said his and Collett's actions were directed at the U.S. coaching staff, not the flag or the National Anthem. "We were just mad about a lot of things. We didn't think it would blow up like this. We were asked to apologize. I'm not really sorry for what I did. I'm sorry for the way people took it [hoots and whistles from the stands when the anthem finished]. What I tried to get across to the Olympic Committee was if it was pre-meditated I could have done something better than that. It was just something that happened. We didn't realize the implications to the people in the stands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview after the medal ceremony with the [[American Broadcasting Company]], Collett said the [[national anthem]] meant nothing to him.&lt;ref name=MJ&gt;{{cite news|author=Chuck Johnson|title=Matthews, Collett Barred for Conduct on Victory Stand|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=September 8, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cMAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7196,4127118&amp;dq=wayne+collett&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained that he had felt unable to honor the anthem, because of the struggle faced by [[African American]]s at the time: "I couldn't stand there and sing the words because I don't believe they're true. I wish they were. I believe we have the potential to have a beautiful country, but I don't think we do." The pair were banned from future Olympic competition by the IOC; since [[John Smith (sprinter)|John Smith]] had pulled a hamstring 80 meters into the final while leading and had been ruled unfit to run, the USA were now unable to field a team in the [[4 × 400 metres relay|4 × 400 m relay]] and were forced to scratch from the event.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

===Athlete statements===
&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't acting any differently than I usually do, but we were like goldfish in a fishbowl, in front of all those people. If they wanted me to stand at attention, I could've probably done that, but it wouldn't be me, and I was led to believe that the Olympics was for the athlete. We consider ourselves athletes, not politicians, or marching bands. Our athletic competition was over, and we were both happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/merron/030205.html|title=ESPN.com - Page2 - Violating the Olympic spirit|work=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After the games==
Matthews was banned from all future Olympic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JrEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+banned&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=njf4IVrOwi&amp;sig=JH18ql10zlU9ayOguLiIDL6LvMg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xF8uVY3-KsuKyATe4YGACA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20banned&amp;f=false%7ctitle=Jet%7cwork=google.com|title=Jet|work=google.com|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both runners in fact received a lifelong ban from the IOC and the USOC.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt; This banning likely cost the US medals in the 4x400.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; Both runners were eventually elected to the Black Olympian Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KdbR4eqgfEC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=Vincent+Matthews+Wayne+Collett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PiCNVyOHE4&amp;sig=X8bd-DGcrE-KxhtW7acoiCA9AME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmIuVYuuEouoyQSArYHIAQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Vincent%20Matthews%20Wayne%20Collett&amp;f=false|title=Black Enterprise|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Avery Brundage]] stated the actions of Matthews and Collett made for  a "disgusting display."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/wayne-collett-athlete-who-staged-a-black-power-protest-at-the-1972-olympic-games-1956018.html|title=Wayne Collett: Athlete who staged a Black Power protest at the 1972 Olympic Games|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; This display by the athletes would be overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; Collett went on to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 2011, Matthews was elected to the USATF Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/halloffame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=249|title=USATF - Hall of Fame|work=usatf.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], an '''abstract data type''' ('''ADT''') is a [[mathematical model]] for [[data type]]s, where a data type is defined by its behavior ([[Semantics (computer science)|semantics]]) from the point of view of a ''user'' of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This contrasts with [[data structure]]s, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

Formally, an ADT may be defined as a "class of objects whose logical behavior is defined by a set of values and a set of operations";{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=3}} this is analogous to an [[algebraic structure]] in mathematics. What is meant by "behavior" varies by author, with the two main types of formal specifications for behavior being ''axiomatic (algebraic) specification'' and an ''abstract model;''{{sfn|Dale|Walker|1996|p=4}} these correspond to [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[operational semantics]] of an [[abstract machine]], respectively. Some authors also include the [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] ("cost"), both in terms of time (for computing operations) and space (for representing values). In practice many common data types are not ADTs, as the abstraction is not perfect, and users must be aware of issues like [[arithmetic overflow]] that are due to the representation. For example, integers are often stored as fixed width values (32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers), and thus experience [[integer overflow]] if the maximum value is exceeded.

ADTs are a theoretical concept in computer science, used in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems, and do not correspond to specific features of [[computer language]]s—mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specified ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include [[abstract type]]s, [[opaque data type]]s, [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocols]], and [[design by contract]]. ADTs were first proposed by [[Barbara Liskov]] and Stephen N. Zilles in 1974, as part of the development of the [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] language.{{sfn|Liskov|Zilles|1974}}

==Examples==
For example, [[integer]]s are an ADT, defined as the values …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, and by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, together with greater than, less than, etc., which behave according to familiar mathematics (with care for [[integer division]]), independently of how the integers are represented by the computer.{{efn|Compare to the characterization of integers in abstract algebra.}} Explicitly, "behavior" includes obeying various axioms (associativity and commutativity of addition etc.), and preconditions on operations (cannot divide by zero). Typically integers are represented in a data structure as [[binary number]]s, most often as [[two's complement]], but might be [[binary-coded decimal]] or in [[ones' complement]], but the user is abstracted from the concrete choice of representation, and can simply use the data as data types.

An ADT consists not only of operations, but also of values of the underlying data and of constraints on the operations. An "interface" typically refers only to the operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, notably pre-conditions and post-conditions, but not other constraints, such as relations between the operations.

For example, an abstract [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]], which is a last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;, that inserts a data item onto the stack; &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;, that removes a data item from it; and &lt;kbd&gt;peek&lt;/kbd&gt; or &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;, that accesses a data item on top of the stack without removal. An abstract [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]], which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: &lt;kbd&gt;enqueue&lt;/kbd&gt;, that inserts a data item into the queue; &lt;kbd&gt;dequeue&lt;/kbd&gt;, that removes the first data item from it; and &lt;kbd&gt;front&lt;/kbd&gt;, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most recently pushed item that has not been popped yet. When [[analysis of algorithms|analyzing the efficiency]] of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.

==Introduction==
Abstract data types are purely theoretical entities, used (among other things) to simplify the description of abstract algorithms, to classify and evaluate data structures, and to formally describe the [[type system]]s of programming languages. However, an ADT may be [[implementation|implemented]] by specific [[data type]]s or [[data structure]]s, in many ways and in many programming languages; or described in a [[formal specification language]]. ADTs are often implemented as [[modular programming|modules]]: the module's [[interface (computer science)|interface]] declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, sometimes with [[comment (computer programming)|comments]] that describe the constraints. This [[information hiding]] strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the [[client (computing)|client]] programs.

The term abstract data type can also be regarded as a generalized approach of a number of algebraic structures, such as lattices, groups, and rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rudolf Lidl | title=Abstract Algebra| publisher=Springer | year=2004 | isbn=81-8128-149-7}}, Chapter 7,section 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of [[data abstraction]], important in [[object-oriented programming language|object-oriented programming]] and [[design by contract]] methodologies for [[software engineering|software development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/object-oriented-programming/|title=What Is Object-Oriented Programming?|date=2015-05-05|newspaper=Hiring {{!}} Upwork|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining an abstract data type==
An abstract data type is defined as a mathematical model of the data objects that make up a data type as well as the functions that operate on these objects.
There are no standard conventions for defining them. A broad division may be drawn between "imperative" and "functional" definition styles.

===Imperative-style definition===
In the philosophy of [[imperative programming]] languages, an abstract data structure is conceived as an entity that is ''mutable''—meaning that it may be in different ''states'' at different times. Some operations may change the state of the ADT; therefore, the order in which operations are evaluated is important, and the same operation on the same entities may have different effects if executed at different times—just like the instructions of a computer, or the commands and procedures of an imperative language. To underscore this view, it is customary to say that the operations are ''executed'' or ''applied'', rather than ''evaluated''. The imperative style is often used when describing abstract algorithms. (See [[The Art of Computer Programming]] by [[Donald Knuth]] for more details)

====Abstract variable====
Imperative-style definitions of ADT often depend on the concept of an ''abstract variable'', which may be regarded as the simplest non-trivial ADT. An abstract variable ''V'' is a mutable entity that admits two operations:
* &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') where ''x'' is a ''value'' of unspecified nature;
* &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V''), that yields a value,
with the constraint that
* &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') always returns the value ''x'' used in the most recent &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') operation on the same variable ''V''.

As in so many programming languages, the operation &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''x'') is often written ''V'' ← ''x'' (or some similar notation), and &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') is implied whenever a variable ''V'' is used in a context where a value is required. Thus, for example, ''V'' ← ''V'' + 1 is commonly understood to be a shorthand for &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'',&lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') + 1).

In this definition, it is implicitly assumed that storing a value into a variable ''U'' has no effect on the state of a distinct variable ''V''. To make this assumption explicit, one could add the constraint that
* if ''U'' and ''V'' are distinct variables, the sequence { &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''U'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'', ''y''); &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt;(''U'', ''x'') }.

More generally, ADT definitions often assume that any operation that changes the state of one ADT instance has no effect on the state of any other instance (including other instances of the same ADT) — unless the ADT axioms imply that the two instances are connected ([[Aliasing (computing)|aliased]]) in that sense. For example, when extending the definition of abstract variable to include abstract [[record (computer science)|records]], the operation that selects a field from a record variable ''R'' must yield a variable ''V'' that is aliased to that part of ''R''.

The definition of an abstract variable ''V'' may also restrict the stored values ''x'' to members of a specific set ''X'', called the ''range'' or ''type'' of ''V''. As in programming languages, such restrictions may simplify the description and [[analysis of algorithms]], and improve their readability.

Note that this definition does not imply anything about the result of evaluating &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt;(''V'') when ''V'' is ''un-initialized'', that is, before performing any &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt; operation on ''V''. An algorithm that does so is usually considered invalid, because its effect is not defined. (However, there are some important algorithms whose efficiency strongly depends on the assumption that such a &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt; is legal, and returns some arbitrary value in the variable's range.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}})

====Instance creation====
Some algorithms need to create new instances of some ADT (such as new variables, or new stacks). To describe such algorithms, one usually includes in the ADT definition a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that yields an instance of the ADT, usually with axioms equivalent to
* the result of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() is distinct from any instance in use by the algorithm.
This axiom may be strengthened to exclude also partial aliasing with other instances. On the other hand, this axiom still allows implementations of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() to yield a previously created instance that has become inaccessible to the program.

====Example: abstract stack (imperative)====
As another example, an imperative-style definition of an abstract stack could specify that the state of a stack ''S'' can be modified only by the operations
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''), where ''x'' is some ''value'' of unspecified nature;
* &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''), that yields a value as a result,
with the constraint that
* For any value ''x'' and any abstract variable ''V'', the sequence of operations { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') } is equivalent to ''V'' ← ''x''.

Since the assignment ''V'' ← ''x'', by definition, cannot change the state of ''S'', this condition implies that ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') restores ''S'' to the state it had before the &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''). From this condition and from the properties of abstract variables, it follows, for example, that the sequence
: { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''y''); ''U'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''z''); ''V'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S''); ''W'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') }
where ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are any values, and ''U'', ''V'', ''W'' are pairwise distinct variables, is equivalent to
: { ''U'' ← ''y''; ''V'' ← ''z''; ''W'' ← ''x'' }

Here it is implicitly assumed that operations on a stack instance do not modify the state of any other ADT instance, including other stacks; that is,
* For any values ''x'', ''y'', and any distinct stacks ''S'' and ''T'', the sequence { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''T'', ''y'') } is equivalent to { &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''T'', ''y''); &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x'') }.

An abstract stack definition usually includes also a [[Boolean value|Boolean]]-valued function &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'') and a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that returns a stack instance, with axioms equivalent to
* &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;() ≠ ''S'' for any stack ''S'' (a newly created stack is distinct from all previous stacks);
* &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(&lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;()) (a newly created stack is empty);
* &lt;kbd&gt;not&lt;/kbd&gt; &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt;(&lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''x'')) (pushing something into a stack makes it non-empty).

====Single-instance style====
Sometimes an ADT is defined as if only one instance of it existed during the execution of the algorithm, and all operations were applied to that instance, which is not explicitly notated. For example, the abstract stack above could have been defined with operations &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''x'') and &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(), that operate on ''the'' only existing stack. ADT definitions in this style can be easily rewritten to admit multiple coexisting instances of the ADT, by adding an explicit instance parameter (like ''S'' in the previous example) to every operation that uses or modifies the implicit instance.

On the other hand, some ADTs cannot be meaningfully defined without assuming multiple instances. This is the case when a single operation takes two distinct instances of the ADT as parameters. For an example, consider augmenting the definition of the abstract stack with an operation &lt;kbd&gt;compare&lt;/kbd&gt;(''S'', ''T'') that checks whether the stacks ''S'' and ''T'' contain the same items in the same order.

===Functional-style definition===
Another way to define an ADT, closer to the spirit of [[functional programming]], is to consider each state of the structure as a separate entity. In this view, any operation that modifies the ADT is modeled as a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]] that takes the old state as an argument, and returns the new state as part of the result. Unlike the imperative operations, these functions have no [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. Therefore, the order in which they are evaluated is immaterial, and the same operation applied to the same arguments (including the same input states) will always return the same results (and output states).

In the functional view, in particular, there is no way (or need) to define an "abstract variable" with the semantics of imperative variables (namely, with &lt;kbd&gt;fetch&lt;/kbd&gt; and &lt;kbd&gt;store&lt;/kbd&gt; operations). Instead of storing values into variables, one passes them as arguments to functions.

====Example: abstract stack (functional)====
For example, a complete functional-style definition of an abstract stack could use the three operations:
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state and an arbitrary value, returns a stack state;
* &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a value;
* &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;: takes a stack state, returns a stack state.

In a functional-style definition there is no need for a &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt; operation. Indeed, there is no notion of "stack instance". The stack states can be thought of as being potential states of a single stack structure, and two stack states that contain the same values in the same order are considered to be identical states. This view actually mirrors the behavior of some concrete implementations, such as [[linked list]]s with [[hash cons]].

Instead of &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), a functional-style definition of an abstract stack may assume the existence of a special stack state, the ''empty stack'', designated by a special symbol like Λ or "()"; or define a &lt;kbd&gt;bottom&lt;/kbd&gt;() operation that takes no arguments and returns this special stack state. Note that the axioms imply that
* &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(Λ, ''x'') ≠ Λ.
In a functional-style definition of a stack one does not need an &lt;kbd&gt;empty&lt;/kbd&gt; predicate: instead, one can test whether a stack is empty by testing whether it is equal to Λ.

Note that these axioms do not define the effect of &lt;kbd&gt;top&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), unless ''s'' is a stack state returned by a &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;. Since &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt; leaves the stack non-empty, those two operations are undefined (hence invalid) when ''s'' = Λ. On the other hand, the axioms (and the lack of side effects) imply that &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''x'') = &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''t'', ''y'') [[if and only if]] ''x'' = ''y'' and ''s'' = ''t''.

As in some other branches of mathematics, it is customary to assume also that the stack states are only those whose existence can be proved from the axioms in a finite number of steps. In the abstract stack example above, this rule means that every stack is a ''finite'' sequence of values, that becomes the empty stack (Λ) after a finite number of &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;s. By themselves, the axioms above do not exclude the existence of infinite stacks (that can be &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;ed forever, each time yielding a different state) or circular stacks (that return to the same state after a finite number of &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;s). In particular, they do not exclude states ''s'' such that &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') = ''s'' or &lt;kbd&gt;push&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''x'') = ''s'' for some ''x''. However, since one cannot obtain such stack states with the given operations, they are assumed "not to exist".

===Whether to include complexity===
Aside from the behavior in terms of axioms, it is also possible to include, in the definition of an ADT operation, their [[Analysis of algorithms|algorithmic complexity]]. [[Alexander Stepanov]], designer of the C++ [[Standard Template Library]], included complexity guarantees in the STL specification, arguing:

{{quote|The reason for introducing the notion of abstract data types was to allow interchangeable software modules. You cannot have interchangeable modules unless these modules share similar complexity behavior. If I replace one module with another module with the same functional behavior but with different complexity tradeoffs, the user of this code will be unpleasantly surprised. I could tell him anything I like about data abstraction, and he still would not want to use the code. Complexity assertions have to be part of the interface.|Alexander Stepanov&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Al |last=Stevens |title=Al Stevens Interviews Alex Stepanov |date=March 1995 |journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]] |url=http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/drdobbs-interview.html |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Advantages of abstract data typing==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2011}}

===Encapsulation===
[[Abstraction (computer science)|Abstraction]] provides a promise that any implementation of the ADT has certain properties and abilities; knowing these is all that is required to make use of an ADT object. The user does not need any technical knowledge of how the implementation works to use the ADT. In this way, the implementation may be complex but will be encapsulated in a simple interface when it is actually used.

===Localization of change===
Code that uses an ADT object will not need to be edited if the implementation of the ADT is changed. Since any changes to the implementation must still comply with the interface, and since code using an ADT object may only refer to properties and abilities specified in the interface, changes may be made to the implementation without requiring any changes in code where the ADT is used.

===Flexibility===
Different implementations of the ADT, having all the same properties and abilities, are equivalent and may be used somewhat interchangeably in code that uses the ADT. This gives a great deal of flexibility when using ADT objects in different situations. For example, different implementations of the ADT may be more efficient in different situations; it is possible to use each in the situation where they are preferable, thus increasing overall efficiency.

==Typical operations==
Some operations that are often specified for ADTs (possibly under other names) are
* &lt;kbd&gt;compare&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), that tests whether two instances' states are equivalent in some sense;
* &lt;kbd&gt;hash&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that computes some standard [[hash function]] from the instance's state;
* &lt;kbd&gt;print&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;show&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that produces a human-readable representation of the instance's state.

In imperative-style ADT definitions, one often finds also
* &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), that yields a new instance of the ADT;
* &lt;kbd&gt;initialize&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that prepares a newly created instance ''s'' for further operations, or resets it to some "initial state";
* &lt;kbd&gt;copy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), that puts instance ''s'' in a state equivalent to that of ''t'';
* &lt;kbd&gt;clone&lt;/kbd&gt;(''t''), that performs ''s'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;create&lt;/kbd&gt;(), &lt;kbd&gt;copy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'', ''t''), and returns ''s'';
* &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'') or &lt;kbd&gt;destroy&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s''), that reclaims the memory and other resources used by ''s''.

The &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt; operation is not normally relevant or meaningful, since ADTs are theoretical entities that do not "use memory". However, it may be necessary when one needs to analyze the storage used by an algorithm that uses the ADT. In that case one needs additional axioms that specify how much memory each ADT instance uses, as a function of its state, and how much of it is returned to the pool by &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt;.

==Examples==
Some common ADTs, which have proved useful in a great variety of applications, are
{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
* [[Container (abstract data type)|Container]]
* [[List (abstract data type)|List]]
* [[Set (abstract data type)|Set]]
* [[Set (abstract data type)#Multiset|Multiset]]
* [[Associative array|Map]]
* [[Multimap]]
* [[Graph (abstract data type)|Graph]]
* [[Tree (data structure)|Tree]]
* [[Stack (abstract data type)|Stack]]
* [[Queue (abstract data type)|Queue]]
* [[Priority queue]]
* [[Double-ended queue]]
* [[Double-ended priority queue]]
{{div col end}}

Each of these ADTs may be defined in many ways and variants, not necessarily equivalent. For example, an abstract stack may or may not have a &lt;kbd&gt;count&lt;/kbd&gt; operation that tells how many items have been pushed and not yet popped. This choice makes a difference not only for its clients but also for the implementation.

; Abstract graphical data type
An extension of ADT for computer graphics was proposed in 1979:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | author= D. Thalmann, N. Magnenat Thalmann |title= Design and Implementation of Abstract Graphical Data Types |date=1979 |conference=IEEE|url= http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=762551&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F6188%2F16515%2F00762551.pdf%3Farnumber%3D762551}}, Proc. 3rd International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'79), IEEE, Chicago, USA, pp.519-524&lt;/ref&gt; an [[abstract graphical data type]] (AGDT). It was introduced by [[Nadia Magnenat Thalmann]], and [[Daniel Thalmann]]. AGDTs provide the advantages of ADTs with facilities to build graphical objects in a structured way.

==Implementation==
{{further|Opaque data type}}
Implementing an ADT means providing one [[subroutine|procedure or function]] for each abstract operation. The ADT instances are represented by some concrete [[data structure]] that is manipulated by those procedures, according to the ADT's specifications.

Usually there are many ways to implement the same ADT, using several different concrete data structures. Thus, for example, an abstract stack can be implemented by a [[linked list]] or by an [[Array data structure|array]].

In order to prevent clients from depending on the implementation, an ADT is often packaged as an ''[[opaque data type]]'' in one or more [[module (programming)|modules]], whose interface contains only the signature (number and types of the parameters and results) of the operations. The implementation of the module—namely, the bodies of the procedures and the concrete data structure used—can then be hidden from most clients of the module. This makes it possible to change the implementation without affecting the clients. If the implementation is exposed, it is known instead as a ''transparent data type.''

When implementing an ADT, each instance (in imperative-style definitions) or each state (in functional-style definitions) is usually represented by a [[handle (computing)|handle]] of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Sedgewick | title=Algorithms in C | publisher=Addison/Wesley | year=1998 | isbn=0-201-31452-5}}, definition 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern object-oriented languages, such as [[C++]] and [[Java programming language|Java]], support a form of abstract data types. When a class is used as a type, it is an abstract type that refers to a hidden representation. In this model an ADT is typically implemented as a [[class (computer science)|class]], and each instance of the ADT is usually an [[object (computer science)|object]] of that class. The module's interface typically declares the constructors as ordinary procedures, and most of the other ADT operations as [[method (computer programming)|methods]] of that class. However, such an approach does not easily encapsulate multiple representational variants found in an ADT. It also can undermine the extensibility of object-oriented programs.
In a pure object-oriented program that uses interfaces as types, types refer to behaviors not representations.

===Example: implementation of the abstract stack===
&lt;!-- This section should be moved to [[stack data structure]] or a new [[abstract stack]] article. --&gt;
As an example, here is an implementation of the abstract stack above in the [[C programming language]].
&lt;!-- Replace &lt;pre&gt; by &lt;source "lang=c"&gt; after the color scheme has been fixed. The light green paentheses on gray background, in particular, are unreadable (and silly, IMHO). Text must always have substantial *brightness* (CIE Y) contrast. This complaint should be moved to the technical village pump or some such. --&gt;

====Imperative-style interface====
An imperative-style interface might be:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;       // type: stack instance representation (opaque record)
typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;               // type: handle to a stack instance (opaque pointer)
typedef void* stack_Item;                 // type: value stored in stack instance (arbitrary address)

stack_T stack_create(void);               // creates a new empty stack instance
void stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack
stack_Item stack_pop(stack_T s);          // removes the top item from the stack and returns it
bool stack_empty(stack_T s);              // checks whether stack is empty
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface could be used in the following manner:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;stack.h&gt;          // includes the stack interface

stack_T s = stack_create(); // creates a new empty stack instance
int x = 17;
stack_push(s, &amp;x);          // adds the address of x at the top of the stack
void* y = stack_pop(s);     // removes the address of x from the stack and returns it
if(stack_empty(s)) { }      // does something if stack is empty
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface can be implemented in many ways. The implementation may be arbitrarily inefficient, since the formal definition of the ADT, above, does not specify how much space the stack may use, nor how long each operation should take. It also does not specify whether the stack state ''s'' continues to exist after a call ''x'' ← &lt;kbd&gt;pop&lt;/kbd&gt;(''s'').

In practice the formal definition should specify that the space is proportional to the number of items pushed and not yet popped; and that every one of the operations above must finish in a constant amount of time, independently of that number. To comply with these additional specifications, the implementation could use a linked list, or an array (with dynamic resizing) together with two integers (an item count and the array size).

====Functional-style interface====
Functional-style ADT definitions are more appropriate for functional programming languages, and vice versa. However, one can provide a functional-style interface even in an imperative language like C. For example:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
typedef struct stack_Rep stack_Rep;          // type: stack state representation (opaque record)
typedef stack_Rep* stack_T;                  // type: handle to a stack state (opaque pointer)
typedef void* stack_Item;                    // type: value of a stack state (arbitrary address)

stack_T stack_empty(void);                   // returns the empty stack state
stack_T stack_push(stack_T s, stack_Item x); // adds an item at the top of the stack state and returns the resulting stack state
stack_T stack_pop(stack_T s);                // removes the top item from the stack state and returns the resulting stack state
stack_Item stack_top(stack_T s);             // returns the top item of the stack state
&lt;/source&gt;

===ADT libraries===
Many modern programming languages, such as C++ and Java, come with standard libraries that implement several common ADTs, such as those listed above.

===Built-in abstract data types===
The specification of some programming languages is intentionally vague about the representation of certain built-in data types, defining only the operations that can be done on them. Therefore, those types can be viewed as "built-in ADTs". Examples are the arrays in many scripting languages, such as [[Awk]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], and [[Perl]], which can be regarded as an implementation of the abstract list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4259">In [[mathematics]], '''biquandles''' and '''biracks''' are generalizations of [[racks and quandles|quandles and racks]]. Whereas the hinterland of quandles and racks is the theory of classical [[knot]]s, that of the bi-versions, is the theory of [[virtual knot]]s.

Biquandles and biracks have two binary operations on a set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; written &lt;math&gt; a^b &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_b &lt;/math&gt;. These satisfy the following three axioms:

1.  &lt;math&gt; a^{b c_b}= {a^c}^{b^c} &lt;/math&gt;

2.  &lt;math&gt; {a_b}_{c_b}= {a_c}_{b^c} &lt;/math&gt;

3.  &lt;math&gt; {a_b}^{c_b}= {a^c}_{b^c} &lt;/math&gt;

These identities appeared in 1992 in reference [FRS] where the object was called a species.

The superscript and subscript notation is useful here because it dispenses with the need for brackets. For example
if we write &lt;math&gt; a*b &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; a_b &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a**b &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; a^b &lt;/math&gt; then the
three axioms above become

1. &lt;math&gt; (a**b)**(c*b)=(a**c)**(b**c) &lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt; (a*b)*(c*b)=(a*c)*(b**c) &lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt; (a*b)**(c*b)=(a**c)*(b**c) &lt;/math&gt;

For other notations see [[racks and quandles]].

If in addition the two operations are [[invertible]], that is given &lt;math&gt; a, b  &lt;/math&gt; in the set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; there are unique &lt;math&gt; x, y  &lt;/math&gt; in the set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x^b=a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y_b=a &lt;/math&gt; then the set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; together with the two operations define a [[birack]].

For example if &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, with the operation &lt;math&gt; a^b &lt;/math&gt;, is a [[quandle|rack]] then it is a birack if we define the other operation to be the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]],  &lt;math&gt; a_b=a &lt;/math&gt;.

For a birack the function &lt;math&gt; S:X^2 \rightarrow X^2 &lt;/math&gt; can be defined by

: &lt;math&gt; S(a,b_a)=(b,a^b).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then

1. &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]]

2. &lt;math&gt; S_1S_2S_1=S_2S_1S_2 \, &lt;/math&gt;

In the second condition,  &lt;math&gt; S_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_2 &lt;/math&gt; are defined by &lt;math&gt; S_1(a,b,c)=(S(a,b),c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_2(a,b,c)=(a,S(b,c))&lt;/math&gt;. This condition is sometimes known as the [[set-theoretic]] [[Yang-Baxter]] equation.

To see that 1. is true note that &lt;math&gt; S' &lt;/math&gt; defined by

: &lt;math&gt; S'(b,a^b)=(a,b_a)\, &lt;/math&gt;

is the inverse to 

:&lt;math&gt; S \,&lt;/math&gt;

To see that 2. is true let us follow the progress of the triple &lt;math&gt; (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) &lt;/math&gt; under &lt;math&gt; S_1S_2S_1 &lt;/math&gt;. So 

: &lt;math&gt; (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) \to (b,c^b,a_{bc^b}) \to (b,a_b,c^{ba_b}) \to (a, b^a, c^{ba_b}). &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, &lt;math&gt; (c,b_c,a_{bc^b}) = (c, b_c, a_{cb_c}) &lt;/math&gt;. Its progress under &lt;math&gt; S_2S_1S_2 &lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; (c, b_c, a_{cb_c}) \to (c, a_c, {b_c}^{a_c}) \to (a, c^a, {b_c}^{a_c}) = (a, c^a, {b^a}_{c^a}) \to (a, b_a, c_{ab_a}) = (a, b^a, c^{ba_b}). &lt;/math&gt;

Any &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; satisfying 1. 2. is said to be a ''switch'' (precursor of biquandles and biracks).

Examples of switches are the [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]], the ''twist'' &lt;math&gt; T(a,b)=(b,a) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S(a,b)=(b,a^b) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; a^b &lt;/math&gt; is the operation of a [[quandle|rack]].

A switch will define a birack if the operations are invertible. Note that the identity switch does not do this.

==Biquandles==
A biquandle is a birack which satisfies some additional structure, as [https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1951v1 described] by Nelson and Rische. The axioms of a biquandle are "minimal" in the sense that they are the weakest restrictions that can be placed on the two binary operations while making the biquandle of a virtual knot invariant under Reidemeister moves.

The '''Clean Development Mechanism''' ('''CDM''') is one of the [[Flexible Mechanisms]] defined in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (IPCC, 2007) that provides for emissions reduction projects which generate [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units (CERs) which may be traded in [[emissions trading]] schemes.&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web

The CDM, defined in Article 12 of the Protocol, was intended to meet two objectives: 
*(1) to assist parties not included in [[Annex I]] in achieving [[sustainable development]] and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), which is to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous climate change]]; and 
*(2) to assist parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments ([[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emission caps).&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Chance LLP (2013). "Clean Development Mechanism: CDM and the UNFCC" http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/CDM%26UNFCCCcorrected.pdf . Advocates for International Development. Retrieved 19 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Annex I" parties are the countries listed in Annex I of the treaty, the industrialized countries. Non-Annex I parties are [[developing countries]].

The CDM addresses the second objective by allowing the Annex I countries to meet part of their emission reduction commitments under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] by buying [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units from CDM emission reduction projects in developing countries (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Both the projects and the issue of CERs units are subject to approval to ensure that these emission reductions are real and "additional." The CDM is supervised by the CDM Executive Board (CDM EB) under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP/MOP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The CDM allows industrialized countries to buy CERs and to invest in emission reductions where it is cheapest globally (Grubb, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;159).&lt;ref name=grubb/&gt; Between 2001, which was the first year CDM projects could be registered and 7 September 2012, the CDM issued 1 billion [[Certified Emission Reduction]] units.&lt;ref name="giga"&gt;{{cite press release

However, a number of weaknesses of the CDM have been identified (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265-267){{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Several of these issues were addressed by the new [[Program of Activities (PoA)]], which moves to approving 'bundles' of projects instead of accrediting each project individually. In 2012, the report ''Climate Change, Carbon Markets and the CDM: A Call to Action'' said governments urgently needed to address the future of the CDM. It suggested the CDM was in danger of collapse because of the low price of carbon and the failure of governments to guarantee its existence into the future. Writing on the website of the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], Yolanda Kakabadse, a member of the investigating panel for the report and founder of Fundación Futuro Latinamericano, said a strong CDM is needed to support the political consensus essential for future climate progress. "Therefore we must do everything in our hands to keep it working," she said.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

The clean development mechanism is one of the "flexibility mechanisms" defined in the Kyoto Protocol. The flexibility mechanisms were designed to allow Annex B countries to meet their emission reduction commitments with reduced impact on their economies (IPCC, 2007).&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; The flexibility mechanisms were introduced into the Kyoto Protocol by the US government. [[Developing countries]] were highly skeptical and fiercely opposed to the flexibility mechanisms (''Carbon Trust'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6).&lt;ref name=carbont&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; However, the international negotiations over the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol agreed that the mechanisms will continue.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the CDM is to promote clean development in developing countries, i.e., the "non-Annex I" countries (countries that aren't listed in Annex I of the Framework Convention). The CDM is one of the Protocol's "project-based" mechanisms, in that the CDM is designed to promote projects that reduce emissions. The CDM is based on the idea of emission reduction "production" (Toth ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;660).&lt;ref&gt;

The baseline emissions are the emissions that are predicted to occur in the absence of a particular CDM project. CDM projects are "credited" against this baseline, in the sense that developing countries gain credit for producing these emission cuts.

The economic basis for including developing countries in efforts to reduce emissions is that emission cuts are thought to be less expensive in developing countries than developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;30;&lt;ref name=goldemberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in developing countries, environmental regulation is generally weaker than it is in developed countries (Sathaye ''et al''., 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;387-389).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Emissions from developing countries are projected to increase substantially over this century (Goldemberg ''et al''., 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;29).&lt;ref name=goldemberg/&gt; Infrastructure decisions made in developing countries could therefore have a very large influence on future efforts to limit total global emissions (Fisher ''et al''., 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-03-18|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDM is designed to start developing countries off on a path towards less pollution, with industrialised (Annex B) countries paying for the reductions.

There were two main concerns about the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15). One was over the [[additionality]] of emission reductions produced by the CDM (see the section on ''additionality''). The other was whether it would allow rich, northern countries, and in particular, companies, to impose projects that were contrary to the development interests of host countries. To alleviate this concern, the CDM requires host countries to confirm that CDM projects contribute to their own sustainable development. International rules also prohibit credits for some kinds of activities, notably [[nuclear power]] and avoided [[deforestation]].

To prevent industrialised countries from making unlimited use of CDM, the framework has a provision that use of CDM be ‘supplemental’ to domestic actions to reduce emissions. This wording has led to a wide range of interpretations - the Netherlands for example aims to achieve half of its required emission reductions (from a BAU baseline) by CDM.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} It treats Dutch companies' purchases of [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] allowances from companies in other countries as part of its domestic actions.

The CDM gained momentum in 2005 after the Kyoto Protocol took effect. Before the Protocol entered into force, investors considered this{{clarify|date=July 2016}} a key risk factor. The initial years of operation yielded fewer CDM credits than supporters had hoped for, as parties did not provide sufficient funding to the EB, which left it understaffed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Adaptation Fund was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Fund is to be financed with a share of proceeds from clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities and receive funds from other sources.

==CDM project process==

===Outline===
An industrialised country that wishes to get credits from a CDM project must obtain the consent of the developing country hosting the project and their agreement that the project will contribute to sustainable development. Then, using methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board (EB), the applicant industrialised country must make the case that the [[carbon project]] would not have happened anyway (establishing [[additionality]]), and must establish a baseline estimating the future emissions in absence of the registered project. The case is then validated by a third party agency, called a Designated Operational Entity (DOE), to ensure the project results in real, measurable, and long-term emission reductions. The EB then decides whether or not to register (approve) the project. If a project is registered and implemented, the EB issues credits, called [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs, commonly known as [[carbon credit]]s, where each unit is equivalent to the reduction of one metric tonne of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e, e.g. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or its equivalent), to project participants based on the monitored difference between the baseline and the actual emissions, verified by the DOE.

===Additionality===

To avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway ("freeriders"), specified rules ensure the [[additionality]] of the proposed project, that is, ensure the project reduces emissions more than would have occurred in the absence of the intervention created by the CDM.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"&gt;

 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At present, the CDM Executive Board deems a project additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that CDM helps it overcome. Current Guidance from the EB is available at the UNFCCC website.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=UNFCCC Tools
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baseline===

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

The determination of [[additionality]] and the calculation of emission reductions depends on the emissions that would have occurred without the project minus the emissions of the project. Accordingly, the CDM process requires an established baseline or comparative emission estimate. The construction of a project baseline often depends on hypothetical scenario modeling, and may be estimated through reference to emissions from similar activities and technologies in the same country or other countries, or to actual emissions prior to project implementation. The partners involved in the project could have an interest in establishing a baseline with high emissions, which would yield a risk of awarding spurious credits. Independent third party verification is meant to avoid this potential problem.

===Methodologies===

Any proposed CDM project has to use an approved baseline and monitoring methodology to be validated, approved and registered. Baseline Methodology will set steps to determine the baseline within certain applicability conditions whilst monitoring methodology will set specific steps to determine monitoring parameters, quality assurance, equipment to be used, in order to obtain data to calculate the emission reductions. Those approved methodologies are all coded:&lt;ref name=UNFCCCMETHBOOK&gt;http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/documentation/meth_booklet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AM''' - Approved Methodology

'''ACM''' - Approved Consolidated Methodology

'''AMS''' - Approved Methodology for Small Scale Projects

'''ARAM''' - Aforestation and Reforestation Approved Methodologies

All baseline methodologies approved by Executive Board are publicly available along with relevant guidance on the UNFCCC CDM website.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/cdm&lt;/ref&gt; If a DOE determines that a proposed project activity intends to use a new baseline methodology, it shall, prior to the submission for registration of this project activity, forward the proposed methodology to the EB for review, i.e. consideration and approval, if appropriate.&lt;ref name="CDMCharts0511"&gt;Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (May, 2011) CDM in Charts Version 13.1, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==

According to Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37, crediting mechanisms like the CDM could play three important roles in [[climate change mitigation]] :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Improve the cost-effectiveness of GHG mitigation policies in developed countries
*Help to reduce "leakage" ([[carbon leakage]]) of emissions from developed to developing countries. Leakage is where mitigation actions in one country or economic sector result in another country's or sector's emissions increasing, e.g., through relocation of polluting industries from Annex I to non-Annex I countries (Barker ''et al.'', 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*Boost transfers of clean, less polluting technologies to developing countries.

According to Burniaux ''et al''. (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;37), the cost-saving potential of a well-functioning crediting mechanism appears to be very large. Compared to baseline costs (i.e., costs where emission reductions only take place in Annex I countries), if the cap on offset use was set at 20%, one estimate suggests mitigation costs could be halved. This cost saving, however, should be viewed as an upper bound: it assumes no transaction costs and no uncertainty on the delivery of emission savings. Annex I countries who stand to gain most from crediting include Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In this economic model, non-Annex I countries enjoy a slight income gain from exploiting low cost emission reductions.
Actual transaction cost in the CDM are rather high, which is problematic for smaller projects.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, 2010, States and Trend of the Carbon Market http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTCARBONFINANCE/Resources/State_and_Trends_of_the_Carbon_Market_2010_low_res.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is addressed by the [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] modality.

===Difficulties with the CDM===

'''Carbon leakage'''

In theory, leakage may be reduced by crediting mechanisms (Burniaux ''et al.'', 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;38). In practice, the amount of leakage partly depends on the definition of the baseline against which credits are granted. The current CDM approach already incorporates some leakage. Thus, reductions in leakage due to the CDM may, in fact, be small or even non-existent.

'''Additionality, transaction costs and bottlenecks'''

In order to maintain the environmental effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol, emission savings from the CDM must be additional (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;265).&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite web
|year=2010
|author=World Bank
|title=World Development Report 2010: Development and Climate Change
|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433
|url=http://go.worldbank.org/BKLQ9DSDU0
|accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without additionality, the CDM amounts to an income [[transfer payment|transfer]] to non-Annex I countries (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;40). Additionality is, however, difficult to prove, the subject of vigorous debate.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;

Burniaux ''et al''. (2009) commented on the large [[transaction cost]]s of establishing additionality. Assessing additionality has created delays (bottlenecks) in approving CDM projects. According to the [[World Bank]] (2010), there are significant constraints to the continued growth of the CDM to support mitigation in developing countries.

'''Incentives'''

The CDM rewards emissions reductions, but does not penalize emission increases (Burniaux ''et al''., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;41). It therefore comes close to being an emissions reduction [[subsidy]]. This can create a [[perverse incentive]] for firms to raise their emissions in the short-term, with the aim of getting credits for reducing emissions in the long-term.

Another difficulty is that the CDM might reduce the incentive for non-Annex I countries to cap their emissions. This is because most developing countries benefit more from a well-functioning crediting mechanism than from a world [[carbon emission trading|emissions trading]] scheme (ETS), where their emissions are capped. This is true except in cases where the allocation of emissions rights (i.e., the amount of emissions that each country is allowed to emit) in the ETS is particularly favourable to developing countries.

'''Local resistance'''

While the C in CDM stands for Clean, most projects might be better defined with the B from Big, from large hydropower to HFC or waste to energy and clean coal projects (which all together make the majority of credits generated through CDM). The argument in favor of the CDM is that it brings development to the South. However, in all continents the mainly Big Development it stands for is resisted by local people in those countries. A global coalition of researchers published a large report on African civil society resistance to CDM projects all over the continent.&lt;ref&gt;18th of April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In New Delhi, India, a grassroots movement of wastepickers is resisting another CDM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2012/02/watch-a-gaia-ejolt-video-on-waste-wars-in-delhi/|title=Watch a GAIA-EJOLT video on Waste Wars in Delhi - Environmental Justice Organisations, Liabilities and Trade|author=|date=|website=www.ejolt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; on what the makers call 'the waste war' in Delhi. In Panama, a CDM project is blocking peace talks between the Panamanian government and the indigenous [[Ngöbe-Buglé people]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society groups and researchers in both North and South have complained for years that most CDM projects benefit big industries, while doing harm to excluded people. As local protests against CDM projects are arising on every continent, the notion that CDM 'brings development to the South' is contested.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

'''Market deflation'''

Most of the [[demand]] for CERs from the CDM comes from the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]], which is the largest carbon market. In July 2012, the [[market price]] for CERs fell to new record low of €2.67 a tonne, a drop in price of about 70% in a year. Analysts attributed the low CER price to lower prices for European Union emissions allowances, oversupply of EU emissions allowances and the slowing European economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, ''The Economist'' described the CDM as a "complete disaster in the making" and "in need of a radical overhaul". Carbon prices, including prices for CERs, had collapsed from $20 a tonne in August 2008 to below $5 in response to the [[European debt crisis|Eurozone debt crisis]] reducing industrial activity and the over-allocation of emission allowances under the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With such low CER prices, potential projects were not commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Financial issues==
With costs of emission reduction typically much lower in developing countries than in industrialised countries, industrialised countries can comply with their emission reduction targets at much lower cost by receiving credits for emissions reduced in developing countries as long as administration costs are low.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has projected GDP losses for [[OECD]] Europe with full use of CDM and [[Joint Implementation]] to between 0.13% and 0.81% of GDP versus 0.31% to 1.50%&lt;ref&gt;Climate Change 2001 - Synthesis report. Figure SPM-8, IPCC, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; with only domestic action.

While there would always be some cheap domestic emission reductions available in Europe, the cost of switching from coal to gas could be in the order of €40-50 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s from CDM projects were in 2006 traded on a forward basis for between €5 and €20 per tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent. The price depends on the distribution of risk between seller and buyer. The seller could get a very good price if it agrees to bear the risk that the project's baseline and monitoring methodology is rejected; that the host country rejects the project; that the CDM Executive Board rejects the project; that the project for some reason produces fewer credits than planned; or that the buyer doesn't get CERs at the agreed time if the international transaction log (the technical infrastructure ensuring international transfer of carbon credits) is not in place by then. The seller can usually only take these risks if the [[counterparty]] is deemed very reliable, as rated by international rating agencies.

===Mitigation finance===

The revenues of the CDM constitutes the largest source of mitigation finance to developing countries to date (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;261-262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; Over the 2001 to 2012 period, CDM projects could raise $18&amp;nbsp;billion ($15&amp;nbsp;billion to $24&amp;nbsp;billion) in direct carbon revenues for developing countries. Actual revenues will depend on the price of carbon. It is estimated that some $95&amp;nbsp;billion in clean energy investment benefitted from the CDM over the 2002-08 period.

===Adaptation finance===

The CDM is the main source of income for the [[UNFCCC]] Adaptation Fund, which was established in 2007 to finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262-263).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; The CDM is subject to a 2% levy, which could raise between $300&amp;nbsp;million and $600&amp;nbsp;million over the 2008-12 period. The actual amount raised will depend on the carbon price.

The EU ETS allowed firms to comply with their commitments by buying offset credits, and thus created a perceived value to projects. The Kyoto Protocol set the CDM on a firm legal footing.

By the end of 2008, over 4,000 CDM projects had been submitted for validation, and of those, over 1,000 were registered by the CDM Executive Board, and were therefore entitled to be issued CERs (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;19). In 2010, the World Bank estimated that in 2012, the largest potential for production of CERs would be from China (52% of total CERs) and India (16%) (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;262).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; CERs produced in Latin America and the Caribbean would make up 15% of the potential total, with Brazil as the largest producer in the region (7%).

By 14 September 2012, 4626 projects had been registered by the CDM Executive Board as CDM projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Destruction of HFC-23 ===

Some CDM projects remove or destroy industrial gases, such as [[Fluoroform|hydrofluorocarbon-23]] (HFC-23) and nitrous oxide (N2O). HFC-23 is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and is a byproduct from the production of the refrigerant gas [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (HCFC-22).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The gas HFC-23 is estimated to have a global warming effect 11,000 times greater than carbon dioxide, so destroying a tonne of HFC-23 earns the refrigerant manufacturer 11,000 certified emissions reduction units.&lt;ref name="chill1"&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, the Carbon Trust estimated that industrial gas projects such as those limiting HFC-23 emissions, would contribute about 20% of the CERs issued by the CDM in 2012. The Carbon Trust expressed the concern that projects for destroying HFC-23 were so profitable that coolant manufacturers could be building new factories to produce the coolant gas. (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; In September 2010, [[Sandbag]] estimated that in 2009 59% of the CERs used as offsets in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] originated from HFC-23 projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An example is the Plascon, Plasma arc plant that was installed by Quimobásicos S.A. de C.V in Monterrey, Mexico to eliminate of HCFC-23, a byproduct of the production of R-22 refrigerant gas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=this needs a citation}}

From 2005 to June 2012, 19 manufacturers of refrigerants (11 in China, 5 in India, and one each in Argentina, Mexico and South Korea),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

David Hanrahan, the technical director of IDEAcarbon believes each plant would probably have earned an average of $20 million to $40 million a year from the CDM. The payments also incentivise the increased production of the ozone-depleting refrigerant HCFC-22, and discourage substitution of HCFC-22 with less harmful refrigerants.&lt;ref name="chill1" /&gt;

In 2007 the CDM stopped accepting new refrigerant manufacturers into the CDM. In 2011, the CDM renewed contracts with the nineteen manufacturers on the condition that claims for HFC-23 destruction would be limited to 1 percent of their coolant production. However, in 2012, 18 percent of all CERs issued are expected to go to the 19 coolant plants, compared with 12 percent to 2,372 wind power plants and 0.2 percent to 312 solar projects.&lt;ref name="chill1"/&gt;

In January 2011, the [[European Union]] Climate Change Committee banned the use of HFC-23 CERs in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] from 1 May 2013. The ban includes nitrous oxide (N2O) from adipic acid production. The reasons given were the perverse incentives, the lack of additionality, the lack of environmental integrity, the under-mining of the [[Montreal Protocol]], costs and ineffectiveness and the distorting effect of a few projects in advanced [[developing countries]] getting too many CERs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Barriers==

World Bank (n.d., p.&amp;nbsp;12) described a number of barriers to the use of the CDM in [[least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name=wbnd/&gt; LDCs have experienced lower participation in the CDM to date. Four CDM decisions were highlighted as having a disproportionate negative impact on LDCs:
*'''Suppressed demand''': Baseline calculations for LDCs are low, meaning that projects cannot generate sufficient [[carbon finance]] to have an impact.
*'''Treatment of projects that replace non-renewable biomass''': A decision taken led to essentially a halving in the emission reduction potential of these projects. This has particularly affected [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and projects in poor communities, where firewood, often from non-renewable sources, is frequently used as a fuel for cooking and heating.
*'''Treatment of forestry projects and exclusion of agriculture under the CDM''': These sectors are more important for LDCs than for middle-income countries. Credits from forestry projects are penalized under the CDM, leading to depressed demand and price.
*'''Transaction costs and CDM process requirements''': These are geared more towards the most advanced developing countries, and do not work well for the projects most often found in LDCs.

==Views on the CDM==

===Additionality===

====Emissions====

One of the difficulties of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;54-56).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their [[additionality]] assessments. They compared establishing [[additionality]] to the balance of evidence in a legal system. Certainty in additionality is rare, and the higher the proof of additionality, the greater the risk of rejecting good projects to reduce emissions.

====Types====

Additionality is much contested. There are many rival interpretations of additionality:

# What is often labelled ‘environmental additionality’ has that a project is additional if the emissions from the project are lower than the baseline. It generally looks at what would have happened without the project.
# Another interpretation, sometimes termed ‘project additionality’, the project must not have happened without the CDM.

A number of terms for different kinds of additionality have been discussed, leading to some confusion, particularly over the terms 'financial additionality' and 'investment additionality' which are sometimes used as synonyms. 'Investment additionality', however, was a concept discussed and ultimately rejected during negotiation of the Marrakech Accords. Investment additionality carried the idea that any project that surpasses a certain risk-adjusted profitability threshold would automatically be deemed non-additional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrom.nl/pagina.html?id=37532|title=VROM (Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment|author=|date=|website=vrom.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Financial additionality' is often defined as an economically non-viable project becoming viable as a direct result of CDM revenues.

Many investors argue that the environmental additionality interpretation would make the CDM simpler. Environmental NGOs have argued that this interpretation would open the CDM to free-riders, permitting developed countries to emit more CO&lt;sub&gt;2e&lt;/sub&gt;, while failing to produce emission reductions in the CDM host countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326 Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM]; International Rivers; December 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Gillenwater (2011) evaluated the various definitions of [[additionality]] used within the CDM community and provided a synthesis definition that rejects the notion of there being different types of additionality.&lt;ref name="Gillenwater, M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gillenwater, M. |title=What Is Additionality?

Schneider (2007) produced a report on the CDM for the WWF.&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;{{Cite web
|date=5 November 2007

|title=Is the CDM fulfilling its environmental and sustainable development objectives? An evaluation of the CDM and options for improvement

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of the report were based on a systematic evaluation of 93 randomly chosen registered CDM projects, as well as interviews and a literature survey (p.&amp;nbsp;5). According to Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;72), the additionality of a significant number of projects over the 2004-2007 period seemed to be either unlikely or questionable.

It is never possible to establish with certainty what would have happened without the CDM or in absence of a particular project, which is one common objection to the CDM. Nevertheless, official guidelines have been designed to facilitate uniform assessment,&lt;ref&gt;Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 03), UNFCCC CDM EB, EB 29&lt;/ref&gt; set by the CDM Executive Board for assessing additionality.

====Views on additionality====

An argument against additionality is based on the fact that developing countries are not subject to emission caps in the Kyoto Protocol (Müller, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;''iv'',&amp;nbsp;9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
|date=March 2009

|df=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On these basis, "business-as-usual" (BAU) emissions (i.e., emissions that would occur without any efforts to reduce them) in developing countries should be allowed. By setting a BAU baseline, this can be interpreted as being a target for developing countries. Thus, it is, in effect, a restriction on their right to emit without a cap. This can be used as an argument against having additionality, in the sense that non-additional (i.e., emission reductions that would have taken place under BAU) emission reductions should be credited.

Müller (2009) argued that compromise was necessary between having additionality and not having it. In his view, additionality should sometimes be used, but other times, it shouldn't.

According to World Bank (n.d., pp.&amp;nbsp;16–17), additionality is crucial in maintaining the environmental integrity of the carbon market.&lt;ref name=wbnd&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To maintain this integrity, it was suggested that projects meeting or exceeding ambitious policy objectives or technical standards could be deemed additional.

===Concerns===

====Overall efficiency====
Pioneering research has suggested that an average of approximately 30% of the money spent on the open market buying CDM credits goes directly to project operating and capital expenditure costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbonretirement.com/project-offsetting-costs|title=Carbon Retirement report: The Efficiency of Carbon Offsetting through the Clean Development Mechanism|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kahya|first=Damian|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8399740.stm|title='30% of carbon offsets' spent on reducing emissions|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-12-07|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other significant costs include the broker's premium (about 30%, understood to represent the risk of a project not delivering) and the project shareholders' dividend (another 30%). The researchers noted that the sample of projects studied was small, the range of figures was wide and that their methodology of estimating values slightly overstated the average broker's premium.

====The risk of fraud====
One of the main problems concerning CDM-projects is the risk of fraud.&lt;ref name="VODO"&gt;{{cite web|last=VODO vzw &amp; 11.11.11|title=CDM: schoon genoeg?

[[Clean Development Mechanism#Hydropower|Hydro-projects]] are also quite problematic. Barbara Haye calculated that more than a third of all hydro-projects recognized as a CDM-project ‘were already completed at the time of registration and almost all were already under construction’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haye|first=B.|title=Failed mechanism: How the CDM is subsidizing hydro developers and harming the Kyoto Protocol|journal=Internationalrivers.org|date=November 2007|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/files/Failed_Mechanism_3.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that CERs are issued for projects that aren’t additional, which again indirectly leads to higher emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=International Rivers|title=Failed Mechanism: Hundreds of Hydros Expose Serious Flaws in the CDM|url=http://www.internationalrivers.org/node/2326|publisher=Internationalrivers.org|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, most of the proposed carbon benefits of these projects are exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;

Why are these projects approved by the Clean_Development_Mechanism Executive Board (EB)?’, one might wonder. One of the main problems is that the EB is a highly politicized body. People taking a place in the board aren’t independent technocrats, but are elected as representatives of their respective countries. They face pressure from their own &amp; other (powerful) countries, the [[World Bank]] (that subsidizes certain projects), and other lobbying organisations. This, combined with a lack of transparency regarding the decisions of the board leads to the members favouring political-economical over technical or scientific considerations.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flues"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flues|first=F.|author2=Michaelowa, A. |author3=Michaelowa, K |title=UN approval of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects in developing countries: The political economy of the CDM Executive Board|journal=CIS Working Paper|year=2008|issue=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that the CDM isn’t governed according to the rules of ‘[[good governance]]’. Solving this problem might require a genuine democratization in the election of the EB-members and thus a shift in thinking from government to [[environmental governance|governance]]. In practice this would mean that all the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] should get a voice in who can have a seat in the EB.

Another important factor in the dysfunctionality of the EB is the lack of time, staff and financial resources it has to fully evaluate a project proposal.&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt; Moreover, the verification of a project is often outsourced to companies that also deliver services (such as accounting or consultancy) to enterprises setting up these same projects. In this way, the verifiers have serious incentives to deliver a positive report to the EB.&lt;ref name="VODO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Despines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wara" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bachram|first=H.|title=Climate Fraud and Carbon Colonialism: The New Trade in Greenhouse Gases|journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism|year=2004|volume=15|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that implementation is the place where the shoe pinches, as usually happens in environmental issues (mostly due to a lack of funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J.P.|title=Environmental governance|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=London|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it should be noted though that there have been indications in recent years that the EB is becoming more strict in its decisions, due to the huge criticism and the board getting more experience.&lt;ref name="Flues" /&gt;

====Exclusion of forest conservation/avoided deforestation from the CDM====
The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol excluded forest conservation as well as avoided deforestation from the CDM for a variety of political, practical and ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A New Initiative to Use Carbon Trading for Tropical Forest Conservation] William F. Laurance(2007), Biotropica 39 (1), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt; However, carbon emissions from deforestation represent 18-25% of all emissions,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, N. 2006. Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change&lt;/ref&gt; and will account for more carbon emissions in the next five years than all emissions from all aircraft since the Wright Brothers until at least 2025.&lt;ref&gt;Forests First in the Fight Against Climate Change, Global Canopy Programme, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there have been growing calls for the inclusion of forests in CDM schemes for the second commitment period from a variety of sectors, under the leadership of the [[Coalition for Rainforest Nations]], and brought together under the [[Forests Now Declaration]], which has been signed by over 300 NGOs, business leaders, and policy makers. There is so far no international agreement about whether projects avoiding deforestation or conserving forests should be initiated through separate policies and measures or stimulated through the carbon market. One major concern is the enormous monitoring effort needed in order to make sure projects are indeed leading to increased carbon storage. There is also local opposition. For example, May 2, 2008, at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues ([[UNPFII]]), Indigenous leaders from around the world protested against the [[Clean Energy Mechanism]]s, especially against [[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]].

====Reasons for including avoided deforestation projects in the CDM====

''Combating global warming has broadly two components: decreasing the release of greenhouse gases and sequestering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emitters, such as coal-fired power plants, are known as "sources", and places where carbon and other greenhouse gases, such as methane, can be sequestered, i.e. kept out of the atmosphere, are known as "sinks".

The world's forests, particularly rain forests, are important carbon sinks, both because of their uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through photosynthesis and because of the amount of carbon stored in their woody biomass and the soil. When rain forests are logged and burned, not only do we lose the forests' capacity to take up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere, but also the carbon stored in that biomass and soil is released into the atmosphere through release of roots from the soil and the burning of the woody plant matter.

An emerging proposal, Reduced Emissions from Avoided Deforestation and Degradation (REDD), would allow rain forest preservation to qualify for CDM project status. [[REDD]] has gained support through recent meetings of the COP, and will be examined at Copenhagen.

====Coal thermal power generation in India and China====
In July 2011, Reuters reported that a 4,000 MW coal thermal electricity generation plant in Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh had been registered with the CDM. CDM Watch and the Sierra Club criticised the plant's registration and its eligibility for certified emission reduction units as clearly not additional. A CDM spokesperson dismissed these claims. According to information provided to Reuters, there are total of five coal-fired electricity plants registered with the CDM, four in India with a capacity of 10,640 MW and one 2,000 MW plant in China. The five plants are eligible to receive 68.2 million CERs over a 10-year period with an estimated value of 661 million euros ($919 million) at a CER price of 9.70 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2012, the Executive Board of the Clean Development Mechanism adopted rules confirming that new coal thermal power generation plants could be registered as CDM projects and could use the simplified rules called 'Programmes of Activities'. The organisation CDM-Watch described the decision as inconsistent with the objective of the CDM as it subsidised the construction of new coal power plants. CDM-Watch described the CERs that would be issued as "non-additional dirty carbon credits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrial gas projects====

Some CERs are produced from CDM projects at refrigerant-producing factories in non-Annex I countries that generate the powerful greenhouse gas HFC 23 as a by-product. These projects dominated the CDM's early growth, and are expected to generate 20% of all credited emission reductions by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Paying for facilities to destroy HFC-23 can cost only 0.2-0.5&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Industrialized countries were, however, paying around 20 €/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for reductions that cost below 1&amp;nbsp;€/tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This provoked strong criticism.

The scale of profits generated by HFC-23 projects threatened distortions in competitiveness with plants in industrialized countries that had already cleaned up their emissions (p.&amp;nbsp;60). In an attempt to address concerns over HFC-23 projects, the CDM Executive Board made changes in how these projects are credited. According to the Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60), these changes effectively ensure that:
*the potential to capture emissions from these plants is exploited;
*distortions are reduced;
*and the risk of perverse incentives is capped.

Carbon Trust (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;60) argued that criticizing the CDM for finding low-cost reductions seemed perverse. They also argued that addressing the problem with targeted funding was easy with hindsight, and that before the CDM, these emission reduction opportunities were not taken.

====Hydropower====

{{refimprove section|date=April 2010}}

NGOs have criticized the inclusion of large [[hydropower]] projects, which they consider unsustainable, as CDM projects.{https://www.internationalrivers.org/km/taxonomy/term/1024} Lately, both the CDM EB and investors have become concerned about such projects for potential lack of additionality. One reason was that many of these projects had started well before applying for CDM status. In June 2008, third party validator TÜV SÜD Group rejected a hydropower project in China because the project proponents could not document that they had seriously considered CDM at the time the project was started. In July 2008, third party validators agreed that projects applying for CDM status more than one year after having taken their investment decision should not qualify for CDM status.  Currently, the largest power plant to receive CDM registration is the [[Jirau Dam|Jirau Hydroelectric Plant]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazil's Jirau hydro project world's largest CDM-registered renewable plant|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/06/brazil-s-jirau-hydro-project-world-s-largest-cdm-registered-rene.html|work=Hydro World|accessdate=30 Dec 2014|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydropower projects larger than 20&amp;nbsp;MW must document that they follow [[World Commission on Dams]] guidelines or similar guidelines in order to qualify for the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=requires a citation}} As of 21 July 2008, CERs from hydropower projects are not listed on European carbon exchanges, because different member states interpret these limitations differently.

Organisation seeking to measure the degree of compliance of individual projects with WCD principles can use the [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]], recommended as the most practical currently available evaluation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 17517IIED: Watered Down?

====Other concerns====

'''Renewable energy'''

In the initial phase of the CDM, policy makers and NGOs were concerned about the lack of renewable energy CDM projects. As the new CDM projects are now predominantly renewables and energy efficiency projects, this is now less of an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NEWS/Resources/State&amp;Trendsformatted06May10pm.pdf|title=World Bank, State and Trends of the Carbon Market, 2010|author=|date=|website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinks'''

NGOs, as well as several governments, have consistently been sceptical towards the inclusion of [[Carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] as CDM projects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010|reason=this needs a citation}} The main reasons were fear of oversupply, that such projects cannot guarantee permanent storage of carbon, and that the methods of accounting for carbon storage in biomass are complex and still under development. Consequently, two separate carbon currencies (temporary CERs and long-term CERs) were created for such projects. Such credits cannot be imported to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. The lack of demand for such projects have resulted in very limited supply: Currently (21 July 2008), only one sinks project has been registered under CDM.

'''Windfarms in Western Sahara'''

In 2012, it was announced, that a windfarm complex is going to be located near [[Laayoune]], the capital city of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Since this project is to be established under tight collaboration between the UN (which itself recognizes Western Sahara's status of a non-autonomous country) and the Moroccan government, it has been questioned by many parties supporting Western Sahara independence, including the [[Polisario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsrw.org/a105x2329|title=WSRW requests UN to refrain from paying for Moroccan King in Sahara - wsrw.org|first=Western Sahara Resource|last=Watch|date=|website=www.wsrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suggestions====

In response to concerns of unsustainable projects or spurious credits, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and other NGOs devised a ‘Gold Standard’ methodology to certify projects that uses much stricter criteria than required, such as allowing only renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdmgoldstandard.org/|title=The Gold Standard|author=|date=|website=www.cdmgoldstandard.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[South Africa]]n brick kiln was faced with a business decision; replace its depleted energy supply with coal from a new [[Coal mine|mine]], or build a difficult but cleaner [[natural gas]] pipeline to another country. They chose to build the pipeline with [[Sasol|SASOL]]. SASOL claimed the difference in GHG emissions as a CDM credit, comparing emissions from the pipeline to the contemplated coal mine.
During its approval process, the validators noted that changing the supply from coal to gas met the CDM's 'additionality' criteria and was the least cost-effective option.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/UserManagement/FileStorage/S790NBBTEMPHOKU95G4UB8J0U5V52O CDM Project 0177 Lawley Fuel Switch Project] UNFCCC&lt;/ref&gt;
However, there were unofficial reports that the fuel change was going to take place anyway, although this was later denied by the company's press office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;Itemid=36&amp;id=177&amp;task=view|title=Trading the Absurd - carbon trade watch|first=|last=Administrator|date=|website=www.carbontradewatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successes===

Schneider (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;73) commented on the success of the CDM in reducing emissions from industrial plants and landfills.&lt;ref name=schneider/&gt; Schneider (2007) concluded by stating that if concerns over the CDM are properly addressed, it would continue to be an "important instrument in the fight against climate change."

{{Wikiquote}}'''Consent''' occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/39517?rskey=7YN1Zi&amp;result=1#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It is a term of common speech, but may have more specific definitions in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships.  

Types of consent include [[implied consent]], expressed consent, [[informed consent]] and [[unanimous consent]].  Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its  everyday meaning. For example, a person with a [[mental disorder]], a low [[mental age]], or under the legal [[age of sexual consent]] may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law. UN agencies and initiatives in sex education programs believe that teaching the topic of consent as part of a [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*[[Implied consent]] is a form of consent which is not expressly granted by a person, but rather inferred from a person's actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person's silence or inaction). Some examples include implied consent to follow rules and/or regulations at an education institution and the implied consent to physical contact by participants in a hockey game.
*Expressed consent is clearly and unmistakably stated, rather than implied. It may be given in [[writing]], by [[spoken words|speech]] (orally), or [[nonverbal communication|non-verbally]], e.g. by a clear gesture such as a nod. Non-written express consent not evidenced by witnesses or an audio or video recording may be disputed if a [[Party (law)|party]] denies that it was given.
*[[Informed consent]] in medicine is consent given by a person who has a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and future consequences of an action. The term is also used in other contexts, such as in social scientific research, when participants are asked to affirm that they understand the research procedure and consent to it.
*[[Unanimous consent]], or general consent, by a group of several parties (e.g., an [[Voluntary association|association]]) is consent given by all parties.
*Substituted consent, or the substituted judgment doctrine, allows a decision maker to attempt to establish the decision an incompetent person would have made if he or she were competent.&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan |date=2011 |title=Black's Law Dictionary |url= |location= |publisher=West Publishing Co. |page=726 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tort==
{{Main|Tort}}
Consent can be either expressed or implied. For example, participation in a [[contact sport]] usually implies consent to a degree of contact with other participants, implicitly agreed and often defined by the rules of the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4200680.stm  Example of permitted and regulated contact in sport - BBC Sport: Rugby Union: "... you can tackle an opponent in order to get the ball, as long as you stay within the rules."]&lt;/ref&gt; Another specific example is where a boxer cannot complain of being punched on the nose by an opponent; implied consent will be valid where the violence is '''ordinarily and reasonably to be contemplated as incidental to the sport in question'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|29|1976|litigants=Pallante v Stadiums Pty Ltd (No 1) |parallelcite=[1976] [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 331 at 339 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Express consent exists when there is oral or written agreement, particularly in a contract. For example, businesses may require that persons [[Digital signature|sign]] a [[waiver]] (called a [[liability waiver]]) acknowledging and accepting the hazards of an activity. This proves express consent, and prevents the person from filing a [[tort]] lawsuit for unauthorised actions.

In [[English law]], the principle of ''[[volenti non fit injuria]]'' applies not only to participants in sport, but also to spectators and to any others who willingly engage in activities where there is a risk of injury. Consent has also been used as a defense in cases involving [[Death during consensual sex|accidental deaths during sex]], which occur during [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]]. ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' (May 23, 1988) referred to this latter example, as the "''rough-sex defense''". It is not effective in English law in cases of serious injury or death.

As a term of jurisprudence prior provision of consent signifies a possible defence (an [[excuse]] or justification) against civil or criminal liability. [[Defendant]]s who use this [[defense (legal)|defense]] are arguing that they should not be held [[legal liability|liable]] for a tort or a [[crime]], since the [[action (philosophy)|actions]] in question took place with the plaintiff or "victim's" prior consent and permission.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Medicine==
{{see also| Informed consent}}

The question of consent is important in medical law. For example, a medical practitioner may be liable for harm to a patient by a procedure which was not consented to. There are [[Doe ex. rel. Tarlow v. District of Columbia|exemptions]], such as when the patient is unable to give consent.&lt;ref name="sub"/&gt;

Also, a medical practitioner must explain the significant risks of a procedure (those that might change the patient's mind about whether or not to have it) before the patient can give binding consent. This was explored in Australia in ''Rogers v Whitaker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|58|1992|litigants=Rogers v Whitaker |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If a practitioner does not explain a material risk that subsequently eventuates, then that is considered negligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=[[Chester v Afshar]] |year=2004 |court=UKHL |num=41 |parallelcite= [2005] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 134 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These material risks include the loss of chance of a better result if a more experienced surgeon had performed the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|55|1998|litigants=Chappel v Hart |parallelcite=(1998) 195 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 232 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[UK]], a [[Supreme Court]] judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board |courtname=auto|juris=Scotland |court=UKSC |year=2015 |num=11 |parallelcite=[2015] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 1430}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modernised the law on consent and introduced a patient-focused test to UK law: allowing the patient rather than the medical professionals to decide upon the level of risk they wish to take in terms of a particular course of action, given all the information available.  This change reflects the Guidance of the General Medical Council on the requirement to consent patients, and removes the rule of medical paternalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court decision changes doctor-patient relationship forever - Balfour+Manson|url=https://www.balfour-manson.co.uk/news-plus-events/news/2015/03/mothers-landmark-court-win-changes-doctor-patient-relationship-forever/|website=www.balfour-manson.co.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science research ==
[[Social science|Social scientists]] are generally required to obtain informed consent from [[Research participant|research participants]] before asking interview questions or conducting an experiment. Federal law governs social science research that involves [[Human subject research|human subjects]], and tasks [[Institutional review board|institutional review boards]] (IRBs) at universities, federal or state agencies, and tribal organizations to oversee social science research that involves human subjects and to make decisions about whether or not informed consent is necessary for a social scientific study to go forward. Informed consent in this context generally means explaining the study's purpose to research participants and obtaining a signed or verbal affirmation that the study participants understand the procedures to be used and to consent to participate in the study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|51-55}} 

Some types of social scientific research, such as psychological experiments, may use deception as part of the study; in these cases, researchers may not fully describe the procedures to participants, and thus participants are not fully informed. However, researchers are required to debrief participants immediately after the experiment is concluded. Certain populations are considered to be vulnerable, and in addition to informed consent, special protections must be made available to them. These include persons who are incarcerated, pregnant women, persons with disabilities, and persons who have a mental disability.

Some countries, such as [[New Zealand]] with its [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] and its [[Building Act]], use the term "consent" for the legal process that provide planning permission for developments like subdivisions, bridges or buildings. Achieving permission results in getting "Resource consent" or "Building consent".

==Sexual activity==

{{see also| Sexual consent|Rape#Consent|Consent (criminal law)}}

In Canada "consent means…the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in sexual activity" without abuse or exploitation of "trust, power or authority", coercion or threats.&lt;ref name=canadiancriminalcode&gt;{{cite journal|last=Criminal Code|first=Canadian|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-137.html#docCont|title=‘Canadian Criminal Code’|date=2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Consent can also be revoked at any moment.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=David S.|title=‘Consent for Sexual Behavior in a College Student Population’|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=10 August 1998|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual consent plays an important role in defining what sexual assault is, since [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] without consent by all parties is considered [[rape]].&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beres. A|first=Melanie|title='Spontaneous' Sexual Consent: An Analysis of Sexual Consent Literature|journal=Feminism &amp; Psychology|date=18 January 2007|volume=17|issue=93|page=93|doi=10.1177/0959353507072914}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that we must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than "no means no" or "yes means yes".&lt;ref name=PINEAU&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pineau|first=Lois|title=‘Date Rape: A Feminist Analysis’|journal=Law and Philosophy|year=1989|volume=8|issue=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. "Consent is good, joyous, sexy": A banner campaign to market consent to college students. Journal of American College Health. 2016; 64(8):639-650&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, new models of sexual consent have been proposed. Specifically, the development of "yes means yes" and affirmative models, such as Hall's definition: "the voluntary approval of what is done or proposed by another; permission; agreement in opinion or sentiment."&lt;ref name=Hall/&gt; Hickman and Muehlenhard state that consent should be "free verbal or nonverbal communication of a feeling of willingness' to engage in sexual activity."&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, S.E. and Muehlenhard, C.L. (1999) '"By the Semi-mystical Appearance of a Condom": How Young Women and Men Communicate Sexual Consent in Heterosexual Situations', The Journal of Sex Research 36: 258–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative consent may still be limited since the underlying, individual circumstances surrounding the consent cannot always be acknowledged in the "yes means yes", or in the "no means no", model.&lt;ref name=Roffee&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9781137476159_5|title=Roffee James A., ‘When Yes Actually Means Yes: Confusing Messages and Criminalising Consent’ in Rape Justice: Beyond the Criminal Law eds. Powell A., Henry N., and Flynn A., Palgrave, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals are unable to give consent. Children or [[Minor (law)|minors]] below a certain age, the [[Age of consent|age of sexual consent]] in that [[jurisdiction]], are deemed not able to give valid consent by law to sexual acts. Likewise, persons with [[Alzheimer's disease]] or similar disabilities may be unable to give [[Consent (criminal law)|legal consent]] to sexual relations even with their spouse.&lt;ref name=NYT42215&gt;{{cite news|author1=Pam Belluck|title=Iowa Man Found Not Guilty of Sexually Abusing Wife With Alzheimer’s|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/health/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-of-sexually-abusing-wife-with-alzheimers.html|accessdate=April 23, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within literature, definitions surrounding consent and how it should be communicated have been contradictory, limited or without consensus.&lt;ref name=Roffee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beres/&gt; Roffee argued that legal definition needs to be universal, so as to avoid confusion in legal decisions. He also demonstrated how the moral notion of consent does not always align with the legal concept. For example, some adult siblings or other family members may voluntarily enter into a relationship, however the legal system still deems this as incestual, and therefore a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023|title= No Consensus on Incest? Criminalisation and Compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights| volume=14 | journal=Human Rights Law Review|pages=541–572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee argues that the use of particular language in the legislation regarding these familial sexual activities manipulates the reader to view it as immoral and criminal, even if all parties are consenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0964663913502068?legid=spsls%3B23%2F1%2F113&amp;patientinform-links=yes|title= The Synthetic Necessary Truth Behind New Labour’s Criminalisation of Incest| doi=10.1177/0964663913502068 | volume=23|journal=Social &amp; Legal Studies|pages=113–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some children under the legal age of consent may knowingly and willingly choose to be in a sexual relationship. However the law does not view this as legitimate. Whilst there is a necessity for an age of consent, it does not allow for varying levels of awareness and maturity. Here it can be seen how a moral and a legal understanding do not always align.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9781137476159.0009|title=Roffee, James (2015).

Initiatives in sex education programs are working towards including and foregrounding topics of and discussions of sexual consent, in primary, high school and college Sex Ed curricula.  In the UK, the Personal Social Health and Economic Education Association (PSHEA) is working to produce and introduce Sex Ed lesson plans in British schools that include lessons on "consensual sexual relationships," "the meaning and importance of consent" as well as "[[rape myth]]s".&lt;ref name=UK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title='Plans for sexual consent lessons in schools 'do not go far enough''|date=9 March 2015}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In U.S., California-Berkeley University has implemented affirmative and continual consent in education and in the school’s policies.&lt;ref name=consentpolicy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the Ontario government has introduced a revised Sex Ed curriculum to Toronto schools, including new discussions of sex and affirmative consent, healthy relationships and communication.&lt;ref name=CAN&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rushowy|first=Kristin|url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/education/2015/02/25/in-ontario-sex-ed-consent-the-hot-issue.html|title=‘In Ontario sex ed, consent the hot issue’|date=25 February 2015}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent.

===Affirmative consent===
Affirmative consent (enthusiastic yes) is when both parties agree to sexual conduct, either through clear, verbal communication or nonverbal cues or gestures.&lt;ref name=Grinberg&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grinberg|first=E.|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/03/living/affirmative-consent-school-policy/|title=‘Enthusiastic yes in sex consent education’|date=29 September 2014}} Retrieved March 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves communication and the active participation of people involved. This is the approach endorsed by colleges and universities in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;"...affirmative consent standards have been adopted at colleges across the nation, including every ivy league university except Harvard. "Affirmative consent: A primer"  Christine Emba ''Washington Post'' Oct 12 2015 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/10/12/affirmative-consent-a-primer/&lt;/ref&gt; which describe consent as an "affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity." According to Yoon-Hendricks, a staff writer for Sex, Etc., "Instead of saying 'no means no,' 'yes means yes' looks at sex as a positive thing." Ongoing consent is sought at all levels of sexual intimacy regardless of the parties' relationship, prior sexual history or current activity ("Grinding on the dance floor is not consent for further sexual activity," a university policy reads).&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; By definition, affirmative consent cannot be given if a person is intoxicated, unconscious or asleep.

There are 3 pillars often included in the description of sexual consent, or "the way we let others know what we're up for, be it a good-night kiss or the moments leading up to sex."

They are:

# Knowing exactly what and how much I'm agreeing to
# Expressing my intent to participate
# Deciding freely and voluntarily to participate&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

To obtain affirmative consent, rather than waiting to say or for a partner to say "no", one gives and seeks an explicit "yes". This can come in the form of a smile, a nod or a verbal yes, as long as it's unambiguous, enthusiastic and ongoing. "There's varying language, but the language gets to the core of people having to communicate their affirmation to participate in sexual behavior," said Denice Labertew of the California Coalition Against Sexual Assault.&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt; "It requires a fundamental shift in how we think about sexual assault. It's requiring us to say women and men should be mutually agreeing and actively participating in sexual behavior."&lt;ref name=Grinberg/&gt;

'''Deep time''' is the concept of [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The modern philosophical concept was developed in the 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).{{sfn|Palmer|Zen}}{{sfn|Kubicek|2008}} The [[age of the Earth]] has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/|title=How Science Figured Out the Age of Earth|last=Braterman|first=Paul S.|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific concept==
{{Life timeline}}
Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eddy |first = Matthew Daniel |title = The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date = 2008 |publisher = [[Ashgate]] |location = London |page = Ch. 5 |url = https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".{{sfn|Playfair|1805}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McPhee |first= John |date= 1981 |title= Book 1: Basin and Range, in [[Annals of the Former World]] |url= |location= New York |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page= 79 |isbn= 0-374-10520-0 |author-link= John McPhee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]].  Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on [[Plutonism]], visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of [[Hutton's Unconformity]] at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".{{sfn|Montgomery|2003}}{{sfn|Rance|1999}}

Other scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785-1873) incorporated Werner's ideas into concepts of [[catastrophism]]; Sedgwick inspired his university student [[Charles Darwin]] to exclaim "What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".{{sfn|Darwin|1831}}  In a competing theory, [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) developed Hutton's comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] concept  into [[uniformitarianism]].  As a young [[Natural history|naturalist]] and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell's book exhaustively during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey voyage]] in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about [[evolution]].

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (1999), as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] in ''In Search of Deep Time:  Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life'' (2001){{sfn|Korthof|2000}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001}}  [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

[[John McPhee]] discussed "deep time" at length with the layperson in mind in ''Basin and Range'' (1981), parts of which originally appeared in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}} In ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'', Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider the Earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] and [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 973–1037),{{sfn|Toulmin|Goodfield|1965|p=64}} and by the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]] and polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=iii,23-24}}

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Thomas Berry]] (1914–2009) explored [[spirituality|spiritual]] implications of the concept of deep time.  Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of [[deep ecology]] and [[ecophilosophy]]. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of [[Joanna Macy]] and [[John Seed]].

[[H.G. Wells]] and [[Julian Huxley]] regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice", they said in ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1929).  "We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit."&lt;ref&gt;
H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: The Literary Guild, 1934; orig. publ. 1929), p. 326.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11254">'''Emotional blackmail''' and '''FOG''' are terms, popularized by [[psychotherapist]] Susan Forward, about controlling people in relationships and the theory that [[fear]], [[obligation]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] (FOG) are the [[transactional analysis|transactional dynamics]] at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the [[controlling behavior]] of another person, and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=R.

== General ==
The first documented use of "emotional blackmail" appeared in 1947 in the ''Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women'' in the article "Emotional Blackmail Climate". The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unknown|journal=Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women|date=1947|volume= 11-12|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esther Vilar]], an Argentine physician, also used the term "emotional blackmail" in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children.&lt;ref&gt;"To  instill  obedience  into  an  only  child,  the  mother  has  to  evolve  complex  methods  to  outsmart and persuade it, and get it to see reason; or it has to be punished. Since this is a nuisance, mother usually 
leaves it to father. Several children, on the other hand, can be trained by emotional blackmail. As they are all dependent on their mother's approval, she has only to show a slight preference for one and the others will do anything she tells them to. Every child lives in constant fear that its mother will 'withdraw' her love and give it to some
one else." Villar, Esther (1972). The Manipulated Man, Bantam/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends).&lt;ref&gt;Stanlee Phelps/Nancy Austin, ''The Assertive Woman'' (1987) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Children, too, will employ [[special pleading]] and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Rapport ed., ''British Subjects'' (Oxford 2002) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist. Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[self-esteem]], blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Miller, ''R. D. Laing'' (2004) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as "FOG". FOG is a contrived acronym—a play on the word "fog" which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.

The person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

Under pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's [[Mental breakdown|breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Baudrillard]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=lKvjtv31AqoC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174 ''The Revenge of the Crystal''] (1999) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; and could fall into a pattern of letting the blackmailer control his/her decisions and behavior, lost in what [[Doris Lessing]] described as "a sort of psychological fog".&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 554&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Forward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own [[mental manipulation]] style:&lt;ref name="Forward"&gt;Susan Forward/Donna Frazier, ''Emotional Blackmail'' (London 1997) p. 28, 82, 145, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different levels of demands—demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal [[integrity]], demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

== Patterns and characteristics ==

===Addictions===
Addicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.&lt;ref name="Fenley"&gt;Fenley, Jr., James L. ''Finding a Purpose in the Pain'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness===
People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with [[paranoid personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldberg, MD|first=Joseph|title=Paranoid Personality Disorder |url=http://webmd.com/mental-health/paranoid-personality-disorder|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="braiker"&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[narcissistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref name= 'Nina W. Brown'&gt;Nina W. Brown, ''Children of the Self-Absorbed'' (2008) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

People with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to use emotional blackmail&lt;ref name="braiker"/&gt; (as too are destructive [[Narcissism|narcissists]]).&lt;ref name="Nina W. Brown"/&gt; However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of hopelessness, rather than being the product of any conscious plan.&lt;ref&gt;Blaise A. Aguirre, ''Borderline Personality Disorder in Adolescents'' (2007) p. 73-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codependency===
[[Codependency]] often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref name="CODA"&gt;[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affluenza and children===
[[Affluenza]]—the status insecurity derived from obsessively [[keeping up with the Joneses]]—has been linked by [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] to a pattern of childhood training whereby sufferers were "subjected to a form of emotional blackmail as toddlers. Their mothers' love becomes conditional on exhibiting behaviour that achieved parental goals."&lt;ref&gt;Oliver James, ''Britain on the Couch'' (London 1998) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Assertiveness training'' ===
[[Assertiveness]] training encourages people to not engage in fruitless back-and-forths or power struggles with the emotional blackmailer but instead to repeat a neutral statement, such as "I can see how you feel that way," or, if pressured to eat, say "No thank you, I'm not hungry." They are taught to keep their statements within certain boundaries in order not to capitulate to coercive [[nagging]], emotional blackmail, or [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;Sue Bishop, Develop Your Assertiveness (2006) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==
Techniques for resisting emotional blackmail include strengthening [[personal boundaries]], resisting demands, developing a ''power statement''—the determination to stand the pressure—and buying time to break old patterns. Re-connecting with the autonomous parts of the self the blackmailer had over-ruled is not necessarily easy.&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt; One may feel guilty based on emotional blackmail, even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke, ''Mary Barnes'' (1974) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; but still be able to resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of having a [[tantrum]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming a Person'' (1961) p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistently ignoring the manipulation in a friendly way may however lead to its intensification, and threats of separation,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1993) p. 349 and p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; or to accusations of being "crazy" or a "home wrecker".&lt;ref name="Forward"/&gt;

== Cultural examples ==

*[[Angela Carter]] described ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]'' as glorifying emotional blackmail on the part of the Beast, as a means of controlling his target, Beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Aiden Day, ''Angela Carter: The Rational Glass'' (1998) p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;
*Novelist [[Doris Lessing]] claimed that “I became an expert in emotional blackmail by the time I was five."&lt;ref&gt;Gayle, Green, ''Doris Lessing: The Poetics of Change'' (1997) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]] objects that in [[popular psychology]] the idea of emotional blackmail has been misused as a defense against any form of fellow-feeling or consideration for others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxkrED7hVuIC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41 ''The Comfort of Things''] (2008) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling of this dynamic with inflammatory terms such as "blackmail" and "manipulation" may not be so helpful as it is both polarizing and it implies premeditation and malicious intent which is often not the case. Controlling behavior and being controlled is a transaction between two people with both playing a part.&lt;ref name="BPDFamily"/&gt;

'''Human impact on coral reefs''' is significant. [[Coral reef]]s are dying around the world.&lt;ref name="Coral reefs around the world"/&gt; Damaging activities include coral mining, pollution (organic and non-organic), [[overfishing]], [[blast fishing]], the digging of [[canal]]s and access into islands and bays.

Reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas. Warming causes [[coral bleaching]], which if severe kills the coral.

In 2008, a worldwide study estimated that 19% of the existing area of coral reefs has already been lost, and that a further 17% is likely to be lost over the subsequent 10–20 years.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson&gt;Wilkinson, Clive (2008) [http://www.icriforum.org/sites/default/files/Status%20Coral%20%20Reefs%20of%20World%202008%20%20Executive%20Summary_0.pdf Status of Coral Reefs of the World: Executive Summary].

==Issues==

===Competition===
In the [[Caribbean Sea]] and tropical [[Pacific ocean]], direct contact between coral and 40–70% of common [[seaweed]]s cause [[coral bleaching|bleaching]] and death of coral tissue via [[allelopathic]] competition. The lipid-soluble extracts of seaweeds that harmed coral tissues also produced rapid bleaching. At these sites bleaching and mortality was limited to areas of direct contact with seaweed or their extracts. The seaweed then expanded to occupy the dead coral's habitat.&lt;ref name=RasherHay10&gt;{{cite journal

Competitive seaweed and other [[algae]] thrive in nutrient-rich waters in the absence of sufficient [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[predator]]s. Herbivores include fish such as [[parrotfish]]s, [[Acanthuridae|surgeonfishes, tangs and unicornfishes]].&lt;ref name=RasherHay10/&gt;

===Predation===
{{Main|Overfishing|Environmental effects of fishing}}

[[Overfishing]], particularly selective overfishing, can unbalance coral ecosystems by encouraging the excessive growth of coral predators. Predators that eat living coral, such as the [[crown-of-thorns starfish]], are called ''corallivores''. Coral reefs are built from [[stony coral]], which evolved with large amounts of the [[wax]] [[cetyl palmitate]] in their tissues. Most predators find this wax indigestible.&lt;ref&gt;Benson AA and Muscatine L (1974) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2834385 Wax in Coral Mucus: Energy Transfer From Corals to Reef Fishes] ''Limnology and Oceanography'', '''19''' (5) 810–814. [http://www.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_19/issue_5/0810.pdf Download]&lt;/ref&gt; The crown-of-thorns starfish is a large (up to one meter) starfish protected by long, venomous spines. Its [[enzyme]] system dissolves the wax in stony corals, and allows the [[starfish]] to feed on the living animal. Starfish face predators of their own, such as the [[Giant Triton|giant triton]] [[sea snail]]. However, the giant triton is valued for its [[mollusc shell|shell]] and has been over fished. As a result, crown-of-thorns starfish populations can periodically grow unchecked, devastating reefs.&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/survival/coral/predators.html Predators and Prey] ''[[PBS.org]]''.

===Fishing practices===
Although some [[marine aquarium]] fish species can reproduce in aquaria (such as [[Pomacentridae]]), most (95%) are collected from coral reefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Intense harvesting, especially in [[maritime Southeast Asia]] (including [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]]), damages the reefs. This is aggravated by [[destructive fishing practices]], such as [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]] and [[blast fishing]]. Most (80–90%) aquarium fish from the Philippines are captured with [[sodium cyanide]]. This toxic chemical is dissolved in sea water and released into areas where fish shelter. It narcotizes the fish, which are then easily captured. However, most fish collected with cyanide die a few months later from [[liver]] damage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Moreover, many non-marketable specimens die in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x | title= David LECCHINI, Sandrine POLTI, Yohei NAKAMURA, Pascal MOSCONI, Makoto TSUCHIYA, Georges REMOISSENET, Serge PLANES (2006) "New perspectives on aquarium fish trade" Fisheries Science 72 (1), 40–47 | accessdate = 16 January 2007 | publisher=Blackwell Synergy |doi=10.1111/j.1444-2906.2006.01114.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 4,000 or more Filipino fish collectors have used over {{convert|1000000|kg}}  of cyanide on Philippine reefs alone, about 150,000&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt; A major catalyst of [[cyanide fishing]] is poverty within fishing communities. In countries like the Philippines that regularly employ cyanide, more than thirty percent of the population lives below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |title=CIA—The World Factbook—Philippines |accessdate=1 February 2011 |publisher=[[CIA]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070218/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html |archivedate=11 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dynamite]] [[fishing]] is another destructive method for gathering fish. Sticks of dynamite, [[grenade]]s, or home-made explosives are detonated in the water. This method of fishing kills the fish within the main blast area, along with many unwanted reef animals. The blast also kills the corals in the area, eliminating the reef's structure, destroying habitat for the remaining fish and other animals important for reef health.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{cite web
|last1=McClellan |first1=Kate |last2=Bruno |first2=John |year=2008 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Coral_degradation_through_destructive_fishing_practices
|title=Coral degradation through destructive fishing practices |publisher=Encyclopedia of Earth |accessdate= 25 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muroami]] is the destructive practice of covering reefs with nets and dropping large stones onto the reef to produce a flight response among the fish. The stones break and kill the coral. Muroami was generally outlawed in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Fishing gear damages reefs via direct physical contact with the reef structure and substrate. Gill nets, fish traps, and anchors break branching coral and cause coral death through entanglement. When fishermen drop lines by coral reefs, the lines entangle the coral. The fisher cuts the line and abandons it, leaving it attached to the reef. The discarded lines abrade coral [[polyp]]s and upper tissue layers. Corals are able to recover from small lesions, but larger and recurrent damage complicates recovery.

Bottom dragging gear such as [[beach seine]]s can damage corals by abrasion and fracturing. A beach seine is a long net about {{convert|150|m|ft|sp=us}} with a mesh size of {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} and a weighted line to hold the net down while it is dragged across the substrate and is one of the most destructive types of fishing gear on Kenya’s reefs.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

Bottom [[trawling]] in deep oceans destroys cold–water and deep–sea corals. Historically, industrial fishers avoided coral because their nets would get caught on the reefs. In the 1980s, "rock–hopper" trawls attached large tires and rollers to allow the nets to roll over rough surfaces. Fifty-five percent of Alaskan cold–water coral that was damaged by one pass from a bottom trawl had not recovered a year later. Northeast Atlantic reefs bear scars up to {{convert|4|km|mi|sp=us}} long. In Southern Australia, 90 percent of the surfaces on coral [[seamount]]s are now bare rock. Even in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, seafloor trawling for prawns and scallops is causing localized extinction of some coral species.&lt;ref name="McClellan"/&gt;

=== Marine pollution ===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
[[File:Cwall99 lg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This image of an [[algae bloom]] off the southern coast of England, though not in a coral region, shows what a bloom can look like from a satellite remote sensing system.]]

Reefs in close proximity to human populations are subject to poor water quality from land- and marine-based sources. In 2006 studies suggested that approximately 80 percent of ocean pollution originates from activities on land.&lt;ref name="2006 United Nations Environment Program"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/annualreport/UNEP_AR_2006_English.pdf |format=pdf |title=UNEP in 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution arrives from land via [[Surface runoff|runoff]], the wind and "injection" (deliberate introduction, e.g., drainpipes).
Runoff brings with it sediment from [[erosion]] and land-clearing, nutrients and pesticides from agriculture, [[wastewater]], industrial [[effluent]] and miscellaneous material such as petroleum residue and trash that storms wash away. Some pollutants consume [[oxygen]] and lead to [[eutrophication]], killing coral and other reef inhabitants.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/visions/coral/side.html |publisher=[[NOAA]] |title=How Pollution Affects Coral Reefs |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing fraction of the global population lives in coastal areas. Without appropriate precautions, development (e.g., buildings and paved roads) increases the fraction of rainfall and other water sources that enter the ocean as runoff by decreasing the land's ability to absorb it.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Pollution can introduce [[pathogen]]s. For example, [[Aspergillus]] sydowii has been associated with a disease in [[sea fan]]s, and [[Serratia marcescens]], has been linked to the coral disease white pox.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

Reefs in close proximity to human populations can be faced with local stresses, including poor water quality from land-based sources of pollution.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt; Copper, a common industrial pollutant has been shown to interfere with the [[Biological life cycle|life history]] and development of coral polyps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emma Young|date=February 18, 2003|title=Copper decimates coral reef spawning

In addition to runoff, wind blows material into the ocean. This material may be local or from other regions. For example, dust from the [[Sahara]] moves to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]]. Dust also blows from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] [[desert]]s across [[Korea]], [[Japan]], and the Northern [[Pacific]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==== Nutrient pollution ====
{{main|Nutrient pollution}}
[[File:Runoff from this pipe in the U.S. Virgin Islands spews directly into the ocean only a few hundred yards from reefs.jpg|left|180px|thumb]]

[[Nutrient pollution]], particularly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] can cause [[eutrophication]], upsetting the balance of the reef by enhancing algal growth and crowding out corals. This nutrient–rich water can enable [[algal blooms|blooms]] of fleshy [[algae]] and [[phytoplankton]] to thrive off coasts. These blooms can create [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] conditions by using all available [[oxygen]]. Biologically available nitrogen (nitrate plus [[ammonia]]) needs to be below 1.0 [[micromole]] per liter (less than 0.014 parts per million of nitrogen), and biologically available phosphorus ([[orthophosphate]] plus dissolved organic phosphorus) needs to be below 0.1 micromole per liter (less than 0.003 parts per million of phosphorus). In addition concentrations of chlorophyll (in the microscopic plants called phytoplankton) needs to be below 0.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both plants also obscure sunlight, killing both fish and coral. High nitrate levels are specifically toxic to corals, while phosphates slow down skeletal growth.

Excess nutrients can intensify existing disease, including potentially doubling the spread of [[Aspergillosis]], a fungal infection that kills soft corals such as sea fans, and increasing yellow band disease, a [[bacteria]]l [[infection]] that kills reef-building hard corals by fifty percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Nowak|publisher=New Scientist|date=11 January 2004|title=Sewage nutrients fuel coral disease|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4539|accessdate=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Air pollution ====
{{main|Air pollution}}
A study released in April 2013 has shown that air pollution can also stunt the growth of [[coral reef]]s; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions. The researchers state that the study signifies the first time that the relationship between air pollution and coral reefs has been elucidated, while former chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority Ian McPhail referred to the report as "fascinating" upon the public release of its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Air pollution casts a cloud over coral reef growth|url=http://theconversation.com/air-pollution-casts-a-cloud-over-coral-reef-growth-13319|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=9 April 2013|author=Liz Minchin|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine debris===
{{main|Marine debris}}
[[Marine debris]] is any solid object that enters coastal and ocean waters. Debris may arrive directly from a ship or indirectly when washed out to sea via rivers, streams, and storm drains. Human-made items tend to be the most harmful such as [[plastics]] (from [[plastic bag|bags]] to balloons, hard hats to [[fishing line]]), glass, metal, rubber (millions of [[waste tire]]s), and even entire vessels.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;

[[Plastic debris]] kills several reef species. Derelict (abandoned) fishing nets and other gear—often called "ghost nets" because they still catch fish and other marine life despite being abandoned—can entangle and kill reef organisms and break or damage reefs. Even remote reef systems suffer the effects of marine debris. Reefs in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] are particularly prone to the accumulation of marine debris because of their central location in the [[North Pacific Gyre]]. From 2000 to 2006, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and partners removed over 500 tons of marine debris there.&lt;ref name="celebrating200years.noaa.gov"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Dredging===
{{Main|Dredging}}
[[Dredging]] operations are sometimes completed by cutting a path through a coral reef, directly destroying the reef structure and killing any organisms that live on it.&lt;ref name="miamiherald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |title=Scientists race to save coral doomed by Government Cut dredging - Environment - MiamiHerald.com |publisher=miamiherald.com |accessdate=21 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715171454/http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/06/06/4162375/scientists-race-to-save-coral.html |archivedate=15 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations that directly destroy coral are often intended to deepen or otherwise enlarge [[Channel (geography)|shipping channels]] or [[canals]], due to the fact that in many areas, removal of coral requires a [[License|permit]], making it more cost-effective and simple to avoid coral reefs if possible.

Dredging also releases plumes of suspended sediment, which can settle on coral reefs, damaging them by starving them of food and sunlight. Continued exposure to dredging spoil has been shown to increase rates of diseases such as [[white syndrome]], [[Coral bleaching|bleaching]] and sediment [[necrosis]] among others.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/16/coral-reefs-face-heightened-risk-of-fatal-disease-from-dredging-says-research|title=Coral reefs face heightened risk of fatal disease from dredging, says research &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; theguardian.com|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the [[Montebello Islands|Montebello]] and [[Barrow Island (Western Australia)|Barrow Islands]] showed that the number of coral colonies with signs of poor health more than doubled in [[transects]] with high exposure to dredging sediment plumes.&lt;ref name="plosone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0102498|title=PLOS ONE: Sediment and Turbidity Associated with Offshore Dredging Increase Coral Disease Prevalence on Nearby Reefs|publisher=plosone.org|accessdate=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunscreen===
[[Sunscreen]] enters the wastewater system when it is washed off and eventually reaches the ocean. Some 14,000 tons of sunscreen ends up in the ocean each year. Certain formulations of sunscreen are a serious danger to coral health. The common sunscreen ingredient [[oxybenzone]] causes coral bleaching and has an impact on other marine fauna.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/10/20/450276158/chemicals-in-sunscreen-are-harming-coral-reefs-says-new-study|title=Chemicals In Sunscreen Are Harming Coral Reefs, Says New Study|last=Wagner|first=Laura|date=October 20, 2015|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Akumal]], Mexico, visitors are warned not to use sunscreen and are kept out of some areas to prevent damage to the coral. In several other tourist destinations, authorities recommend the use of sunscreens prepared with the naturally occurring chemicals [[titanium dioxide]] or [[zinc oxide]], or suggest the use of clothing rather than chemicals to screen the skin from the sun.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

===Climate change===
{{Main|Climate change|Coral bleaching}}
[[File:CoralBleaching.jpg|thumbnail|right|Unbleached and [[coral bleaching|bleached coral]].]]

[[Current sea level rise|Rising sea levels due to climate change]] requires coral to grow to stay close enough to the surface to continue [[photosynthesis]]. Also, water temperature changes or disease of the coral&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; can induce [[coral bleaching]], as happened during the 1998 and 2004 [[El Niño]] years, in which [[sea surface temperature]]s rose well above normal, bleaching and killing many reefs. Bleaching may be caused by different triggers, including High sea surface temperature (SST), pollution, or other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ocean|last=|first=|publisher=DK|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=152–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; SST coupled with high irradiance (light intensity), triggers the loss of [[zooxanthellae]], a [[symbiotic]] single cell algae that gives the coral its color and the coral's [[dinoflagellate]] pigmentation, which turns the coral white when it is expelled, which can kill the coral. Zooxanthellae provide up to 90% of their hosts' energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Healthy reefs can often recover from bleaching if water temperatures cool. However, recovery may not be possible if {{chem|CO|2}} levels rise to 500 [[Parts per million|ppm]] because concentrations of carbonate ions may then be too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40021 |title=Environment: Between a Reef and a Hard Place |last=Leahy |first=Stephen |year=2007 |publisher=NoticiasFinancieras |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008064436/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40021 |archivedate=2009-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoegh-Guldberg|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warming seawater may also encourage an emerging problem: coral disease. Weakened by warm water, coral is much more prone to diseases including [[black band disease]], [[white band disease]] and [[skeletal eroding band]]. If global temperatures increase by 2&amp;nbsp;°C during the twenty-first century, coral may not be able to adapt quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Warming seawater is also expected to cause migrations in fish populations to compensate for the change. This puts coral reefs and their associated species at risk of [[invasive species|invasion]] and may cause their extinction if they are unable to compete with the invading populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=S. |last=Airamé |title=Climate Change, Coral Reef Ecosystems, and Management Options for Marine Protected Areas. |volume=44 |issue=6 |date=June 2009 |pmc=2791481 |pmid=19636605 |doi=10.1007/s00267-009-9346-0|bibcode = 2009EnMan..44.1069K |journal=Environmental Management |pages=1069–1088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 report by the [[Institute of Physics]] predicts that unless the national targets set by the [[Copenhagen Accord]] are amended to eliminate loopholes, then by 2100 global temperatures could rise by 4.2&amp;nbsp;°C and result in an end to coral reefs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iop.org/news/sep10/page_44805.html Climate Accord loopholes could spell 4.2°C rise in temperature and end of coral reefs by 2100] ''[[Institute of Physics]]'', Press release, 29 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rogelj J, Chen C, Nabel J, Macey K, Hare W, Schaeffer M, Markmann K, Höhne N, Andersen KK |display-authors=etal | year = 2010 | title =Analysis of the Copenhagen Accord pledges and its global climatic impacts—a snapshot of dissonant ambitions | url =https://www.iop.org/news/sep10/page_44805.html | journal = Environmental Research Letters | publisher = [[Institute of Physics]] | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 3 | doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/5/3/034013 |bibcode = 2010ERL.....5c4013R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ocean acidification===
{{Main|Ocean acidification}}
[[File:Isidella tentaculum - NOAA.jpg|thumb|[[Bamboo coral]] is an early harbinger of ocean acidification]]
[[Ocean acidification]] results from increases in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].

[[File:Ocellaris clownfish.JPG|thumb|left|Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water harms the ability of young clown and damsel fishes to smell and hear]]

Rising carbon dioxide levels could confuse brain signaling in fish. In 2012, researchers reported on their results after studying the behaviour of baby [[Clownfish|clown]] and [[damselfish]]es for several years in water with elevated levels of dissolved carbon dioxide, in line with what may exist by the end of the century. They found that the higher carbon dioxide disrupted a key brain [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] in the fish, interfering with [[neurotransmitter]] functions. The damaged central nervous systems affected fish behaviour and diminishing their sensory capacity to a point "likely to impair their chances of survival". The fishes were less able to locate reefs by smell or "detect the warning smell of a predator fish". Nor could they hear the sounds made by other reef fish, compromising their ability to locate safe reefs and avoid dangerous ones. They also lost their usual tendencies to turn to the left or right, damaging their ability to [[Shoaling and schooling|school]] with other fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/01/16/3409053.htm Carbon dioxide affecting fish brains: study] ''ABC'', 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/337677/title/Rising_carbon_dioxide_confuses_brain_signaling_in_fish Rising carbon dioxide confuses brain signaling in fish] ''Science News Online'', 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nilsson GE, Dixson DL, Domenici P, McCormick MI, Sørensen C, Watson S, Munday PL | year = 2012 | title = Near-future carbon dioxide levels alter fish behaviour by interfering with neurotransmitter function Letter | url = | journal = Nature Climate Change | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nclimate1352 |bibcode = 2012NatCC...2..201N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease===

Disease is a serious threat to many coral species. The diseases of coral may consist of bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Due to many of the dramatic changes in climate and stress caused by pollution, coral become more vulnerable to diseases. Some examples of coral disease are vibrio, white syndrome, white band, rapid wasting disease, and many more.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pierce.ctc.edu:2189/ehost/detail/detail?vid=14&amp;sid=f278f495-82f3-4790-a5bf-2bf8783710ca%40sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4114&amp;bdata=JnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=503444154&amp;db=scf|title=Emerging Infections on the Reefs|last=Bruckner|first=Andrew and Robin|date=1998|website=EBSCO|access-date=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These diseases have different effects on the corals, ranging from damaging individual corals, killing individual coral, or even wiping out entire reefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Caribbean, white band disease is one of the primary causes for the death of over eighty percent of Staghorn and Elkhorn coral (Reef Resilience). It is a disease that can destroy miles of coral reef fast. 
A disease such as white plague can spread over a coral colony by a half an inch a day. By the time the disease has fully taken over the colony, it leaves behind a dead skeleton. Dead standing coral structures are what most people see after disease has taken over a reef.

===Other issues===

[[Coral sand|Coral mining]] is another threat. Both small scale harvesting by villagers and industrial scale mining by companies are serious threats. Mining is usually done to produce construction material which is valued as much as 50% cheaper than other rocks, such as from [[quarries]].&lt;ref name="The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs"&gt;The Greenpeace Book of Coral Reefs&lt;/ref&gt; The rocks are ground and mixed with other materials, like cement to make concrete. Ancient coral used for construction is known as [[coral rag]]. Building directly on the reef also takes its toll, altering water circulation and the tides which bring the nutrients to the reef. The pressing reason for building on reefs is simply lack of space.

Boats and ships require access points into bays and islands to load and unload cargo and people. For this, parts of reefs are often chopped away to clear a path. Negative consequences can include altered water circulation and altered [[tide|tidal]] patterns which can disrupt the reef's nutrient supply; sometimes destroying a great part of the reef. [[Fishing vessel]]s and other large boats occasionally run aground on a reef. Two types of damage can result. Collision damage occurs when a coral reef is crushed and split by a vessel's hull into multiple fragments. Scarring occurs when boat propellers tear off the live coral and expose the skeleton. The physical damage can be noticed as striations. [[Mooring (watercraft)|Mooring]] causes damage which can be reduced by using mooring [[buoy]]s. Buoys can attach to the seafloor using concrete blocks as weights or by penetrating the seafloor, which further reduces damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jan03/noaa03r402.html|title=Department of Commerce Awards Bronze Medal to Florida Biologist John Halas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Tetiaroa#Future_of_Teti'aroa|reef docks]] can be used to move over goods from large, seagoing vessels to small, flat-bottomed vessels. 

Coral in Taiwan is being threatened by the influx of human population growth. Since 2007, several local environmental groups conducted research and found that much of the coral populations are being affected by untreated sewage, an influx of tourists taking corals for souvenirs, without fully understanding the destructive impact on the coral's ecological system. Researchers reported to the Taiwanese government that many coral populations have turned black in the southeast coast of Taiwan. Potentially, this could lead to loss of food supply, medicinal sources and tourism due to the breakdown of the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, R. (Feb. 6, 2009).

==Threatened species==
The global standard for recording [[threatened species|threatened]] marine species is the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] Red List of Threatened Species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction The 2008 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706005808/http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/introduction |date=July 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This list is the foundation for marine conservation priorities worldwide. A species is listed in the threatened category if it is considered to be [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]], [[Endangered species|endangered]], or [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Other categories are [[near threatened]] and [[data deficient]]. By 2008, the [[IUCN]] had assessed all 845 known reef-building corals species, marking 27% as [[threatened species|Threatened]] 20% as [[near threatened]] and 17% as [[data deficient]].&lt;ref name="IUCN factsheet"&gt;[[IUCN]]: [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/status_of_the_world_s_marine_species.pdf Status of the world's marine species]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Coral Triangle|coral triangle]] (Indo-Malay-Philippine archipelago) region has the highest number of reef-building coral species in threatened category as well as the highest coral species diversity. The loss of coral reef ecosystems will have devastating effects on many marine species, as well as on people that depend on reef resources for their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="IUCN factsheet"/&gt;

Particular environmental pressures include [[surface runoff]], [[salinity]] fluctuations, [[climate change]], cyclic crown-of-thorns outbreaks, [[overfishing]], and spills or improper ballast discharge. According to the 2014 report of the [[Government of Australia]]'s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA), climate change is the most significant environmental threat to the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref name="Outlook"&gt;{{cite web|author1=GBRMPA |title=GBRMPA Outlook Report 2014 |url=http://asp-au.secure-zone.net/v2/index.jsp?id=1342/1518/5784&amp;lng=en |website=Australian Government Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=15 August 2014 |format=PDF |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813000159/http://asp-au.secure-zone.net/v2/index.jsp?id=1342%2F1518%2F5784&amp;lng=en |archivedate=13 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asia===
{{See also|Southeast Asia coral reefs}}
Southeast Asian coral reefs are at risk from damaging [[fishing]] practices (such as [[Cyanide fishing|cyanide]] and [[blast fishing]]), [[overfishing]], sedimentation, pollution and bleaching. Activities including education, regulation and the establishment of [[marine protected area]]s help protect these reefs.

====Indonesia====
[[Indonesia]] is home to one-third of the world's coral reefs, with coral that covers nearly {{convert|85000|km2}} and is home to one-quarter of its fish [[species]]. Indonesia's coral reefs are located in the heart of the [[Coral Triangle]] and have fallen victim to destructive fishing, tourism and bleaching. Data from LIPI in 1998 found that only 7 percent is in excellent condition, 24 percent is in good condition and approximately 69 percent is in poor-to-fair condition. According to one source, Indonesia will lose 70 percent of its coral reef by 2050 if restoration action does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mengenali Sumberdaya Pesisir dan Laut|url=http://ipmawatisusan.blogspot.com/2010/11/mengenali-sumberdaya-pesisir-dan-laut.html|work=Pelajar Progressif|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=Ditulis oleh susan|language=Malay|date=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
In 2007, [[Reef Check]], the world's largest reef [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] organization, stated that only 5% of [[Philippines]] {{convert|27,000|km2}} of coral reef are in "''excellent condition''": [[Tubbataha Reef]], [[Marine Park]] in [[Palawan]], [[Apo Island]] in [[Negros Oriental]], [[Apo Reef]] in [[Puerto Galera]], [[Mindoro]], and [[Verde Island]] Passage off [[Batangas]]. [[Philippine]] [[coral reefs]] is [[Asia]]'s second largest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=93671 Abs-Cbn Interactive, "RP coral reefs, second largest in Asia, in bad shape"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taiwan====
Coral reefs in [[Taiwan]] are being threatened by human population growth. Many corals are affected by untreated sewage and souvenir-hunting tourists, not knowing that this practice destroys habitat and causes disease. Many corals have turned black from disease off Taiwan's southeast coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Caribbean===
It has been estimated that 50% of the [[Caribbean sea]] coral cover has disappeared since the 1960s. According to a [[United Nations Environment Program]] report, the [[Caribbean]] coral reefs might face [[Local extinction|extirpation]] in next 20 years due to population expansion along the coast lines, overfishing, the pollution of coastal areas, global warming, and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caribbean coral reefs may disappear within 20 years: Report |url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/07/caribbean-coral-reefs-may-disappear-within-20-years-report/|work=IANS|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epistemic closure'''&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |author=Luper, Steven |title=The Epistemic Closure Principle |date=31 December 2001 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/#CloPri}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of some [[belief system]]s. It is the [[concept|principle]] that if a subject &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; [[Logical consequence|entails]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can thereby come to know &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Most [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[philosophical theory|theories]] involve a closure principle and many [[Skepticism|skeptical]] [[argument]]s assume a closure principle.

On the other hand, some epistemologists, including [[Robert Nozick]], have denied closure principles on the basis of [[reliabilism|reliabilist]] accounts of knowledge. Nozick, in ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'', advocated that, when considering the [[Gettier problem]], the least counter-intuitive assumption we give up should be epistemic closure. Nozick suggested a "truth tracking" theory of knowledge, in which the x was said to know P if x's belief in P tracked the truth of P through the relevant [[modal logic|modal scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical explanations'',  By Robert Nozick (Harvard 1981), page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

A subject may not actually believe &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, for example, regardless of whether he or she is justified or warranted. Thus, one might instead say that knowledge is closed under ''known'' deduction: if, while knowing &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; entails &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; An even stronger formulation would be as such: If, while knowing various propositions, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that these propositions entail &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; While the principle of epistemic closure is generally regarded as intuitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brady, Michael |author2=Pritchard, Duncan |title=Epistemological Contextualism: Problems and Prospects |journal=[[The Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=55 |issue=219 |pages=161–171 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers such as [[Robert Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske]] have argued against it.

== Epistemic closure and skeptical arguments ==
The epistemic closure principle typically takes the form of a [[modus ponens]] argument:

# S knows p.
# S knows that p entails q.
# Therefore, S knows q.

This epistemic closure principle is central to many versions of skeptical arguments.  A [[Skepticism|skeptical]] argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the [[brain in a vat]] scenario or the [[Evil demon|cartesian evil demon]] scenario.  A skeptic might say, for example, that if you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge that you have hands implies that you know you are not handless, and if you know that you are not handless, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|date=1999-10-01|title=How to Defeat Opposition to Moore|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7/abstract|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=33|pages=141–153|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a [[modus tollens]] argument.  For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following:
# You do not know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (~K(~h))
# If you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (K(o) → K(~h))
# '''Conclusion:''' Therefore, you do not know that you have hands (~K(o))
Much of the epistemological discussion surrounding this type of skeptical argument involves whether to accept or deny the conclusion, and how to do each.  [[Ernest Sosa]] says that there are three possibilities in responding to the skeptic:
# Agree with the skeptic by granting him both premises and the conclusion (1, 2, c)
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 2 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 1 (1, ~2, ~c) as [[Robert Nozick|Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske|Dretske]] do.  This amounts to ''denying'' the epistemic closure principle.
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 1 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 2 (~1, 2, ~c) as [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] does.  This amounts to ''maintaining'' the epistemic closure principle, and holding that knowledge is closed under known [[Logical consequence|implication]].

== Justificatory closure == 
In the seminal 1963 paper, “[[Gettier problem|Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?]]”, Edmund Gettier gave an assumption (later called the “principle of deducibility for justification” by [[Irving Thalberg, Jr.]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thalberg Jr., Irving |title=In Defense of Justified True Belief |journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=66 |issue=22 |pages=794–803 |date=November 1969 |jstor=2024370 |ref={{harvid|Thalberg|1969}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would serve as a basis for the rest of his piece: “for any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P and P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gettier, Edmund |title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–3 |date=June 1963 |jstor=3326922 |doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seized upon by Thalberg, who rejected the principle in order to demonstrate that one of Gettier's examples fails to support Gettier's main thesis that justified true belief is not knowledge (in the following quotation, (1) refers to “Jones will get the job”, (2) refers to “Jones has ten coins”, and (3) is the [[logical conjunction]] of (1) and (2)):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why doesn't Gettier's principle (PDJ) hold in the evidential situation he has described? You multiply your risks of being wrong when you believe a conjunction. […&amp;nbsp;T]he most elementary theory of probability indicates that Smith's prospects of being right on both (1) and (2), namely, of being right on (3), are bound to be less favorable than his prospects of being right on either (1) or (2). In fact, Smith's chances of being right on (3) might not come up to the minimum standard of justification which (1) and (2) barely satisfy, and Smith would be unjustified in accepting (3). {{harv|Thalberg|1969|p=798}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Epistemic closure in U.S. political discussion ==
The term "epistemic closure" has been used in U.S. political debate to refer to the claim that political belief systems can be closed systems of deduction, unaffected by [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Epistemic Closure’? Those are Fighting Words |author=Patricia Cohen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/books/28conserv.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term was popularized by libertarian blogger and commentator [[Julian Sanchez (writer)|Julian Sanchez]] in 2010 as an extreme form of [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sanchez, Julian |title=Frum, Cocktail Parties, and the Threat of Doubt |date=26 March 2010 |url=http://www.juliansanchez.com/2010/03/26/frum-cocktail-parties-and-the-threat-of-doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], the '''affinely extended real number system''' is obtained from the [[real number]] system {{math|ℝ}} by adding two elements: {{math|+&amp;#8239;∞}} and {{math|–&amp;#8239;∞}} (read as '''positive [[infinity]]''' and '''negative infinity''' respectively). These new elements are not real numbers. It is useful in describing various [[limit of a function|limiting behavior]]s in [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis]], especially in the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] and [[integral|integration]]. The affinely extended real number system is denoted &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--{{math|{{overset|—|ℝ}}}}--&gt; or {{math|[–∞, +∞]}} or {{math|ℝ ∪ {–∞, +∞}|}}.

When the meaning is clear from context, the symbol {{math|+∞}} is often written simply as {{math|∞}}.

==Motivation==
===Limits===

We often wish to describe the behavior of a function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, as either the argument &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or the function value &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; gets "very big" in some sense. For example, consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^{-2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The graph of this function has a horizontal [[asymptote]] at y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Geometrically, as we move farther and farther to the right along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the value of &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0. This limiting behavior is similar to the [[limit of a function]] at a [[real number]], except that there is no real number to which &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches.

By adjoining the elements &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we allow a formulation of a "limit at infinity" with [[topology|topological]] properties similar to those for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

To make things completely formal, the [[Construction of the real numbers#Construction from Cauchy sequences|Cauchy sequences definition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; allows us to define &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all sequences of rationals which, for any &lt;math&gt;K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, from some point on exceed &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. We can define &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; similarly.

===Measure and integration===

In [[measure theory]], it is often useful to allow sets that have infinite measure and integrals whose value may be infinite.

Such measures arise naturally out of calculus. For example, in assigning a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; that agrees with the usual length of intervals, this measure must be larger than any finite real number. Also, when considering [[improper integral]]s, such as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty}\frac{dx}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

the value "infinity" arises. Finally, it is often useful to consider the limit of a sequence of functions, such as      

:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 2n(1-nx), &amp; \mbox{if } 0 \le x \le \frac{1}{n} \\ 0, &amp; \mbox{if } \frac{1}{n} &lt; x \le 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; 

Without allowing functions to take on infinite values, such essential results as the [[monotone convergence theorem]] and the [[dominated convergence theorem]] would not make sense.

==Order and topological properties==

The affinely extended real number system turns into a [[totally ordered set]] by defining &lt;math&gt;-\infty\leq a \leq +\infty&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. This order has the desirable property that every subset has a [[supremum]] and an [[infimum]]: it is a [[complete lattice]].

This induces the [[order topology]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt;. In this topology, a set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it contains a set &lt;math&gt;\{x : x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt; for some real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and analogously for the neighborhoods of &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]] [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[unit interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the topology is [[metrizable]], corresponding (for a given homeomorphism) to the ordinary metric on this interval. There is no metric that is an extension of the ordinary metric on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

With this topology the specially defined [[Limit of a function|limits]] for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; tending to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, and the specially defined concepts of limits equal to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, reduce to the general topological definitions of limits.

==Arithmetic operations==

The arithmetic operations of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; can be partially extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + \infty = +\infty + a &amp; = +\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq -\infty \\
a - \infty = -\infty + a &amp; = -\infty, &amp; a &amp; \neq +\infty \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty] \\
a \cdot (\pm\infty) = \pm\infty \cdot a &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in [-\infty, 0) \\
\frac{a}{\pm\infty} &amp; = 0, &amp; a &amp; \in \mathbb{R} \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \pm\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (0, +\infty) \\
\frac{\pm\infty}{a} &amp; = \mp\infty, &amp; a &amp; \in (-\infty, 0)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

For exponentiation, see [[Exponentiation#Limits of powers]].
Here, "&lt;math&gt;a + \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a + (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and "&lt;math&gt;a - (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;", while "&lt;math&gt;a - \infty&lt;/math&gt;" means both "&lt;math&gt;a - (+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;" and {{nowrap|"&lt;math&gt;a + (-\infty)&lt;/math&gt;".}}

The expressions &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty, 0 \times (\pm\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pm\infty/\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; (called [[indeterminate form]]s) are usually left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]]. These rules are modeled on the laws for [[Limit_of_a_function#Limits_involving_infinity|infinite limits]]. However, in the context of probability or measure theory, &lt;math&gt;0 \times \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; is often defined as &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The expression &lt;math&gt;1/0&lt;/math&gt; is not defined either as &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, because although it is true that whenever &lt;math&gt;f(x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; it must be the case that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is eventually contained in every [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{-\infty, +\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, it is ''not'' true that &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must tend to one of these points. An example is &lt;math&gt;g(x) = 1/\sin (1/x)&lt;/math&gt; which is of the form &lt;math&gt;1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; but does not tend to either &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\sin (1/x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{\sin (1/x)} = 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 1/\pi}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist because &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^+}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to {1/\pi}^-}{{1} \over {\sin (1/x)}} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. (The [[absolute value|modulus]] &lt;math&gt;|1/f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;, nevertheless, does approach &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

==Algebraic properties==

With these definitions &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is '''not''' even a [[semigroup]], let alone a [[group (mathematics)|group]], a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] or a [[field (mathematics)|field]], like &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is one. However, it still has several convenient properties:
* &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a + b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined.
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt; are either equal or both undefined
* &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)&lt;/math&gt; are equal if both are defined.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a + c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b + c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a + c \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and if both &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt; are defined, then &lt;math&gt;a \cdot c \leq b \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, all laws of arithmetic are valid in &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; as long as all occurring expressions are defined.

==Miscellaneous==

Several [[function (mathematics)|functions]] can be [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; by taking limits. For instance, one defines &lt;math&gt;\exp(-\infty) = 0, \exp(+\infty) = +\infty, \ln(0) = -\infty, \ln(+\infty) = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; etc.

Some [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularities]] may additionally be removed. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;1/x^2&lt;/math&gt; can be continuously extended to &lt;math&gt;\overline\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; (under ''some'' definitions of continuity) by setting the value to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; can ''not'' be continuously extended because the function approaches &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 0 from below, and &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; from above.

Compare the [[projectively extended real line]], which does not distinguish between &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, on one hand a function may have limit &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line, while in the affinely extended real number system only the absolute value of the function has a limit, e.g. in the case of the function &lt;math&gt;1/x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
correspond on the projectively extended real line to only a limit from the right and one from the left, respectively, with the full limit only existing when the two are equal. Thus  &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\arctan(x)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be made continuous at &lt;math&gt;x = \infty&lt;/math&gt; on the projectively extended real line.

__NOTOC__
'''Extension neglect'''{{efn|The concept of ''extensionality'' is used throughout Kahneman and Tversky's research as synonymous of ''extent'' (range, size) of the set. It should not be confused with [[Kenneth Arrow|Arrow]]'s concept of ''extensionality'', which in Kahneman and Tversky's work is called ''invariance''.}} is a type of [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when the mind tends to ignore the size of the set during an evaluation in which the size of the set is logically relevant.&lt;ref name=Kahneman2000&gt;{{harvnb|Kahneman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extension neglect is described as being caused by [[judgment by prototype]], of which the [[representativeness heuristic]] is a special case.

Forms of extension neglect include:

* [[base rate neglect]]
* [[insensitivity to sample size]]
* [[scope neglect]]
*[[duration neglect]]
** the [[peak-end rule]]
* the [[conjunction fallacy]]
* the [[less-is-better effect]]

The extension effect is "neither universal nor absolute". If attention is drawn to set size in an easily interpretable way, an '''additive extension effect''' is reported, according to which the valuation of a set is a function of the valuation of a prototypical member of the set ''added'' to set size, rather than ''multiplied''.&lt;ref name=Kahneman2000 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20620">The '''Faurisson affair''' was an academic controversy in the wake of a book by French scholar [[Robert Faurisson]], a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]]. The scandal largely dealt with the inclusion of an essay by American linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], entitled "Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression", as an introduction to Faurisson's book, without Chomsky's knowledge or approval. Responding to a request for comment in a climate of attacks on Faurisson, Chomsky defended Faurisson's right to express and publish his opinions on the grounds that [[freedom of speech]] must be extended to all viewpoints, no matter how unpopular or fallacious.

His defense was the target of subsequent accusations by various academics and groups. The accusers claimed that his defense went beyond free speech arguments, and that it included a defense of Faurisson's work, and in general they sought to discredit Chomsky by claiming that there was a deeper philosophical and political association between him and Faurisson.

On several occasions, Robert Faurisson has been convicted under French law for his speech. For instance, on October 3, 2006, he was sentenced to a three-month suspended sentence by the Paris correctional court, for denying the Holocaust on an Iranian TV channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peine avec sursis pour Faurisson|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/010162345-peine-avec-sursis-pour-faurisson|publisher=Libération|accessdate=9 June 2010|date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faurisson affair greatly damaged Chomsky's reputation in France, a country he did not visit for almost thirty years following the affair, and where translation of his political writings was delayed until the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Birnbaum|first=Jean | title=Chomsky à Paris : chronique d'un malentendu

==Faurisson's letters to ''Le Monde''==
In December 1978 and January 1979, Robert Faurisson, a [[France|French]] [[professor]] of literature at the [[University of Lyon]], published two letters in ''[[Le Monde]]'' claiming that the [[gas chambers]] used by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] to exterminate the [[Jew]]s did not exist.

As a result of a [[television|TV]] [[interview]], he was found guilty of [[defamation]] and [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]] and given a suspended 3-month [[prison]] term, and a 21,000-franc (€3,200) fine. In addition he was ordered to pay for the reproduction of the judgement in national [[newspaper]]s and television. This latter requirement was dropped after he appealed.

==Petition signed by Chomsky==
In the fall of 1979, American scholar [[Noam Chomsky]] contributed his name to a petition—signed by roughly 600 people, including [[Serge Thion]], [[Arthur Butz]], [[John Tuson Bennett]] and [[Mark Weber (historian)|Mark Weber]]—concerning the affair:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. Robert Faurisson has served as a respected professor of twentieth-century French literature and document criticism for over four years at the University of Lyon-2 in France. Since 1974 he has been conducting extensive historical research into the "Holocaust" question.&lt;br/&gt;
Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to a vicious campaign of harassment, intimidation, slander and physical violence in a crude attempt to silence him. Fearful officials have even tried to stop him from further research by denying him access to public libraries and archives.&lt;br /&gt;
We strongly protest these efforts to deprive Professor Faurisson of his freedom of speech and expression, and we condemn the shameful campaign to silence him.&lt;br /&gt;
We strongly support Professor Faurisson's just right of academic freedom and we demand that university and government officials do everything possible to ensure his safety and the free exercise of his legal rights.&lt;ref name="VidalB"&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet|Vidal-Naquet, Peirre]] (1992). [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet81b/ "On Faurisson and Chomsky], ''Assassins of Memory'', [[Columbia University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of French intellectuals criticized Chomsky's signing of the petition, describing the extent of Faurisson's Holocaust denial and his ties to neo-Nazi groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fresco|first=Nadine|title=The Denial of the Dead  On the Faurisson Affair|url=http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/Fresco81|publisher=anti-rev.org|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] criticized the wording of the petition as "scandalous", saying that it implied Faurisson was a serious researcher and not a forgery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is scandalous about the petition is that it never raises the question of whether what Faurisson is saying is true or false, that it even presents his conclusions or "findings" as the result of a historical investigation, one, that is, in quest of the truth. To be sure, it may be argued that every man has a right to lies and falsehood, and that individual freedom entails that right, which is accorded, in the French liberal tradition, to the accused for his defence. But the right that the forger demands should not be conceded to him in the name of truth.''&lt;ref name="VidalA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vidal-Naquet|first=Pierre|title=A Paper Eichmann (1980) - Anatomy of a Lie (10. Living With Faurisson?)|url=http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet92a/part-10.html|publisher=anti-rev.org|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vidal-Naquet said that Faurisson was not barred from access to public libraries or archives, and the only archive to ban him was the private [[Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine]] (Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation) in Paris, which Vidal-Naquet sees as entirely consistent with its declared mission, "the fact that the staff of the Centre de Documentation Juive Contemporaine, challenged in its fundamental activity, that of the memory of the crime, should --after years of forbearance-- refuse to serve Faurisson seems perfectly normal to me".&lt;ref name="VidalB"/&gt;

==Preface to ''Mémoire en defense''==
Chomsky subsequently wrote an essay entitled ''Some Elementary Comments on the Rights of Freedom of Expression'', in which he attacked his critics for failing to respect the principle of freedom of speech. Chomsky wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me add a final remark about Faurisson's alleged "anti-Semitism." Note first that even if Faurisson were to be a rabid anti-Semite and fanatic pro-Nazi -- such charges have been presented to me in private correspondence that it would be improper to cite in detail here -- this would have no bearing whatsoever on the legitimacy of the defense of his civil rights. On the contrary, it would make it all the more imperative to defend them since, once again, it has been a truism for years, indeed centuries, that it is precisely in the case of horrendous ideas that the right of free expression must be most vigorously defended; it is easy enough to defend free expression for those who require no such defense. Putting this central issue aside, is it true that Faurisson is an anti-Semite or a neo-Nazi? As noted earlier, I do not know his work very well. But from what I have read -- largely as a result of the nature of the attacks on him -- I find no evidence to support either conclusion. Nor do I find credible evidence in the material that I have read concerning him, either in the public record or in private correspondence. As far as I can determine, he is a relatively apolitical liberal of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Some Elementary Comments on The Rights of Freedom of Expression |url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19801011.htm|publisher=The Noam Chomsky Website|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky granted permission for the essay to be used for any purpose. [[Serge Thion]] and [[Pierre Guillaume]] then used it as a preface when publishing a book by Faurisson, without Chomsky's knowledge.&lt;ref name="manconsent"&gt;Mark Achbar &amp; Peter Wintonick. ''Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media''. Zeitgeist Films, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Chomsky requested that the essay not be used in this manner, since he believed the French intellectual community was so incapable of understanding freedom of speech that it would only confuse them further, but his request came too late for the book to be changed.&lt;ref name="manconsent" /&gt; Chomsky subsequently said that asking for the preface to be removed is his one regret in the matter.&lt;ref name="manconsent" /&gt;

Chomsky's essay sparked an even greater controversy. Critics such as [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] attacked him not for defending the principle of freedom of speech, but for allegedly defending Faurisson personally against charges of anti-Semitism and upholding his work as historical inquiry:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The simple truth, Noam Chomsky, is that you were unable to abide by the ethical maxim you had imposed. You had the right to say: my worst enemy has the right to be free, on condition that he not ask for my death or that of my brothers. You did not have the right to say: my worst enemy is a comrade, or a "relatively apolitical sort of liberal." You did not have the right to take a falsifier of history and to recast him in the colors of truth.&lt;ref name="VidalB" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vidal-Naquet offered the following argument to substantiate his characterisation of Faurisson as an antisemite:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I shall simply say: Faurisson's personal anti-Semitism, in fact, interests me rather little. It exists and I can testify to it, but it is nothing compared with the anti- Semitism of his texts. Is it anti-Semitic to write with consummate calm that in requiring Jews to wear the yellow star starting at the age of six "Hitler was perhaps less concerned with the Jewish question than with ensuring the safety of German soldiers"? Certainly not, within Faurisson's logic, since in the final analysis there is no practical anti-Semitism possible. But within Chomsky's logic? Is the invention of an imaginary declaration of war against Hitler, in the name of the international Jewish community, by an imaginary president of the World Jewish Congress, a case of anti-Semitism or of deliberate falsification?&lt;ref name="VidalB" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Goldsmith (linguist)|John Goldsmith]] writes that "Unsympathetic critics used it as an opportunity to brand Chomsky with anti-Semitic labels, but even critics potentially sympathetic to Chomsky's political views felt his remarks showed lack of judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=John|title=Review of Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, by Robert Barsky|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/goldsmith/barsky.htm|publisher=The University of Chicago|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics held that Faurisson's statements were the archetype of anti-Semitism, and that the logical conclusion of Chomsky's statement would be that Nazism was not anti-Semitic. The main argument for this is that Holocaust deniers are not interested in truth, but "motivated by racism, extremism, and virulent anti-Semitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=E. Lipstadt|first=Deborah|title=Deniers, Relativists and Pseudo-Scholarship|url=http://www.adl.org/braun/dim_14_1_deniers.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League's Braun Holocaust Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chomsky's response==

In a response to a letter circa 1989–1991, Chomsky stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A professor of French literature was suspended from teaching on grounds that he could not be protected from violence, after privately printing pamphlets questioning the existence of gas chambers. He was then brought to trial for "falsification of History," and later condemned for this crime, the first time that a modern Western state openly affirmed the Stalinist-Nazi doctrine that the state will determine historical truth and punish deviation from it. Later he was beaten practically to death by Jewish terrorists. As of now, the European and other intellectuals have not expressed any opposition to these scandals; rather, they have sought to disguise their profound commitment to Stalinist-Nazi doctrine by following the same models, trying to divert attention with a flood of outrageous lies.&lt;ref name="ChomskyW"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=The Faurisson Affair - Noam Chomsky writes to Lawrence K. Kolodney|url=http://www.chomsky.info/letters/1989----.htm|publisher=The Noam Chomsky Website|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "His Right to Say It", published in ''[[The Nation]]'', Chomsky stressed the conceptual distinction between ''endorsing'' someone's view and ''defending'' his right to say it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Vidal-Naquet misunderstood a sentence in the petition that ran, "Since he began making his findings public, Professor Faurisson has been subject to...." The term "findings" is quite neutral. One can say, without contradiction: "He made his findings public and they were judged worthless, irrelevant, falsified...." The petition implied nothing about quality of Faurisson's work, which was irrelevant to the issues raised. [...]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I made it explicit that I would not discuss Faurisson's work, having only limited familiarity with it (and, frankly, little interest in it). Rather, I restricted myself to the civil-liberties issues and the implications of the fact that it was even necessary to recall Voltaire's famous words in a letter to M. le Riche: "I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write." [...] Many writers find it scandalous that I should support the right of free expression for Faurisson without carefully analyzing his work, a strange doctrine which, if adopted, would effectively block defense of civil rights for unpopular views. [...]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It seems to me something of a scandal that it is even necessary to debate these issues two centuries after Voltaire defended the right of free expression for views he detested. It is a poor service to the memory of the victims of the holocaust to adopt a central doctrine of their murderers.&lt;ref name="Right"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=His Right to Say It|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/19810228.htm|publisher=The Noam Chomsky Website|accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chomsky's biographers on the Faurisson affair==

Chomsky's biographers have expressed a range of views on the Faurisson affair. In ''Chomsky: Ideas and ideals'', Neil Smith writes: 'Chomsky should perhaps have foreseen the negative effect of his activity and refrained from writing the way he did. Perhaps, but on balance perhaps not. Even had he seen the furore which would erupt and the degree that would ensue, the moral doctrine of defending freedom of speech is probably higher.'&lt;ref&gt;Neil Smith (1999). ''Chomsky: Ideas and ideals''. Cambridge University Press. p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent'', Robert Barsky says 'Chomsky's tactics may not always be the most appropriate in light of the causes that he supports but the values transmitted by his work are, according to virtually any reasonable measure, consistent with those of the libertarians.' Barsky also points out that although the Faurisson affair 'has had a harmful and lasting effect on Chomsky … Chomsky has refused to back down on the issue, even refusing to admit a momentary lack of judgment.'&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barsky, (1997). ''Noam Chomsky: A life of dissent''. MIT Press. pp. 183-5. See also: Robert Barsky (2007). ''The Chomsky Effect: A radical works beyond the ivory tower''. MIT Press. Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other biographers, Milan Rai and Chris Knight, both refer to the Faurisson affair in the context of Chomsky's uncompromising support for academic freedom for everyone including 'war criminals'. In ''Chomsky's Politics'', Milan Rai quotes Chomsky saying that he even 'supported the rights of American war criminals not only to speak and teach but also to conduct their research, on grounds of academic freedom, at a time when their work was being used to murder and destroy.'&lt;ref&gt;Rai, M. 1995. ''Chomsky’s Politics''. London and New York: Verso., p. 130-1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Decoding Chomsky'', Chris Knight refers to Chomsky's 1969 threat to 'protest publicly' if fellow MIT academic, Walt Rostow, was denied a position at the university. Chomsky certainly saw Rostow, a prime architect of the Vietnam War, as a 'war criminal'. Yet he insisted that MIT must stick to its principles of academic freedom - principles expressed when MIT's President Johnson stated that the university should be a 'refuge from the censor, where any individual can pursue truth as he sees it, without any interference.'&lt;ref&gt;Chris Knight (2016). ''Decoding Chomsky; Science and revolutionary politics''. Yale University Press. pp. 38-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Johnson's motivation for talking about academic freedom at this time of anti-war student unrest was largely to prevent any interference with MIT's various military-funded research laboratories. But, Knight claims, Chomsky also felt he had to extend the principle of academic freedom to unusual lengths because any 'less libertarian policy might have undermined his own conflicted position as an anti-war campaigner working in a laboratory funded by the US military.' Knight concludes that Chomsky's subsequent position on Faurisson 'did not imply any sympathy towards Holocaust denial. It was simply a logical extension of a principle common to all Western universities – one which his management at MIT felt obliged to uphold with special tenacity in view of what its own researchers were doing.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chomsky at MIT: Between the war scientists and the anti-war students|url=https://libcom.org/history/chomsky-mit-between-war-scientists-anti-war-students-chris-knight|author=Chris Knight |}}; Knight 2016, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Figure–ground organization''' is a type of perceptual grouping which is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In [[Gestalt psychology]] it is known as identifying a ''figure'' from the back''ground''. For example, you see words on a printed paper as the "figure" and the white sheet as the "background".&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive." Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the [[Rubin vase|faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (1921) ''Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse''. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), ''Visual Perception''. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). "Psychology (2nd ed.)." New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744–753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual process==
How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Peterson, MA|title=A Bayesian observer replicates convexity context effects in figure–ground perception.|journal=Seeing and perceiving|year=2012|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=365–95|pmid=22564398|doi=10.1163/187847612X634445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=L|author2=Lee, L|title=Perceptual information processing system.|journal=USPatent Patent Application 10/618,543,|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic applications==
Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional [[visual design]] technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.&lt;ref name="figure and ground"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R |title=Psychology the science of behaviour-figure and ground |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=USA |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of figure–ground problems==
[[File:Star-jeans.jpg|thumb|Type 2: The actual ground is the figure.]]
There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohr L. Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance: Lessons in Visual Literacy Cleveland, OH: Prentice-Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Flajolet–Martin algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] for approximating the number of distinct elements in a stream with a single pass and space-consumption logarithmic in the maximal number of possible distinct elements in the stream (the [[count-distinct problem]]). The algorithm was introduced by [[Philippe Flajolet]] and [[G. Nigel Martin]] in their 1984 article "Probabilistic Counting Algorithms for Data Base Applications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0000(85)90041-8 |title=Probabilistic counting algorithms for data base applications |journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=182&amp;ndash;209 |year=1985 |last1=Flajolet |first1=Philippe |last2=Martin |first2=G. Nigel |url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlMa85.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it has been refined in "LogLog counting of large cardinalities" by [[Marianne Durand]] and [[Philippe Flajolet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-39658-1_55 |chapter=Loglog Counting of Large Cardinalities |chapter-url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/DuFl03-LNCS.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11 |title= Algorithms - ESA 2003 |volume=2832 |pages=605 |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2003 |last1=Durand |first1=Marianne |last2=Flajolet |first2=Philippe |isbn=978-3-540-20064-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[HyperLogLog]]: The analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm" by [[Philippe Flajolet]] et al.&lt;ref name="flajolet07"&gt;{{cite journal |citeseerx=10.1.1.76.4286 |first1=Philippe |last1=Flajolet |first2=Éric |last2=Fusy |first3=Olivier |last3=Gandouet |first4=Frédéric |last4=Meunier |title=Hyperloglog: The analysis of a near-optimal cardinality estimation algorithm |url=http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf  |accessdate=2016-12-11 |year=2007 |volume=AH |pages=127–146 |journal=Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science proceedings |location=[[Nancy, France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2010 article "An optimal algorithm for the distinct elements problem",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1145/1807085.1807094 |chapter=An optimal algorithm for the distinct elements problem|chapter-url=http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-dpwoodru/knw11.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-11 |title=Proceedings of the twenty-ninth ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART symposium on Principles of database systems of data - PODS '10 |page=41 |year=2010 |last1=Kane |first1=Daniel M. |last2=Nelson |first2=Jelani |last3=Woodruff |first3=David P. |isbn=978-1-4503-0033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel M. Kane, Jelani Nelson and David P. Woodruff give an improved algorithm, which uses nearly optimal space and has optimal ''O''(1) update and reporting times.

==The algorithm==
Assume that we are given a [[hash function]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{hash}(x)&lt;/math&gt; that maps input &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to integers in the range &lt;math&gt;[0; 2^L - 1]&lt;/math&gt;, and where the outputs are sufficiently [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]]. Note that the set of integers from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2^L - 1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the set of binary strings of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. For any non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, define &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{bit}(y,k)&lt;/math&gt; to be the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th bit in the binary representation of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;
y = \sum_{k \geq 0} \mathrm{bit}(y,k) 2^k.
&lt;/math&gt;

We then define a function &lt;math&gt;\rho(y)&lt;/math&gt; that outputs the position of the least-significant set bit in the binary representation of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(y) = \min \{k \geq 0 \mid \mathrm{bit}(y,k) \neq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho(0) = L&lt;/math&gt;. Note that with the above definition we are using 0-indexing for the positions. For example, &lt;math&gt;\rho(13) = \rho(1101_{2}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, since the least significant bit is a 1 (0th position), and &lt;math&gt;\rho(8) = \rho(1000_{2}) = 3&lt;/math&gt;, since the least significant bit is at the 3rd position. At this point, note that under the assumption that the output of our hash function is uniformly distributed, then the probability of observing a hash output ending with &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; (a one, followed by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; zeroes) is &lt;math&gt;2^{-(k+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, since this corresponds to flipping &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; heads and then a tail with a fair coin.

Now the Flajolet–Martin algorithm for estimating the cardinality of a [[multiset]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:
# Initialize a bit-vector BITMAP to be of length &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and contain all 0s.
# For each element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
## Calculate the index &lt;math&gt;i = \rho(\mathrm{hash}(x))&lt;/math&gt;.
## Set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i] = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; denote the smallest index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Estimate the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;2^R / \phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\phi \approx 0.77351&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea is that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of distinct elements in the multiset &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[0]&lt;/math&gt; is accessed approximately &lt;math&gt;n/2&lt;/math&gt; times, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[1]&lt;/math&gt; is accessed approximately &lt;math&gt;n/4&lt;/math&gt; times and so on. Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;i \gg \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is almost certainly 0, and if &lt;math&gt;i \ll \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; is almost certainly 1. If &lt;math&gt;i \approx \log_2 n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{BITMAP}[i]&lt;/math&gt; can be expected to be either 1 or 0.

The correction factor &lt;math&gt;\phi \approx 0.77351&lt;/math&gt; is found by calculations, which can be found in the original article.

==Improving accuracy==
A problem with the Flajolet–Martin algorithm in the above form is that the results vary significantly. A common solution has been to run the algorithm multiple times with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; different hash functions and combine the results from the different runs. One idea is to take the mean of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; results together from each hash function, obtaining a single estimate of the cardinality. The problem with this is that averaging is very susceptible to outliers (which are likely here). A different idea is to use the [[median]], which is less prone to be influences by outliers. The problem with this is that the results can only take form &lt;math&gt;2^R / \phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is integer. A common solution is to combine both the mean and the median: Create &lt;math&gt;k \cdot l&lt;/math&gt; hash functions and split them into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; distinct groups (each of size &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;). Within each group use the median for aggregating together the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; results, and finally take the mean of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; group estimates as the final estimate.

The 2007 [[HyperLogLog]] algorithm splits the multiset into subsets and estimates their cardinalities, then it uses the [[harmonic mean]] to combine them into an estimate for the original cardinality.&lt;ref name="flajolet07"/&gt;

[[File:Abm2.jpg|thumb|300px|A photo showing a boy jumping into a body of water. It is widely believed that humans make decisions (e.g. jumping in the water) based on free will.]]

'''Free will''' is the ability to [[Choice|choose]] between different possible courses of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] unimpeded.&lt;ref&gt;Omoregie, J. (2015).
 Freewill: The degree of freedom within. UK: Author House | {{ISBN|9781504987516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hegeler, Edward C. (1910). ''The Monist'', Vol. 20. Open Court. p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free will is closely linked to the concepts of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], [[praise]], [[Culpability|guilt]], [[sin]], and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/area.12339|title = Demonic geographies| journal=Area| volume=49| issue=4| pages=503–509|year = 2017|last1 = Simandan|first1 = Dragos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Monroe, A.E., 2014.

Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also connected with the concepts of [[Advice (opinion)|advice]], [[persuasion]], [[deliberation]], and [[Prohibitionism|prohibition]]. Traditionally, only actions that are freely [[Will (philosophy)|will]]ed are seen as deserving credit or blame. There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.

Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events. [[Determinism]] suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with the existence of free will thus conceived.&lt;ref name="Baumeister, R.F 2014. pp. 1-52"/&gt; This problem has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism /&gt; and remains a major focus of philosophical debate. This view that conceives free will to be incompatible with determinism is called ''[[incompatibilism]]'' and encompasses both [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarianism]], the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible, and [[hard determinism]], the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible. It also encompasses [[hard incompatibilism]], which holds not only determinism but also its negation to be incompatible with free will and thus free will to be impossible whatever the case may be regarding determinism.

In contrast, ''[[compatibilism|compatibilists]]'' hold that free will ''is'' compatible with determinism. Some compatibilists even hold that determinism is ''necessary'' for free will, arguing that choice involves preference for one course of action over another, requiring a sense of ''how'' choices will turn out.&lt;ref name=Carnap&gt;An argument by [[Rudolph Carnap]] described by: {{cite book |title=Research In Psychology: Methods and Design |author=C.

Classical compatibilists considered free will nothing more than freedom of action, considering one free of will simply if, ''had'' one counterfactually wanted to do otherwise, one ''could'' have done otherwise without physical impediment. Contemporary compatibilists instead identify free will as a psychological capacity, such as to direct one's behavior in a way responsive to reason, and there are still further different conceptions of free will, each with their own concerns, sharing only the common feature of not finding the possibility of determinism a threat to the possibility of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/compatibilism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Michael|last1=McKenna|first2=D.

The underlying questions are whether we have control over our actions, and if so, what sort of control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek [[Stoicism|stoics]] (for example, [[Chrysippus]]), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these centuries.&lt;ref name=Nagel&gt;

It is difficult to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with the view that the physical world can be explained to operate perfectly by [[physical law]].&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=2–29 |author=Max Velmans |title=How Could Conscious Experiences Affect Brains? |url=http://cogprints.org/2750/ |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either [[causal closure]] or [[physical determinism]] ([[nomological determinism]]) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).

The puzzle of reconciling 'free will' with a deterministic universe is known as the ''problem of free will'' or sometimes referred to as the ''dilemma of determinism''.&lt;ref name=WJames&gt;{{cite book |title=The Will to believe, and other essays in popular philosophy |author=William James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2Tw28d-85wC&amp;pg=PA145 |pages=145 ''ff'' |chapter=The dilemma of determinism |publisher=Longmans, Green |year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma leads to a [[morality|moral]] dilemma as well: the question of how to assign [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] for actions if they are caused entirely by past events.&lt;ref name=Bargh&gt;

A different approach to the dilemma is that of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], namely, that if the world is deterministic, then our feeling that we are free to choose an action is simply an [[hard determinism|illusion]]. [[Metaphysical libertarianism]] is the form of incompatibilism which posits that [[determinism]] is false and free will is possible (at least some people have free will).&lt;ref name="stanfordcompatibilism" /&gt; This view is associated with [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|non-materialist]] constructions,&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; including both traditional [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance or Cartesian dualism|dualism]], as well as models supporting more minimal criteria; such as the ability to consciously veto an action or competing desire.&lt;ref name="Libet 2003"&gt;Libet, (2003). "Can Conscious Experience affect brain Activity?", ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, nr. 12, pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt; Yet even with [[indeterminism|physical indeterminism]], arguments have been made against libertarianism in that it is difficult to assign ''Origination'' (responsibility for "free" indeterministic choices).

Free will here is predominately treated with respect to [[physical determinism]] in the strict sense of [[nomological determinism]], although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments /&gt; For example, logical and [[theological determinism|theological]] determinism challenge metaphysical libertarianism with ideas of [[destiny]] and [[fate]], and [[biological determinism|biological]], [[cultural determinism|cultural]] and [[psychological determinism|psychological]] determinism feed the development of compatibilist models. Separate classes of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]] may even be formed to represent these.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Zagzebski |first=Linda |editor=Edward N.

Below are the classic arguments bearing upon the dilemma and its underpinnings.

===Incompatibilism===
{{Main|Incompatibilism}}
Incompatibilism is the position that free will and determinism are logically incompatible, and that the major question regarding whether or not people have free will is thus whether or not their actions are determined. "Hard determinists", such as [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]], are those incompatibilists who accept determinism and reject free will. In contrast, "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|metaphysical libertarians]]", such as [[Thomas Reid]], [[Peter van Inwagen]], and [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], are those incompatibilists who accept free will and deny determinism, holding the view that some form of indeterminism is true.&lt;ref name="Wagen"&gt;van Invagen, P. (1983) ''An Essay on Free Will''. Oxford: [[Clarendon Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-824924-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another view is that of hard incompatibilists, which state that free will is incompatible with both [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]].&lt;ref name="Derk1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Pereboom, D. |year=2003 |title=Living without Free Will |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9sKZ1rAO2BwC&amp;printsec=frontcover |isbn=0521791987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional arguments for incompatibilism are based on an "[[intuition pump]]": if a person is like other mechanical things that are determined in their behavior such as a wind-up toy, a billiard ball, a puppet, or a robot, then people must not have free will.&lt;ref name="Wagen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = J.M. | year = 1983 | title = Incompatibilism | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 121–37 | doi = 10.1007/BF01112527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been rejected by compatibilists such as Daniel Dennett on the grounds that, even if humans have something in common with these things, it remains possible and plausible that we are different from such objects in important ways.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt;

Another argument for incompatibilism is that of the "causal chain". Incompatibilism is key to the idealist theory of free will. Most incompatibilists reject the idea that freedom of action consists simply in "voluntary" behavior. They insist, rather, that free will means that man must be the "ultimate" or "originating" cause of his actions. He must be ''[[causa sui]]'', in the traditional phrase. Being responsible for one's choices is the first cause of those choices, where first cause means that there is no antecedent cause of that cause. The argument, then, is that if man has free will, then man is the ultimate cause of his actions. If determinism is true, then all of man's choices are caused by events and facts outside his control. So, if everything man does is caused by events and facts outside his control, then he cannot be the ultimate cause of his actions. Therefore, he cannot have free will.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, R. (1996) ''The Significance of Free Will'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-512656-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, C. A. (1957) ''On Selfhood and Godhood'', London: George Allen and Unwin. {{ISBN|0-415-29624-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, J. P. (1943) ''Being and Nothingness'', reprint 1993. New York: Washington Square Press. Sartre also provides a psychological version of the argument by claiming that if man's actions are not his own, he would be in ''bad faith''.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has also been challenged by various compatibilist philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, R.M. (1994) ''The Metaphysics of Free Will'', Oxford:Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bok, H. (1998) ''Freedom and Responsibility'', Princeton:Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-01566-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third argument for incompatibilism was formulated by [[Carl Ginet]] in the 1960s and has received much attention in the modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we have no control over the events of the past that determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the ''consequences'' of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the ''consequence argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Ginet, C. (1966) "Might We Have No Choice?" In Lehrer, 1966: 87–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ving"&gt;Van Inwagen, P. and Zimmerman, D. (1998) ''Metaphysics: The Big Questions''. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Peter van Inwagen remarks that C.D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Inwagen, P. (n.d.) [http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc "How to think about free will"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911064556/http://philosophy.nd.edu/people/all/profiles/van-inwagen-peter/documents/HowThinkFW.doc |date=2008-09-11 }}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of this argument for some compatibilists lies in the fact that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its "decider".&lt;ref name="Ving"/&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if ''different circumstances'' had actually obtained in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1755-2567.1981.tb00473.x | last1 = Lewis | first1 = D. | year = 2008| title = Are We Free to Break the Laws? | url = | journal = Theoria | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 113–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''T'', ''F'' for "true" and "false" and ''?'' for undecided, there are exactly nine positions regarding determinism/free will that consist of any two of these three possibilities:&lt;ref name=Strawson&gt;

''Incompatibilism'' may occupy any of the nine positions except (5), (8) or (3), which last corresponds to ''soft determinism''. Position (1) is ''hard determinism'', and position (2) is ''libertarianism''. The position (1) of hard determinism adds to the table the contention that ''D'' implies ''FW'' is untrue, and the position (2) of libertarianism adds the contention that ''FW'' implies ''D'' is untrue. Position (9) may be called ''hard incompatibilism'' if one interprets ''?'' as meaning both concepts are of dubious value. ''Compatibilism'' itself may occupy any of the nine positions, that is, there is no logical contradiction between determinism and free will, and either or both may be true or false in principle. However, the most common meaning attached to ''compatibilism'' is that some form of determinism is true and yet we have some form of free will, position (3).&lt;ref name=FischerFour2009&gt;{{cite book |pages=44 ''ff'' |author= Fischer, John Martin |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |isbn=1405134860 |year=2009 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |chapter=Chapter 2: Compatibilism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toppledominos.jpg|thumb|A [[domino effect|domino's movement]] is [[Determinism|determined]] completely by laws of physics.]]
[[Alexander Rosenberg|Alex Rosenberg]] makes an extrapolation of physical determinism as inferred on the macroscopic scale by the behaviour of a set of dominoes to neural activity in the brain where; "If the brain is nothing but a complex physical object whose states are as much governed by physical laws as any other physical object, then what goes on in our heads is as fixed and determined by prior events as what goes on when one domino topples another in a long row of them."&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Determinism#Quantum mechanics and classical physics|Physical determinism]] is currently disputed by prominent [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations]] of [[quantum mechanics]], and while not necessarily representative of intrinsic [[indeterminism]] in nature, fundamental limits of precision in measurement are inherent in the [[uncertainty principle]].&lt;ref name="Bohr1"/&gt; The relevance of such prospective indeterminate activity to free will is, however, contested,&lt;ref name="Bohr"/&gt; even when chaos theory is introduced to magnify the effects of such microscopic events.&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1142/S0219635206001112 | last=Lewis | first=E.R. |author2=MacGregor, R.J. | year=2006 | title=On Indeterminism, Chaos, and Small Number Particle Systems in the Brain | journal=[[Journal of Integrative Neuroscience]] | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=223–47 |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~lewis/LewisMacGregor.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hard determinism====
{{main|Hard determinism}}
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy4.svg|thumb|A simplified [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and determinism.]]

Determinism can be divided into causal, logical and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="Parkinson2012"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=G. H. R. Parkinson|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqbJnEYKpW4C|accessdate=26 December 2012|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-00323-0|title=determinism|pages=891–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to each of these different meanings, there arises a different problem for free will.&lt;ref name="Viv"&gt;Vihvelin, Kadri, "Arguments for Incompatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2003 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2003/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt; Hard determinism is the claim that [[determinism]] is true, and that it is [[incompatibilism|incompatible with free will]], so free will does not exist. Although hard determinism generally refers to [[nomological determinism]] (see causal determinism below), it can include all forms of determinism that necessitate the future in its entirety.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt; Relevant forms of determinism include:
;[[Causal determinism]]: The idea that everything is caused by prior conditions, making it impossible for anything else to happen.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility /&gt; In its most common form, [[nomological determinism|nomological (or scientific) determinism]], future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the [[thought experiment]] of [[Laplace's demon]]. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-4975.1993.tb00266.x | last1 = Suppes | first1 = P. | year = 1993 | title = The Transcendental Character of Determinism | url = | journal = Midwest Studies in Philosophy | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 242–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=determinism&gt;
The view of ''scientific determinism'' goes back to [[Pierre Simon Laplace|Laplace]]: "We ought to regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its antecedent state." For further discussion see {{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia. N–Z, Indeks, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA197 |pages= 197 ''ff'' |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2006 |chapter=Determinism |isbn=0415939275 |editors=Sahotra Sarkar, Jessica Pfeifer, Justin Garson |author=John T Roberts}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Logical determinism]]: The notion that all [[proposition]]s, whether about the past, present or future, are either true or false. The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how choices can be free, given that what one does in the future is already determined as true or false in the present.&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt;
;[[Theological determinism]]: The idea that the future is already determined, either by a [[creator deity]] decreeing or [[omniscience|knowing]] its outcome in advance.&lt;ref name = "FischerGod1989"&gt;Fischer, John Martin (1989) ''God, Foreknowledge and Freedom''.

London: Luzac &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of free will, in this context, is the problem of how our actions can be free if there is a being who has determined them for us in advance, or if they are already set in time.

Other forms of determinism are more relevant to compatibilism, such as [[biological determinism]], the idea that all behaviors, beliefs, and desires are fixed by our genetic endowment and our biochemical makeup, the latter of which is affected by both genes and environment, [[cultural determinism]] and [[psychological determinism]].&lt;ref name="Viv"/&gt; Combinations and syntheses of determinist theses, such as bio-environmental determinism, are even more common.

Suggestions have been made that hard determinism need not maintain strict determinism, where something near to, like that informally known as [[determinism|adequate determinism]], is perhaps more relevant.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismarguments&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vihvelin |first=Kadri |editor=Edward N.

====Metaphysical libertarianism====
{{Main|Libertarianism (metaphysics)}}
[[File:FreewillConceptsBasedUponPhilosophyOfMindCausationViews.svg|thumb|Various definitions of free will that have been proposed for Metaphysical Libertarianism (agent/substance causal,&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories/&gt; centered accounts,&lt;ref name="Kane2005" /&gt; and efforts of will theory&lt;ref name="RKane1" /&gt;), along with examples of other common free will positions (Compatibilism,&lt;ref name="Velmans2002"/&gt; Hard Determinism,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and Hard Incompatibilism&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt;). Red circles represent mental states; blue circles represent physical states; arrows describe causal interaction.]]

[[libertarianism (metaphysics)|Metaphysical libertarianism]] is one philosophical view point under that of incompatibilism. Libertarianism holds onto a concept of free will that requires that the [[agency (philosophy)|agent]] be able to take more than one possible course of action under a given set of circumstances.

Accounts of libertarianism subdivide into non-physical theories and physical or naturalistic theories. Non-physical theories hold that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, which requires that the world is not closed under physics. This includes [[interactionist dualism]], which claims that some non-physical [[mind]], will, or [[soul]] overrides physical [[causality]]. Physical determinism implies there is only one possible future and is therefore not compatible with libertarian free will. As consequent of incompatibilism, metaphysical libertarian explanations that do not involve dispensing with [[physicalism]] require physical indeterminism, such as probabilistic subatomic particle behavior&amp;nbsp;– theory unknown to many of the early writers on free will. Incompatibilist theories can be categorised based on the type of indeterminism they require; uncaused events, non-deterministically caused events, and agent/substance-caused events.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Randolph |first=Clarke |editor=Edward N. Zalta | title=Incompatibilist (Nondeterministic) Theories of Free Will | encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy| edition=Fall 2008 | year=2008 | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/incompatibilism-theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-causal theories====
Non-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will do not require a free action to be caused by either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal accounts often claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition&amp;nbsp;– a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm).&lt;ref name=LumerNannini2007&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Lumer|author2=Sandro Nannini|title=Intentionality, Deliberation and Autonomy: The Action-Theoretic Basis of Practical Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LzldxvSk4kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-6058-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCann1998&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh McCann|title=The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7HZT-MrFvwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1998|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8583-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over anything in particular. According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom&amp;nbsp;– intentional actions are rather self-generating. The "actish feel" of some intentional actions do not "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, in the absence of any relevant desire or intention on the part of that person".&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.

Some non-causal explanations involve invoking [[panpsychism]], the theory that a quality of [[mind]] is associated with all particles, and pervades the entire universe, in both animate and inanimate entities.

====Event-causal theories====

Event-causal accounts of incompatibilist free will typically rely upon physicalist models of mind (like those of the compatibilist), yet they presuppose physical indeterminism, in which certain indeterministic events are said to be caused by the agent. A number of event-causal accounts of free will have been created, referenced here as ''deliberative indeterminism'', ''centred accounts'', and ''efforts of will theory''.&lt;ref name=stanfordincompatibilismtheories /&gt; The first two accounts do not require free will to be a fundamental constituent of the universe. Ordinary randomness is appealed to as supplying the "elbow room" that libertarians believe necessary. A first common objection to event-causal accounts is that the indeterminism could be destructive and could therefore diminish control by the agent rather than provide it (related to the problem of origination). A second common objection to these models is that it is questionable whether such indeterminism could add any value to deliberation over that which is already present in a deterministic world.

''Deliberative indeterminism'' asserts that the indeterminism is confined to an earlier stage in the decision process.&lt;ref name=Ekstrom2000&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Waddell Ekstrom|title=Free Will: A Philosophical Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oaOpa7qlz3kC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0-8133-9093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mele2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred R.

The selection process is deterministic, although it may be based on earlier preferences established by the same process. Deliberative indeterminism has been referenced by [[Daniel Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Clement Dennett|title=Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xwObaAZEwoC|accessdate=27 December 2012|date=13 July 1981|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-54037-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Martin Fischer]].&lt;ref name="L.

''Centred accounts'' propose that for any given decision between two possibilities, the strength of reason will be considered for each option, yet there is still a probability the weaker candidate will be chosen.&lt;ref name=Kane2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BRiQgAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514970-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Balaguer1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Balaguer |title=Libertarianism as a Scientifically Reputable View |journal= Philosophical Studies |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=189–211 |year=1999 |doi=10.1023/a:1004218827363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nozick1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Philosophical Explanations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4zH86WogYwC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1981|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-66479-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sorabji1980&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Sorabji|title=Necessity, Cause, and Blame: Perspectives on Aristotle's Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8tmAAAACAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1980|publisher=Duckworth|isbn=978-0-7156-1549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inwagen1983&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Van Inwagen|title=An Essay on Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of1sJaUSdcYC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-824924-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiggins1973&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Honderich|title=Essays on Freedom of Action:Towards a Reasonable Libertarianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qY9AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1973|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7100-7392-1|pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Searle2001&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

''Efforts of will theory'' is related to the role of will power in decision making. It suggests that the indeterminacy of agent volition processes could map to the indeterminacy of certain physical events&amp;nbsp;– and the outcomes of these events could therefore be considered caused by the agent. Models of [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] have been constructed in which it is seen as a particular kind of complex, high-level process with an element of physical indeterminism. An example of this approach is that of [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]], where he hypothesizes that "in each case, the indeterminism is functioning as a hindrance or obstacle to her realizing one of her purposes&amp;nbsp;– a hindrance or obstacle in the form of resistance within her will which must be overcome by effort."&lt;ref name="RKane1"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Four Views on Free Will (Libertarianism)| last=Kane| first=Robert|author2=John Martin Fischer |author3=Derk Pereboom |author4=Manuel Vargas | year=2007| publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford UK| page=39| isbn=1-4051-3486-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Kane such "ultimate responsibility" is a required condition for free will.&lt;ref name="Kane1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Kane|title=The Significance of Free Will|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hhuyeYKsWAkC|accessdate=27 December 2012|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor in such a theory is that the agent cannot be reduced to physical neuronal events, but rather mental processes are said to provide an equally valid account of the determination of outcome as their physical processes (see [[non-reductive physicalism]]).

Although at the time [[quantum mechanics]] (and physical [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminism]]) was only in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [[Miracles (book)|''Miracles: A preliminary study'']] C.S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality.&lt;ref name="CSLewis1"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Lewis, C.S. | title=Miracles | year=1947| page=24| isbn=0-688-17369-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indeterminism|Indeterministic]] physical models (particularly those involving [[quantum indeterminacy]]) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow [[Incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious [[Volition (psychology)|volition]]) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable,&lt;ref name=quantum&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Views on Free Will (Great Debates in Philosophy) |chapter=Libertarianism |author= Kane, Robert|page=9 |quote=It would seem that undetermined events in the brain or body would occur ''spontaneously'' and would be more likely to ''undermine'' our freedom rather than ''enhance'' it. |isbn=1405134860 |year=2007 |publisher= Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the [[neuroscience of free will]]. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality.&lt;ref name=Bohr1&gt;{{cite web |author=Niels Bohr |title= The Atomic Theory and the Fundamental Principles underlying the Description of Nature; ''Based on a lecture to the Scandinavian Meeting of Natural Scientists and published in Danish in Fysisk Tidsskrift in 1929.

It is also required that the agent's causing of that event is not causally determined by prior events. A number of problems have been identified with this view. Firstly, it is difficult to establish the reason for any given choice by the agent, which suggests they may be random or determined by ''luck'' (without an underlying basis for the free will decision). Secondly, it has been questioned whether physical events can be caused by an external substance or mind&amp;nbsp;– a common problem associated with [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|interactionalist dualism]].

====Hard incompatibilism====
Hard incompatibilism is the idea that free will cannot exist, whether the world is deterministic or not. [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] has defended hard incompatibilism, identifying a variety of positions where free will is irrelevant to indeterminism/determinism, among them the following:
:#Determinism (D) is true, D does not imply we lack free will (F), but in fact we do lack F.
:#D is true, D does not imply we lack F, but in fact we don't know if we have F.

::::::Derk Pereboom, ''Living without Free Will'',&lt;ref name="Derk1"/&gt; p. xvi.
Pereboom calls positions 3 and 4 ''soft determinism'', position 1 a form of ''hard determinism'', position 6 a form of ''classical libertarianism'', and any position that includes having F as ''compatibilism''.

[[John Locke]] denied that the phrase "free will" made any sense (compare with [[theological noncognitivism]], a similar stance on the [[existence of God]]). He also took the view that the truth of determinism was irrelevant. He believed that the defining feature of voluntary behavior was that individuals have the ability to ''postpone'' a decision long enough to reflect or deliberate upon the consequences of a choice: "... the will in truth, signifies nothing but a power, or ability, to prefer or choose".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, J. (1689). ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1998, ed). Book II, Chap. XXI, Sec. 17. Penguin Classics, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contemporary philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] agrees with Locke that the truth or falsity of determinism is irrelevant to the
problem.&lt;ref name="GStraw"&gt;Strawson, G. (1998, 2004). "Free will". In E. Craig (ed.), ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. London: Routledge. Retrieved August 17, 2006, [http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 ((online))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825055350/http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014 |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the notion of free will leads to an infinite regress and is therefore senseless.
According to Strawson, if one is responsible for what one does in a given situation, then one must be responsible for the way one is in certain mental respects. But it is impossible for one to be responsible for the way one is in any respect. This is because to be responsible in some situation ''S'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''. To be responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'', one must have been responsible for the way one was at ''S&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and so on. At some point in the chain, there must have been an act of origination of a new causal chain. But this is impossible. Man cannot create himself or his mental states ''[[ex nihilo]]''. This argument entails that free will itself is absurd, but not that it is incompatible with determinism. Strawson calls his own view "pessimism" but it can be classified as [[hard incompatibilism]].&lt;ref name="GStraw"/&gt;

=====High-level determinism and free will=====
======Causal determinism======
{{Main|Determinism}}

Causal determinism is the concept that [[Event (philosophy)|events]] within a given [[paradigm]] are bound by [[causality]] in such a way that any state (of an object or event) is completely determined by prior states. Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. Causal determinists believe that there is nothing uncaused or [[Causa sui|self-caused]]. The most common form of causal determinism is nomological determinism (or scientific determinism), the notion that the past and the present dictate the future entirely and necessarily by rigid natural laws, that every occurrence results inevitably from prior events. [[Quantum mechanics]] poses a serious challenge to this view.

Fundamental debate continues over whether the physical universe is likely to be [[causal determinism|deterministic]]. Although the scientific method cannot be used to rule out [[indeterminism]] with respect to violations of [[causal closure]], it can be used to identify indeterminism in natural law. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] at present are both [[deterministic system|deterministic]] and [[indeterminism|indeterministic]], and are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.&lt;ref name=GroblacherPaterek2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groblacher|first1=Simon|last2=Paterek|first2=Tomasz|last3=Kaltenbaek|first3=Rainer|last4=Brukner|first4=Caslav|last5=Zukowski|first5=Marek|last6=Aspelmeyer|first6=Markus|last7=Zeilinger|first7=Anton|title=An experimental test of non-local realism|journal=Nature|volume=446|issue=7138|year=2007|pages=871–75|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/nature05677|pmid=17443179|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.2529|arxiv=0704.2529|bibcode=2007Natur.446..871G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Destiny and fate======
{{Main|Destiny}}

Destiny or fate is a predetermined course of events. It may be conceived as a predetermined future, whether in general or of an individual. It is a concept based on the belief that there is a fixed natural order to the cosmos.

Although often used interchangeably, the words "fate" and "destiny" have distinct connotations.

[[Fate]] generally implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to [[determinism]], but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance [[theological determinism]]). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.

[[Destiny]] implies there is a set course that cannot be deviated from, but does not of itself make any claim with respect to the setting of that course (i.e., it does not necessarily conflict with [[incompatibilist]] free will). Free will if existent could be the mechanism by which that destined outcome is chosen (determined to represent destiny).&lt;ref name="Blackwell2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben C. Blackwell|title=Christosis: Pauline Soteriology in Light of Deification in Irenaeus and Cyril of Alexandria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDZxSq9nx4IC|accessdate=8 December 2012|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|isbn=978-3-16-151672-6|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Logical determinism======
{{See also|B-theory of time}}
Discussion regarding destiny does not necessitate the existence of supernatural powers. Logical [[determinism]] or determinateness is the notion that all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is it is already determined as either true or false), and is referred to as the [[problem of future contingents]].

======Omniscience======
{{Main|Omniscience}}

[[Omniscience]] is the capacity to know everything that there is to know (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level [[predeterminism]] such as hard [[theological determinism]] or [[predestination]]&amp;nbsp;– that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, as is the case with libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an [[incompatible-properties argument]] for the existence of [[God]], known as the [[argument from free will]], and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of [[omnipotence]] with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew what they were going to choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).

=====Predeterminism=====

[[Predeterminism]] is the idea that all events are determined in advance.&lt;ref name="McKewan"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=McKewan |first=Jaclyn |editor=H.

Predeterminism is frequently taken to mean that human actions cannot interfere with (or have no bearing on) the outcomes of a pre-determined course of events, and that one's destiny was established externally (for example, exclusively by a creator deity). The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking [[causal determinism]], implying that there is an unbroken [[chain of prior occurrences]] stretching back to the origin of the universe. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of [[determinism]].&lt;ref name="McKewan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-determinism.html |title=Some Varieties of Free Will and Determinism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=10 September 2009 &lt;!-- date found by checking page's source code where format of date given as m.d.y --&gt;|work=Philosophy 302: Ethics |publisher=philosophy.lander.edu |accessdate=19 December 2012| quote=Predeterminism: the philosophical and theological view that combines God with determinism.

The term predeterminism suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a "someone" who is controlling or planning the causality of events before they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. [[Predestination]] asserts that a supremely powerful being has indeed fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance, and is a famous doctrine of the [[Calvinists]] in [[Christian]] theology. Predestination is often considered a form of hard [[theological determinism]].

Predeterminism has therefore been compared to [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, H. |title=Marx and determinism |quote=Many religions of the world have considered that the path of history is predetermined by God or Fate. On this basis, many believe that what will happen will happen, and they accept their destiny with fatalism. |journal=Journal of Economic Issues |pages=61–71 |year=1981 |jstor=4224996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatalism is the idea that everything is fated to happen, so that humans have no control over their future.

====Theological determinism====

{{Main|Theological determinism}}

[[Theological determinism]] is a form of [[determinism]] stating that all events that happen are pre-ordained, or [[predestination|predestined]] to happen, by a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[deity]], or that they are destined to occur given its [[omniscience]]. Two forms of theological determinism exist, here referenced as strong and weak theological determinism.&lt;ref name=JordanTate2004&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anne Lockyer Jordan|author2=Anne Lockyer Jordan Neil Lockyer Edwin Tate|author3=Neil Lockyer|author4=Edwin Tate|title=Philosophy of Religion for A Level OCR Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBVuNip8qjkC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 June 2004|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-7487-8078-5|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first one, strong theological determinism, is based on the concept of a [[creator deity]] dictating all events in history: "everything that happens has been predestined to happen by an omniscient, omnipotent divinity."&lt;ref name=Iannone2001&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Pabl Iannone|title=Dictionary of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wBmBO3vpE4C|accessdate=22 December 2012|year=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-17995-9|page=194|chapter=determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second form, weak theological determinism, is based on the concept of divine foreknowledge&amp;nbsp;– "because [[God]]'s omniscience is perfect, what God knows about the future will inevitably happen, which means, consequently, that the future is already fixed."&lt;ref name=Huyssteen2003&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentzel Van Huyssteen|title=Encyclopedia of science and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIcYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 December 2012|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference|isbn=978-0-02-865705-9|page=217|chapter=theological determinism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exist slight variations on the above categorisation. Some claim that theological determinism requires [[predestination]] of all events and outcomes by the divinity (that is, they do not classify the weaker version as 'theological determinism' unless libertarian free will is assumed to be denied as a consequence), or that the weaker version does not constitute 'theological determinism' at all.&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Raymond J. VanArragon|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyTohO1AMzwC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-3867-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological determinism can also be seen as a form of [[causal determinism]], in which the antecedent conditions are the nature and will of God.&lt;ref name=stanfordmoralresponsibility&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Eshleman |first=Andrew |editor=Edward N.

[[File:TheologicalDeterminismXFreeWill.svg|thumb|A simplified [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of philosophical positions regarding free will and theological determinism.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge" /&gt;]]
There are various implications for [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will as consequent of theological determinism and its philosophical interpretation.
* Strong theological determinism is not compatible with metaphysical libertarian free will, and is a form of ''hard theological determinism'' (equivalent to theological fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and ''God'' has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard theological determinism is similar in implication to [[hard determinism]], although it does not invalidate [[compatibilism|compatibilist]] free will.&lt;ref name=stanfordforeknowledge /&gt; Hard theological determinism is a form of theological incompatibilism (see figure, top left).
* Weak theological determinism is either compatible or incompatible with metaphysical libertarian free will depending upon one's philosophical interpretation of [[omniscience]]&amp;nbsp;– and as such is interpreted as either a form of hard theological determinism (known as [[theological fatalism]]), or as ''soft theological determinism'' (terminology used for clarity only). Soft theological determinism claims that humans have free will to choose their actions, holding that God, while [[omniscience|knowing their actions before they happen]], does not affect the outcome. God's providence is "compatible" with voluntary choice. Soft theological determinism is known as theological compatibilism (see figure, top right). A rejection of theological determinism (or [[omniscience|divine foreknowledge]]) is classified as theological incompatibilism also (see figure, bottom), and is relevant to a more general discussion of free will.&lt;ref name="stanfordforeknowledge"/&gt;

The basic argument for theological fatalism in the case of weak theological determinism is as follows:
# Assume divine foreknowledge or [[omniscience]]
# [[infallibility|Infallible]] foreknowledge implies destiny (it is known for certain what one will do)
# Destiny eliminates alternate possibility (one cannot do otherwise)
# Assert incompatibility with metaphysical libertarian free will

This argument is very often accepted as a basis for theological incompatibilism: denying either libertarian free will or divine foreknowledge (omniscience) and therefore theological determinism. On the other hand, theological compatibilism must attempt to find problems with it. The formal version of the argument rests on a number of premises, many of which have received some degree of contention. Theological compatibilist responses have included:
* Deny the truth value of [[Problem of future contingents|future contingents]], as proposed for example by [[Aristotle]] (although this denies foreknowledge and therefore theological determinism).
* Assert differences in non-temporal knowledge (space-time independence), an approach taken for example by [[Boethius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Boethius | title=The Consolation of Philosophy | chapter=Book V, Prose vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aquinas, St. Thomas | title=Summa Theologica | chapter=Ia, q. 14, art 13.}} See [[Summa Theologica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C.S. Lewis | title=Mere Christianity | publisher=Touchstone:New York | year=1980 | page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deny the Principle of [[Alternative Possibilities|Alternate Possibilities]]: "If you cannot do otherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely." For example, a human observer could in principle have a machine that could detect what will happen in the future, but the existence of this machine or their use of it has no influence on the outcomes of events.&lt;ref name=zagzebski1991&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|title=The Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v9nLMBtGYcC|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=25 April 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-510763-0|chapter=chapter 6, section 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the definition of [[compatibilism]] and [[incompatibilism]], the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or "Hard Theological Determinism" above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose outcomes were not "predestined" or determined by God). If hard theological determinism is accepted (if it was assumed instead that such outcomes were predestined by God), then metaphysical libertarianism is not, however, possible, and would require reclassification (as hard incompatibilism for example, given that the universe is still assumed to be indeterministic&amp;nbsp;– although the classification of hard determinism is technically valid also).&lt;ref name=VanArragon2010 /&gt;

=====Mind-body problem=====
{{Main|Mind–body problem}}
{{See also|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Monism|Physicalism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[René Descartes]]]]

The idea of ''free will'' is one aspect of the [[Mind–body problem|mind-body problem]], that is, consideration of the relation between [[mind]] (for example, consciousness, memory, and judgment) and body (for example, the [[human brain]] and [[nervous system]]). [[Philosophy of Mind|Philosophical models of mind]] are divided into [[Physicalism|physical]] and non-physical expositions.

[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]] holds that the mind is a nonphysical substance, the seat of consciousness and intelligence, and is not identical with physical states of the brain or body. It is suggested that although the two worlds do interact, each retains some measure of autonomy. Under cartesian dualism external mind is responsible for bodily action, although unconscious brain activity is often caused by external events (for example, the instantaneous reaction to being burned).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi&gt;See for example: {{cite book |title=Mind and Causality |chapter=Chapter 5: Mental causation and intentionality in a mind naturalizing theory |author=Sandro Nannini |editor=Alberto Peruzzi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zYEPifPTQK4C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA77 |pages=69 ''ff'' |isbn=1588114759 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism implies that the physical world is not deterministic&amp;nbsp;– and in which external mind controls (at least some) physical events, providing an interpretation of [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] free will. Stemming from Cartesian dualism, a formulation sometimes called ''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)#Interactionism|interactionalist dualism]]'' suggests a two-way interaction, that some physical events cause some mental acts and some mental acts cause some physical events. One modern vision of the possible separation of mind and body is the [[Popper's three worlds|"three-world" formulation]] of [[Karl Popper|Popper]].&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;{{cite book |title=All Life is Problem Solving |chapter=Notes of a realist on the body-mind problem |author=Karl Raimund Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3cZYwdq28C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 |pages=23 ''ff'' |isbn=0415174864 |year=1999 |publisher=Psychology Press |quote=The body-mind relationship...includes the problem of man's position in the physical world...'World 1'. The world of conscious human processes I shall call 'World 2', and the world of the objective creations of the human mind I shall call 'World 3'. |edition=A lecture given in Mannheim, 8 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartesian dualism and Popper's three worlds are two forms of what is called [[epistemological pluralism]], that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include [[psychophysical parallelism]] and [[epiphenomenalism]]. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is ''not'' reducible to the concepts of the natural sciences.

A contrasting approach is called [[physicalism]]. Physicalism is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that everything that [[existence|exists]] is no more extensive than its [[physical properties]]; that is, that there are no non-physical substances (for example physically independent minds). Physicalism can be reductive or non-reductive. [[Reductive physicalism]] is grounded in the idea that everything in the world can actually be reduced analytically to its fundamental physical, or material, basis. Alternatively, [[non-reductive physicalism]] asserts that mental properties form a separate ontological class to physical properties: that mental states (such as [[qualia]]) are not ontologically reducible to physical states. Although one might suppose that mental states and neurological states are different in kind, that does not rule out the possibility that mental states are correlated with neurological states. In one such construction, [[anomalous monism]], mental events [[Supervenience|''supervene'']] on physical events, describing the [[emergence]] of mental properties correlated with physical properties&amp;nbsp;– implying causal reducibility. Non-reductive physicalism is therefore often categorised as [[property dualism]] rather than [[monism]], yet other types of property dualism do not adhere to the causal reducibility of mental states (see epiphenomenalism).

[[Incompatibilism]] requires a distinction between the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) physical reality and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, [[metaphysical libertarianism|metaphysical libertarian]] free will must assert influence on physical reality, and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).

===Compatibilism===
{{Main|Compatibilism}}
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]] was a classical compatibilist.]]

Compatibilists maintain that determinism is compatible with free will. They believe freedom can be present or absent in a situation for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics. For instance, [[courts of law]] make judgments about whether individuals are acting under their own free will under certain circumstances without bringing in metaphysics. Similarly, [[political liberty]] is a non-metaphysical concept.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Likewise, some compatibilists define free will as freedom to act according to one's determined motives without hindrance from other individuals. So for example Aristotle in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sauve Meyer, ''Aristotle on Moral Responsibility.'', Oxford 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stoic Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bobzien|Bobzien, Susanne]], ''Freedom and Determinism in Stoic Philosophy'', Oxford 1998, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the [[incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] positions are concerned with a sort of "metaphysically free will", which compatibilists claim has never been coherently defined. Compatibilists argue that determinism does not matter; though they disagree among themselves about what, in turn, ''does'' matter. To be a compatibilist, one need not endorse any particular conception of free will, but only deny that determinism is at odds with free will.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"&gt;McKenna, Michael, "Compatibilism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2004/entries/compatibilism/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are various impediments to exercising one's choices, free will does not imply freedom of action. Freedom of choice (freedom to select one's will) is logically separate from freedom to ''implement'' that choice (freedom to enact one's will), although not all writers observe this distinction.&lt;ref name="OConnor"/&gt; Nonetheless, some philosophers have defined free will as the absence of various impediments. Some "modern compatibilists", such as [[Harry Frankfurt]] and [[Daniel Dennett]], argue free will is simply freely choosing to do what constraints allow one to do. In other words, a coerced agent's choices can still be free if such coercion coincides with the agent's personal intentions and desires.&lt;ref name="DD1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, D. |year=1984 |title= Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting |publisher= Bradford Books |isbn=0-262-54042-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NtNzOKxycC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frankfurt&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2024717 | last1=Frankfurt |first1= H. | year=1971 | pages=5–20 |title= Freedom of the Will and the Concept of the Person | issue=1 | volume=68 |journal=Journal of Philosophy |jstor= 2024717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as lack of physical restraint====
Most "classical compatibilists", such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], claim that a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also possible for the person to be able to do otherwise, ''if the person had decided to''. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of ''will'', asserting, for example, that "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe{{sic}}&lt;!-- sic, that is how Hobbes wrote it; don't change to "do". --&gt;."&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;Hobbes, T. (1651) ''Leviathan'' [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html#a_2025807 Chapter XXI.: "Of the liberty of subjects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122711/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=585&amp;search=%22finds+no+stop%22&amp;chapter=89860&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }} (1968 edition). London: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In articulating this crucial proviso, [[David Hume]] writes, "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains."&lt;ref name="Hume"&gt;Hume, D. (1740). ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' Section VIII.: "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html#a_606067 Of liberty and necessity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511122708/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=341&amp;search=%22prisoner+chains%22&amp;chapter=61966&amp;layout=html |date=2011-05-11 }}" (1967 edition). [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Voltaire]], in his ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique]]'', claimed that "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." He asked, "would you have everything at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" For him, free will or liberty is "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs."

====Free will as a psychological state====
Compatibilism often regards the agent free as virtue of their reason. Some explanations of free will focus on the internal causality of the mind with respect to higher-order brain processing&amp;nbsp;– the interaction between conscious and unconscious brain activity.&lt;ref name=Baumeister&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages=487 ''ff'' |editor1=Ezequiel Morsella |editor2=John A.

{{cite book |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 23: Free Willpower: A limited resource theory of volition, choice and self-regulation |author1=Roy F Baumeister |author2=Matthew T Galliot |author3=Dianne M Tice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487 |pages= 487 ''ff'' |editors=Ezequiel Morsella, John A.

Our findings suggest that the traditional folk notions of willpower and character strength have some legitimate basis in genuine phenomena.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Compatibilist free will has also been attributed to our natural [[sense of agency]], where one must believe they are an agent in order to function and develop a [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name="Smilansky2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Saul Smilansky|title=Free Will and Illusion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPUTQq7CUfwC|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-825018-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gallagher | first1 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 14–21 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01417-5| pmid = 10637618 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of levels of decision is presented in a different manner by Frankfurt.&lt;ref name=Frankfurt/&gt; Frankfurt argues for a version of compatibilism called the "hierarchical mesh". The idea is that an individual can have conflicting desires at a first-order level and also have a desire about the various first-order desires (a second-order desire) to the effect that one of the desires prevails over the others. A person's will is identified with their effective first-order desire, that is, the one they act on, and this will is free if it was the desire the person wanted to act upon, that is, the person's second-order desire was effective. So, for example, there are "wanton addicts", "unwilling addicts" and "willing addicts". All three groups may have the conflicting first-order desires to want to take the drug they are addicted to and to not want to take it.

The first group, ''wanton addicts'', have no second-order desire not to take the drug. The second group, "unwilling addicts", have a second-order desire not to take the drug, while the third group, "willing addicts", have a second-order desire to take it. According to Frankfurt, the members of the first group are devoid of will and therefore are no longer persons. The members of the second group freely desire not to take the drug, but their will is overcome by the addiction. Finally, the members of the third group willingly take the drug they are addicted to. Frankfurt's theory can ramify to any number of levels. Critics of the theory point out that there is no certainty that conflicts will not arise even at the higher-order levels of desire and preference.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, D. (1982). ''Free Will''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that Frankfurt offers no adequate explanation of how the various levels in the hierarchy mesh together.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, John Martin, and Mark Ravizza. (1998). ''Responsibility and Control: An Essay on Moral Responsibility''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as unpredictability====
In ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]'', Dennett presents an argument for a compatibilist theory of free will, which he further elaborated in the book ''[[Freedom Evolves]]''.&lt;ref name="DD2"&gt;Dennett, D. (2003) ''Freedom Evolves''. Viking Books. {{ISBN|0-670-03186-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic reasoning is that, if one excludes God, an infinitely powerful [[demon]], and other such possibilities, then because of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and epistemic limits on the precision of our knowledge of the current state of the world, the future is ill-defined for all finite beings. The only well-defined things are "expectations". The ability to do "otherwise" only makes sense when dealing with these expectations, and not with some unknown and unknowable future.

According to Dennett, because individuals have the ability to act differently from what anyone expects, free will can exist.&lt;ref name="DD2"/&gt; Incompatibilists claim the problem with this idea is that we may be mere "automata responding in predictable ways to stimuli in our environment". Therefore, all of our actions are controlled by forces outside ourselves, or by random chance.&lt;ref name="Kaney"&gt;Kane, R. ''The Oxford Handbook to Free Will''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-513336-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More sophisticated analyses of compatibilist free will have been offered, as have other critiques.&lt;ref name="CompSEP"/&gt;

In the philosophy of [[decision theory]], a fundamental question is: From the standpoint of statistical outcomes, to what extent do the choices of a conscious being have the ability to influence the future? [[Newcomb's paradox]] and other philosophical problems pose questions about free will and predictable outcomes of choices.

====The physical mind====
{{See also|Neuroscience of free will}}

[[Compatibilist]] models of free will often consider deterministic relationships as discoverable in the physical world (including the brain). Cognitive [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]&lt;ref name=naturalism&gt;A key exponent of this view was [[Willard van Orman Quine]]. See {{cite web |title=Willard van Orman Quine |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/quine/ |author=Hylton, Peter |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition) |editor= Edward N. Zalta |date=Apr 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] approach to studying human [[cognition]] and [[consciousness]] in which the mind is simply part of nature, perhaps merely a feature of many very complex self-programming feedback systems (for example, [[neural networks]] and [[Cognitive robotics|cognitive robots]]), and so must be studied by the methods of empirical science, such as the [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] and [[cognitive science]]s (''i.e.'' [[neuroscience]] and [[cognitive psychology]]).&lt;ref name=Peruzzi/&gt;&lt;ref name=physicalism&gt;

A thoughtful list of careful distinctions regarding the application of empirical science to these issues is found in {{cite web |author=Stoljar, Daniel |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/physicalism/#12 |title=Physicalism: §12 – Physicalism and the physicalist world picture |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Sep 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive naturalism stresses the role of neurological sciences. Overall brain health, [[substance dependence]], [[Long-term depression|depression]], and various [[personality disorders]] clearly influence mental activity, and their impact upon [[Volition (psychology)|volition]] is also important.&lt;ref name=Baumeister /&gt; For example, an [[substance abuse|addict]] may experience a conscious desire to escape addiction, but be unable to do so. The "will" is disconnected from the freedom to act. This situation is related to an abnormal production and distribution of [[dopamine]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Volkow&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The neuroscience of free will places restrictions on both compatibilist and incompatibilist free will conceptions.

Compatibilist models adhere to models of mind in which mental activity (such as deliberation) can be reduced to physical activity without any change in physical outcome. Although compatibilism is generally aligned to (or is at least compatible with) physicalism, some compatibilist models describe the natural occurrences of deterministic deliberation in the brain in terms of the first person perspective of the conscious agent performing the deliberation.&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt; Such an approach has been considered a form of identity dualism. A description of "how conscious experience might affect brains" has been provided in which "the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."&lt;ref name=Baumeister2 /&gt;

Recently{{when|date=August 2018}} [[Claudio Costa (philosopher)|Claudio Costa]] developed a neocompatibilist theory based on the causal theory of action that is complementary to classical compatibilism. According to him, physical, psychological and rational restrictions can interfer at different levels of the causal chain that would naturally lead to action. Corrrespondingly, there can be physical restrictions to the body, psychological restrictions to the decision, and rational restrictions to the formation of reasons (desires plus beliefs) that should lead to what we would call a reasonable action. The last two are usually called "restrictions of free will". The restriction at the level of reasons is particularly important, since it can be motivated by external reasons that are insufficiently conscious to the agent. One example was the collective suicide led by [[Jim Jones]]. The suicidal agents were not conscious that their free will have been manipulated by external, even if ungrounded, reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Costa [http://www.example''Lines of Thought: Rethinking Philosophical Assumptions''] CSP, 2014, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Some philosophers' views are difficult to categorize as either compatibilist or incompatibilist, hard determinist or libertarian. For example, [[Ted Honderich]] holds the view that "determinism is true, compatibilism and incompatibilism are both false" and the real problem lies elsewhere. Honderich maintains that determinism is true because quantum phenomena are not events or things that can be located in space and time, but are [[Abstract object|abstract]] entities. Further, even if they were micro-level events, they do not seem to have any relevance to how the world is at the macroscopic level. He maintains that incompatibilism is false because, even if indeterminism is true, incompatibilists have not provided, and cannot provide, an adequate account of origination. He rejects compatibilism because it, like incompatibilism, assumes a single, fundamental notion of freedom. There are really two notions of freedom: voluntary action and origination. Both notions are required to explain freedom of will and responsibility. Both determinism and indeterminism are threats to such freedom. To abandon these notions of freedom would be to abandon moral responsibility. On the one side, we have our intuitions; on the other, the scientific facts. The "new" problem is how to resolve this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, T. (2001). "Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False and the Real Problem" in ''The Free Will Handbook'', edited by Robert Kane of the University of Texas. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as an illusion====
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|Spinoza thought that there is no free will.]]
:"Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men believe themselves free, simply because they are conscious of their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined." [[Baruch Spinoza]], ''Ethics''&lt;ref name=Spinoza&gt;{{cite book |author= Benedict de Spinoza |year=2008 |chapter= Part III: On the origin and nature of the emotions; Postulates (Proposition II, Note) |editor= R.H.M.

David Hume discussed the possibility that the entire debate about free will is nothing more than a merely "verbal" issue. He suggested that it might be accounted for by "a false sensation or seeming experience" (a ''velleity''), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1765). ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Indianapolis: Hacket Publishing Co. Second edition. 1993. {{ISBN|0-87220-230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] claimed that phenomena have no free will but the will as [[Noumena|noumenon]], is free.]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] put the puzzle of free will and moral responsibility in these terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Everyone believes himself, ''a priori'', perfectly free&amp;nbsp;– even in his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can commence another manner of life. ... But ''a posteriori'', through experience, he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to necessity, that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he himself condemns...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The Wisdom of Life'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his essay ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Schopenhauer stated, "You can do what you will, but in any given moment of your life you can ''will'' only one definite thing and absolutely nothing other than that one thing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], Arthur, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell {{ISBN|0-631-14552-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schopenhauer, [[phenomena]] do not have free will. However, [[Will (philosophy)|will]] [urging, craving, striving, wanting, and desiring] as [[Noumena|noumenon]] is free.

====Free will as "moral imagination"====
[[Rudolf Steiner]], who collaborated in a complete edition of Arthur Schopenhauer's work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Schopenhauers sämtliche Werke in zwölf Bänden. Mit Einleitung von Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Stuttgart: Verlag der J.G. Cotta'schen Buchhandlung Nachfolger, o.J. (1894–96)|first=Rudolf|last=Steiner|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~kafka/k_s_bibII.html |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''The [[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', which focuses on the problem of free will. Steiner (1861–1925) initially divides this into the two aspects of freedom: ''freedom of thought'' and ''freedom of action''. The controllable and uncontrollable aspects of decision making thereby are made logically separable, as pointed out in the introduction. This separation of ''will'' from ''action'' has a very long history, going back at least as far as [[Stoicism]] and the teachings of [[Chrysippus]] (279–206 BCE), who separated external ''antecedent'' causes from the internal disposition receiving this cause.&lt;ref name=Chrysippus&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lRD6feR3hEC&amp;pg=PA529 |page=529 |chapter=Chapter VI: The Chyrsippean notion of fate: soft determinism |author=Keimpe Algra |isbn=0521250285 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner then argues that inner freedom is achieved when we integrate our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, with our thoughts, which lend coherence to these impressions and thereby disclose to us an understandable world. Acknowledging the many influences on our choices, he nevertheless point out that they do not preclude freedom unless we fail to recognise them. Steiner argues that outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with ''moral imagination.” “Moral” in this case refers to action that is willed, while “imagination” refers to the mental capacity to envision conditions that do not already hold. Both of these functions are necessarily conditions for freedom. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, R. (1964). Rudolf Steiner Press, London, 1964, 1970, 1972, 1979, 230 pp., translated from the 12th German edition of 1962 by Michael Wilson. [http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA004/ ((online))]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pragmatically useful concept====
[[William James]]' views were ambivalent. While he believed in free will on "ethical grounds", he did not believe that there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it.&lt;ref&gt;See Bricklin, Jonathan, "A Variety of Religious Experience: William James and the Non-Reality of Free Will", in Libet (1999), ''The Volitional Brain: Toward a Neuroscience of Free Will'' (Thorverton UK: Imprint Academic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately he believed that the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he did not believe that the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work ''[[Pragmatism]]'', he wrote that "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted to carry on the social business of punishment and praise" regardless of metaphysical theories.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;James, W. (1907) ''Pragmatism'' (1979 edition). Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He did believe that indeterminism is important as a "doctrine of relief"&amp;nbsp;– it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines [[meliorism]]&amp;nbsp;– the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

====Free will and views of causality====
{{See also|Principle of sufficient reason}}

In 1739, [[David Hume]] in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' approached free will via the notion of causality. It was his position that causality was a mental construct used to explain the repeated association of events, and that one must examine more closely the relation between things ''regularly succeeding'' one another (descriptions of regularity in nature) and things that ''result'' in other things (things that cause or necessitate other things).&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;
{{cite book |title=The significance of free will |author=Robert Kane |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBlXH3FtwJIC&amp;pg=PA226 |page= 226 |chapter=Notes to pages 74–81, note 22 |isbn=0195126564 |year=1998 |edition=Paperback}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hume, 'causation' is on weak grounds: "Once we realise that 'A must bring about B' is tantamount merely to 'Due to their constant conjunction, we are psychologically certain that B will follow A,' then we are left with a very weak notion of necessity."&lt;ref name=Lorkowski&gt;{{cite web |author=CM Lorkowski |date=November 7, 2010 |title=David Hume: Causation |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/ |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This empiricist view was often denied by trying to prove the so-called [[apriority]] of causal law (i.e. that it precedes all experience and is rooted in the construction of the perceivable world):
* [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s proof in ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (which referenced time and time ordering of causes and effects)&lt;ref&gt;Kant argued that, in order that human life is not just a "dream" (a random or projected by subjects juxtaposition of moments), the temporality of event A as before or after B must submit to a rule. An established order then implies the existence of some necessary conditions and causes, that is: sufficient bases (a so-called sufficient reason is the coincidence of all the necessary conditions). Without established causality, both [[Transcendental apperception|in subject]] and in the external world, the passing of time would be impossible, because it is essentially directional. See [[s:Critique of Pure Reason/Volume 1/Division 1#B. SECOND ANALOGY. Principle of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality. All changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause and Effect.|online text of his proof]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s proof from ''The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'' (which referenced the so-called intellectuality of representations, that is, in other words, objects and [[qualia]] perceived with senses)&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, who by the way continued and simplified Kant's system, argued (among others basing on optical illusions and the "initial processing") that it is the intellect or even the brain what generates the image of the world out of something else, by ''concluding from effects, e.g. optical, about appropriate causes'', e.g. concrete physical objects. Intellect in his works is strictly connected with recognizing causes and effects and associating them, it is somewhat close to the contemporary view of [[cerebral cortex]] and formation of associations. The intellectuality of all perception implied then of course that causality is rooted in the world, precedes and enables experience.

In the 1780s [[Immanuel Kant]] suggested at a minimum our decision processes with moral implications lie outside the reach of everyday causality, and lie outside the rules governing material objects.&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;

Freeman introduces what he calls "circular causality" to "allow for the contribution of self-organizing dynamics", the "formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the patterns of activity of the contributing individuals", applicable to "interactions between neurons and neural masses ... and between the behaving animal and its environment".&lt;ref name=Freeman&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Freeman, Walter J. |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88 |page=88| quote=Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes....

====Free will according to Thomas Aquinas====

Thirteenth century philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] viewed humans as pre-programmed (by virtue of being human) to seek certain goals, but able to choose between routes to achieve these goals (our Aristotelian [[telos (philosophy)|telos]]). His view has been associated with both compatibilism and libertarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 2| issue = 2| page = 74| last = Staley| first = Kevin M.| title = Aquinas: Compatibilist or Libertarian| journal = The Saint Anselm Journal| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2005| url = http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151221073832/http://www.anselm.edu/Documents/Institute%20for%20Saint%20Anselm%20Studies/Abstracts/4.5.3.2h_22Staley.pdf| archivedate = 2015-12-21| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Hartung| first = Christopher| title = Thomas Aquinas on Free Will| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = May 2013| publisher = University of Delaware| url = http://udspace.udel.edu/handle/19716/12979}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In facing choices, he argued that humans are governed by ''intellect'', ''will'', and ''passions''. The will is "the primary mover of all the powers of the soul ... and it is also the efficient cause of motion in the body."&lt;ref name=Stump&gt;

A discussion of the roles of will, intellect and passions in Aquinas' teachings is found in {{cite book |title=Aquinas, ''Arguments of the philosophers series'' |author= Stump, Eleonore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GvL3eKhoM8C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278 |pages=278 ''ff'' |isbn=0415029600 |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge (Psychology Press) |chapter= Intellect and will}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Choice falls into five stages: (i) intellectual consideration of whether an objective is desirable, (ii) intellectual consideration of means of attaining the objective, (iii) will arrives at an intent to pursue the objective, (iv) will and intellect jointly decide upon choice of means (v) will elects execution.&lt;ref name=OConnor0&gt;{{cite web |author=Timothy O'Connor |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/freewill/ |title= Free Will |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor= Edward N.

Furthermore, there are always external constraints on the range of options we can meaningfully try to undertake. As the presence or absence of these conditions and constraints are not (usually) our responsibility, it is plausible that the central loci of our responsibility are our choices, or "willings".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will enters as follows: Free will is an "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term "appetite" from Aquinas's definition "includes all forms of internal inclination").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01656a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Appetite |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that judgment "concludes and terminates counsel. Now counsel is terminated, first, by the judgment of reason; secondly, by the acceptation of the appetite [that is, the free-will]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1083.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Free-will (Prima Pars, Q. 83) |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A compatibilist interpretation of Aquinas's view is defended thus: "Free-will is the cause of its own movement, because by his free-will man moves himself to act. But it does not of necessity belong to liberty that what is free should be the first cause of itself, as neither for one thing to be cause of another need it be the first cause. God, therefore, is the first cause, Who moves causes both natural and voluntary. And just as by moving natural causes He does not prevent their acts being natural, so by moving voluntary causes He does not deprive their actions of being voluntary: but rather is He the cause of this very thing in them; for He operates in each thing according to its own nature."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', Q83 A1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further discussion of this compatibilistic theory can be found in Thomas' ''Summa contra gentiles'', Book III about Providence, c. 88–91 (260–67), where it is postulated that everything has its cause and it is again and again in detail referred also to all individual choices of man etc., even refuting opposite views. [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles3b.htm#88 Here the online text of the Summa]. In order to avoid, at least in concept, the absolution of man of any guilt he then notes the contingency of all that takes place, i.e. lack of ''direct'' necessity from God strictly with regard to a concrete ("contingent") act. A typical choice was not separately ordained to be so-and-so by God; St. Thomas says the choice is not necessary, but in fact that apparently means it was ''contingent'' with regard to God and the law of nature (as a specific case that could have not existed in other circumstances), and ''necessary'' with regard to its direct previous cause in will and intellect. (The contingency, or fortuity, is even intuitive under modern [[chaos theory]], where one can try to show that more and more developed products appearing in the evolution of a universe or, simpler, an automaton are [[chaos theory|chaotic]] with regard to its principles.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will as a pseudo-problem====

Historically, most of the philosophical effort invested in resolving the dilemma has taken the form of close examination of definitions and ambiguities in the concepts designated by "free", "freedom", "will", "choice" and so forth. Defining 'free will' often revolves around the meaning of phrases like [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22ability+to+do+otherwise%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "ability to do otherwise"] or [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22alternative+possibilities%22+%22free+will%22&amp;gws_rd=ssl "alternative possibilities"]. This emphasis upon words has led some philosophers to claim the problem is merely verbal and thus a pseudo-problem.&lt;ref name=Deery&gt;

The free will problem – real or illusory |isbn=9780199733392 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, others point out the complexity of decision making and the importance of nuances in the terminology.

===History of free will===

The problem of free will has been identified in [[ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophical]] literature. The notion of compatibilist free will has been attributed to both [[Aristotle]] (fourth century BCE) and [[Epictetus]] (1st century CE); "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them".&lt;ref name=bobzien1998determinism&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Determinism and freedom in Stoic philosophy| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 1998| url = https://books.google.com/?id=7kmTeOjHIqkC&amp;pg=PR12|quote="...Aristotle and Epictetus: In the latter authors it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them. In Alexander's account, the terms are understood differently: what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them."| isbn = 9780198237945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bobzien| first = Susanne| title = Did Epicurus discover the free-will problem?| accessdate = 2015-12-09| date = 2000| url = http://philpapers.org/rec/BOBDED}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Susanne Bobzien]], the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] (third century CE); "what makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".

The term "free will" (''liberum arbitrium'') was introduced by Christian philosophy (4th century CE). It has traditionally meant (until the Enlightenment proposed its own meanings) lack of necessity in human will,&lt;ref&gt;A. Schopenhauer, ''On the Freedom of the Will'', c. 1, "What is freedom?"&lt;/ref&gt; so that "the will is free" meant "the will does not have to be such as it is". This requirement was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.&lt;ref&gt;Hence the notion of contingency appeared as the very opposition of necessity, so that wherever a thing is considered dependent or relies upon another thing, it is contingent and thus not necessary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific approaches==

Science has contributed to the free will problem in at least three ways. First, physics has addressed the question whether nature is deterministic, which is viewed as crucial by incompatibilists (compatibilists, however, view it as irrelevant). Second, although free will can be defined in various ways, all of them involve aspects of the way people make decisions and initiate actions, which have been studied extensively by neuroscientists. Some of the experimental observations are widely viewed as implying that free will does not exist or is an illusion (but many philosophers see this as a misunderstanding). Third, psychologists have studied the beliefs that the majority of ordinary people hold about free will and its role in assigning moral responsibility.

===Quantum physics===
Early scientific thought often portrayed the universe as deterministic&amp;nbsp;– for example in the thought of [[Democritus]] or the [[Cārvāka]]ns&amp;nbsp;– and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient [[physical information|information]] would allow them to predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and [[stochastic]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Boniolo, G. and Vidali, P. (1999) ''Filosofia della Scienza'', Milan: Mondadori. {{ISBN|88-424-9359-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum mechanics]] predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism is true of the world, being very far from a potential [[Theory of Everything]], and open to many different [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations]].&lt;ref name="stanfordcausaldeterminism"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Carl |last=Hoefer |title=Causal Determinism |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-11-01 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the Universe Deterministic? |first=Vlatko |last=Vedral |volume=192 |issue=2578 |date=2006-11-18 |journal=New Scientist |quote=Physics is simply unable to resolve the question of free will, although, if anything, it probably leans towards determinism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that an indeterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is for all practical purposes confined to microscopic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwVariousHonderichKanebook.htm |author=Honderich, E.|title= Determinism as True, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism as Both False, and the Real Problem |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some [[hardware random number generator]]s work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant question is whether the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only a result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition),&lt;ref name="RKane1"/&gt; According to many interpretations, non-determinism enables free will to exist,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quantum-physics-free-will/&lt;/ref&gt; while others assert the opposite (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/lujan1.html |title=Infidels. "Metaphysical Freedom" |publisher=Infidels.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetics===
Like physicists, [[biology|biologists]] have frequently addressed questions related to free will. One of the most heated debates in biology is that of "[[nature versus nurture]]", concerning the relative importance of genetics and biology as compared to culture and environment in human behavior.&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinel, P. J. (1990) ''Biopsychology''. Prentice Hall Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of many researchers is that many human behaviors can be explained in terms of humans' brains, genes, and evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;DeFries, J.C., McGuffin, P., McClearn, G.E., Plomin, R. (2000) ''Behavioral Genetics'' 4th ed. W H Freeman &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. (1967) ''The Naked Ape''. New York:McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|0-385-33430-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawk"&gt;Dawkins, R. (1976) ''The Selfish Gene''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|88-04-39318-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view raises the fear that such attribution makes it impossible to hold others responsible for their actions. [[Steven Pinker]]'s view is that fear of determinism in the context of "genetics" and "evolution" is a mistake, that it is "a confusion of ''explanation'' with ''exculpation''". Responsibility does not require that behavior be uncaused, as long as behavior responds to praise and blame.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;Pinker, S. (2002) ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. London: Penguin. p. 179 {{ISBN|0-14-200334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is not certain that environmental determination is any less threatening to free will than genetic determination.&lt;ref name="Lew"&gt;Lewontin, R. (2000). ''It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and other Illusions''. New York: NYREV Inc. {{ISBN|88-420-6418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroscience and Neurophilosophy===
{{Main|Neurophilosophy|Neuroscience of free will}}
{{see also|Neurostimulation}}

It has become possible to study the living [[Human brain|brain]], and researchers can now watch the brain's decision-making process at work. A seminal experiment in this field was conducted by [[Benjamin Libet]] in the 1980s, in which he asked each subject to choose a random moment to flick their wrist while he measured the associated activity in their brain; in particular, the build-up of electrical signal called the [[readiness potential]] (after German [[Bereitschaftspotential]], which was discovered by [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 1965. Hirnpotentialänderungen bei Willkürbewegungen und passiven Bewegungen des Menschen: Bereitschaftspotential und reafferente Potentiale. Pflügers Arch 284: 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;) Although it was well known that the readiness potential reliably preceded the physical action, Libet asked whether it could be recorded before the conscious intention to move. To determine when subjects felt the intention to move, he asked them to watch the second hand of a clock. After making a movement, the volunteer reported the time on the clock when they first felt the conscious intention to move; this became known as Libet's W time.&lt;ref name="LGW" /&gt;

Libet found that the ''unconscious'' brain activity of the readiness potential leading up to subjects' movements began approximately half a second before the subject was aware of a conscious intention to move.&lt;ref name="LGW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00044903 | last1 = Libet | first1 = B. | year = 1985 | title = Unconscious cerebral initiative and the role of conscious will in voluntary action | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 529–66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These studies of the timing between actions and the conscious decision bear upon the role of the brain in understanding free will. A subject's declaration of intention to move a finger appears ''after'' the brain has begun to implement the action, suggesting to some that unconsciously the brain has made the decision ''before'' the conscious mental act to do so. Some believe the implication is that free will was not involved in the decision and is an illusion. The first of these experiments reported the brain registered activity related to the move about 0.2 s before movement onset.&lt;ref name=Libet&gt;

The bearing of these results upon notions of free will appears complex.&lt;ref name=Strother&gt;{{cite journal|title=The conscious experience of action and intention |author1=Lars Strother |author2=Sukhvinder Singh Obhi |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=198 |year=2009 |pages=535–39 |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-1946-7 |url=http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |issue=4 |pmid=19641911 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217013640/http://publish.uwo.ca/~lstroth/StrotherObhi_EBR_2009.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Rosenbaum&gt;A brief discussion of possible interpretation of these results is found in {{cite book |title=Human Motor Control |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsFmds_ACBwC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86 |isbn=0123742269 |year=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |author=David A. Rosenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that placing the question of free will in the context of motor control is too narrow. The objection is that the time scales involved in motor control are very short, and motor control involves a great deal of unconscious action, with much physical movement entirely unconscious. On that basis "... free will cannot be squeezed into time frames of 150–350 ms; free will is a longer term phenomenon" and free will is a higher level activity that "cannot be captured in a description of neural activity or of muscle activation...."&lt;ref name=Gallagher&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |author= Gallagher, Shaun|chapter=Chapter 6: Where's the action?

More studies have since been conducted, including some that try to:
* support Libet's original findings
* suggest that the cancelling or "veto" of an action may first arise subconsciously as well
* explain the underlying brain structures involved
* suggest models that explain the relationship between conscious intention and action

[[Benjamin Libet]]'s results are quoted&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Wegner|Wegner D.]], 2002. The Illusion of Conscious Will. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in favor of epiphenomenalism, but he believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action. In ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', [[Daniel Dennett]] argues that a no-free-will conclusion is based on dubious assumptions about the location of consciousness, as well as questioning the accuracy and interpretation of Libet's results. [[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]] underlined that absence of conscious will during the early Bereitschaftspotential (termed BP1) is not a proof of the non-existence of free will, as also unconscious agendas may be free and non-deterministic. According to their suggestion, man has relative freedom, i.e. freedom in degrees, that can be in- or decreased through deliberate choices that involve both conscious and unconscious (panencephalic) processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Helmut Kornhuber|Kornhuber]] &amp; [[Lüder Deecke|Deecke]], 2012. ''The will and its brain – an appraisal of reasoned free will''. University Press of America, Lanham, MD, {{ISBN|978-0-7618-5862-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that data such as the [[Bereitschaftspotential]] undermine epiphenomenalism for the same reason, that such experiments rely on a subject reporting the point in time at which a conscious experience occurs, thus relying on the subject to be able to consciously perform an action. That ability would seem to be at odds with early epiphenomenalism, which according to Huxley is the broad claim that consciousness is "completely without any power… as the steam-whistle which accompanies the work of a locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery".&lt;ref name="Flanagan1992"&gt;{{cite book |first=O.J. |last=Flanagan |year=1992 |title=Consciousness Reconsidered |series=Bradford Books |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56077-1 |lccn=lc92010057 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFOqQgAACAAJ |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adrian G.

It has been shown that in several brain-related conditions, individuals cannot entirely control their own actions, though the existence of such conditions does not directly refute the existence of free will. Neuroscientific studies are valuable tools in developing models of how humans experience free will.

For example, people with [[Tourette syndrome]] and related [[tic disorder]]s make involuntary movements and utterances (called [[tic]]s) despite the fact that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or ''unvoluntary'',&lt;ref name=TSADef&gt;Tourette Syndrome Association. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050322170245/http://www.tsa-usa.org/research/definitions.html Definitions and Classification of Tic Disorders.].

In [[alien hand syndrome]], the afflicted individual's [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] will produce unintentional movements without the will of the person. The affected limb effectively demonstrates 'a will of its own.' The [[sense of agency]] does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. This phenomenon corresponds with an impairment in the premotor mechanism manifested temporally by the appearance of the readiness potential (see section on the Neuroscience of Free Will above) recordable on the scalp several hundred milliseconds before the overt appearance of a spontaneous willed movement. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] with specialized multivariate analyses to study the temporal dimension in the activation of the cortical network associated with voluntary movement in human subjects, an anterior-to-posterior sequential activation process beginning in the supplementary motor area on the medial surface of the frontal lobe and progressing to the primary motor cortex and then to parietal cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name=Kayser&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20771 | last1 = Kayser | first1 = A.S. | last2 = Sun | first2 = F.T. | last3 = D'Esposito | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A comparison of Granger causality and coherency in fMRI-based analysis of the motor system | url = | journal = Human Brain Mapping | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 3475–94 | pmid = 19387980 | pmc = 2767459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sense of agency]] thus appears to normally emerge in conjunction with this orderly sequential network activation incorporating premotor association cortices together with primary motor cortex. In particular, the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal lobe appears to activate prior to primary motor cortex presumably in associated with a preparatory pre-movement process. In a recent study using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]], alien movements were characterized by a relatively isolated activation of the primary motor cortex contralateral to the alien hand, while voluntary movements of the same body part included the natural activation of motor association cortex associated with the premotor process.&lt;ref name=Assal&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ana.21173 | last1 = Assal | first1 = F. | last2 = Schwartz | first2 = S. | last3 = Vuilleumier | first3 = P. | year = 2007 | title = Moving with or without will: Functional neural correlates of alien hand syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 301–06 | pmid = 17638304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical definition requires "feeling that one limb is foreign or has a ''will of its own,'' together with observable involuntary motor activity" (emphasis in original).&lt;ref name=Doody&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.55.9.806 | last1 = Doody | first1 = RS | last2 = Jankovic | first2 = J. | year = 1992 | title = The alien hand and related signs | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 9| pages = 806–10 | pmid = 1402972 | pmc = 1015106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This syndrome is often a result of damage to the [[corpus callosum]], either when it is severed to treat intractable [[epilepsy]] or due to a [[stroke]].

This is sometimes likened to being a robot controlled by someone else. Although the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia are not yet clear, one influential hypothesis is that there is a breakdown in brain systems that compare motor commands with the feedback received from the body (known as [[proprioception]]), leading to attendant [[hallucination]]s and [[delusions of control]].&lt;ref name=frith&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0173(99)00052-1 | last1 = Frith | first1 = CD | last2 = Blakemore | first2 = S | last3 = Wolpert | first3 = DM | title = Explaining the symptoms of schizophrenia: abnormalities in the awareness of action | journal = Brain Research.

===Experimental psychology===
{{See also|Cognitive science|Cognitive psychology|Neuroscience}}
[[Experimental psychology]]'s contributions to the free will debate have come primarily through social psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]]'s work on conscious will. In his book, ''The Illusion of Conscious Will''&lt;ref name = "WegnerBook"&gt;Wegner, D.M. (2002). ''The illusion of conscious will.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegner summarizes what he believes is [[empirical evidence]] supporting the view that human perception of conscious control is an illusion. Wegner summarizes some empirical evidence that may suggest that the perception of conscious control is open to modification (or even manipulation). Wegner observes that one event is inferred to have caused a second event when two requirements are met:
# The first event immediately precedes the second event, and
# The first event is consistent with having caused the second event.
For example, if a person hears an explosion and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to infer that the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person is not likely to infer that either noise caused the tree to fall down.

Wegner has applied this principle to the inferences people make about their own conscious will. People typically experience a thought that is consistent with a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference.&lt;ref name="WegnerBook"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.54.7.480 | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wheatley | first2 = T. | year = 1999 | title = Apparent mental causation: sources of the experience of will | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 480–91 | pmid=10424155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused&amp;nbsp;– and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, [[priming (psychology)|priming]] subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Emily Pronin]] has argued that the subjective experience of free will is supported by the [[introspection illusion]]. This is the tendency for people to trust the reliability of their own introspections while distrusting the introspections of other people. The theory implies that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behavior, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pronin|first=Emily|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, Vol. 41|editor=Mark P. Zanna|chapter=The Introspection Illusion |volume=41|publisher=Academic Press|pages=42–43|year=2009|isbn=978-0-12-374472-2|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)00401-2|ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have shown that reducing a person's belief in free will makes them less helpful and more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = RF | last2 = Masicampo | first2 = EJ | last3 = Dewall | first3 = CN | year = 2009 | title = Prosocial benefits of feeling free: disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 260–68 | doi = 10.1177/0146167208327217 | pmid = 19141628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur because the subject loses a sense of [[self-efficacy]].

Caveats have, however, been identified in studying a subject's awareness of mental events, in that the process of introspection itself may alter the experience.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book|title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |chapter=The neuroscience of movement |author=Susan Pockett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19 |page=19 |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572|quote=...it is important to be clear about exactly what experience one wants one's subjects to introspect. Of course, explaining to subjects exactly what the experimenter wants them to experience can bring its own problems–...instructions to attend to a particular internally generated experience can easily alter both the timing and the content of that experience and even whether or not it is consciously experienced at all.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J.B. Miles]] contradicts the idea that free will has prosocial benefits, recognizing that many distinguished minds have already brought up the negative effects that such a belief would ensure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miles | first1 = J.B. | year = 2011 | title = 'Irresponsible and a Disservice': The integrity of social psychology turns on the free will dilemma | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 205–18 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.2011.02077.x | pmid = 22074173 | pmc = 3757306 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation for the commonality of this mix-up is a lack of knowledge regarding the free will debate in psychological research. Miles analyzed the methods of popular studies and concluded that such research purported to be examining associations between behavior and disbelief in free will are actually examining the associations between behavior and belief in fatalism. While evidence of the negative effects of a belief in fatalism is legitimate, the research fails to study the effects of belief on free will which they claim to discuss. This occurrence is due to an incorrect understanding and implication that fatalism accompanies determinism. Fatalism is distinguished by the idea that decisions lack effect on the future because everything is determined. Conversely, determinism is the belief that everything operates under cause and effect; every action determines a reaction. Determinism, therefore emphasizes the importance and responsibility one has in decision making as every choice will have an accompanying effect. Seeing this flaw throughout commonly cited research, Miles presents countering research which includes “evidence that the myth of free choice encourages immoral, unjust, prejudiced, and anti-intellectual behaviour.” Miles suggests that while both extremes of fatalism and belief in free will result in negative social outcomes, determinism serves to encourage intentional, prosocial decision making. Ultimately, the point of this research is to encourage accurate knowledge of the free will debate when conducting and evaluating such studies in experimental psychology.

Regardless of the validity of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial to understand where the idea comes from. One contribution is randomness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebert | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Wegner | first2 = D.M. | year = 2011 | title = March 1). Mistaking randomness for free will | url = | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 965–71 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.12.012 | pmid = 21367624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is established that randomness is not the only factor in the perception of the free will, it has been shown that randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, G., Baumeister, R.F., &amp; Wong, K.F. (2014, July 30). Free will is about choosing: The link between choice and the belief in free will. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 55, 239–45. {{doi|10.1016/j.jesp.2014.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that people's belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. It is also possible that one's desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.

===Believing in free will{{anchor|Believing in free will}}===
In recent years, free will belief in individuals has been analysed with respect to traits in social behaviour. In general the concept of free will researched to date in this context has been that of the incompatibilist, or more specifically, the libertarian, that is freedom from determinism.

====What people believe====
Whether people naturally adhere to an incompatibilist model of free will has been questioned in the research. Eddy Nahmias has found that incompatibilism is not intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was not adhered to, in that determinism does not negate belief in moral responsibility (based on an empirical study of people's responses to moral dilemmas under a deterministic model of reality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=Stephen G Morris|author3=Thomas Nadelhoffer|author4=Jason Turner|date=2006-07-01|title=Is Incompatibilism Intuitive?|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=73|issue=1|pages=28–53|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00603.x|issn=1933-1592|citeseerx=10.1.1.364.1083}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-29--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Cokely has found that incompatibilism is intuitive&amp;nbsp;– it was naturally adhered to, in that determinism does indeed negate belief in moral responsibility in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

Studies indicate that peoples' belief in free will is inconsistent. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler found that people believe they have more free will than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1012046108| pmid = 21149703| volume = 107| issue = 52| pages = 22469–74| last = Pronin| first = Emily|author2=Matthew B.

Studies also reveal a correlation between the likelihood of accepting a deterministic model of mind and personality type. For example, Adam Feltz and Edward Cokely found that people of an extrovert personality type are more likely to dissociate belief in determinism from belief in moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feltz|first=Adam|author2=Edward T.

[[Roy Baumeister]] and colleagues reviewed literature on the psychological effects of a belief (or disbelief) in free will. The first part of their analysis (which the only relevant part to this section) was not meant to discover the types of free will that actually exist. The researchers instead sought to identify what people believe, how many people believed it, and the effects of those beliefs. Baumeister found that most people tend to believe in a sort of "naive compatibilistic free will".&lt;ref name=BAC&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R. | last2 = Crescioni | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Alquist | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume =4| issue = | pages =1–11| doi = 10.1007/s12152-010-9058-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L. and Margesson. A., (1994). ''Free Will and Determinism (FAD) scale''. Unpublished manuscript, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found that people consider acts more "free" when they involve a person opposing external forces, planning, or making random actions.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, T.F., R.F. Baumeister, F.D. Fincham, T.E. Joiner, N.M. Lambert, A.R. Mele, and D.M. Tice. 2008. Guilty, free, and wise. Belief in free will promotes learning from negative emotions. Manuscript in preparation.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the last behaviour, "random" actions, may not be possible; when participants attempt to perform tasks in a random manner (such as generating random numbers), their behaviour betrays many patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Hillel, M. 2007. Randomness is too important to trust to chance. Presented at the 2007 Summer Institute in Informed Patient Choice, Dartmouth Medical School, NH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wagenaar | first1 = W.

Taking into account all these personal variables existing in the debates over free will, Manuel Vargas has generally assumed that in fact “there is nearly always an unremarked upon elephant that lurks in rooms where philosophers discuss free will”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Manuel|date=2004|title=Libertarianism and Skepticism about Free Will|journal=Philosophical Topics|volume=32|issue=1|pages=403–426|doi=10.5840/philtopics2004321/210|issn=0276-2080}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he particularly pointed to the role of (i)religion in motivating and sustaining various accounts of free will. As he put,&lt;blockquote&gt;My guess is that we would learn that a disproportionate number—perhaps even most—libertarians are religious and, especially, Christian. I suspect we would also learn that the overwhelming majority of compatibilists are atheist or agnostic. (I do not have a guess about the religious predilections of the various stripes of skeptical incompatibilists.) Even so, it may not be obvious why the religious beliefs of particular philosophers should matter. We could think that the arguments of the various partisans in free will debates should be judged on their merits, irrespective of whether or not they have religious motivation. However, systematically ignoring the role of religion can remove important considerations from view, considerations that affect how we think about, argue, and evaluate the various philosophical possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, by a detailed analysis of the writings and work of Arthur Eddington and Arthur Holy Compton in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and 1930s, one analysis clearly revealed not only a strong intrinsic religious motivation and specific conservative worldview concerns behind their own work on free will, but also similar personal, political and ideological factors, only of the opposite sign, in their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of 'Quantum Free Will': A Socio-Historical Analysis|volume=6|date=2018|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|series=Historical-Analytical Studies on Nature, Mind and Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Among philosophers====
A recent 2009 survey has shown that compatibilism is quite a popular stance among those who specialize in philosophy (59%). Belief in libertarianism amounted to 14%, while a lack of belief in free will equaled 12%. More than a half of surveyed people were US Americans.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bourget, D.J.

{{Quotebox|align=right|width=40%|quoted=1|quote= An alternative explanation builds on the idea that subjects tend to confuse determinism with fatalism... What happens then when agents’ self-efficacy is undermined? It is not that their basic desires and drives are defeated. It is rather, I suggest, that they become skeptical that they can control those desires; and in the face of that skepticism, they fail to apply the effort that is needed even to try. If they were tempted to behave badly, then coming to believe in fatalism makes them less likely to resist that temptation.|source=—Richard Holton&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;}}
Baumeister and colleagues found that provoking disbelief in free will seems to cause various negative effects. The authors concluded, in their paper, that it is belief in [[determinism]] that causes those negative effects.&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt; This may not be a very justified conclusion, however.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt; First of all, free will can at least refer to either [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian (indeterministic) free will]] or [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic (deterministic) free will]]. Having participants read articles that simply "disprove free will" is unlikely to increase their understanding of determinism, or the compatibilistic free will that it still permits.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

In other words, "provoking disbelief in free will" probably causes a belief in [[fatalism]]. As discussed earlier in this article, compatibilistic free will is illustrated by statements like ''"my choices have causes, and an effect&amp;nbsp;– so I affect my future"'', whereas fatalism is more like ''"my choices have causes, but no effect&amp;nbsp;– I am powerless"''. Fatalism, then, may be what threatens people's sense of [[self-efficacy]]. Lay people should not confuse fatalism with determinism, and yet even professional philosophers occasionally confuse the two. It is thus likely that the negative consequences below can be accounted for by participants developing a belief in ''fatalism'' when experiments attack belief in "free will".&lt;ref name=Holton&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Richard | year = 2011 | title = Response to 'Free Will as Advanced Action Control for Human Social Life and Culture' by Roy F.

Some studies have been conducted indicating that people react strongly to the way in which mental determinism is described, when reconciling it with moral responsibility. Eddy Nahmias has noted that when people's actions are framed with respect to their beliefs and desires (rather than their neurological underpinnings), they are more likely to dissociate determinism from moral responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nahmias|first=Eddy|author2=D.

Various social behavioural traits have been correlated with the belief in deterministic models of mind, some of which involved the experimental subjection of individuals to libertarian and deterministic perspectives.

After researchers provoked volunteers to disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs has found that those whose belief in free will had been eroded were more likely to cheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02045.x| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 49–54| last = Vohs| first = Kathleen D.|author2=Jonathan W.

Baumeister and colleagues also note that volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of [[counterfactual thinking]].&lt;ref name=BAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alquist, J.L., M. Daly, T. Stillman, and R.F. Baumeister, (2009). [Belief in determinism decreases counterfactual thinking].

Roese. 2008. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking. Personality and Social Psychology 12: 168–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.&lt;ref name=Holton/&gt;

==Eastern philosophy==

===Hindu philosophy===
{{see also|Free will in theology#Hinduism}}
The six orthodox ([[astik]]a) schools of thought in [[Hindu philosophy]] do not agree with each other entirely on the question of free will. For the [[Samkhya]], for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (''kaivalya'') consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fapXqp-JSL0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=kaivalya|title=The ascetic self: subjectivity, memory and tradition |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-60401-7|page=73|last=Flood|first=Gavin|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Yoga]] school, only [[Ishvara]] is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the [[Nyaya]] and [[Vaisheshika]] schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not seem to make explicit claims about determinism or free will.&lt;ref name="koller"&gt;Koller, J. (2007) ''Asian Philosophies''. 5th ed. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-092385-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quotation from [[Swami Vivekananda]], a [[Vedanta|Vedantist]], offers a good example of the worry about free will in the Hindu tradition.
{{quote|text=Therefore we see at once that there cannot be any such thing as free-will; the very words are a contradiction, because will is what we know, and everything that we know is within our universe, and everything within our universe is moulded by conditions of time, space and causality. ... To acquire freedom we have to get beyond the limitations of this universe; it cannot be found here.&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;}}
However, the preceding quote has often been misinterpreted as Vivekananda implying that everything is predetermined. What Vivekananda actually meant by lack of free will was that the will was not "free" because it was heavily influenced by the law of cause and effect&amp;nbsp;– "The will is not free, it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect, but there is something behind the will which is free."&lt;ref name = "viveka"&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda]] (1907) {{cite web |url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_5/sayings_and_utterances.htm |title=Sayings and utterances |publisher=ramakrishnavivekananda.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda never said things were absolutely determined and placed emphasis on the power of conscious choice to alter one's past [[Karma in Hinduism|karma]]: "It is the coward and the fool who says this is his [[Destiny|fate]]. But it is the strong man who stands up and says I will make my own fate."&lt;ref name = "viveka"/&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
[[Buddhism]] accepts both freedom and determinism (or something similar to it), but in spite of its focus towards the human agency, rejects the western concept of a total agent from external sources.&lt;ref name="Gier"&gt;Gier, Nicholas and Kjellberg, Paul. "Buddhism and the Freedom of the Will: Pali and Mahayanist Responses" in Freedom and Determinism. Campbell, Joseph Keim; O'Rourke, Michael; and Shier, David. 2004. MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], "There is free action, there is retribution, but I see no agent that passes out from one set of momentary elements into another one, except the [connection] of those elements."&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt; Buddhists believe in neither absolute free will, nor determinism. It preaches a middle doctrine, named ''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'' in [[Sanskrit]], often translated as "inter-dependent arising". This theory is also called "Conditioned Genesis" or "[[Dependent Origination]]". It teaches that every volition is a conditioned action as a result of ignorance. In part, it states that free will is inherently conditioned and not "free" to begin with. It is also part of the theory of [[karma in Buddhism]]. The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's [[destiny]] in future lives.

In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (that is that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is unwise, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that humans have no choice in life or that their lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). ''Pubbekatahetuvada'', the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject [[agency (philosophy)|agenthood]], the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality. Ancient India had many heated arguments about the nature of causality with [[Jain]]s, [[Nyaya|Nyayists]], [[Samkhya|Samkhyists]], [[Cārvāka]]ns, and Buddhists all taking slightly different lines. In many ways, the Buddhist position is closer to a theory of "conditionality" than a theory of "causality", especially as it is expounded by [[Nagarjuna]] in the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]''.&lt;ref name="Gier"/&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Free will in theology}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Antonio Rodríguez - Saint Augustine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Augustine's view of free will and predestination would go on to have a profound impact on Christian theology]]

The notions of free will and predestination are heavily debated among Christians. Free will in the Christian sense is the ability to choose between good or evil. Among Catholics, there are those holding to [[Thomism]], adopted from what [[Thomas Aquinas]] put forth in the ''[[Summa Theologica]].'' There are also some holding to [[Molinism]] which was put forth by Jesuit priest [[Luis de Molina]]. Among Protestants there is [[Arminianism]], held primarily by [[Methodist]] and some [[Baptist]], and formulated by Dutch theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]; and there is also [[Calvinism]] held by most in the [[Reformed]] tradition which was formulated by the French Reformed theologian, [[John Calvin]]. John Calvin was heavily influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo]] views on predestination put forth in his work ''On the Predestination of the Saints.'' [[Martin Luther]] seems to hold views on predestination similar to Calvinism in his ''[[On the Bondage of the Will]],'' thus rejecting free will. In condemnation of Calvin and Luther views, the Council of Trent declared that "the free will of man, moved and excited by God, can by its consent co-operate with God, Who excites and invites its action; and that it can thereby dispose and prepare itself to obtain the grace of justification. The will can resist grace if it chooses. It is not like a lifeless thing, which remains purely passive. Weakened and diminished by Adam's fall, free will is yet not destroyed in the race (Sess. VI, cap. i and v)."

[[Paul the Apostle]] discusses Predestination in some of his Epistles.

"''For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many brethren; and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.''” —[[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 8:29–30

“''He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will.''” —[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 1:5

The exact meaning of these verses has been debated by Christian theologians throughout history.

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bas relief]] of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
[[Maimonides]] reasoned that human beings have free will (at least in the context of choosing to do good or evil).  Without free will, the demands of [[Nevi'im#Latter Prophets|the prophets]] would have been meaningless, there would be no need for the [[Torah]], and justice could not be administered.  In Maimonides's view, human free will is granted by God as part of the universe's design.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Teshuvah 5:4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

In [[Islam]] the theological issue is not usually how to reconcile free will with God's foreknowledge, but with God's ''jabr'', or divine commanding power. [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ash'ari]] developed an "acquisition" or "dual-agency" form of compatibilism, in which human free will and divine ''jabr'' were both asserted, and which became a cornerstone of the dominant [[Ash'ari]] position.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Montgomery Watt|Watt, Montgomery]]. Free-Will and Predestination in Early Islam. Luzac &amp; Co.: London 1948; [[Harry Austryn Wolfson|Wolfson, Harry]]. The Philosophy of Kalam, Harvard University Press 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shia]] Islam, Ash'aris understanding of a higher balance toward [[predestination]] is challenged by most theologians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mananddestiny/3.htm |title=Man and His Destiny |publisher=Al-islam.org |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free will, according to Islamic doctrine is the main factor for man's accountability in his/her actions throughout life. Actions taken by people exercising free will are counted on the [[Day of Judgement]] because they are their own; however, the free will happens with the permission of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tosun|first=Ender|title=Guide to Understanding Islam|year=2012|location=Istanbul|isbn=978-605-631-981-5|url=http://www.islamicinformationcenter.info/understandingislam.pdf|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===

The philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] claimed that divine omnipotence cannot be separated from divine goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Timothy P. (1998) "Arminian edification: Kierkegaard on grace and free will" in ''Cambridge Companion to Kierkegaard'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As a truly omnipotent and good being, God could create beings with true freedom over God. Furthermore, God would voluntarily do so because "the greatest good ... which can be done for a being, greater than anything else that one can do for it, is to be truly free."&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. (1848) ''Journals and Papers'', vol. III. Reprinted in Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1967–78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s "[[Plantinga's free will defense|free will defense]]" is a contemporary expansion of this theme, adding how God, free will, and [[problem of evil|evil]] are consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, J.L. (1955) "Evil and Omnipotence", ''Mind'', new series, vol. 64, pp. 200–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers follow [[William of Ockham]] in holding that necessity and possibility are defined with respect to a given point in time and a given matrix of empirical circumstances, and so something that is merely possible from the perspective of one observer may be necessary from the perspective of an omniscient.&lt;ref name="ockham"&gt;Ockham, William. Predestination, God's Knowledge, and Future Contingents, early 14th century, trans. Marilyn McCord Adams and [[Norman Kretzmann]] 1982, Hackett, esp pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers follow [[Philo of Alexandria]], a philosopher known for his [[homocentrism]], in holding that free will is a feature of a human's [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and thus that non-human [[animal]]s lack free will.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. A. Wolfson]], ''Philo'', 1947 Harvard University Press; Religious Philosophy, 1961 Harvard University Press; and "St. Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy" in Religious Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Homeokinetics''' is the study of self-organizing, [[complex systems]].&lt;ref name=homeo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/1978%20Physical%20Basis%20-%20Homeokinetics.pdf|title=Homeokinetics: A Physical Science for Complex Systems|author=H. Soodak and A. Iberall|publisher=Science 201:579-582|date=August 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Homeok2016&gt;Iberall, A.S., Homeokinetics: The Basics. Strong Voices Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trinity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/ecopsyc/homeokinetics/discussion/HKphysics.html|title=The Physics of Complex Systems|author=Arthur Iberall|publisher=Trinity College|accessdate=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standard [[physics]] studies systems at separate levels, such as [[atomic physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[biophysics]], [[social physics]], and galactic physics. Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as [[mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]], and the laws of [[thermodynamics]] provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists [[Harry Soodak]] and [[Arthur Iberall]]. Complex systems are [[universes]], [[galaxies]], [[social systems]], [[people]], or even those that seem as simple as [[gases]]. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic-like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;

==History==
[[Arthur Iberall]], [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Harry Soodak]] developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics.  It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA [[exobiology]] program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processes&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Analysis of the dynamic systems response of some internal human systems. Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information; Reports to NASA: CR-129, Oct. 1964; CR-141, Jan. l965; CR-219, May 1965; Interim Report, Dec. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S., M. Ehrenberg and S.Z. Cardon. General-dynamics of the physical-chemical systems in mammals. Contractors Report to NASA, NASW-1066, Aug. 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested [[hierarchy]] and with an extensive range of time scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Hierarchical regulation in the complex biological organism. Record of the IEEE Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Phila., October, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A.S. and W.S. McCulloch. The organizing principle of complex living systems. J. Basic Engr., ASME 290-294, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as [[heterarchy]]) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with [[nature]], [[life]], [[human]], [[mind]], and [[society]]. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of [[UCLA]], where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems.

==Self-organizing Complex Systems==

A system is a collective of interacting ‘atomistic’-like entities.&lt;ref name=Homeok2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=homeo/&gt; The word ‘atomism’ is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‘kinetic’ theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‘energy’ in interactive collisions. That so-called ‘equipartitioning’ process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction—few in number—that influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‘density’ of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair-by-pair interactions, internal actions such as [[vibrations]], [[rotations]], and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large—in time—cycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‘engaged’ for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing [[Aristotle]] as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic-metalogic for physics, e.g., [[metaphysics]], then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe.

==Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics==

Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels.&lt;ref name="primer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeokinetics.org/pdf%20files/HomeokineticsPrimer.pdf|title=Primer on Homeokinetics: A Physical Foundation for Complex Systems|author=Arthur Iberall and Harry Soodak|publisher=Cri-de-Coeur Press|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

==Applications==
A homeokinetic approach to complex systems has been applied to ecological psychology,&lt;ref&gt;Iberall, A., A physical (homeokinetic) foundation for the Gibsonian theory of perception and action, Ecolog. Psychol. 7(1): 37-68, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropology, geology,

'''''Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois''''', {{ussc|431|720|1977}} was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case on [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]] which established that indirect purchasers of goods or services along a supply chain cannot seek remedy for [[antitrust]] actions committed by the manufacturer or service provider, leaving this option only reserved for direct purchasers. The decision in this case has become known as the "Illinois Brick doctrine" used to determine who has [[Case or Controversy Clause|Article III standing]] to bring antitrust charges against companies.

==Background==
In the early 1970s, the United States government filed both civil and criminal charges against eleven [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete brick]] manufacturers in Chicago, stating that they were engaging in [[price fixing]]. The defendants pleaded ''[[nolo contendere]]'' and entered into a settlement with the government. 

Spurred by this, the government of Illinois filed a new suit at the eleven concrete brick manufacturers, asserting they were engaged in conspiratorial price-fixing for bricks to be used for government construction, violating the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and seeking treble damage. The defendants sought to have the case dismissed as the government were not direct purchasers of the bricks. In general, these companies sold bricks directly to masonry contractors for them to complete jobs given to them by [[general contractor]]s during the construction of new buildings; the defendants stated that the government, in paying for the construction of these buildings, were not the ones purchasing the bricks themselves. The district court agreed, citing both the Supreme Court ruling of ''Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.'' ({{ussc|392|481|1968|el=no}}) that emphasized that direct purchases of goods have the right to sue manufacturers for anti-trust, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]]'s decision in ''Commonwealth Edison v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.'' (315 F.2d 564, 567) that determined that the ultimate consumers of goods along a supply chain were "too remote and [in]consequential to provide legal standing to sue against the alleged antitrust violator". 

The state appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which overturned the district court's ruling, arguing that the Sherman Act allows for any person that was harmed by antitrust behaviors may bring suit for triple damages. ([https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1910166399232658727 536 F.2d 1163]). The brick manufacturers petitioned to the Supreme Court for writ of certorari, which was granted. Oral arguments were heard on March 23, 1977 with the decision given on June 9, 1977.

==Judgment==
In a 6-3 decision, The Supreme Court held that indirect victims of a price fixing conspiracy had no standing to sue for antitrust violations for raised prices. The majority opinion was written by Justice [[Byron White]], joined by Justices [[Warren Burger]], [[Potter Stewart]], [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], [[William Rehnquist]], and [[John Paul Stevens]]. It held that if an indirect purchaser of overpriced goods could sue, then it would open the door to “multiple recovery”. An overcharge might be collected if more than one entity in the chain of distribution of the product could recover for the same violation. White was concerned with the Court making a significant overrule to their previous decision in ''Hanover Shoe''.

Justice [[William J. Brennan Jr.|William Brennan]] wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Harry Blackmun]]. Brennan wrote that the majority's approach to stay consistent with ''Hanover Shoe'' undercut the strength of the language that Congress had written into the Sherman Act. Justice Blackmun also wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing the case's close timing with ''Hanover'' likely impacted the result; if ''Hanover'' had not been decided, the courts would have likely ruled in favor of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11635537603314405616&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
Two exceptions to the direct purchaser rule are potentially recognized in various jurisdictions: the control exception and the preexisting cost-plus contract exception.

The control exception, noted in footnote 16 of the Illinois Brick opinion, states that in some situations an indirect purchaser might maintain an antitrust action where the direct purchases is owned or controlled by its customer.  This exception is narrowly construed and limited to situations where the relationship involves a functional or economic unity between the direct and indirect purchaser such that there has been effectively one sale.  See Jewish Hospital Association v. Stewart Mechanical Enterprise, Inc., 628 F.2d 971 (6th Cir. 1980).

The preexisting cost-plus contract exception states that an indirect purchaser may have standing where the all costs initially borne by the direct purchaser are passed on to the indirect purchaser pursuant to a preexisting cost-plus contract between the parties.  In such situation, the overcharging is not absorbed by the direct purchaser but is instead passed on to the indirect purchaser. See Illinois v. Panhandle E. Pipe Line Co. 852 F.2d 891 (7th Cir 1988).

==Significance==
Many state antitrust laws reject the ''Illinois Brick'' doctrine. Thus, in ''California v. ARC America Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/490/93/case.html Justia], 490 U.S. 93 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court rejected arguments that ''Illinois Brick'' preempted broader state antitrust laws such as that of California, which rejected the doctrine.

A 2007 Antitrust Modernization Commission Report proposed that Congress should abandon the ''Illinois Brick'' doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;The Antitrust Modernization Commission was created pursuant to the Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-273, §§ 11051-60, 116 Stat. 1856. The Commission submitted its Report and Recommendations to Congress and the President on April 2, 2007. The Report and other documents relating to its work are found at its website—http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/amc/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, if adopted, would weaken the federal right of action for direct purchasers by reviving as a defense the fact that the direct purchaser had passed on the overcharge instead of absorbing it, while creating a federal right of action for indirect purchasers. Federal rights of action under the proposal would not be exclusive, but state law claims would be subject to expanded federal jurisdiction to allow consolidation of all claims from a price fix in a single court for both discovery and trial. All recoveries in the consolidated actions would be limited to the initial overcharge, trebled.

The applicability of ''Illinios Brick'' towards digital marketplaces is expected to be the subject of the pending Supreme Court case, ''[[Apple Inc. v. Pepper]]'', to be heard in the 2018 term, which relates to whether consumers of third-party mobile applications through a marketplace can bring anti-trust actions against the owner of the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17479480/supreme-court-apple-vs-pepper-antitrust-lawsuit-standing-explainer | title = What happens if Apple loses its Supreme Court App Store antitrust appeal? |first = Adi | last = Robertson | date = June 20, 2018 | accessdate = June 20, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Studies exemplify [[National Peace Council (Ghana)]], Department on Ethnic, Religious Policy and Civil Society Interaction (Kyrgyzstan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Chetan|last2=de la Haye|first2=Jos|title=‘Hybrid Peacemaking: Building National "Infrastructures for Peace"’|journal=Global Governance|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–20|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/UNDP_BCPR_Chetan%20Kumar_Infrastructures%20for%20Peace.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economical approaches in Guyana, Bolivia and Kenya and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] contributes to about 30 infrastructures for peace projects around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Jordan|title=Infrastructures for Peace as a Path to Resilient Societies: An Institutional Perspective|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=14–24|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15423166.2013.774806#.VXvk9Pmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

[[File:Cernozemski ustaska uniforma.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The assassin of Alexander I of Yugoslavia Chernozemski as instructor in Janka-Puszta, 1934.]]
'''Janka-Puszta''' or '''Jankovac''' was a training camp set up for the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Paris| first=Edmond| year=1961| pp=23| title=Genocide in Satellite Croatia 1941-1945|publisher=King's|isbn=1258163462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was located in the [[Zala County]] of [[Hungary]], close to the border of the then [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] near the villages of [[Murakeresztúr]] and [[Belezna]]. The camp was one of a string of training camps established in Hungary and Italy by the [[Ustashe]]. It housed several hundred émigré recruits, mostly manual laborers returning from Western Europe and North America. The recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the leader of the [[Ustashe]], [[Ante Pavelić]], took part in militant exercises, and produced anti-Serb propaganda material.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}}

==Background==

In the summer of 1931, the location was leased by the Hungary authorities to [[Gustav Perčec]] who served as the camp commander. [[Ustashe]] members were already active in the region on both sides of the border at the time. Situated on a hill on approximately 150 acres, the camp consisted of two buildings, open fields and a forest. In November 1931, the first members of the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation arrived. The camp started out as a sort of [[commune]], a refuge for fugitive members of the [[Ustashe]] group who had recently escaped from Yugoslavia. After months of preparation, Gustav Perčec  began to actively seek members to join the camp.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}} In co-operation with the Hungarian authorities, [[Ustashe]] fugitives crossing the Yugoslav-Hungarian border were interviewed by Hungarian police and their details were passed onto Percec. After it was confirmed a fugitive was not a Yugoslav spy, the Hungarian police would take them to the camp and would be provided a false name and acceptance into the camp.&lt;ref name="Šadek"&gt;Vladimir Šadek: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/128108 Logor Janka-puszta i razvoj ustaške organizacije u Podravini do 1934.], Podravina, sv. 11, broj 21, Str. 47 - 56 Koprivnica 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Those living at the training camp partook in regimented programs. Alongside [[Croatian nationalism]] indoctrination, [[Ustashe]] members took part in military training and also, conducted duties to keep the camp running. The head instructors of weapons training were Hungarian officers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Toynbee| first=Arnold|year=1935| pp=546–47| title=Survey of International Affairs 1934| publisher=Oxford University Press| asin=B0006DIHDI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the living conditions at the camp were said to have been poor, with camp members receiving severe punishment for any misbehavior. Much of the weaponry came from Italy, and many high ranking and prominent members of the [[Ustashe]] organisation visited the camp including: [[Ante Pavelic]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt; In relation with the agreement reached in 1929 between the pro-Bulgarian [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and the Ustashe on a common struggle against Yugoslavia. As result, Bulgarian [[Vlado Chernozemski]] was designated as their instructor in terrorist attacks and was send to Italy in 1931. Since mid-1932, taking steps to improve its relations with Yugoslavia, the Italian authorities have closed the [[Borgo Val di Taro]] Ustashe camp. Thus [[Vlado Chernozemski]], was transferred  to Janka-Puszta. From the period of 1932-1934, the camp served as the ideological and technical support base for many militant actions including the [[Velebit uprising]] and the assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

In the camp lived also the lover of Perčec-Jelka Pogorelec, who was an agent of Serbian intelligence. One night she secretly crossed the border. In October 1933 she published a series of materials for the camp in the "Novosti" newspaper in [[Zagreb]]. This greatly complicated Yugoslavia's relations with Hungary. Cross-border conflicts arose between the two countries, accompanied by mutual attacks. Thus, in April 1934, Belgrade made a formal complaint to the [[League of Nations]]. There was also a complaint filled by the Hungarian regent [[Horthy]]. The League formed a commission to review the case in May. Under these circumstances, the Hungarian authorities were forced to close the camp and urgently move the Ustashe in the nearby town of [[Nagykanizsa]]. When the members of the  international commission arrived at the camp, they recognized that the complaint about a terrorist camp was not correct. In this way the camp fell into disuse in late 1934.&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

[[File:Japanese River Otter Skelton.jpg|260px|right|thumb|Skeleton of Japanese river otter. Exhibit in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], [[Tokyo]]]]
The {{nihongo|'''Japanese river otter''' (''Lutra lutra whiteleyi'')|日本川獺|Nihon-kawauso&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'', Kenkyusha Limited, Tokyo 1991, {{ISBN|4-7674-2015-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is an extinct variety of [[otter]] formerly widespread in Japan. Dating back to the 1880s, it was even seen in [[Tokyo]]. The population suddenly shrank in the 1930s, and the mammal nearly vanished. Since then, it has only been spotted several times, in 1964 in the [[Seto Inland Sea]], and in the Uwa Sea in 1972 and 1973. The last official sighting was in the southern part of [[Kōchi Prefecture]] in 1979, when it was photographed in the mouth of the Shinjo River in [[Susaki, Kōchi|Susaki]]. It was subsequently classified as a "Critically Endangered" species on the Japanese Red List.&lt;ref name="redlist"&gt;{{cite web | title=Red List of Threatened Mammals of Japan | url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/red_mammals.txt | publisher=Ministry of the Environment | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 28, 2012, the Japanese river otter was officially declared extinct by the Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref name="mainichi20120828"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120828p2a00m0na016000c.html |title=Japanese river otter declared extinct |date=August 28, 2012 |work=Mainichi jp |publisher=The Mainichi Newspapers |location=Japan |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901105043/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20120828p2a00m0na016000c.html |archivedate=September 1, 2012 |accessdate=August 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120829a6.html Japanese river otter declared extinct]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', August 29, 2012, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is the official animal symbol of [[Ehime Prefecture]].&lt;ref name=facts/&gt; In February 2017, a wild otter was caught on camera on [[Tsushima Island]], [[Nagasaki Prefecture]]. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&amp;k=2017081700680 Jiji.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Several genetic studies have suggested that the Japanese river otter should be treated as a distinct species ''Lutra nippon'' rather than a subspecies of ''Lutra lutra''.&lt;ref name="Suzuki et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suzuki |first1=Tomohiko |last2=Yuasa |first2=Hajime |last3=Machida |first3=Yoshihiko |year=1996 |title=Phylogenetic position of the Japanese river otter ''Lutra nippon'' inferred from the nucleotide sequence of 224 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome ''b'' gene |journal=Zoological Science |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=621-626 |doi=10.2108/zsj.13.621 |url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.2108/zsj.13.621}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last1=Yamamoto|first1=K.|last2=Ando|first2=M.|year=2011|title=Trends in otter-related newspaper articles in Japan over 135 years|publisher=IUCN Otter Specialist|series=Group Bulletin|volume=28|pages=31-34|url=http://www.iucnosg.org/Bulletin/Volume28B/Yamamoto_Ando_2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Fully grown, a Japanese otter was between {{convert|65|and|80|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, with a tail measuring {{convert|45|to|50|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It had a thick, lush coat of dark brown fur with short webbed feet. In addition the river otter has two types/sets of fur. Data has shown that the river otter would shed their under fur fully from May to August. After the shedding of the under fur, the otter shed their guard hair from August to November. This allowed them to adjust to the seasons changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Blundell | first1 = Gail M. | last2 = Ben-David | first2 = Merav | last3 = Bowyer | first3 = R. Terry | year = 2002 | title = Sociality in river otters: cooperative foraging or reproductive strategies? | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 134–141 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/13.1.134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The otter had a lifespan of up to 25 years.&lt;ref name=facts/&gt;

== Habits ==
A nocturnal creature, an otter only left its den after dark to forage for food. Claiming a territory about ten miles in diameter, it marked the area with its droppings about one to three miles apart and sets up three or four nests under rocks or inside bushes. The otters were always on the move, visiting each den only once every three to four days. They were considered an adult after only one year. They would then venture on their own, but continue in solitude unless ready to mate.&lt;ref name="Extinct Otters"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mueller|first1=Jennifer|title=Extinct Otters|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/extinct-otters-6758.html|website=PawNation|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
In general, the Japanese River Otter was ready to reproduce when they were two to three years old. In addition, the males sought out the females in the reproduction process. Besides during reproduction and with the exception of young males staying with their mother for a range of two to three years until they were mature, female otters and male otters didn't generally live together. When a male otter calls out to a female otter, she must give him permission for the mating. If she does not, the male would move onto the next female otter. For the male to know that the female is interested in mating, the female will roll around with the male, which releases hormones. The Japanese River Otter could have anywhere from one to six offspring per litter. Once born, the baby otters are completely blind for a month, leaving them utterly helpless. The female otter makes for a great mother; nursing her young for up to eight hours a day, as well as teaching them valuable lessons and protecting them. After the pups are around the age of four months, the mother otter will introduce her youth to solid food and start to teach them how to hunt.&lt;ref&gt;"Otter Reproduction." Otter Facts and Information. BioExpedition.com, n.d. Web. 24 Oct. 2014. &lt;http://www.otter-world.com/otter-reproduction/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet ==
Like most otters, the Japanese river otter was not an especially picky eater. While it primarily fed on fish, crab, and shrimp; it also ate eels, beetles, watermelons, and sweet potatoes. Many of these Japanese otters eat about 15% to 25% of their own body weight. Many otters spend around six hours to find food because of their difficult living space and their competition for food. The Japanese otter was known as one of the top carnivores in the aquatic food chain.

== Cause of extinction ==
In the past, there were thousands of river otters in Japan. Starting in the Meiji period, the government of Japan adopted a policy of increasing wealth and military prowess. Animal pelts thus became very valuable since they could be exported for money. As a result, Japanese river otters started to be hunted throughout the country. Their numbers soon dwindled. Populations made a slight comeback after the creation of hunting regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motokazu|first1=Ando|title=Lake Biwa: Interactions between Nature and People|date=2012|publisher=Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg|location=New York|isbn=978-94-007-1782-4|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, pollution and human development then harmed their environment and resources to build their habitats. This pollution terminated their food sources in the rivers, causing them to hunt in more dangerous settings.&lt;ref name="Extinct Otters"/&gt; These causes grew rapidly, resulting in the extinction of the Japanese river otter in the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Epstein|first1=Mike|title=Japanese River Otter Declared Extinct After Three Decades|url=http://www.themarysue.com/japanese-otter-extinct/|website=The Mary Sue|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to prove its existence ==
Throughout the 1990s, there were several attempts to locate a surviving Japanese river otter.

In December 1991, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Environmental Agency of Japan]] in partnership with the Kochi prefectural government assembled a research team of experts and began their search. In March 1992, the research group found hair and excrement in Kochi Prefecture and believed to have come from an otter. Also found were three footprints, and ten additional excrement samples. After an analysis of a cross-section of the hair, the researchers determined that it came from an otter. An official from the agency's wildlife protection section stated that the hair was "scientifically solid evidence that confirms the existence of the Japanese Otter."

In 1994, zoological experts visited the area where the excrement was found. They discovered remains of the animal's urine, which the animal is believed to leave during its courtship. The prefectural government of Kochi set up an infrared camera for six months from October 1994 to April 1995 in an effort to capture it on film, but all that was recorded were animals such as [[raccoon dog]]s.

Between March 4 and 9, 1996, a group of zoo officials, municipal government officials and animals lovers from across the country searched for the river otter in the areas where finds have been made in the past. Such areas included coastal areas in Susaki, areas along the Niyodo River running through Sakawacho and Inocho, and coastal areas along [[Shimanto River]]. No evidence of the animal's existence was found.

Among these, the presumed sighting reported in Kochi by a local artist with a detailed sketch was regarded "highly trustable" by Yoshihiko Machida, an emeritus professor at the [[Kōchi University]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Mainichi Shimbun]]. 2017. [https://mainichi.jp/articles/20170329/k00/00e/040/212000c ニホンカワウソ　２００９年に目撃情報]. Retrieved on April 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Machida also pointed that the previous studies by the prefecture had been restricted only among coastal areas and thus not filling the definition of extinct species by [[IUCN]]. Regarding this, a survey was conducted by [[Ehime Prefecture]] in 2014, noting several recent sightings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ehime Prefecture]]. [https://www.pref.ehime.jp/h25115/biodiversity/documents/26kawauso.pdf. ニホンカワウソ生息状況調査事業 調査概要（26 年度）] (pdf). Retrieved on April 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, a wild otter was filmed alive on [[Tsushima Island]] in [[Nagasaki Prefecture]], Japan. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild otter filmed alive in first Japan sighting since 1979|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/17/national/wild-otter-thought-extinct-filmed-alive-first-japan-sighting-since-1979/|website=The Japan Times Online|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic studies ==
Research done in the early 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan revealed some interesting facts about the genes of the Japanese River Otter. For many years, it was thought that the Japanese river otter was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter ''Lutra lutra''. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified Japanese river otter corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the Japanese river otter was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies. The name for the Japanese river otter was then changed from ''L. l. whiteleyi'' to ''Lutra nippon''.&lt;ref name="Suzuki et al. 1996"/&gt;

==Other uses==
The Japanese river otter was used as medicine to help cure [[tuberculosis]]. Typically a dosage that would last about forty days would cost roughly three hundred US dollars.&lt;ref name="motokazu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Motokazu|first=Ando|title=Extinction of Japanese River Otter|url=http://www.otterspecialistgroup.org/Library/Colloquium_10/Presentations/10-11-10-40_Ando.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in the early 20th century, the otter pelts were used for military purposes as well. In 1929, the government established the "Hunters Association" which called upon people to hunt and skin these otters, which was one of the main causes of their eventual extinction.&lt;ref name="motokazu"/&gt;

==In culture==
The Japanese river otter was named the official animal symbol of Japan's [[Ehime Prefecture]], a region of Japan in northwestern [[Shikoku]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese River Otter Facts|url=http://extinct-animals-facts.com/Recently-Extinct-Animal-Facts/Extinct-Japanese-River-Otter-Facts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Army 52300 "Tell Me A Story" promotes academic, emotional connections.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention.|A parent and child engage in joint attention]]
'''Joint attention''' or '''shared attention''' is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of [[eye gaze|eye-gazing]], [[pointing]] or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a [[cross-sectional]] description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's [[attention]] using eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Dunham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=C.|last2=Dunham |first2=P |title= Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1995 |isbn=0-8058-1437-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying [[intention]]. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing [[reference]]. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of [[language development]] including [[language comprehension|comprehension]], [[Language production|production]] and [[Vocabulary development|word learning]]. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and developmental disorders such as [[autism]].

Other animals such as [[great ape]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[horse]]s also show some elements of joint attention.

== Humans ==

=== Levels of joint attention ===
Defining levels of joint attention is important in determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.

Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt; For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=R.P. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=185–204|isbn=0-19-924563-0 |chapter=What puts the jointness in joint attention?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.

Dyadic joint attention is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is especially true for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case of the adult, speech.

Shared gaze occurs when two individuals are simply looking at an object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okamoto-Barth |first1=S.|last2=Tomonaga |first2=M. |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Tanaka |title= Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |pages=155–171|isbn=4-431-30246-8 |chapter=Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared gaze is the lowest level of joint attention.

Individuals who engage in triadic joint attention must understand both gaze and intention to establish common reference. Gaze refers to a child's understanding of the link between mental activity and the physical act of seeing. Intention refers to the child's ability to understand the goal of another person's mental processes.

[[File:Click Here. No, Here.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention through pointing.|A parent and child engage in joint attention through [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]]]]
For an individual to engage in joint attention they must establish [[reference]].&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Following the gaze or directive actions (such as pointing) of others is a common way of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; For an individual to understand that following gaze establishes reference the individual must display:
* Recognition that looking is intentional behavior directed to external objects and events. Following gaze serves the purpose of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"&gt;D'Entremont, B., Yazbeck, A., Morgan, A. &amp; MacAulay, S. (2007).

Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An understanding that looking results in the mental experience of seeing an object or event.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that eyes are responsible for seeing.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that others share in the capacity to see things.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* An understanding that voice direction helps determine whether the speaker is talking to them and what he or she is referring to or focused on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossano|first=Federico |author2=Malinda Carpenter |author3=Michael Tomasello|title=One-Year-Old Infants Follow Others’ Voice Direction|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|pages=1298–1302|doi=10.1177/0956797612450032|volume=23|pmid=23070306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaze becomes more complex with age and practice.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; As gaze increases in complexity, individuals are better able to discriminate what others are referring to.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt; Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt; Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt;

=== Intention ===
The ability to identify [[intention]] is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are able to enter into and direct another's attention.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = M. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Joint attention and early language | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1454–1463 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, D.A. (1995). Understanding the link between joint attention and language. In C. Moore &amp; P.J. Dunham (Eds.) ''Joint attention: Its origins and role in development'' (pp.131-158). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who are intentional in their actions display regularity in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, and then use hands to make contact with and manipulate the object.&lt;ref name= "Mumme"&gt;Mumme, D., Bushnell, E., DiCorcia, J. &amp; Lariviere, L. (2007). Infants' use of gaze cues to interpret others' actions and emotional reactions. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 143–170). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, V. (2005). Before the third element: Understanding attention to self. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 85–109). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint attention plays an important role in the development of [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.&lt;ref name="Heal2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=J. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=34–44|chapter=Joint attention and understanding the mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language comprehension ===
[[File:Wpm02 05.JPG|thumb|right|alt= Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.|Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.]]

The ability of children to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of [[Attention seeking|attentional behaviors]] such as [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Episodes of joint attention provide children with a great deal of information about objects by establishing reference and intention.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, A. (2005). Infants' understanding of the actions involved in joint attention. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 110–128). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's talk: Learning to use language.'' (pp. 67–88). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.

===Language production===
An infant's social environment relates to his or her later language development.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rollins | first1 = P. R. | year = 2003 | title = Caregivers' contingent comments to 9-month-old infants: Relationships with later language | url = | journal = Applied Psycholinguistics | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 221–234 | doi = 10.1017/S0142716403000110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson&gt;Oates J, &amp; Grayson A. (2004). Cognitive and Language Development in Children. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-1045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants are more likely to engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in [[Vocabulary development|word learning]], a crucial aspect of language development.&lt;ref name=Hirotani&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotani | first1 = M. | last2 = Stets | first2 = M. | last3 = Striano | first3 = T. | last4 = Friederic | first4 = A.D. | year = 2009 | title = Joint attention helps infants learn new words: event-related potential evidence | url = | journal = Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 600–605 | doi = 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32832a0a7c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to [[Social emotional development|socio-emotional development]]===
Joint attention and the ability to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] that rely on the sharing of [[experience]] and [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name= "MacPherson"&gt;MacPherson, A. C. &amp; Moore, C. (2007). Attentional control by gaze cues in infancy. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 53–76). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's [[motivation]] to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter, M. (2011). Social Cognition and Social Motivations in Infancy. In U. Goswami (Eds.), ''The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development'' (pp. 106–128). West Sussex, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.{{ISBN|1-4051-9116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[attachment theory]], infants need to develop a relationship with a [[primary caregiver]] to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to [[language development]], joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hecke | first1 = Amy Vaughan | last2 = Mundy | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Acra | first3 = C.Franciose | last4 = Block | first4 = Jessica J. | last5 = Delgado | first5 = Christine E.F. | last6 = Parlade | first6 = Meaghan V. | last7 = Myers | first7 = Jessica A. | last8 = Neal | first8 = A.

===Developmental markers in infancy===
At the age of 2 months, children engage in dyadic joint attention and conversation-like exchanges with adults during which each is the focus of the other's attention and they take turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by [[Edward Tronick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-galinsky/trusting-relationships-ar_b_1123524.html Trusting Relationships Are Central to Children's Learning -- Lessons From Edward Tronick], Huffington Post, 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the [[Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale]]. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by:
*Orienting themselves in the same general direction (in their visual field) as another person.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; Infants also cease to focus on the first interesting (salient) object they encounter.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Following outward directed gaze of adults.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Extending more sophisticated behaviors, such as gaze checking, when initial gaze following is not successful.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt;
*Paying more attention to eyes, responding to shifts in eye gaze direction, and directing their own attention based on another's gaze.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

At age 8 months, infants demonstrate joint attention through proto-declarative pointing, particularly in girls.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2008)''Cognitive Development: The Learning Brain''. New York, NY:Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; At 9 months of age, infants begin to display triadic joint attention.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants also will display joint attention activities, such as communicative gestures, social referencing, and using the behavior of others to guide response to novel things.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;

At one year of age, joint attention is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 15 months, children [[theory of mind|recognize the minds of others]].&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At this age, children also recognize the importance of eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] experience of seeing and the role of eyes&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; Two-year-olds are also capable of [[Mental representation|representational thought]] or [[Information processing|increased memory]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt;

=== Individuals with disabilities ===
Several studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes.&lt;ref name= Bhat&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhat | first1 = AN | last2 = Galloway | first2 = JC | last3 = Landa | first3 = RJ | year = | title = Social and non-social visual attention patterns and associative learning in infants at risk for autism | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 9| pages = 989–997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02262.x | pmc = 3653974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. [[Autism spectrum|Autism spectrum disorders]]).&lt;ref name= Bhat/&gt; A core deficit noted in [[autism]] is eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruinsma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koegel | first2 = R. | last3 = Koegel | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Joint attention and children with autism: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 169–175 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20036 | pmid=15611988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of [[social competence]].&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nowakowski | first1 = Matlida E. | last2 = Tasker | first2 = Susan L. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = Louis A. | year = 2009 | title = Establishment of joint attention in dyads involving hearing mothers of deaf and hearing children and its relation to adaptive social behavior | url = | journal = American Annals of the Deaf | volume = 154 | issue = 1| pages = 15–29 | doi=10.1353/aad.0.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.&lt;ref name=Bigelow&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bigelow | first1 = A. E. | year = 2003 | title = The development of joint attention in blind infants | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 259–275 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579403000142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==

=== Definitions in non-human animals ===
Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face.&lt;ref name="3OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Social Cognition Development in First 2 Years. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.182-197). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Dyadic joint attention ===
Infant and parent chimpanzees show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner by looking at each other's eyes&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Evolutionary Origins of Mother-Infant Relationship. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.127-141). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Shared gaze ===
Gaze following, or shared gaze, can be found in a number of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"/&gt;{{rp|155–71}} Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also demonstrate shared gaze.&lt;ref name="Ikatura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Itakura |first1=S. |title=Gaze Following and Joint Visual Attention in Nonhuman Animals |journal=Japanese Psychological Research |year=2004 |pages=216–226 |volume=46 |issue=3 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5584.2004.00253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

Chimpanzees are capable of actively locating objects that are the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."&gt;Tomasello et al. &amp; Emery et al. as cited in (2006). Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.155–171). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."/&gt; They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

'''Leon Schidlowsky''' ([[Hebrew]]: ליאון שידלובסקי; born 21 July 1931 in [[Santiago de Chile]]) is a Chilean-Israeli composer and painter. He has written music for [[orchestra]], chamber ensemble, [[choir]], and instruments including the [[piano]], [[violin]], [[cello]], [[flute]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], [[harp]], [[organ (music)|organ]], as well as about sixty-five pieces of music with [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]]. His compositions have been performed in numerous countries with different orchestras under conductors such as [[Aldo Ceccato]], [[Errico Fresis]], [[Clytus Gottwald]], [[Juan Pablo Izquierdo]], [[Erhard Karkoschka]], [[Herbert Kegel]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Hermann Scherchen]], and [[Ingo Schulz]]. The scores of his graphic music have been shown in various exhibitions linked to concerts, such as in the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]], [[Kunsthaus Hamburg]], the [[Wilhelm-Hack-Museum]], [[Ludwigshafen]], and the [[Stadtgalerie Saarbrücken]].

==Biography==
Schidlowsky pursued his secondary studies at the [[Instituto Nacional]] de Chile in Santiago from 1940–47 and studied the piano with [[Roberto Duncker]] at the [[Conservatorio Nacional]] de Chile in [[Santiago (Chile)|Santiago]] from 1942-48. He later studied composition with [[Juan Allende-Blin]] and [[Fré Focke]], as well as [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[Universidad de Chile]] in Santiago from 1948-51. He completed his studies in Germany at the Nordwestdeutsche Musikakademie (later [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]]) in [[Detmold]], where he met his future wife Susanne, whom he married in 1953. They had five children (David, Elias, Judith, and twins Yuval and Noam).

==Chile (1954-1968; 2014)==
After his return to Chile in 1954 Leon Schidlowsky became a member of the avant-garde ensemble [[Grupo Tonus]] in Santiago and served as its director from 1958&amp;ndash;61. This ensemble wanted to spread avant-garde and contemporary music in Chile. In 1956 Schidlowsky produced "Nacimiento", considered the first [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] work composed in Latin America. Between 1956 and 1959 he was member of the [[British Council]] and between 1956 and 1961 a musical adviser of the pantomime ensemble [[Grupo Noisvander]]. He served as director of the music library at the [[Instituto de Extensión Musical]], of the Universidad de Chile (Chilean University) in 1961-62, and as secretary-general of the [[Asociación Nacional de Compositores]] from 1961-63. He also served as director-general of the [[Instituto de Extensión Musical]], Universidad de Chile, from 1962-66. In this period the Institute achieved distinction, with the performance of music that had never been played in Chile before, and with the performance of at least one work by a Chilean composer every year. Besides that, a number of orchestral conductors, soloists, and foreign orchestras visited Chile and made a substantial contribution to the musical culture of the country.

In 1964 he was, together with [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]], a member of the jury in a composers' competition in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The same year he took part in the music symposium "Latin America and the music of our time" (América Latina y la música de nuestros tiempos) in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. In 1965, Schidlowsky was appointed Professor of Composition at the [[Conservatorio Nacional]], Universidad de Chile (Chilean University). In 1966 he participated in the Inter-American Festival in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA, as well as the Festival Interamericano de Música in [[Caracas]], Venezuela. In 1967, he took part in the Festival of Music from [[Spain]] and Latin America, in [[Madrid]], Spain. He participated in the "Festival of the Three Worlds" in [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], Venezuela in 1968, with lectures and discussions with the composers [[Krzyztof Penderecki]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]. The city of Mérida nominated him a "Distinguished Guest of the City". In the same year he received a Fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in order to write an [[opera]], which he completed in Germany.

On 21 August 2014 Leon Schidlowsky was awarded the Chilean [[National Prize for Musical Arts (Chile)|National Prize for Musical Arts]], accompanied  by several homages, press articles and interviews in the local press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/leon-schidlowsky-obtiene-el-premio-nacional-de-artes-musicales/ |title=León Schidlowsky obtiene el Premio Nacional de Artes Musicales |trans-title=León Schidlowsky Gets the National Prize for Musical Arts |author=J.

In 1969, he was appointed Professor for Composition and Music Theory at the [[Samuel Rubin Academy of Music]] at [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1979 he was granted a Sabbatical Year, which he spent in Hamburg. He has given many conferences in Berlin, [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]), [[Lund]] ([[Sweden]]), and [[Saragossa]] (Spain). Schidlowsky received several fellowships from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), and stayed in [[Berlin]] for various periods, where he composed and painted. During one of these sojourns, in 1999, his wife Susanne died; she was buried in [[Tel Aviv]]. Leon Schidlowsky received various prizes for his music, such as at the regular Festivals of Chilean Music ([[Festivales de Música Chilena]]), with works of his being awarded the Chilean Prize [[CRAV]]. In 1996 he received the First Prize for his work ''Absalom'' in the 60th anniversary competition of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]].

In 2000 he was awarded the [[Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel|ACUM]] Prize for his entire oeuvre by the [[Israel Composers Association]]. In the following year, during a visit to Chile, the [[Chilean Chamber Orchestra]] declared him an Honorary Member, the [[Universidad de Chile]] appointed him an Honorary Professor in its Arts Faculty, and the [[Chilean Ministry of Education]] conferred on him the "Orden al Mérito Docente y Cultural [[Gabriela Mistral]]" with the rank of "Caballero". He received the [[Engel Prize]] for his original work and his research into [[Jewish music]], awarded by the city of Tel Aviv in June 2007. Leon Schidlowsky has given courses in composition in several countries; and he has helped to form and influence a whole generation of composers in Israel, like [[Avraham Amzallag]], [[Chaya Arbel]], [[Mary Even-Or]], [[Rachel Galinne]], [[Betty Olivero]], [[Jan Radzynski]], [[Ruben Seroussi]], [[Ron Weidberg]], [[Moshe Zorman]].

==Works==
Many of his works make reference to his Jewish-Israeli identity and to the history of the Jewish people, as well as to his interest in history and the political and social situation in Chile and Latin America. There is also in his works a musical response to his personal life and experience, such as the death of his wife Susanne (1999) and his son Elias (2004), or the destiny of many personal and professional friends, or personalities of his time. As an admirer of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]´s music, Schidlowsky began his career as a composer in the tradition of the [[Second Viennese School]]. His music is also highly influenced by [[Edgard Varèse]], specially on his concern with [[timbre]] and freedom of [[musical form|form]].

Later he began to use [[serial music|serial techniques]], and to experiment with various tonal concepts ([[Atonality|atonal]], [[aleatoric]], [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]]), but always on the understanding that music has a deeper significance which transcends absolute art, which can open up a path for a human being to find a way to himself (Schidlowsky: "Art itself has not only one meaning. It includes and encompasses all senses, questions and all answers. I think that art is a way to us."). Leon Schidlowsky has written dramatic and vivid works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3949">A '''Maucha diagram''', or '''Maucha symbol''', is a graphical representation of the major cations and anions in a chemical sample. R. Maucha&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anon | first1 =  | year = 1960 | title = Prof. dr. r. maucha 75 jahr | doi = 10.1007/bf00047129 | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 15 | issue = 3| pages = 287–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published the symbol in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Maucha, R., 1932. Hydrochemische Methoden in der Limnologie XII. Schweizerbart, Stuttgart, pp. 1-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maucha Key.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Maucha diagram|Maucha ionic diagram]]

It is mainly used by biologists and chemists for quickly recognising samples by their chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E., 1957. Inorganic ions of rain, lakes, rivers. Vol. I. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hassel | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Dooris | first2 = P. M. | last3 = Martin | first3 = D. F. | year = 1997 | title = Maucha diagrams and chemical analyses to diagnose changes in lake chemistry | url = | journal = Florida Scientist | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 75–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is similar in concept to the [[Stiff diagram]]. It conveys similar ionic information to the [[Piper diagram]], though in a more compact format that is suitable as a map symbol or for showing changes with time. The Maucha diagram is a special case of the [[Radar chart]] and overcomes some of the limitations of the [[Pie chart]] by having equal angles for all variables and consistently showing each variable in the same position.

The star shape comprises eight kite-shaped polygons, the area of each of which is proportional to the concentration of an ion in milliequivalents per litre. The anions carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride and sulphate are on the left, while the cations potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are on the right. The total ionic concentration adds up to the area of the background circle, the total anion concentration adds up to the left semicircle and the total cation concentration adds up to the right semicircle. A method for drawing the diagram in R is available on GitHub &lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/fkeck/oviz&lt;/ref&gt;.

Broch and Yake modified Maucha's original fixed-size diagram by scaling for concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Broch | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Yake | first2 = W. | year = 1969 | title = A modification of Maucha's ionic diagram to include ionic concentrations | doi = 10.4319/lo.1969.14.6.0933 | journal = Limnology and Oceanography | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 933–935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further scaling using the logarithm of the ionic concentration enables the plotting of a wide range of concentrations on a single map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = J. A. | last2 = King | first2 = J. M. | year = 1995 | title = Geographical patterns, and their origins, in the dominance of major ions in South African rivers | url = | journal = South African Journal of Science | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 299–306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">The '''merger doctrine''' in [[civil procedure]] stands for the proposition that when litigants agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], and then seek to have their settlement incorporated into a [[court order]], the court order actually extinguishes the settlement and replaces it with the authority of the court to supervise the behavior of the parties. Under this doctrine, the court is free to modify its order as necessary to achieve justice in the case, and may hold a party that breaches the agreement in [[contempt of court]].

{{Buddhism}}
The '''Middle Way''' or '''Middle Path''' ({{lang-pi|{{IAST|Majjhimāpaṭipadā}}}}; {{lang-sa|{{IAST|Madhyamāpratipad}}}};&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (1991), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Also see the Pali version of the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' (available online at [http://www.mettanet.lk/tipitaka/2Sutta-Pitaka/3Samyutta-Nikaya/Samyutta5/55-Sacca-Samyutta/02-Dhammacakkappavattanavaggo-p.html SLTP, n.d.-b, sutta 12.2.1]) where the phrase ''majjhimā patipadā'' is repeatedly used.}} {{bo|t=དབུ་མའི་ལམ།|s =Umélam}}; {{CJKV|t=中道|v=Trung đạo}}; {{lang-th|มัชฌิมาปฏิปทา}}) is the term that [[Gautama Buddha]] used to describe the character of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] he discovered that leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|liberation]].

==Theravada Buddhism and the Pali canon==

===''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''===
In the [[Pāli Canon]] of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]], the term "Middle Way" was used in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'', which the Buddhist tradition regards to be the first teaching that the Buddha delivered after his awakening.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''[[Samyutta Nikaya]]'', 56:11. See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html]}} In this sutta, the Buddha describes the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] as the middle way of moderation, between the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification:&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt;
{{quote|Monks, these two extremes ought not to be practiced by one who has gone forth from the household life. There is addiction to indulgence of sense-pleasures, which is low, coarse, the way of ordinary people, unworthy, and unprofitable; and there is addiction to self-mortification, which is painful, unworthy, and unprofitable.&lt;br /&gt;
Avoiding both these extremes, the [[Tathāgata|Tathagata]] (the Perfect One) has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to Nibbana. And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata...? It is the Noble Eightfold path, and nothing else, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.&lt;ref&gt;Piyadassi (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the scriptural account, when the Buddha delivered the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', he was addressing five ascetics with whom he had previously practiced severe austerities.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See, for instance, the Mahasaccaka Sutta ("The Longer Discourse to Saccaka," [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 36 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.036x.than.html Thanissaro, 1998]).}} Thus, it is this personal context as well as the broader context of Indian [[shramana|shramanic]] practices that gives particular relevancy to the caveat against the extreme (Pali: ''antā'') of self-mortification (Pali ''attakilamatha'').

Later [[Pali literature]] has also used the phrase ''Middle Way'' to refer to the Buddha's teaching of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]] as a view between the extremes&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion|url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html|website = www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[sassatavada|eternalism]] and [[eternal oblivion|annihilationism]].

===Dependent origination===
{{Main|Pratītyasamutpāda}}
[[Pratītyasamutpāda]], or "dependent origination", describes the existence of objects and phenomena as the result of causes. When one of these causes changes or disappears, the resulting object or phenomena will also change or disappear, as will the objects or phenomena depending on the changing object or phenomena. Thus, there is nothing with an eternal self or atman, only mutually dependent origination and existence. However, the absence of an eternal atman does not mean there is nothing at all. Early Buddhism adheres to a realistic approach which does not deny existence as such, but denies the existence of eternal and independent substances. This view is the Middle Way between eternalism and annihilationism:
{{quote|The understanding that sees a "person" as subsisting in the causal connectedness of dependent arising is often presented in Buddhist thought as "the middle" (''madhyama/majjhima'') between the views of "eternalism" (''śaśvata-/sassata-vāda'') and "annihilationism" (''uccheda-vāda'').&lt;ref&gt;Gethin (1998),p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha| Gethin's endnote (p. 290, ''n''. 22) then references [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.17. See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.017.than.html Thanissaro 2005)]}}}}

===Anatta===
Dependent origination views human persons too as devoid of a personal essence or ''atman''. In Theravadin literature, this usage of the term "Middle Way" can be found in 5th-century CE [[atthakatha|Pali commentaries]]:
{{quote|The Tathāgata teaches the [[Dharma|Dhamma]] by the middle without veering to either of these extremes – eternalism or annihilationism – having abandoned them without reservation. He teaches while being established in the middle way. What is that Dhamma? By the formula of dependent origination, the effect is shown to occur through the cause and to cease with the cessation of the cause, but no agent or experiencer [...] is described.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 739 note 41, quoting from the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] [[Atthakatha|Commentary]] (SN-a or Spk.) in regards to [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.17 (S ii.20)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', the following is found : 
{{quote|"Dependent origination" (''paticca-samuppada'') represents the middle way, which rejects the doctrines, 'He who acts is he who reaps' and 'One acts while another reaps' (S.ii.20) ..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Buddhaghosa]] &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' XVII, 24, p. 531&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Pali Canon itself, this view is not explicitly called the "Middle Way" but is literally referred to as "teaching by the middle" (''majjhena dhamma'').

===Rebirth===
[[pratītyasamutpāda|Paticcasamuppāda]] "dependent origination" also gives a rationale for [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]:
{{quote|Conditioned Arising is [...] a 'Middle Way' which avoids the extremes of 'eternalism' and 'annihilationism': the survival of an eternal self, or the total annihilation of a person at death.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey (2007), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In Theravadin [[soteriology]], the principle of [[anatta|anattBuddhist philosophy refers to the philosophical investigations and systems of inquiry that developed among various Buddhist schools in India following the death of the Buddha and later spread throughout Asia. Buddhism's main concern has always been freedom from dukkha (unease),[1] and the path to that ultimate freedom consists in ethical action (karma), meditation and in direct insight (prajña) into the nature of "things as they truly are" (yathābhūtaṃ viditvā). Indian Buddhists sought this understanding not just from the revealed teachings of the Buddha, but through philosophical analysis and rational deliberation.[2] Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in East Asia have covered topics as varied as phenomenology, ethics, ontology, epistemology, logic and philosophy of time in their analysis of this path. of human identity is an indestructible and eternal self, whether individual or universal [...]  The other extreme, annihilationism (''ucchedavāda''), holds that at death the person is utterly annihilated.... Dependent origination offers a radically different perspective that transcends the two extremes.  It shows that individual existence is constituted by a current of conditioned phenomena devoid of a metaphysical self yet continuing on from birth to birth as long as the causes that sustain it remain effective.}}
Paticcasamuppāda also describes the [[Twelve Nidānas]] of [[dukkha]] "suffering" that lead to rebirth, from [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avijjā]] "ignorance" to [[jarāmaraṇa]] "aging and death", and the parallel reverse-order interdependent cessation of these factors.

In Theravada Buddhism, only [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nibbana]] is unconditioned; nonetheless, even the [[arhat|arahant]] or [[tathāgata]], upon passing, neither exists nor non-exists according to the Pāli Canon.

== Mahayana ==
In [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], the ''Middle Way'' refers to the insight into [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness" that transcends the extremes of existence and non-existence, the [[two truths doctrine]]. According to Kalupahana,
{{quote|Two aspects of the Buddha's teachings, the philosophical and the practical, which are mutually dependent, are clearly enunciated in two discourses, the ''Kaccāyanagotta-sutta'' and the ''Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta'', both of which are held in high esteem by almost all schools of Buddhism in spite of their sectarian rivalries. The ''Kaccāyanagotta-sutta'', quoted by almost all the major schools of Buddhism, deals with the philosophical "middle path", placed against the backdrop of two absolutistic theories in Indian philosophy, namely, permanent existence (atthitaa) propounded in the early Upanishads and nihilistic non-existence (natthitā) suggested by the Materialists.&lt;ref name=Kalupahana&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nāgārjuna|authorlink1=Nagarjuna|editor1-last=Kalupahana|editor1-first=David|title=The philosophy of the middle way = Mūlamadhyamakakārikā|date=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, N.Y.|isbn=978-0887061486|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Madhyamaka===
In Mahayana Buddhism, the [[Madhyamaka]] ("Middle Way") school portrays a "middle way" position between metaphysical claims that things ultimately either exist or do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (1991), pp. 131, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nagarjuna]]'s influential ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' deconstructs the usage of terms describing reality, leading to the insight into [[śūnyatā]] "emptiness". It contains only one reference to a sutta, the ''Kacc{{IAST|ā}}yanagotta Sutta'' from the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]:
&lt;poem&gt;"Everything exists": That is one extreme.
"Everything doesn't exist": That is a second extreme.
Avoiding these two extremes,
The Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.015.than.html Thanissaro (1997), ''Translation of Kaccayanagotta Sutta'', [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 12.15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329025311/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.015.than.html |date=2013-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

===East Asian conceptions===

====Tendai====
In the [[Tendai]] school, the ''Middle Way'' refers to the synthesis of the thesis that all things are śūnyatā and the antithesis that all things have phenomenal existence.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (1991), pp. 143-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chan Buddhism====
In [[Chan Buddhism]], the Middle Way describes the realization of being free of the one-sidedness of perspective that takes the extremes of any polarity as objective reality. In chapter ten of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'', [[Huineng]] gives instructions for the teaching of the Dharma. Huineng enumerates 36 basic oppositions of consciousness and explains how the Way is free from both extremes:
{{quote|If one asks about the worldly, use the paired opposite of the saintly; if asking about the saintly use the paired opposite of the worldly. The mutual causation of the Way of dualities, gives birth to the meaning of the Middle Way. So, for a single question, a single pair of opposites, and for other questions the single [pair] that accords with this fashion, then you do not lose the principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wonderwheels.blogspot.com/2010/09/platform-sutra-1st-section-of-chapter.html {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For example: "Suppose there is a person who asks, ‘What is taken for and called darkness?’ Reply and say, ‘Light is the proximate cause and darkness is the contributory cause. When light is ended, then there is darkness. By the means of light, darkness manifests; by the means of darkness, light manifests. [Their] coming and going are mutually proximate causes and become the meaning of the Middle Way.[http://wonderwheels.blogspot.com/2010/09/platform-sutra-1st-section-of-chapter.html {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}]}}}}

'''Negative gearing''' is a form of [[leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] whereby an [[investor]] borrows money to acquire an income-producing [[investment]] and the gross income generated by the investment (at least in the short term) is less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including [[depreciation]] and [[interest]] charged on the loan (but excluding capital repayments). The investor may enter into a negatively geared investment expecting [[tax]] benefits or the [[capital gain]] on the investment, when the investment is ultimately disposed of, to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is [[Tax deduction|tax-deductible]] against the investor's other taxable income and if the [[capital gain]] on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment. 

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
Negative gearing is often discussed with regard to [[real estate]], where [[rental income]] is less than [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] interest costs, but may also apply to [[Share (finance)|shares]] whose [[dividend]] income falls short of interest costs on a [[margin (finance)|margin loan]]. The tax treatment may or may not be the same between the two.

Positive gearing occurs when one borrows to invest in an income-producing asset and the returns (income) from that asset exceed the cost of borrowing. From then on, the investor must pay tax on the rental income profit until the asset is sold, when point the investor must pay capital gains tax on any profit.

When the income generated covers the interest, it is simply a geared investment, which creates [[passive income]]. A negative gearing strategy makes a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] under any of the following circumstances:

*if the asset rises in value so that the capital gain is more than the sum of the ongoing losses over the life of the investment
*if the income stream rises to become greater than the cost of interest (the investment becomes positively geared)
*if the interest cost falls because of lower [[Interest rate|interest rates]] or paying down the principal of the loan (again, making the investment positively geared)

The investor must be able to fund any shortfall until the asset is sold or until the investment becomes positively geared (income &gt; interest). The different tax treatment of planned ongoing losses and possible future capital gains affects the investor's final return. In countries that tax capital gains at a lower rate than income, it is possible for an investor to make a loss overall before taxation but a small gain after taxpayer subsidies.

Some countries, including Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries, including the US, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the UK or the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/eJTR/2005/4.html#Heading447 "Quarantining Interest Deductions for Negatively Geared Rental Property Investments" &amp;#91;2005&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as [[stamp duty|stamp duties]] and [[capital gains tax]] may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2006/pdf/rdp2006-12.pdf Housing and Housing Finance: The View from Australia and Beyond, RBA &amp;#91;2006&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A negatively-geared investment property will generally remain negatively geared for several years, when the [[Renting|rental]] income will have increased with [[inflation]] to the point that the investment is positively geared (the rental income is greater than the interest cost).

The tax treatment of negative gearing (also termed "rental loss offset against other income") varies. For example:
* the United States restricts the practice to lower/middle income taxpayers who are active in managing their rental investment.
* Canada limits the practice by ensuring the investment generated a positive return over its life.
* the United States also allows interest costs against the family home to be fully tax deductible.
* countries with lower tax rates have a lower benefit from negative gearing due to a lower top rate of tax or a higher threshold for a specific tax rate.

==Negative gearing by country==
===Australia===
{{tone|section|date=June 2016}}{{See also|Taxation in Australia}}

[[Australia]] allows the application of property losses arising from negative gearing against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Negative gearing by property investors reduced personal income tax revenue in Australia by $600 million in the 2001/02 tax year, $3.9 billion in 2004/05 and $13.2 billion in 2010/11.

Negative gearing is a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], during which the Labor Party proposed restricting (but not eliminating) negative gearing and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/policycheck-negative-gearing-reform-58404|title=PolicyCheck: Negative gearing reform|last=Wright|first=Danika|date=3 May 2016|newspaper=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-far-more-than-everyday-australians-analysis-shows-20151113-gkyllz.html|title=Negative gearing benefits the rich far more than everyday Australians, analysis shows|last=Hutchens|first=Gareth|date=13 November 2015|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Treasurer of Australia|Federal Treasurer]] [[Scott Morrison]], in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that shows that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/federal-budget/scott-morrison-says-claims-negative-gearing-benefits-the-rich-are-a-complete-and-utter-myth-20160425-goetex.html|title=Scott Morrison says claims negative gearing benefits the rich are 'a complete and utter myth'|last=Koziol|first=Michael|date=26 April 2016|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The raw numbers do not show the extent to which different professional groups benefit.)

====History====
Traditionally, Australian taxpayers have been allowed to negatively gear their investment properties, in the strict sense of investing in property at an initial loss. Negative gearing was restricted by a prohibition on the transfer of contingent property income and the property losses could not offset income from labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/1987/27.pdf Avoidance, Evasion and Reform: Who Dismantled and who's rebuilding the Australian Income Tax System]&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed this applied to losses as well as income, but this is unclear in the [[Income Tax Assessment Act 1936]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/itaa1936240/ INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT ACT 1936]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A common method of bypassing the restrictions on property losses offsetting income from labour was to convert such income into another form through the use of partnerships and other legal mechanisms. As a result, this restriction may not have been significant.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} A partnership, trust or similar legal mechaninsm allowed an individual, or individuals, to pool their incomes and losses, thus allowing them to offset property losses against other incomes. This option was not available to individuals who derived their income from wages. 

In 1983, the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] Deputy Commissioner of Taxation briefly denied Victorian property investors the deduction for interest in excess of the rental income, so losses could not be transferred nor moved to a future tax year. That ruling was quickly over-ruled by the federal tax commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rami|first=Hanegbi|year=2002|title=Negative Gearing: Future Directions|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/DeakinLawRw/2002/17.html#fnB21|journal=[[Deakin Law Review]]|volume=|issue=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 1985, under the [[Australian Labor Party]] [[Hawke government]], negative gearing rules were changed so that property losses were no longer quarantined and instead could offset wage income. Six months later, following the tax summit in July 1985, the Hawke government undid this change, once more quarantining negative gearing interest expenses on new transactions so that they could be claimed only against rental income, not other income. (Any excess loss could be carried forward to offset property income in later years.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; That ensured that at personal level and, more importantly, at a national level, property losses would not be subsidised by income from personal exertion. In applying the formula, all previous governments thereby isolated and consequently discouraged capital speculation being subsidised from the general income tax receipts pool.

In addition, a [[capital gains tax]] (CGT) was introduced in Australia on 20 September 1985. While a separate tax, it is often associated with negative gearing.

The Hawke government's reversion to the earlier system in which property losses could not offset income from labour was unpopular with property investors. These investors claimed this reversion had caused investment in rental accommodation to dry up and rents to rise substantially. This was unsupported by evidence other than localised increases in real rents in both [[Perth]] and [[Sydney]], which also had the lowest vacancy rates of all capital cities at the time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100|title=Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?|last=ABC Fact Check|first=|date=3 March 2016|newspaper=|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in July 1987, after lobbying by the property industry, the Federal Labor government with [[Paul Keating]] as its Treasurer, reversed its decision once more, allowing negative gearing losses to be applied against income from labour.

====Taxation====
Australian tax treatment of negative gearing is as follows:

* Interest on an investment loan for an income producing purpose is fully deductible if the income falls short of the interest payable. The shortfall can be deducted for tax purposes from income from other sources, such as the wage or salary income of the investor.
* Ongoing maintenance and small expenses are similarly fully deductible.
* Property fixtures and fittings are treated as plant, and a deduction for [[depreciation]] is allowed based on effective life. When they are later sold, the difference between actual proceeds and the written-down value becomes income or further deduction.
* Capital works (buildings or major additions, constructed after 1997 or certain other dates) attract a 2.5% per annum capital works deduction (or 4% in certain circumstances). The percentage is calculated on the initial cost (or an estimate thereof) and can be claimed until the cost of the works has been completely recovered. The investor's cost base for capital gains tax purposes is reduced by the amount claimed.
* On sale, or most other methods of transfer of ownership, capital gains tax is payable on the proceeds minus cost base (excluding items treated as plant above). A net capital gain is taxed as income, but if the asset was held for one year or more, the gain is first discounted by 50% for an individual, or a third for a superannuation fund. (The discount began in 1999, prior to which an indexing of costs and a stretching of marginal rates applied instead.)

The tax treatment of negative gearing and capital gains may benefit investors in a number of ways, including:
*Losses are deductible in the financial year they are incurred and provide nearly immediate benefit.
*Capital gains are taxed in the financial year when a transfer of ownership occurs (or other less common triggering event), which may be many years after the initial deductions.
*If it is held for more than twelve months, only 50% of the capital gain is taxable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Esther|title=CGT exemptions, rollovers and concessions|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/capital-gains-tax/cgt-exemptions,-rollovers-and-concessions/|website=Australian Taxation Office|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Transfer of ownership may be deliberately timed to occur in a year in which the investor is subject to a lower marginal tax rate, reducing the applicable capital gains tax rate compared to the tax rate saved by the initial deductions.

However, in certain situations the tax rate applied to the capital gain may be higher than the rate of tax saving because of initial deductions such as for investors who have a low marginal tax rate while they make deductions but a high marginal rate in the year the capital gain is realised.

In contrast, the tax treatment of real estate by [[owner-occupier]]s differs from investment properties. Mortgage interest and upkeep expenses on a private property are not deductible, but any capital gain (or loss) made on disposal of a primary residence is tax-free. (Special rules apply on a change from private use to renting or vice versa and for what is considered a main residence.)

====Arguments for and against====
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
The economic and social effects of negative gearing in Australia are a matter of ongoing debate. Those in favour of negative gearing argue:

* Negatively-geared investors support the private residential tenancy market, assisting those who cannot afford to buy, and reducing demand on government [[public housing]].
* Investor demand for property supports the building industry, creating [[employment]].
* Tax benefits encourage individuals to invest and save, especially to help them become self-sufficient in [[retirement]].
* Startup losses are accepted as deductions for business and should also be accepted for investors since investors will be taxed on the result.
* Interest expenses deductible by the investor are income for the lender so there is no loss of tax revenue.
* Negatively-geared properties are running at an actual loss to the investor. Even though the loss may be used to reduce tax, the investor is still in a net worse position compared to not owning the property. The investor is expecting to make a profit either when the net rental income grows over time and exceeds the interest cost, or on the capital gain when the property is sold, or both. After sale, the treatment of the capital gain income is favoured by the tax system since the only half of the capital gain is assessed as taxable income if the investment is held for at least 12 months (before 2000–2001, only the real value of the capital gain was taxed, which had a similar effect). From that perspective, distortions are generated by the 50% discount on capital gains income for income tax purposes, not negative gearing.

Opponents of negative gearing argue:

* It encourages over-investment in residential property, which is an economic distortion.
* Investors inflate the residential property market, making it less affordable for first home buyers or other owner-occupiers.
* In 2007, nine out of ten negatively geared properties in Australia were existing dwellings so the creation of rental supply comes almost entirely at the expense of displacing potential owner-occupiers. Thus, if negative gearing is to exist, it should be applied only to newly constructed properties.
* It encourages [[Speculation|speculators]] into the property market, such as in the [[Australian property bubble]] that began in the mid-1990s, partly the result of increased availability of credit that occurred following the entry of non-bank lenders into the Australian mortgage market.
* Tax deductions and overall benefits accrue to those who already have high incomes, which will make the rich investors even richer and the poorer population even poorer, possibly creating and prolonging a social divide between socio-economic classes.
* Tax deductions reduce government revenue by a significant amount each year, so non-investors are subsidising investors and the government is less able to provide other programs.
* Business expenses (including interest payments) should be deductible against current or future income from that business, not against other forms of current income. Even if the tax code did not allow negative gearing offsets, the cost of operating the rental property (including interest payments) will be deductible from future net rental income or will reduce the capital gains tax at the time of sale of the property.

====Effect on rent prices====
The view that the temporary removal of negative gearing between 1985 and 1987 caused rents to rise has been challenged by Chief Economist of the [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group|ANZ]] Saul Eslake, who has been quoted as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's true, according to Real Estate Institute data, that rents went up in Sydney and Perth. But the same data doesn't show any discernible increase in the other state capitals. I would say that, if negative gearing had been responsible for a surge in rents, then you should have observed it everywhere, not just two capitals. In fact, if you dig into other parts of the REI database, what you find is that vacancy rates were unusually low at that time before negative gearing was abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2003/s991144.htm|title=Sparks fly over housing industry comments|last=|first=|date=17 November 2003|newspaper=[[Lateline]]|access-date=26 February 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eslake is referring to changes in inflation-adjusted rents (i.e., when [[Consumer price index|CPI]] inflation is subtracted from the nominal rent increases). These are also known as real rent changes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nominal rents nationally rose by over 25% during the two years that negative gearing was quarantined. They rose strongly in every Australian capital city, according to the official [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|ABS]] CPI data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/6401.0Mar%202013&lt;/ref&gt; However, as nominal changes include inflation, they provide a less clear picture of how rents changed in effect, and of how changes such as disallowing property losses to offset other types of income affect rent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, it is difficult to assess the impact no longer allowing such deductions had during those two years, given that these deductions had only been allowed for six months prior to their disallowance in July 1985.

An ABC Fact check report, posted on the 3rd of March 2016 and titled "[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/hockey-negative-gearing/6431100 Fact check: Did abolishing negative gearing push up rents?]" provided the following, after inflation, rental cost changes, during the period negative gearing was abolished. (Rounded to whole numbers and listed by size of city). Sydney +2% to +4%, Melbourne +2% to 0%, Brisbane -3% to -4%, Perth 0% to +6% and Adelaide +1% to -3%. All values have the effects of inflation removed, which in 1986 was [http://www.in2013dollars.com/Australia-inflation-rate-in-1986 9.18%]. 

As a comparison with house pricing, the [http://www.econ.mq.edu.au/Econ_docs/research_papers2/2004_research_papers/Abelson_9_04.pdf medium house price] in Sydney rose from $98000, in 1985, to $120025, in 1986, or after inflation, by 12.18%. In Brisbane the medium house price moved from $61550 to $63000, in the same period, or an after inflation, a change of -6.25%. The medium unit price in Sydney moved from $70500 to $72300, in the same period. An after inflation change of -6.07%. In brisbane the after inflation change for units was -0.05%.

====Effect on housing affordability====
[[File:20100517 Australian House Price Index 1986 - 2009.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Chart 1: House Price Index and CPI. Source ABS]]
In 2003, the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] (RBA) stated in its submission to the [[Productivity Commission]] First Home Ownership Inquiry: &lt;blockquote&gt;there are no specific aspects of current tax arrangements designed to encourage investment in property relative to other investments in the Australian tax system. Nor is there any recent tax policy initiative we can point to that accounts for the rapid growth in geared property investment. But the fact is that when we observe the results, resources and finance are being disproportionately channelled into this area, and property promoters use tax effectiveness as an important selling point.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/housing-and-housing-finance/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home/pdf/inquiry-productivity-commission-on-first-home.pdf|title=Productivity Commission Inquiry on First Home Ownership: Submission by Reserve Bank of Australia|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;They went on to say that "the most sensible area to look for moderation of demand is among investors", and that: &lt;blockquote&gt;the taxation treatment in Australia is more favourable to investors than is the case in other countries. In particular, the following areas appear worthy of further study by the Productivity Commission:&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;i. ability to negatively gear an investment property when there is little prospect of the property being cash-flow positive for many years;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ii. the benefit that investors receive by virtue of the fact that when property depreciation allowances are "clawed back" through the capital gains tax, the rate of tax is lower than the rate that applied when depreciation was allowed in the first place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;iii. the general treatment of property depreciation, including the ability to claim depreciation on loss-making investments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Investor Lending - new vs existing to Feb 2010.pdf|thumb|350px|right|Chart 2: Investor Lending – New construction vs Existing property. Source ABS, RBA]]

In 2008, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia echoed the findings of the 2004 Productivity Commission report. One recommendation to the enquiry suggested that negative gearing should be capped: "There should not be unlimited access. Millionaires and billionaires should not be able to access it, and you should not be able to access it on your 20th investment property. There should be limits to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/hsaf/report/index|title=A good house is hard to find: Housing affordability in Australia|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Select Committee on Housing Affordability in Australia|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 report from the Senate Economics References Committee argues that, while negative gearing has an influence on housing affordability, the primary issue is a mismatch between supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/Affordable_housing_2013/Report|title=Out of reach? The Australian housing affordability challenge|last=|first=|publisher=Senate Economics References Committee|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A submission to this committee from the Department of Social Services stated that:&lt;blockquote&gt;[while] demand for housing has increased significantly over the last 30 years, the supply of new dwellings has not responded, with average annual completions of new dwellings remaining around 150,000 since the mid-1980s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The effect of negative gearing on the supply side of dwelling construction is difficult to pin down. Commentary from Eslake and others has highlighted the preponderance of negatively-geared purchases in established suburbs where the probability of a lightly-taxed capital gain exists, challenging the idea that negative gearing leads to substantial amounts of new construction. Many economists{{Who|date=February 2017}} have commented extensively on the tax subsidy being made available to speculative buyers in competition against homebuyers, who have no such tax subsidy, leading to significant social dislocation.

Additionally, the tax subsidy feeding into higher home prices adds to the wealth of those taking advantage of negative gearing. The process that crowds out domestic home owners by pushing up the price of housing also makes the successful user of negative gearing more asset rich due to the increase in land value. This allows these people to borrow further funds against equity in the previously acquired properties, resulting in further acquisitions under tax subsidy. This process can raise prices and thereby make it harder for people who wish to buy a house as an owner-occupier.

===United Kingdom===
While allowing for negative gearing in its basic form, the United Kingdom does not allow the transfer of one type of income (or loss) to another type of income. This is due to its [[schedular system of taxation]]. In this type of taxation system, the tax paid is dependent on income source. Therefore, an individual who received an income from labour and from land would pay two separate tax rates for the two relevant income sources.

Between 1997 and 2007, the [[Tax Law Rewrite Project]] changed this system by simplifying the schedules. As with the previous system, people would not be allowed to transfer incomes (or losses).

A UK government online resource on renting out property in England and Wales&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/renting-out-a-property/paying-tax Renting out your property (England and Wales)]&lt;/ref&gt; outlines how to offset losses. It states that losses can be offset against "future profits by carrying it forward to a later year" or against "profits from other properties (if you have them)".

===New Zealand===
New Zealand allows negative gearing and the transfer of losses to other income streams, with some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://international.harcourts.net/negative-gearing-explained/ Harcourts - “Negative Gearing” Explained]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rental Income Guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/keyword/individualincometax/ir264-guide-rental-income.html  IRD - Rental income IR264]&lt;/ref&gt; states a loss can only be deducted against other incomes if the rental income is at market rate.

The Opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] attempted to raise negative gearing in the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], but after their failure to win government the issue reduced in significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2011/05/nz-moves-to-quarantine-negative-gearing/ NZ moves to quarantine negative gearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{See also|Taxation in Canada}}
In principle, Canada does not allow the transfer of income streams. However, the most current Canadian tax form indicates this can occur in some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/negative_gearing.asp Investopedia - Negative Gearing]&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses", interest payments from an investment designed to generate an income can be deducted:&lt;blockquote&gt;Claim the following carrying charges and interest you paid to earn income from investments: [...] Most interest you pay on money you borrow for investment purposes, but generally only if you use it to try to earn investment income, including interest and dividends. However, if the only earnings your investment can produce are capital gains, you cannot claim the interest you paid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns206-236/221/menu-eng.html CRA Line 221 - Carrying charges and interest expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other sources indicate the deduction must be reasonable and that people should contact the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] for more information. The "Rental Income Includes Form T776"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4036/t4036-e.html#P558_52811|title=Rental Income 2016: Rental losses|last=|first=|date=|website=Canada Review Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; states people can deduce rental losses from other sources of income: "You have a rental loss if your rental expenses are more than your gross rental income. If you incur the expenses to earn income, you can deduct your rental loss against your other sources of income." However, there is a caveat: the rental loss must be reasonable. What is reasonable is not defined in the "Rental Income Includes Form T776" Guide.

Based on these sources, claiming rental losses against other incomes in a given year is allowed as long as a profit is made over the life of the investment, excluding the effects of capital gains.

It should be noted that Canada has a Federal and Provincial income tax, and the above only relates to Federal income tax.

===United States===
In principle, the US federal tax does not allow the transfer of income streams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc414.html IRS Topic 414 - Rental Income and Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, taxpayers can only deduct expenses of renting property from their rental income, as renting property out is usually considered a passive activity. However, if renters are considered to have actively participated in the activities, they can claim deductions from rental losses against their other "nonpassive income".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A definition of "active participation" is outlined in the "Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses" guide:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p527/ch03.html#en_US_2015_publink1000219121 IRS Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and ''bona fide'' sense. Management decisions that may count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and other similar decisions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is possible deduct any loss against other incomes, depending on a range of factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxes.about.com/od/taxhelp/a/Schedule_E.htm Rental Income and Expenses - Tips for Schedule E]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
Japan allows tax payers to offset rental losses against other income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=4188 Authorities challenge real estate loss deduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can claim losses against rental loss with minimal restrictions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Real_estate_income.pdf Analysis of Income (use for real estable income)]&lt;/ref&gt; but if the property was owned through a partnership or trust there are restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/?p=3882 The Japanese taxation of real estate income for individuals]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of additional rules, such as restricting claims of losses due to Bad Debt. Additional information can be found in the Japan Tax Site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://japantax.org/ The Japan tax Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
The [[Taxation in Germany|German tax system]] is complex, but within the bounds of standard federal income tax, Germany does not allow the transfer of income. Rental losses can only be offset against rental income.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Germany/Taxes-and-Costs Rental income tax is high in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the Global Property Guide site, "Owners can deduct any expenses from the gross receipts, which were incurred to produce, maintain and safeguard that income."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Germany recognizes seven sources of income:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schweizer.com.au/documents/P130277_028.pdf The German tax System]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Agriculture and forestry
# Trade and business
# Independent personal services
# Employment
# Capital investment
# Rents and royalties
# "other income", as specified and strictly limited by law to certain types of income such as income from private transactions and income of a recurring nature (e.g. pensions)

The income from each of these sources is calculated separately.

Rental income is taxed as income and is subject to the [[progressive tax]] rate. Interest on loans provided to finance real estate, expenses, and property-related cost (e.g., management fees, insurance) can be deducted from the taxable rental income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germany.alphare.net/pdf/German-Property-Tax-Overview.pdf German Tax Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In principle, the [[Taxation in the Netherlands|Dutch tax system]] does not allow the transfer of income. Most citizens calculate tax, separately, in 3 income groups:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-netherlandsguide-2015.pdf Taxation and Investment in Netherlands 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
# Box 1 income includes income from employment and income from the primary residence
# Box 2 income, which includes income from a substantial holding in a company, as well as gains from substantial shareholdings
# Box 3 deals with income from savings and investments

However, I am unable to identify a clear definition where rental income fits in these three categories in the government taxation laws. 

Dutch resident and non-resident companies and partnerships owning Dutch property are in principle allowed to deduct interest expenses on loans from banks or affiliated companies, and property-related costs from their taxable income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwc.fr/assets/files/pdf/2013/07/Global_real_estate/2012_netherlands.pdf Real Estate Going Global Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">An '''object of the mind''' is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that [[Existence|exists]] in the imagination, but which, in the real world, can only be represented or modeled. Some such objects are [[abstraction]]s, [[literary]] [[concept]]s, or [[fictional]] [[scenario]]s.

Closely related are '''intentional objects''', which are what thoughts and feelings are [[intentionality|about]], even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts 
about [[unicorn]]s, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/cranetim/iWeb/Tim's%20website/Online%20papers_files/Intentional%20objects-1.pdf Tim Crane - ''Intentional Objects'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment).

==Mathematical objects==
Mathematics and geometry describe [[abstract object]]s that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of the [[mind]]. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.

Many more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the [[Klein bottle]]&lt;ref&gt;The Teaching Company, Course No. 1423. "Joy of Thinking: The Beauty and Power of Classical Mathematical Ideas." Lecture 14 - "A One-Sided, Sealed Surface - the Klein Bottle." Professors Edward B. Burger, Michael Starbird.&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the [[Möbius strip]]). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.

==Logical sequences==
If-then arguments posit [[logical]] [[sequences]] that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] argument proposes a [[hypothetical]] or [[subjunctive]] [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] which ''could'' or ''would'' be true, but ''might not'' be false. [[Conditional probability|Conditional]] sequences involving subjunctives use [[intensional logic|intensional]] language, which is studied by [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/M/m064320.htm ''Modal Logic''. Springer Online Reference Works.]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[classical logic]] studies the [[extensional]] language of [[logical possibility|necessary]] and [[sufficient]] conditions.

In general, a logical [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is a sufficient condition, and a logical [[consequent]] is a necessary condition(or the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]) in a [[logical conditional]]. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as [[material conditional]]s. In contrast, [[indicative conditional]]s, sometimes known as non-material conditionals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facweb.bcc.ctc.edu/wpayne/non-material%20conditional.htm Payne, W. Russ ''The non-material conditional'']&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.

[[Truth tables]] for if-then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. [[Strict conditional]]s assign a positive [[truth-value]] to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.

===False antecedent===
A false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.

The subjects of [[literature]] are sometimes false antecedents. For example, the contents of [[false documents]], the origins of [[wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]] phenomena, or the implications of [[loaded words]]. Also, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as "[[nothing]]", or "[[nonexistent]]", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.

[[Art]] and [[acting]] often portray scenarios without any antecedent except an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods, and goddesses.

===False consequent===
A false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]], which literally means ''out of sequence''. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.

As an example, the name of a [[team]], a [[genre]], or a [[nation]] is a collective term applied [[ex post facto]] to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by [[consensus]] or [[reference]], but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different [[social]] or [[political]] [[meaning (semiotics)|significance]].

==Philosophy of mind==

{{main|Mind-body dualism}}

In philosophy, [[mind-body dualism]] is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by [[René Descartes]] in ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

==Invented sources==
{{main|False document}}
Many objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is based on an imaginary book. In the ''Appendices'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien's characters name the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'' as the source material for ''The Lord of the Rings'', which they describe as a translation. But the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' is a fictional document that chronicles events in an [[imaginary world]]. One might imagine a different [[translation]], by another author.

==Convenient fictions==
{{see|Fictionalism}}
[[Social reality]] is composed of many standards and [[inventions]] that facilitate [[communication]], but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, [[money]] is an object of the mind which [[currency]] represents. Similarly, [[language]]s signify [[idea]]s and [[thoughts]].

Objects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, [[acting]] is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. [[Charades]] is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts.

Imaginary [[personalities]] and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the [[verisimilitude]] of [[fictional universes]], and/or the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] of [[role-playing games]]. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames.

[[Science fiction]] is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed.

[[Calendar date]]s also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, "It is the year 2005." In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, ''The Transformers: The Movie'' is [[retro-futuristic]]. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change.

Deliberate [[invention]] also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of [[deception]] is usually referred to as [[lie|lying]], in contrast to invention for [[entertainment]] or [[art]]. Invention is also often applied to [[problem solving]]. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the [[mind|mental]] invention of fictions.

Convenient fictions also occur in science.

==Science==
The theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere '''objects of the mind''' by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include [[phlogiston]] and [[ptolemaic epicycle]]s.

This raises questions, in the debate between [[scientific realism]] and [[instrumentalism]] about the status of current posits, such as [[black hole]]s and [[quark]]s. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct?

The situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose—convenient fictions. Examples include [[field line|field lines]], [[centers of gravity]], and [[electron hole]]s in semiconductor theory.

==Self-reference==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}
A [[reference]] that names an imaginary [[source text|source]] is in some sense also a [[self-reference]]. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference.

In their respective [[imaginary world]]s the ''Necronomicon'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', and the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to [[roleplaying|pretend]] or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.

==Nonexistent objects==
Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]] (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects.  Starting with the “principle of intentionality”,  mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object.  People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist.  Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Nonexistent Objects, First published Tue Aug 22, 2006; substantive revision Thu Sep 7, 2006, Accessed May 18, 2010 [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/#HisRooAleMeiProInt]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Moral Fiction''''' is a collection of essays by the American novelist [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]] published in 1978. ({{ISBN|0-465-05225-8}})

In this work, Gardner attacks what he sees as contemporary literature's lack of [[morality]], which he calls the highest purpose of art and which he defines in the book.  According to Gardner, morality is not an arbitrary construct of society, but an eternal truth, taking on different forms but not essentially changing through the ages.  He says that moral fiction "attempts to test human values, not for the purpose of preaching or peddling a particular ideology, but in a truly honest and open-minded effort to find out which best promotes human fulfillment."

[[Leo Tolstoy]], among others, espouses similar views in his essay ''[[What is Art?]]'', and Gardner draws upon Tolstoy in his argument.

{{Judicial interpretation}}

'''Original intent''' is a theory in [[law]] concerning [[constitution]]al and [[statute|statutory]] interpretation. It is frequently used as a [[synonym]] for [[originalism]];{{ref|syn}} while original intent is indeed one theory in the originalist family, it has some salient differences which has led originalists from more predominant schools of thought such as [[original meaning]] to distinguish original intent as much as [[Legal realism|legal realists]] do.

==Approach==
Original intent maintains that in interpreting a text, a [[court]] should determine what the authors of the text were trying to achieve, and to give effect to what they ''intended'' the statute to accomplish, the actual ''text'' of the legislation notwithstanding.{{ref|Beal}}{{ref|Zander}} As in [[purposivism]], tools such as [[legislative history]] are often used.

==Problems==
===Originalist criticisms of original intent proponents (and some proposed rebuttals)===
Despite the potential confusion of terms between the original Intent and originalism, other schools of Originalist thought have been as critical of original intent as non-Originalists.{{ref|originalist-critics}}
* Original intent presumes that there ''is'' a single, unified intent behind a text. In the case of the United States Constitution, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] was composed of over fifty men, who spent an entire summer compromising and arguing over provisions that were interpreted very differently the moment the Constitution's text became public.{{ref|op1}} It is far from clear, therefore, that those fifty-plus men ''had'' – i.e., agreed upon – a single original intent of the text, or whether their purposes in drafting the Constitution were predicated on personal self-interest.{{ref|Beard}} (There is no meaning from an originalist perspective without intent. That is, it is impossible to interpret anything which has no intent, according to originalism. Lawmakers either have no intent, one intent, or multiple intents. But these multiple intents are always consistent, otherwise the law can have no meaning.)
* Even if the Convention did have a single, unified intent, it is unclear how it could reliably be determined from two centuries' distance. (That may be, but what &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; often be determined is that an interpretation being considered is inconsistent with the original intent even though the exact intent is not known.)
* Many of the clauses of the Constitution are relative, and thus specifically defy any claim that it is possible to divine a single, indisputable outcome to any specific problem or dispute. Key passages in the Constitution were originally cast as flexible evaluations, such as "due process," a phrase that suggests the definitions, requirements and dimensions of court or other governmental proceedings sufficient in any given context to permit citizens to be deprived of their rights were never intended to be fixed forever. (A single indisputable decision is never the outcome using any other jurisprudence. This is an argument against making any decision at all. The judge must merely make his best effort to decide in a manner which is consistent with the intent of the framers or authors of legislation, so far as he can ascertain it.)
* In the case of [[Federal government of the United States|US Federal Law]], law is made by majority vote in two chambers, and is then signed by the [[President of the United States|President]]. 536 people are therefore potentially involved in this process, and not one of them needs to share the same intentions as any other of them in order to play their part in ratifying the bill. They need only vote; their vote will count the same if they share the same intent as their colleagues, if they do ''not'' share the intent of their colleagues, and indeed, if they ''have'' no particular intention, and are voting solely because their party whip handed them a note saying "be on the Senate floor at 9:36pm and say 'Aye'." Their vote will count even if they are falling-down drunk or if they have not even ''read'' the bill under consideration.{{ref|mm}} All of which is to say that giving effect to the intent of the legislature not only presumes that there '''is''' a singular intent – no less dubious an assertion where statutes are concerned than where the Constitution is – but, worse yet, the very diversity of these bodies may permit a judge to corrupt his inquiry by finding a floor statement or committee report which suggests an intent that the Judge thinks would be a good result.{{ref|leghist}} (The intent can be ascertained so far as the authors of the legislation or other less authoritative contemporary sources said what it was)
* Original intent may fall afoul of [[Legal formalism|formalist]] theories of law, which explicitly decline interest in how a law is made, an inquiry which is obviously at the core of an original intent inquiry.

* Original intent cannot be reconciled against [[Textualism]]. Most of those who are originalists in Constitutional matters are also textualists in statutory matters, and textualism rejects the value of the ''intentions'' of the legislature in passing a text.{{ref|scalia}} If one adopts originalism as an "error-correcting lens which fits over textualism to account for the passage of time," one cannot adopt an originalist theory which is incoherent with the underlying textualism.

==Other schools of thought==
In [[Canada]], the predominant school of thought for legal interpretation is the [[living tree doctrine]], under which interpretations can evolve along with the society, to deal with new conditions that were different or did not exist when the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]] was framed.

'''Overexploitation''', also called '''overharvesting''', refers to harvesting a [[renewable resource]] to the [[point of diminishing returns]]. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to [[natural resource]]s such as: wild [[medicinal plant]]s, [[Pasture|grazing pasture]]s, [[Game (food)|game animals]], [[fish stocks]], [[forests]], and [[Aquifer|water aquifers]].

In [[ecology]], overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcove |first=D. S. |first2=D. |last2=Rothstein |first3=J. |last3=Dubow |first4=A. |last4=Phillips |first5=E. |last5=Losos |year=1998 |title=Quantifying threats to imperiled species in the United States |journal=BioScience |volume=48 |issue= |pages=607–615 |doi=10.2307/1313420 |jstor= 1313420 |url= http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/geog/144/001/www/readings/wilcove2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In [[conservation biology]] the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in [[fisheries]], [[hydrology]] and [[natural resource management]].

Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including [[extinction]]s. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as [[#Fisheries|discussed below]] in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term [[overfishing]] can be used instead of overexploitation, as can [[overgrazing]] in [[stock management]], [[overlogging]] in [[forest management]], [[overdrafting]] in [[aquifer]] management, and [[endangered species]] in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native [[flora]] and [[fauna]].

==History==
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|right|When the giant flightless birds called [[moa]] were overexploited to the point of extinction,&lt;ref name=Holdaway /&gt; the giant [[Haast's eagle]] that preyed on them also became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=A. |author2=Martinson, P. |year=2006 |title=Extinct Birds of New Zealand |publisher=Te Papa Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the [[mamo]] bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The [[dodo]], a flightless bird from [[Mauritius]], is another well-known example of overexploitation.  As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fryer |date=2002-09-14 |title=Bringing the dodo back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2255991.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest of times, [[hunting]] has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The [[overkill hypothesis]] ([[Quaternary extinction event]]s) explains why the [[megafauna]]l extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with [[human migration]].

==Overview==
Overexploitation doesn't necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, [[resource depletion|depleting]] the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, [[Livistona rotundifolia|footstool palm]] is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller.

==Tragedy of the commons==
[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|left|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur.]]

The [[tragedy of the commons]] refers to a dilemma described in an article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] and first published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garrett |last=Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |year=1968 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H }} Also available [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to [[Tragedy of the commons#Garrett Hardin's essay|Hardin's essay]] is an example which is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. This example was first sketched in an 1833 pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd]], as a hypothetical and simplified situation based on medieval [[land tenure]] in Europe, of herders sharing a [[Common land|common]] on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze. In Hardin's example, it is in each herder's interest to put each succeeding cow he acquires onto the land, even if the [[carrying capacity]] of the common is exceeded and it is temporarily or permanently damaged for all as a result. The herder receives all of the benefits from an additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group. If all herders make this individually rational economic decision, the common will be overexploited or even destroyed to the detriment of all. However, since all herders reach the same rational conclusion, overexploitation in the form of [[overgrazing]] occurs, with immediate losses, and the pasture may be degraded to the point where it gives very little return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin, 1968)&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as [[national park]]s, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and [[fish stocks]]. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the "tragedy of the fishers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Bowles |title=Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=27–29 |year=2004 |isbn=0-691-09163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the [[Earth]]'s finite resources being the general common.

The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to [[Aristotle]], who noted that "what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=E. |year=1992 |chapter=The rudiments of a theory of the origins, survival, and performance of common-property institutions |editor-first=D. W. |editor-last=Bromley |title=Making the Commons Work: Theory, Practice and Policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=ICS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Hobbes]] and his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feeny |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00889070 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a [[tragedy of the anticommons]]: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it.

The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work "The tragedy of the unregulated commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060726sh.html |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? |work=The Japan Times Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons.]]

In [[wild fisheries]], overexploitation or [[overfishing]] occurs when a [[fish stock]] has been fished down "below the size that, on average, would support the long-term [[maximum sustainable yield]] of the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/glossary.htm ''FishWatch glossary''] Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overexploitation can be sustainable.

When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the [[maximum sustainable yield]], and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.&lt;ref&gt;Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PL6r1Ir_x_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Wildlife+ecology+and+management%22&amp;ei=ugW6SpjREJCINMbR1L8P#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Wildlife ecology and management''] 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-13-840422-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be.

Fish stocks are said to "collapse" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. [[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt; The absence of cod as the [[apex predator]] in many areas has led to [[trophic cascade]]s.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt;

About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grafton | first1 = RQ | authorlink3 = Ray Hilborn | last2 = Kompas | first2 = T | last3 = Hilborn | first3 = RW | year = 2007 | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5856/1601 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5856| page = 1601 | doi=10.1126/science.1146017 | bibcode=2007Sci...318.1601G | pmid=18063793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass. At this point, harvesting can be resumed near the maximum sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = AA | year = 2003 | title = Managing to the margins: the overexploitation of fisheries | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–106 | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001[0102:MTTMTO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tragedy of the commons]] can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by [[fisheries management]]. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of  [[individual transferable quota]]s (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that didn't, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14762-guaranteed-fish-quotas-halt-commercial-freeforall.html  New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12253181 A Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster] The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources, such as [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]] or depleted.  Forests enhance the recharge of [[aquifer]]s in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation: UN Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Conrad2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |last= Conrad|first= C.|title= Forests of eucalyptus shadowed by questions |date= 2008-06-21|publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206103926/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.

This has led to the concept of [[peak water]].

==Forest resources==
{{see|Overlogging}}
[[File:Gordon River Clearcut.jpg|thumb|right|Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada.]]

[[Forest]]s are overexploited when they are [[Logging|logged]] at a rate faster than [[reforestation]] takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term economic gains made by [[Deforestation|conversion of forest]] to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:Overgrazing.JPG|thumb|right|It is not just humans that overexploit resources. [[Overgrazing]] can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation.]]

Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered [[vertebrate]]s, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal [[wildlife trade|trade in wildlife]] is valued at $10 billion per year.  Industries responsible for this include the trade in [[bushmeat]], the trade in [[Chinese medicine]], and the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemley 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or [[CITES]] was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals.  It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation.&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primack |first=R. B. |year=2002 |title=Essentials of Conservation Biology |edition=3rd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-719-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive.  Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] of many species beyond sustainable levels.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1992, Fitzgibon ''et al.'' 1995, Cuarón 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the [[extinction]] of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen [[keystone species|effects]], on the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankham |first=R. |last2=Ballou |first2=J.

Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for [[species richness]].  This is more prevalent when looking at [[island ecology]] and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature.  Island [[Endemism|endemic]] populations are more prone to [[extinction]] from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dowding |first=J.

As another example, when the humble [[Erinaceus europaeus|hedgehog]] was introduced to the Scottish island of [[Uist]], the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success.  Twelve species of [[Bird|avifauna]] are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=D. B. |last2=Fuller |first2=R. J. |last3=Campbell |first3=S. T. |title=Long-term Population Changes Among Breeding Shorebirds in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, In Relation to Introduced Hedgehogs (''Erinaceus europaeus'') |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=117 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=151–166 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00289-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist.  With civil unrest, for example in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=R. F. |year=1990 |title=Farewell to Africa |journal=Audubon |volume=92 |issue= |pages=1547–1551 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government.  Populations of large primates, such as [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[ungulate]]s and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkie |first=D.

Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,&lt;ref&gt;The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[Pinguinus impennis|Great Auk]] – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil.
* [[Carolina parakeet]] – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers.

Other species affected by overexploitation include: 

* The international trade in fur: [[chinchilla]], [[vicuña]], [[giant otter]] and numerous cat species
* Insect collectors: butterflies
* Horticulturists: New Zealand mistletoe (''Trilepidia adamsii''), orchids, cacti and many other plant species
* Shell collectors: Marine [[mollusc]]s
* Aquarium hobbyists: [[tropical fish]] 
* Chinese medicine: bears, tigers, rhinos, seahorses, [[Asian black bear]] and [[saiga antelope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Nick|title=Chinese medicines contain traces of endangered animals|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/men_shealth/9200397/Chinese-medicines-contain-traces-of-endangered-animals.html|publisher=Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cascade effects==
[[Image:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|left|Overexploiting [[sea otter]]s resulted in [[cascade effect]]s which destroyed [[kelp forest]] ecosystems.]]

Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or [[cascade effect]]s. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its [[apex predator]]. Because of the loss of the top predator, a [[Overpopulation in wild animals|dramatic increase]] in their [[prey]] species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction.

A classic example of cascade effects occurred with [[sea otters]]. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the [[kelp forest]] ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=J. A. |first2=D. O. |last2=Duggins |first3=G. B. |last3=Rathbun |year=1989 |title=The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00085.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the [[sea urchin]]. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an [[ecological release]] of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, [[kelp]], creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became [[locally extinct]] as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dayton |first=P. K. |first2=M. J. |last2=Tegner |first3=P. B. |last3=Edwards |first4=K. L. |last4=Riser |year=1998 |title=Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities |journal=Ecol. Appl. |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=309–322 |doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0309:SBGARE]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, [[Orcinus orca|killer whales]] have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C.

The '''phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia''' is being pursued at local and state/territory level rather than nationally, with [[plastic bag]] bans implemented or pending in all [[states and territories of Australia|states and territories]] except [[New South Wales]]. Environmental groups have expressed their concern that [[Australia]] was lagging other countries in the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], including Botswana, Somalia and Tanzania.&lt;ref name="cormack"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Australia falling behind third world on global map of plastic bag bans|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/australia-falling-behind-third-world-on-global-map-of-plastic-bag-bans-20160407-go18ec.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 it was estimated that of the 5 billion plastic bags used annually by Australians, 150 million ended up as litter.&lt;ref name="cormack" /&gt;

In 2003 the [[Tasmania]]n town of [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first location in Australia to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 2008 the then-Environment Minister [[Peter Garrett]] announced the [[Rudd Government (2007–10)|Rudd Government]]'s goal of a nationwide plastic bag ban by year's end, he later abandoned the initiative due to [[cost of living]] concerns and disagreement about the policy among state and territory governments.&lt;ref name="abc-2008-garrett"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garrett calls time on plastic bags|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-01-10/garrett-calls-time-on-plastic-bags/1008452|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=10 January 2008|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feneley|first1=Rick|title=Battle to bag the plastic goes on|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/battle-to-bag-the-plastic-goes-on-20081226-75l4.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to states and territories pursuing their own approaches.&lt;ref name="2010-tas"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darby|first1=Andrew|title=Ban on plastic bags spreads to Tasmania|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/ban-on-plastic-bags-spreads-to-tasmania-20101111-17pgm.html|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to the first statewide lightweight bag ban being introduced in October 2008. It is estimated that this move has saved 400 million bags annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent jurisdiction to announce a ban on plastic bags is [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], to commence on a date to be announced in early 2018.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban" /&gt;

Since 2018, the country's two largest supermarket chains, [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] and [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]], voluntarily removed free lightweight plastic bags from their stores and began charging for reusable bags instead.&lt;ref name="coles-woolies"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out single-use plastic bags|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/14/woolworths-to-phase-out-single-use-plastic-bags-over-12-months|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reusable bags are sold at 15 cents in both chains.

==Background==
In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/settlements/waste/plastic-bags/index.html|title=Plastic bags|date=5 November 2009|publisher=Australian Government|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004&lt;ref name="bag problems"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ecorecycle.sustainability.vic.gov.au/resources/documents/Plastic_Bag_Free_Challenge_-_Factsheet.pdf| title=Plastic Bag Fact Sheet | date=9 November 2005| publisher=Sustainability Victoria| accessdate=1 July 2012|format= pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; According to [[Keep Australia Beautiful]]'s 2015-16 National Litter Index, plastic bags made up 1% of the country's litter.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornton |first1=Trevor |title=In banning plastic bags we need to make sure we're not creating new problems |url=https://theconversation.com/in-banning-plastic-bags-we-need-to-make-sure-were-not-creating-new-problems-81253 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Conversation |date=21 July 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="notreadysbs"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christian |first1=Natasha |title=Why Australia may not be ready to ban plastic bags |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/why-australia-may-not-be-ready-to-ban-plastic-bags |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=SBS News |date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[The Project (Australian TV program)|The Project]]'' and [[Clean Up Australia]] launched a [[Change.org]] petition for the premiers of the three states without plastic bag bans - Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia - to "ban the bag".&lt;ref name="banthebag-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Waleed Aly calls for nationwide ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/current-affairs/ban-the-bag-waleed-aly-calls-on-three-australian-premiers-to-ban-plastic-bags/news-story/7d8b5b5944bf7ec77fc6791380f15531|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=News.com.au|publisher=News Corp Australia|date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a segment on ''The Project'' about the petition, #BanTheBag became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="banthebag-news" /&gt; In February 2018, a motion was put in the Australian Federal Parliament calling for a nationwide ban of lightweight non-biodegradable plastic shopping bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/genpdf/chamber/hansardr/8f8fb221-5f56-4e53-b69a-e109f7156d20/0473/hansard_frag.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf|title=Plastic bag ban motion in Federal Parliament|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate inquiries into recycling and marine plastic pollution also led to tripartisan recommendations by the Liberal, Labor and Greens parties to ban all single-use plastics in the country by 2023 and for all states and territories to ban plastic bags.&lt;ref name="zhou-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zhou |first1=Naaman |title=All single-use plastics should be banned by 2023 Senate inquiry recommends |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/26/recycling-senate-inquiry-recommends-all-single-use-plastics-be-banned |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=26 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cormack-senate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cormack |first1=Lucy |title=Plastic bag ban among recommendations by marine plastic senate inquiry |url=https://www.smh.com.au/environment/plastic-bag-ban-among-recommendations-by-marine-plastic-senate-inquiry-20160420-gob2lb.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 April 2016 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 [[Coles Bay, Tasmania|Coles Bay]] was the first Australian town to completely ban non-biodegradable plastic bags.&lt;ref name="cols-bay-push"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tas town pushes for nationwide bag ban|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/tas-town-pushes-for-nationwide-bag-ban/news-story/46b451f1ea13d036dea18e6dd8761ef4|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|date=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 a Greens motion introduced to Tasmania's parliament to ban plastic bags received tripartisan support from Labor, the Liberals and the Greens.&lt;ref name="tas-tri"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tasmania to ban plastic shopping bags|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/tasmania-to-ban-plastic-shopping-bags/news-story/d6c62dbfa7302605efae0a3ae9dc906f|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=News.Com.Au|agency=AAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; A statewide ban began on 1 November 2013.&lt;ref name="mercury-1nov"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kempton|first1=Helen|title=Tasmania's shoppers adjust quickly to ban on plastic bags as new regulations kick in|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/tasmanias-shoppers-adjust-quickly-to-ban-on-plastic-bags-as-new-regulations-kick-in/news-story/329758beded5b88198e9f90e80c7fa1a|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Mercury|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 review found widespread support for the ban but a mixed environmental impact.&lt;ref name="jury-out"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paine|first1=Michelle|title=Jury still out on plastic bag success|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/jury-still-out-on-plastic-bag-ban-success/news-story/36fc7a481c1da865f55adf716740cdf4|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Mercury|date=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queensland===
In November 2016 the Queensland Government announced it would ban plastic bags from 2018, after the Opposition promised that it would implement a ban if it won the next state election.&lt;ref name="abc-qld-to-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wiggins|first1=Nick|title=Queensland to ban single-use plastic bags from 2018|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-25/queensland-to-ban-single-use-plastic-bags-from-2018/8056084|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 November 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Queensland to ban plastic shopping bags from 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/25/queensland-to-ban-plastic-shopping-bags-from-2018|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Guardian|agency=Australian Associated Press|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementing legislation passed the Queensland Parliament on 6 September 2017, accompanied by a [[Container deposit legislation in Australia|container refund recycling scheme]].&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Branco|first1=Jorge|title=Queensland's plastic bag ban is official, along with recycling refund|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/queensland/the-qld-plastic-bag-ban-is-official-along-with-a-recycling-refund-20170906-p4yvqw.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=Brisbane Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both initiatives are due to take effect on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="qld-official-bt" /&gt;

===Western Australia===
Two attempts by the [[City of Fremantle]] in 2013 and 2015 to introduce a citywide plastic bag ban were blocked through disallowance motions moved in the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kagi|first1=Jacon|title=Fremantle plastic bag ban binned again in WA Parliament|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-14/fremantle-plastic-bag-bag-blocked-by-state-parliament-again/6852518|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=14 October 2015|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2017, the Western Australian Government announced it would commence a statewide plastic bag ban on 1 July 2018.&lt;ref name="abc-wa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trigger|first1=Rebecca|title=How will WA's plastic bag ban work?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-12/plastic-bag-ban-announced-in-wa-but-how-will-it-work/8895770|accessdate=13 September 2017|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=12 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wa-toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=WA to ban plastic bags next year|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/environment/wa-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year-ng-s-1772065|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The West Australian|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
In mid-2017, Victoria's state government expressed its preference for a national ban, while confirming it would be open to a state-level ban in future.&lt;ref name="vic-fed-alone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, [[Daniel Andrews]] stated that Victoria would introduce a ban on plastic bags, with the start date to be announced in early 2018 after consultation with industry and the community.&lt;ref name="age-vic-ban"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preiss|first1=Benjamin|title=Lightweight plastic bags to be banned in Victoria|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lightweight-plastic-bags-to-be-banned-in-victoria-20171017-gz2s4i.html|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Age|agency=Fairfax Media|date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conversation-vic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thornton|first1=Trevor|title=Victoria's plastic bag ban: a good start, but we can do more|url=http://theconversation.com/victorias-plastic-bag-ban-a-good-start-but-we-can-do-more-86149|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=The Conversation|date=25 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government subsequently announced the plastic bag ban would commence by late 2019.&lt;ref name="theage-vic2019date"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cunningham |first1=Melissa |last2=Preiss |first2=Benjamin |title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags by next year |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-by-next-year-20180627-p4znxv.html |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=The Age |publisher=Fairfax Media |date=27 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The New South Wales Government currently has no plans to introduce a ban. In 2017 Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] stated that no regulation was needed because retailers responsible for 80% of plastic bags in the state (Coles, Woolworths and [[Harris Farm Markets|Harris Farm]]) would voluntarily stop providing free plastic bags themselves.&lt;ref name="nsw-not-needed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cormack|first1=Lucy|title=Plastic bag ban across NSW not needed if supermarkets act themselves: Premier|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/plastic-bag-ban-across-nsw-not-needed-if-supermarkets-act-themselves-premier-20170724-gxhfbx.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the country's largest supermarket chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that they would stop providing free plastic bags to customers nationwide in 2018, and would sell thicker plastic bags for 15 cents each.&lt;ref name="ww-coles-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dulaney |first1=Michael |title=Woolworths and Coles to phase out plastic bags around the country |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-14/woolworths-to-phase-out-plastic-bags-around-the-country/8709336 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=14 July 2017 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing free bags is expected to save the retailers $170 million per year in reduced packaging costs while creating a revenue stream from selling thicker plastic bags.&lt;ref name="windfall" /&gt;

==Alternatives to plastic bags==
A side-effect of the plastic bag ban observed in South Australia was the increased use of [[bin bag|bin liners]], which have a greater environmental impact than plastic bags as they do not break down well in modern landfills.&lt;ref name="binliner2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chung|first1=Frank|title=Plastic bag ban: 'You don't actually need a plastic bin liner to put your rubbish out'|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/plastic-bag-ban-you-dont-actually-need-a-plastic-bin-liner-to-put-your-rubbish-out/news-story/629abba62ae7d5174208ca36d43615f2|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=News.com.au|agency=NewsCorp Australia|date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmentally-friendly alternatives suggested instead of bin liners include [[composting]] food scraps and using free [[community newspaper]]s as liners instead.&lt;ref name="binliner2017" /&gt;

A 2007 report into shopping bag alternatives&lt;ref name=2007report&gt;{{cite report | last= Dili | first= Rae | date = 18 April 2007 | title = Comparison of existing life cycle analysis of shopping bag alternatives: Final Report | url = http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/upload/resources/publications/plastic-bag-phase-out/LCA_shopping_bags_full_report%5B2%5D_2.pdf | publisher = Sustainability Victoria | format = PDF | access-date = 23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that paper bags were less environmentally friendly than plastic bags due to a higher [[carbon footprint]].&lt;ref name="wired-adler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adler|first1=Ben|title=Banning Plastic Bags Is Great for the World, Right?

Concern has been expressed about potential unintended adverse health outcomes associated with the plastic bag ban rollout due to the lack of care by consumers in maintaining alternative shopping bags in a clean and healthy condition.  Overseas experiences in locations such as [[San Francisco]], where increased illness and even deaths were reported in the aftermath of similar bans to those in Australian states, suggest that this is a real concern.&lt;ref name="health-outcomes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Study links plastic bag ban with increase in food-related deaths|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/study-links-plastic-bag-ban-with-increase-in-foodrelated-deaths-20130208-2e2zf.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Canberra Times|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5604">In [[United States constitutional law]], '''police power''' is the capacity of the [[U.S. state|states]] to [[Regulation|regulate]] behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the [[health]], [[safety]], [[Morality|morals]], and [[Common good|general welfare]] of their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title =Police Power| encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica|url =http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9060615/police-power| accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that the Federal Government does not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.

Police power is exercised by the legislative and executive branches of the various states through the enactment and [[law enforcement|enforcement of law]]s. States have the power to compel [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to these laws through whatever measures they see fit, provided these measures do not infringe upon any of the rights protected by the [[United States Constitution]] or in the various state constitutions, and are not unreasonably arbitrary or oppressive. Methods of enforcement can include [[Sanctions (law)|legal sanctions]], [[violence#Law|physical means]], and other forms of [[coercion]] and inducement. Controversies over the exercise of state police power can arise when exercise by state authorities conflicts with individual rights and freedoms.

The authority for use of police power under American Constitutional law has its roots in [[English law#Common law|English]] and European common law traditions.&lt;ref name=Pox&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox|date=2012|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more fundamentally, use of police power draws on two (Latin) principles, ''[[sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas]]'' ("use that which is yours so as not to injure others"), and ''[[salus populi suprema lex esto]]'' ("the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law"), to justify restriction of individual liberties in order to protect the general welfare.&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; The concept of police power in America was further expanded in a series of notable court cases in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, including the landmark 1851 [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]], and the 1905 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Jacobson v. Massachusetts]].

== Restrictions ==
{{Geographical imbalance|United States|section|date=July 2017}}
Due to the nebulous definition of the police power, restrictions on its use are few and far between. In Commonwealth v. Alger, Chief Justice [[Lemuel Shaw]] wrote that "It is much easier to perceive and realize the existence and sources of [the police power] than to mark its boundaries, or prescribe limits to exercise."&lt;ref name=Pox /&gt; However, according to historian Michael Willrich, "Shaw recognized certain constitutional restraints on police power, but they were few. Laws must apply equally to all under like circumstances... government interferences with individual rights must be 'reasonable' – they must have a clear relation to some legitimate legislative purpose. Beyond those outer limits... most courts stayed out of the way of state police power."&lt;ref name="Pox 302"&gt;{{cite book|last=Willrich|first=Michael|title=Pox |date=2012|publisher=Penguin |location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-312078-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later court cases have expanded somewhat on these restrictions by limiting the ability of states to infringe upon implied constitutional rights and by demanding a stricter standard of [[Legal burden of proof|reasonability]], but regulation of police power remains fairly minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Galva, Jorge E., Christopher Atchinson, and Samuel Levey. "Public Health Strategy and the Police Powers of the State." Public Health Reports 120.1 (2005): 20–27. National Center for Biotechnology Information. Web. 18 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of United States land-use planning authority ==
The police power is the basis for [[land-use planning]] authority in the United States. This authority is usually delegated by state governments to local governments, including counties and municipalities. It is these local governments that most frequently exercise police power in land use planning matters. The regulation of land use based on police power is distinct from the taking of private property by the government through the power of eminent domain. If the regulation of land use is done under the authority of the police power, the private property owner isn't typically entitled to compensation as they would be if property was taken under the power of eminent domain. The court decision in the case [[Commonwealth v. Alger]] was related to land use planning and dealt with the construction of a wharf on privately owned tidelands around Boston Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding the Law of Zoning and Land Use Controls, Barlow Burke, Lexisnexis, Chapter 1, Published 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11636">[[File:Prolate spheroidal coordinates.png|thumb|right|325px|The three [[Coordinate system#Coordinate surface|coordinate surfaces]] of prolate spheroidal coordinates.  The red prolate spheroid (stretched sphere) corresponds to ''μ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and the blue two-sheet [[hyperboloid]] corresponds to ''ν''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45°.  The yellow half-plane corresponds to ''φ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−60°, which is measured relative to the ''x''-axis (highlighted in green).  The black sphere represents the intersection point of the three surfaces, which has [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of roughly&amp;nbsp;(0.831,&amp;nbsp;−1.439,&amp;nbsp;2.182).]]

'''Prolate spheroidal coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[elliptic coordinates|elliptic coordinate system]] about the focal axis of the ellipse, i.e., the symmetry axis on which the foci are located.  Rotation about the other axis produces [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]].  Prolate spheroidal coordinates can also be considered as a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of [[ellipsoidal coordinates]] in which the two smallest [[ellipsoid|principal axes]] are equal in length.

Prolate spheroidal coordinates can be used to solve various [[partial differential equation]]s in which the boundary conditions match its symmetry and shape, such as solving for a field produced by two centers, which are taken as the foci on the ''z''-axis.  One example is solving for the [[wavefunction]] of an [[electron]] moving in the [[electromagnetic field]] of two positively charged [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], as in the [[hydrogen molecular ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Another example is solving for the [[electric field]] generated by two small [[electrode]] tips.  Other limiting cases include areas generated by a line segment (''&amp;mu;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) or a line with a missing segment (&amp;nu;=0).

==Definition==
[[File:ProlateSpheroidCoord.png|thumb|360 px|right|Prolate spheroidal coordinates ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' for ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. The lines of equal values of &amp;mu; and &amp;nu; are shown on the ''xz''-plane, i.e. for ''&amp;phi;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The surfaces of constant ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' are obtained by rotation about the ''z''-axis, so that the diagram is valid for any plane containing the ''z''-axis: i.e. for any ''&amp;phi;''.]]

The most common definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \sinh \mu \sin \nu \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \cosh \mu \cos \nu
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a nonnegative real number and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in [0, \pi]&lt;/math&gt;. The azimuthal angle &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 2\pi]&lt;/math&gt;.

The trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cosh^2 \mu} + \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu} = \cos^2 \nu + \sin^2 \nu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; form [[prolate]] [[spheroid]]s, since they are [[ellipse]]s rotated about the axis 
joining their foci. Similarly, the hyperbolic trigonometric identity

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{z^2}{a^2 \cos^2 \nu} - \frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2 \sin^2 \nu} = \cosh^2 \mu - \sinh^2 \mu = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

shows that surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; form 
[[hyperboloid]]s of revolution.

The distances from the foci located at &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z) = (0, 0, \pm a)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
r_\pm = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z \mp a)^2} = a(\cosh \mu \mp \cos \nu).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Scale factors==

The scale factors for the elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu)&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\mu = h_\nu = a\sqrt{\sinh^2\mu + \sin^2\nu}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sinh\mu \sin\nu
&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 \sinh\mu \sin\nu ( \sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu) \, d\mu \, d\nu \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian can be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; \frac{1}{a^2 (\sinh^2 \mu + \sin^2 \nu)} 
\left[ \frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \mu^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \nu^2} + 
\coth \mu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \mu} + 
\cot \nu \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \nu}
\right] \\[6pt]
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 \sinh^2 \mu \sin^2\nu}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\mu, \nu, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Alternative definition==

[[File:Prolate spheroidal coordinates degenerate.png|thumb|right|250px|In principle, a definition of prolate spheroidal coordinates could be degenerate.  In other words, a single set of coordinates might correspond to two points in [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]; this is illustrated here with two black spheres, one on each sheet of the hyperboloid and located at (''x'', ''y'', ±''z'').  However, neither of the definitions presented here are degenerate.]]

An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of prolate spheroidal coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used, 
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \cosh \mu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau = \cos \nu&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; are prolate spheroids, whereas the curves of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are hyperboloids of revolution.  The coordinate &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the interval [−1,&amp;nbsp;1], whereas the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
 
The coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; have a simple relation to the distances to the foci &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  For any point in the plane, the ''sum'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}+d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; of its distances to the foci equals &lt;math&gt;2a\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, whereas their ''difference'' &lt;math&gt;d_{1}-d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;2a\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma+\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the distance to &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a(\sigma-\tau)&lt;/math&gt;.  (Recall that &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; are located at &lt;math&gt;z=-a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z=+a&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.) This gives the following expressions for &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}+\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \frac 1 {2a} \left(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z+a)^2}-\sqrt{x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi = \arctan\left(\frac y x \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike the analogous [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]], the prolate spheroid coordinates (σ, τ, φ) are ''not'' degenerate; in other words, there is a [[1-to-1 mapping|unique, reversible correspondence]] between them and the [[Cartesian coordinates]]

:&lt;math&gt;
x  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \cos \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y  = a \sqrt{(\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)} \sin \varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a\ \sigma\ \tau
&lt;/math&gt;

==Alternative scale factors==

The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \varphi)&lt;/math&gt; are

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\sigma} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{\sigma^{2} - 1}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
h_{\tau} = a\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2} - \tau^{2}}{1 - \tau^{2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

while the azimuthal scale factor is now

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\varphi = a \sqrt{\left( \sigma^{2} - 1 \right) \left( 1 - \tau^{2} \right)}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = a^3 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2) \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\varphi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian equals

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi = {} &amp; 
\frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - \tau^2)}
\left\{ \frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma} \left[
\left( \sigma^2 - 1 \right) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} \left[ 
(1 - \tau^2) \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right]
\right\} \\
&amp; {} + \frac{1}{a^2 (\sigma^2 - 1) (1 - \tau^2)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \varphi^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae  found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

As is the case with [[spherical coordinates]], Laplace's equation may be solved by the method of [[separation of variables]] to yield solutions in the form of '''prolate spheroidal harmonics''', which are convenient to use when boundary conditions are defined on a surface with a constant prolate spheroidal coordinate (See Smythe, 1968).

The '''Śuddhāvāsa''' (Pāli: Suddhāvāsa; Tib: ''gnas gtsang ma'') worlds, or "Pure Abodes", are distinct from the other worlds of the Rūpadhātu in that they do not house beings who have been born there through ordinary merit or meditative attainments, but only those [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|Anāgāmins]] ("Non-returners") who are already on the path to [[Arhat]]-hood and who will attain enlightenment directly from the Śuddhāvāsa worlds without being reborn in a lower plane.  Every Śuddhāvāsa deva is therefore a protector of Buddhism. ([[Brahma Sahampati]], who appealed to the newly enlightened Buddha to teach, was an Anagami from a previous Buddha&lt;ref&gt;Susan Elbaum Jootla "Teacher of the Devas": The Wheel Publication No. 414/416 (Kandy: Buddhist Publication Society, 1997) [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html article link at Access to Insight]&lt;/ref&gt;). Because a Śuddhāvāsa deva will never be reborn outside the Śuddhāvāsa worlds, no [[Bodhisattva]] is ever born in these worlds, as a [[Bodhisattva]] must ultimately be reborn as a human being.

Since these devas rise from lower planes only due to the teaching of a Buddha, they can remain empty for very long periods if no Buddha arises.  However, unlike the lower worlds, the Śuddhāvāsa worlds are never destroyed by natural catastrophe. The Śuddhāvāsa devas predict the coming of a Buddha and, taking the guise of Brahmins, reveal to human beings the signs by which a Buddha can be recognized. They also ensure that a Bodhisattva in his last life will see the four signs that will lead to his renunciation.

The five Śuddhāvāsa worlds are:
* '''{{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}}''' or '''{{IAST|Akaniṭṭha}}''' – World of devas "equal in rank" (literally: having no one as the youngest). The highest of all the Rūpadhātu worlds, it is often used to refer to the highest extreme of the universe.  The current [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]] will eventually be born there.  The duration of life in {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} is 16,000 kalpas (Vibhajyavāda tradition). Mahesvara ([[Shiva]]) the ruler of the three realms of [[samsara]] is said to dwell here. The height of this world is 167,772,160 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Saturn from Earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Saturn-planet|title=Saturn {{!}} Facts, Size, Color, &amp; Moons|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sudarśana''' or '''Sudassī''' – The "clear-seeing" devas live in a world similar to and friendly with the {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} world. The height of this world is 83,886,080 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Jupiter from Earth).
* '''{{IAST|Sudṛśa}}''' or '''Sudassa''' – The world of the "beautiful" devas are said to be the place of rebirth for five kinds of anāgāmins. The height of this world is 41,943,040 yojanas above the Earth.
* '''Atapa''' or '''Atappa''' – The world of the "untroubled" devas, whose company those of lower realms wish for. The height of this world is 20,971,520 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Sun from Earth).
* '''{{IAST|Avṛha}}''' or '''Aviha''' – The world of the "not falling" devas, perhaps the most common destination for reborn Anāgāmins.  Many achieve arhatship directly in this world, but some pass away and are reborn in sequentially higher worlds of the Pure Abodes until they are at last reborn in the {{IAST|Akaniṣṭha}} world. These are called in Pāli {{IAST|uddhaṃsotas}}, "those whose stream goes upward".  The duration of life in {{IAST|Avṛha}} is 1,000 kalpas (Vibhajyavāda tradition). The height of this world is 10,485,760 yojanas above the Earth (approximately the distance of Mars from Earth).

A '''regional language''' is a [[language]] spoken in an area of a [[sovereign state]], whether it be a small area, a [[Federalism|federated]] [[State (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]], or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], ''"regional or minority languages" means languages that are: ''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and ''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''&lt;ref name=COE-Charter&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an [[official language]].

==Influence of number of speakers==
There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be [[official language]]s of sovereign states. For example, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (a regional language of [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], albeit the [[national language]] of [[Andorra]]) has more speakers than [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Danish language|Danish]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Catalan only has 4M L1 speakers}}  A similar situation exists in China, where [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], spoken in southern [[Jiangsu]], northern, and the general area of [[Shanghai]] [[Zhejiang]] by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than [[French language|French]]; [[Yue Chinese]], a [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese regional variety]] spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and nearby areas in [[China]] with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of [[Malaysia]]), outnumbers [[Italian language|Italian]] in number of speakers. Dialects of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in [[Fujian]] and in nearby [[Taiwan]], but also in the [[Southeast Asian]] countries of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or [[official language]]. For example:

*The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.
*The [[Modern Gutnish|Gutnish language]], a regional language spoken in [[Gotland]] and related to the Swedish language.
*[[Westrobothnian]] is another Swedish regional language native to historical [[Westrobothnia]].
*[[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] in [[Kurdistan]], which is an autonomous region in [[Northern Iraq]], Northwestern [[Iran]] and southeastern [[Turkey]].
*[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] in northern Iraq, northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran.
* Regional varieties in China are considered part of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[macrolanguage]], with the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the most commonly spoken and [[Standard Chinese]] based on the [[Beijing dialect]].
**[[Wu Chinese|Wu]], in [[Shanghai]], southern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]] and eastern [[Jiangxi]].
**[[Yue Chinese]], in [[Guangdong]], parts of [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Cantonese]] is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas
**[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], in parts of [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], and [[Taiwan]]
**[[Min Chinese|Min]], in [[Fujian]], [[Taiwan]], eastern [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]].
**[[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], in [[Hunan]].
**[[Gan Chinese|Gan]], in [[Jiangxi]].
*[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], a regional language of [[Poland]].
*[[Limburgish]], a regional language in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to [[Luxembourgish]], [[South Guelderish]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]].
*[[Low German]] (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of [[Old Saxon]]. Sometimes (e.g. by nds and nds-nl Wikipedia) considered two languages divided by today’s Netherlands–German border on account of Dutch influences in the west and German influences in the east; closely related to [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], more distantly to [[German language|German]].
*[[Scots language|Scots]], a regional language of [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (both part of the [[United Kingdom]], and where it is known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] in the latter location), belongs to the same family of [[West Germanic languages]] as [[English language|English]].
* [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]], regional languages spoken in [[Italy]] which also belong to the same family of standard Italian ([[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]]).
* Regional languages of [[Languages of Spain|Spain]] and [[Languages of Portugal|Portugal]]:
**[[Aranese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Galician language|Galician]] are each, in the regions where they are the autochthonous language, co-official in status with [[Spanish language|Castilian]] (Spanish) which is official everywhere in the [[Kingdom of Spain]].
**[[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]] are recognized (but unofficial) in [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]] (Spain), while [[Mirandese]] is co-official with Portuguese in [[Miranda do Douro]] (Portugal). These Romance languages are classified under the term [[Astur-Leonese linguistic group|Astur-Leonese languages]]. [[Astur-Leonese]] is closely related to both [[Castilian language|Castilian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], which itself is most closely related to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is an [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Romance language]].
**[[Occitan]], most widely spoken across the Pyrenees in France and Catalonia, together with Catalan, forms a subgroup of Romance languages linguistically intermediate between [[Gallo-Romance languages|French]] and the [[Ibero-Romance languages]] of Spain and Portugal. [[Aranese]] is a subdialect of [[Gascon language|Gascon]]
*[[Tibetic languages]]
**[[Amdo tibetan language]] have regional official status in [[amdo]] or [[Qinghai]].
**[[Standard Tibetan]] is currently based on [[Lhasa Tibetan]].
*[[Võro language|Võro]] and [[Seto language|Seto]], regional languages of [[Estonia]], are either dialects of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] or separate [[Finnic languages]] as Estonian.
*[[Walloon language|Walloon]], a regional language of France and [[Belgium]], belongs to the same family of [[Oïl languages]] as [[French language|French]].
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] and English are the [[official languages]] of [[India]]'s [[Government of India|Central Government]].
** [[Languages of India|Indian regional languages]] are: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri language|Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Urdu]]

In other cases, a regional language may be very different from the state's main language or official language. For example:

*[[Basque language|Basque]], a regional language spoken in [[Spain]] and [[France]] ([[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]).
*[[Breton language|Breton]], a regional Celtic language spoken in [[France]] ([[Brittany]]).
*[[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] language, and one of the many [[Native American languages]] spoken in the [[United States|U.S.]] State of [[Oklahoma]].
*[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a non-living regional Celtic language originating in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Cornwall]]).
*[[Corsican language|Corsican]], a regional language in [[France]] ([[Corsica]]) closely related to the [[Tuscan dialect]] of [[Italian language|Italian]].
*[[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], a regional [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Moldova]].
*[[Livonian language|Livonian]], a regional language of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic family]] spoken in [[Latvia]].
*[[Resian dialect|Resian]], a dialect of [[Slovene language|Slovene]] spoken in [[Italy]] ([[Resia, Friuli|Resia valley]]).

*[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], a regional [[Celtic language]] spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Scotland]]).
*[[Sorbian language|Sorbian]], a regional [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language of [[Germany]].
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]], a regional [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Wales]]).

==Official languages as regional languages==
An official language of a country may also be spoken as a regional language in a region of a neighbouring country. For example:
*[[Afrikaans]], an official language of [[South Africa]], is a regional language of [[Namibia]].
*[[Cantonese]], one of the official standard varieties in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] (both [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|special administrative region]]s of the [[People's Republic of China]]), is used as a regional language of the province of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China]].
*[[Catalan language|Catalan]], the official language of [[Andorra]], is a regional language in [[Spain]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community]]), [[France]] ([[Pyrénées Orientales]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Alghero]], [[Sardinia]]).
*[[German language|German]], an official language of [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Switzerland]], is a regional language in [[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]]), [[Poland]] ([[Silesia]]), [[France]] ([[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]), [[Denmark]] and [[Namibia]].
*[[Taiwanese Hakka|Hakka]], one of the official language in [[Taiwan]], is spoken as a regional language of the province of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]], [[People's Republic of China]].
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]] and official in [[Hungary]], is a regional language of [[Romania]] whose official language, [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is a Romance language.
*[[Irish Gaelic|Irish]], the first official language of the [[Republic of Ireland]], is a regional language in [[Northern Ireland]], part of the [[United Kingdom]].
*[[Korean language|Korean]], the official language of [[Korea]], is a regional language in [[People's Republic of China]] ([[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]]).
*[[Malay Language|Malay]], the official language of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and [[Singapore]], is a regional language in [[Indonesia]] ([[Riau Province]]).
*[[Russian language|Russian]], the official language of the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Belarus]], is a regional language of  [[Abkhazia]], [[South Ossetia]] and other entities.

===By book===

====Book I====
While visiting the [[Piraeus]] with [[Glaucon]], [[Polemarchus]] asks [[Socrates]] to join him for a celebration. Socrates then asks [[Cephalus]], Polemarchus, and [[Thrasymachus]] their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is "the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies." Thrasymachus proclaims "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in [[aporia]] concerning its essence.

====Book II====
Socrates believes he has answered [[Thrasymachus]] and is done with the discussion of justice.

Socrates' young companions, [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]], continue the argument of Thrasymachus for the sake of furthering the discussion. Glaucon gives a speech in which he argues first that the origin of justice was in social contracts aimed at preventing one from suffering injustice and being unable to take revenge, second that all those who practice justice do so unwillingly and out of fear of punishment, and third that the life of the unjust man is far more blessed than that of the just man. Glaucon would like Socrates to prove that justice is not only desirable, but that it belongs to the highest class of desirable things: those desired both for their own sake and their consequences.

After Glaucon's speech, [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] adds that, in this thought experiment, the unjust should not fear any sort of divine judgement in the afterlife, since the very poets who wrote about such judgement also wrote that the gods would grant forgiveness to those humans who made ample religious sacrifice. Adeimantus demonstrates his reason by drawing two detailed portraits, that the unjust man could grow wealthy by injustice, devoting a percentage of this gain to religious sacrifices, thus rendering him innocent in the eyes of the gods.

Socrates suggests that they look for justice in a city rather than in an individual man. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, they go on to describe the development of the city. Socrates first describes the "healthy state", but Glaucon asks him to describe "a city of pigs", as he finds little difference between the two. He then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls "a fevered state".&lt;ref name="PlatoFowler1977"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Harold North Fowler|author3=Paul Shorey|title=Plato in Twelve Volumes|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-eng1:2.372d|volume=5-6|year=1977|publisher=W. Heinemann|isbn=978-0-674-99040-1|location=372d}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a guardian class to defend and attack on its account. This begins a discussion concerning the type of education that ought to be given to these guardians in their early years, including the topic of what kind of stories are appropriate.  They conclude that stories that ascribe evil to the gods are untrue and should not be taught.

====Book III====
Socrates and his companions Adeimantus and Glaucon conclude their discussion concerning education. Socrates breaks the educational system into two. They suggest that guardians should  be educated in these four virtues: wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. They also suggest that the second part of the guardians' education should be in gymnastics. With physical training they will be able to live without needing frequent medical attention: physical training will help prevent illness and weakness. Socrates asserts that both male and female guardians be given the same education, that all wives and children be shared, and that they be prohibited from owning private property.

====Book IV====
Socrates and his companions conclude their discussion concerning the lifestyle of the guardians, thus concluding their initial assessment of the city as a whole. Socrates assumes each person will be happy engaging in the occupation that suits them best. If the city as a whole is happy, then individuals are happy. In the physical education and diet of the guardians, the emphasis is on moderation, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them (422a1). Without controlling their education, the city cannot control the future rulers. Socrates says that it is pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness (425a-425c).&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, “Law in the Republic” from ''Virtue and Law in Plato and Beyond'', (Oxford Scholarship Online, 2017)

DOI:10.1093/oso/9780198755746.003.0002&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains (427e). They find wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors (or auxiliaries), temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes (433b). 

The virtues discovered in the city are then sought in the individual soul. For this purpose, Socrates creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul (the city-soul analogy). He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect (436b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, “spirited,” and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. 

Having established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that knows “what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,” courageous if his spirited part “preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains” the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead (442c-d).&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one doesn’t have the other cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book V====
Socrates, having to his satisfaction defined the just constitution of both city and psyche, moves to elaborate upon the four unjust constitutions of these. Adeimantus and Polemarchus interrupt, asking Socrates instead first to explain how the sharing of wives and children in the guardian class is to be defined and legislated, a theme first touched on in Book III. Socrates is overwhelmed at their request, categorizing it as three "waves" of attack against which his reasoning must stand firm. These three waves challenge Socrates' claims that 

* both male and female guardians ought to receive the same education
* human reproduction ought to be regulated by the state and all offspring should be ignorant of their actual biological parents
* such a city and its corresponding philosopher-king could actually come to be in the real world.

====Book VI====
Socrates' argument is that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of The Good. Just as visible objects must be illuminated in order to be seen, so must also be true of objects of knowledge if light is cast on them. Just as light comes from the Sun, so does truth come from goodness. Goodness as the source of truth makes it possible for the mind to know, just as light from the Sun makes the eyes able to see.

====Book VII====
Socrates elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogies [[Analogy of the Sun|of the Sun]] and of the [[Analogy of the Divided Line|Divided Line]] in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he insists that the psyche must be freed from bondage to the visible/sensible world by making the painful journey into the intelligible world. He continues in the rest of this book by further elaborating upon the curriculum which a would-be philosopher-king must study. This is the origin of the [[quadrivium]]: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.

Next, they elaborate on the education of the philosopher king. Until age 18, would-be guardians should be engaged in basic intellectual study and physical training, followed by two years of military training. However, a correction is then introduced where the study of gymnastics (martial arts) and warfare - 3 plus 2 years, respectively - are supplanted by philosophy for 5 years instead. Next, they receive ten years of mathematics until age 30, and then five years of [[dialectic]] training. Guardians then spend the next 15 years as leaders, trying to "lead people from the cave". (This refers to "the [[Allegory of the Cave]]") Upon reaching 50, they are fully aware of the form of good, and totally mature and ready to lead.

====Book VIII====
Socrates discusses four unjust constitutions: [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], and [[tyranny]]. He argues that a society will decay and pass through each government in succession, eventually becoming a tyranny, the most unjust regime of all.

The starting point is an imagined, alternate [[aristocracy]] (ruled by a philosopher-king); a just government dominated by the wisdom-loving element. When its social structure breaks down and enters civil war, it is replaced by timocracy. The timocratic government is dominated by the spirited element, with a ruling class of property-owners consisting of warriors or generals ([[Ancient Sparta]] is an example). As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. The gap between rich and poor widens, culminating in a revolt by the underclass majority, establishing a democracy. Democracy emphasizes maximum freedom, so power is distributed evenly. It is also dominated by the desiring element, but in an undisciplined, unrestrained way. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power (since they pose a threat), while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.

In parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes. He describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all.

====Book IX====
Having discussed the tyrannical constitution of a city, Socrates wishes to discuss the tyrannical constitution of a psyche. This is all intended to answer Thrasymachus' first argument in Book I, that the life of the unjust man (here understood as a true tyrant) is more blessed than that of the just man (the philosopher-king).

First, he describes how a tyrannical man develops from a democratic household. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.

Because of this, tyranny is the regime with the least freedom and happiness, and the tyrant is most unhappy of all, since the regime and soul correspond. His desires are never fulfilled, and he always must live in fear of his victims. Because the tyrant can only think in terms of servant and master, he has no equals whom he can befriend, and with no friends the tyrant is robbed of freedom. This is the first proof that it is better to be just than unjust. The second proof is derived from the tripartite theory of soul. The wisdom-loving soul is best equipped to judge what is best through reason, and the wise individual judges wisdom to be best, then honor, then desire. This is the just proportion for the city or soul and stands opposite to tyranny, which is entirely satiated on base desires. The third proof follows from this. He describes how the soul can be misled into experiencing false pleasure: for example, a lack of pain can seem pleasurable by comparison to a worse state. True pleasure is had by being fulfilled by things that fit one's nature. Wisdom is the most fulfilling and is the best guide, so the only way for the three drives of the soul to function properly and experience the truest pleasure is by allowing wisdom to lead. To conclude the third proof, the wisdom element is best at providing pleasure, while tyranny is worst because it is furthest  removed from wisdom.

Finally, Socrates considers the multiple of how much worse tyranny is than the kingly/disciplined/wise temperament, and even quantifies the tyrant as living 729 times more painfully/less joyfully than the king. He then gives the example of a chimera to further illustrate justice and the tripartite soul.

The discussion concludes by refuting Thrasymachus' argument and designating the most blessed life as that of the just man and the most miserable life as that of the unjust man.

====Book X====
Concluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. 
"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"&gt;''The Republic'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

"And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenous devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

He speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.

"And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home."

With all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.

"Quite true, he said. 
And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

Sometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.

===Scholarly views===
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
Three interpretations of the ''Republic'' are presented in the following section; they are not exhaustive in their treatments of the work, but are examples of contemporary interpretation.

====Bertrand Russell====
In his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945), [[Bertrand Russell]] identifies three parts to the ''Republic'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', begin of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Books I–V: from the attempt to define ''justice'', the description of an ideal community (''eutopia'') and the education of its Guardians;
# Books VI–VII: the nature of [[philosopher]]s, the ideal rulers of such a community;
# Books VIII–X: the pros and cons of various practical [[form of government|forms of government]].

The core of the second part is the [[Allegory of the Cave]] and the discussion of the [[Platonic realism|theory of ideal forms]]. The third part concerns the [[Five Regimes]] and is strongly related to the later dialogue ''[[Laws (Plato)|The Laws]]''; and the [[Myth of Er]].

====Cornford, Hildebrandt, and Voegelin====
[[Francis Cornford]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Kurt Hildebrandt|de}}, and [[Eric Voegelin]] contributed to an establishment of sub-divisions marked with special formulae in Greek:

The paradigm of the city—the idea of [[the Good]], the ''Agathon''—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the ''Republic'', Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the [[Allegory of the Cave|allegory of the cave]], which is clarified in the [[theory of forms]]. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered ''[[polis]]'' (City). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially [[Communism|communistic]] ''polis''. Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.

In part II, the ''Embodiment of the Idea'', is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a ''polis'' (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the "paradigm", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.

The introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the ''Republic''. The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: "Is justice better than injustice?" and "Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: "Justice is preferable to injustice". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the ''Prologue'' (Book I) and the ''Epilogue'' (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public ''[[doxai]]'' (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the ''Epilogue'' describes the new arts and the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]].

==== Leo Strauss ====
[[Leo Strauss]] identified a four-part structure to the ''Republic'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} perceiving the dialogues as a drama enacted by particular characters, each with a particular perspective and level of intellect:
 
#Book I: Socrates is forcefully compelled to the house of [[Cephalus (person)|Cephalus]]. Three definitions of justice are presented, all are found lacking.
#Books II–V: [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] challenge Socrates to prove why a perfectly just man, perceived by the world as an unjust man, would be happier than the perfectly unjust man who hides his injustice and is perceived by the world as a just man. Their challenge begins and propels the dialogues; in answering the challenge, of the "charge", Socrates reveals his behavior with the young men of Athens, whom he later was convicted of corrupting. Because Glaucon and Adeimantus presume a definition of justice, Socrates digresses; he compels the group's attempt to discover justice, and then answers the question posed to him about the intrinsic value of the just life.
#Books V–VI: The "Just City in Speech" is built from the earlier books, and concerns three critiques of the city. Leo Strauss reported that his student [[Allan Bloom]] identified them as: communism, communism of wives and children, and the rule of philosophers. The "Just City in Speech" stands or falls by these complications.
#Books VII–X: Socrates has "escaped" his captors, having momentarily convinced them that the just man is the happy man, by reinforcing their prejudices. He presents a rationale for political decay, and concludes by recounting [[The Myth of Er]] ("[[everyman]]"), consolation for non-philosophers who fear death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Topics==

===Definition of justice===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
In the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.1.introduction.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Republic by Plato|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are commonsense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a [[definition]]. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a commonsense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.

At the end of Book I, Socrates agrees with Polemarchus that justice includes helping friends, but says the just man would never do harm to anybody. Thrasymachus believes that Socrates has done the men present an injustice by saying this and attacks his character and reputation in front of the group, partly because he suspects that Socrates himself does not even believe harming enemies is unjust. Thrasymachus gives his understanding of justice and injustice as "justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage".&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Book I, 344c. Plato Republic. Indianapolis: Hackett, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates finds this definition unclear and begins to question Thrasymachus. Socrates then asks whether the ruler who makes a mistake by making a law that lessens their well-being, is still a ruler according to that definition. Thrasymachus agrees that no true ruler would make such an error. This agreement allows Socrates to undermine Thrasymachus' strict definition of justice by comparing rulers to people of various professions. Thrasymachus consents to Socrates' assertion that an artist is someone who does his job well, and is a knower of some art, which allows him to complete the job well. In so doing Socrates gets Thrasymachus to admit that rulers who enact a law that does not benefit them firstly, are in the precise sense ''not'' rulers. Thrasymachus gives up, and is silent from then on. Socrates has trapped Thrasymachus into admitting the strong man who makes a mistake is not the strong man in the precise sense, and that some type of knowledge is required to rule perfectly. However, it is far from a satisfactory definition of justice.

At the beginning of Book II, Plato's two brothers challenge Socrates to define justice in the man, and unlike the rather short and simple definitions offered in Book I, their views of justice are presented in two independent speeches. Glaucon's speech reprises Thrasymachus' idea of justice; it starts with the legend of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]],  who discovered a [[Ring of Gyges|ring]] that gave him the power to become invisible. Glaucon uses this story to argue that no man would be just if he had the opportunity of doing injustice with [[impunity]]. With the power to become invisible, Gyges is able to seduce the queen, murder the king, and take over the kingdom. Glaucon argues that the just as well as the unjust man would do the same if they had the power to get away with injustice exempt from punishment. The only reason that men are just and praise justice is out of fear of being punished for injustice. The law is a product of compromise between individuals who agree not to do injustice to others if others will not do injustice to them. Glaucon says that if people had the power to do injustice without fear of punishment, they would not enter into such an agreement. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the unjust life is better than the just life. Adeimantus adds to Glaucon's speech the charge that men are only just for the results that justice brings one fortune, honor, reputation. Adeimantus challenges Socrates to prove that being just is worth something in and of itself, not only as a means to an end.

Socrates says that there is no better topic to debate. In response to the two views of injustice and justice presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus, he claims incompetence, but feels it would be impious to leave justice in such doubt. Thus the ''Republic'' sets out to define [[justice]]. Given the difficulty of this task as proven in Book I, [[Socrates]] in Book II leads his interlocutors into a discussion of justice in the city, which Socrates suggests may help them see justice not only in the person, but on a larger scale, "first in cities searching for what it is; then thusly we could examine also in some individual, examining the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler" (368e–369a).&lt;ref&gt;"Suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger..." (368, trans. Jowett).&lt;/ref&gt;

For over two and a half millennia, scholars have differed on the aptness of the city-soul analogy Socrates uses to find justice in Books II through V.&lt;ref&gt;For an oft-cited argument that the analogy does not work, see T. Penner, “Thought and Desire in Plato.” in G Vlastos ed., Plato, Vol. 2. Anchor Books, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Republic'' is a dramatic dialogue, not a treatise. Socrates' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated, only versions of justice within each city are "found" and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates  constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created. He builds a series of myths, or [[noble lie]]s, to make the cities appear just, and these conditions moderate life within the communities. The "earth born" myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins. Accordingly, Socrates defines justice as "working at that which he is naturally best suited", and "to do one's own business and not to be a busybody" (433a–433b) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three [[cardinal virtues]]: Temperance, Wisdom, and Courage, and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence. Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city, suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either, rather it is the result of a "well ordered" soul. A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types; that of the soldier, that of the producer, and that of a ruler. If a ruler can create just laws, and if the warriors can carry out the orders of the rulers, and if the producers can obey this authority, then a society will be just.

The city is challenged by Adeimantus and Glaucon throughout its development: Adeimantus cannot find happiness in the city, and Glaucon cannot find honor and glory. This hypothetical city contains no private property, no marriage, or nuclear families. These are sacrificed for the common good and doing what is best fitting to one's nature. In Book V Socrates addresses the question of "natural-ness" of and possibility for this city, concluding in Book VI, that the city's ontological status regards a construction of the soul, not of an actual metropolis.

The rule of [[philosopher-king]]s appear as the issue of possibility is raised. Socrates never positively states what justice is in the human soul/city; it appears he has created a city where justice is not found, but can be lost. It is as though in a well-ordered state, justice is not even needed, since the community satisfies the needs of humans.

In terms of why it is best to be just rather than unjust for the individual, Plato prepares an answer in Book IX consisting of three main arguments.  Plato says that a tyrant's nature will leave him with "horrid pains and pangs" and that the typical tyrant engages in a lifestyle that will be physically and mentally exacting on such a ruler.  Such a disposition is in contrast to the truth-loving [[philosopher king]], and a tyrant "never tastes of true freedom or friendship".  The second argument proposes that of all the different types of people, only the philosopher is able to judge which type of ruler is best since only he can see the [[Form of the Good]].  Thirdly, Plato argues, "Pleasures which are approved of by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest." In sum, Plato argues that philosophical pleasure is the only true pleasure since other pleasures experienced by others are simply a neutral state free of pain.

Socrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This "good city" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The paradigmatic society which stands behind every historical society is hierarchical, but social classes have a marginal permeability; there are no slaves, no discrimination between men and women. The men and women are both to be taught the same things, so they are both able to be used for the same things (451e). In addition to the ruling class of guardians ([[:wiktionary:φύλακες|φύλακες]]), which abolished riches, there is a class of private producers (demiourgoi), who may be rich or poor. A number of provisions aim to avoid making the people weak: the substitution of a universal educational system for men and women instead of debilitating music, poetry and theatre—a startling departure from Greek society. These provisions apply to all classes, and the restrictions placed on the philosopher-kings chosen from the warrior class and the warriors are much more severe than those placed on the producers, because the rulers must be kept away from any source of corruption.

In Books V-VI the abolition of riches among the guardian class (not unlike Max Weber's bureaucracy) leads controversially to the abandonment of the typical family, and as such no child may know his or her parents and the parents may not know their own children. Socrates tells a tale which is the "allegory of the good government". The rulers assemble couples for reproduction, based on breeding criteria. Thus, stable population is achieved through eugenics and social cohesion is projected to be high because familial links are extended towards everyone in the city. Also the education of the youth is such that they are taught of only works of writing that encourage them to improve themselves for the state's good, and envision (the) god(s) as entirely good, just, and the author(s) of only that which is good.

In Books VII-X stand Plato's criticism of the forms of government. It begins with the dismissal of timocracy, a sort of authoritarian regime, not unlike a military dictatorship. Plato offers an almost psychoanalytical explanation of the "timocrat" as one who saw his father humiliated by his mother and wants to vindicate "manliness". The third worst regime is oligarchy, the rule of a small band of rich people, millionaires that only respect money. Then comes the democratic form of government, and its susceptibility to being ruled by unfit "sectarian" demagogues. Finally the worst regime is tyranny, where the whimsical desires of the ruler became law and there is no check upon arbitrariness.

===Theory of universals===
{{see also|Problem of universals|Allegory of the Cave|Theory of Forms}}

The ''Republic'' contains Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave|''Allegory of the cave'']] with which he explains his concept of [[The Forms]] as an answer to the [[problem of universals]].

The allegory of the cave primarily depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silverman|first=Allan|title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/plato-metaphysics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as helping to justify the philosopher's place in society as king. Plato imagines a group of people who have lived their entire lives as prisoners, chained to the wall of a cave in the subterranean so they are unable to see the outside world behind them. However a constant flame illuminates various moving objects outside, which are silhouetted on the wall of the cave visible to the prisoners. These prisoners, through having no other experience of reality, ascribe forms to these shadows such as either "dog" or "cat".

Plato then goes on to explain how the philosopher is akin to a prisoner who is freed from the cave. The prisoner is initially blinded by the light, but when he adjusts to the brightness he sees the fire and the statues and how they caused the images witnessed inside the cave. He sees that the fire and statues in the cave were just copies of the real objects; merely imitations. This is analogous to the Forms. What we see from day to day are merely appearances, reflections of the Forms. The philosopher, however, will not be deceived by the shadows and will hence be able to see the 'real' world, the world above that of appearances; the philosopher will gain knowledge of things in themselves. In this analogy the sun is representative of the Good. This is the main object of the philosopher's knowledge. The Good can be thought of as the form of Forms, or the structuring of the world as a whole.

The prisoner's stages of understanding correlate with the levels on the [[The divided line of Plato|divided line]] which he imagines. The line is divided into what the visible world is and what the intelligible world is, with the divider being the Sun. When the prisoner is in the cave, he is obviously in the visible realm that receives no sunlight, and outside he comes to be in the intelligible realm.

The shadows witnessed in the cave correspond to the lowest level on Plato's line, that of imagination and conjecture. Once the prisoner is freed and sees the shadows for what they are he reaches the second stage on the divided line, the stage of belief, for he comes to believe that the statues in the cave are real. On leaving the cave, however, the prisoner comes to see objects more real than the statues inside of the cave, and this correlates with the third stage on Plato's line, thought. Lastly, the prisoner turns to the sun which he grasps as the source of truth, or the Form of the Good, and this last stage, named as dialectic, is the highest possible stage on the line. The prisoner, as a result of the Form of the Good, can begin to understand all other forms in reality.

At the end of this allegory, Plato asserts that it is the philosopher's burden to reenter the cave. Those who have seen the ideal world, he says, have the duty to educate those in the material world. Since the philosopher recognizes what is truly good only he is fit to rule society according to Plato.

===The dialectical forms of government===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}

While Plato spends much of the ''Republic'' having Socrates narrate a conversation about the city he founds with Glaucon and Adeimantus "in speech", the discussion eventually turns to considering four regimes that exist in reality and tend to degrade successively into each other: timocracy, oligarchy (also called plutocracy), democracy and tyranny (also called despotism).

'''Timocracy'''

Socrates defines a [[timocracy]] as a government of people who love rule and honor. Socrates argues that the timocracy emerges from aristocracy due to a civil war breaking out among the ruling class and the majority. Over time, many more births will occur to people who lack aristocratic, guardian qualities, slowly drawing the populace away from knowledge, music, poetry and "guardian education", toward money-making and the acquisition of possessions. This civil war between those who value wisdom and those who value material acquisition will continue until a compromise is reached. The timocracy values war insofar as it satisfies a love of victory and honor. The timocratic man loves physical training, and hunting, and values his abilities in warfare.

'''Oligarchy'''

Temptations create a confusion between economic status and honor which is responsible for the emergence of [[oligarchy]]. In Book VIII, Socrates suggests that wealth will not help a pilot to navigate his ship, as his concerns will be directed centrally toward increasing his wealth by whatever means, rather than seeking out wisdom or honor. The injustice of economic disparity divides the rich and the poor, thus creating an environment for criminals and beggars to emerge. The rich are constantly plotting against the poor and vice versa. The oligarchic constitution is based on property assessment and wealth qualification. Unlike the timocracy, oligarchs are also unable to fight war, since they do not wish to arm the majority for fear of their rising up against them (fearing the majority even more than their enemies), nor do they seem to pay mercenaries, since they are reluctant to spend money.

'''Democracy'''

As this socioeconomic divide grows, so do tensions between social classes. From the conflicts arising out of such tensions, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and [[democracy]] replaces the oligarchy preceding it. The poor overthrow the oligarchs and grant liberties and freedoms to citizens, creating a most variegated collection of peoples under a "supermarket" of constitutions. A visually appealing [[demagogue]] is soon lifted up to protect the interests of the lower class. However, with too much freedom, no requirements for anyone to rule, and having no interest in assessing the background of their rulers (other than honoring such people because they wish the majority well) the people become easily persuaded by such a demagogue's appeal to try and satisfy people's common, base, and unnecessary pleasures.

'''Tyranny'''

The excessive freedoms granted to the citizens of a democracy ultimately leads to a [[tyranny]], the furthest regressed type of government.  These freedoms divide the people into three socioeconomic classes: the dominating class, the elites and the commoners.  Tensions between the dominating class and the elites cause the commoners to seek out protection of their democratic liberties.  They invest all their power in their democratic demagogue, who, in turn, becomes corrupted by the power and becomes a tyrant with a small entourage of his supporters for protection and absolute control of his people.

==Reception and interpretation==

===Ancient Greece===
The idea of writing treatises on systems of government was followed some decades later by Plato's most prominent pupil [[Aristotle]], whose [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politika'']] systematises many of Plato's concepts, in some cases differing from his conclusions.

It has been suggested that [[Isocrates]] parodies the ''Republic'' in his work ''[[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]]'' by showing Callipolis' similarity to the Egyptian state founded by a king of that name.&lt;ref&gt;Most recently, Niall Livingstone, ''A Commentary on Isocrates' Busiris''. ''Mnemosyne Supplement'' 223. Leiden:  Brill, 2001 (see review by David C. Mirhady in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-09-37.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]). For earlier consideration of the similarities, see H. Thesleff, ''Studies in Platonic Chronology'', Helsinki 1982, pp. 105f., and C. Eucken, ''Isokrates'', Berlin 1983, pp. 172 ff. Both Thesleff and Eucken entertain the possibility that Isocrates was responding to an earlier version of ''Republic'' than the final version we possess.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], wrote his own imitation of Plato's ''Republic'', c. 300 BC. ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Zeno's Republic]]'' advocates a form of [[anarchism]] in which all of the citizens are philosophers, and advocates a more radical form of sexual communism than that proposed by Plato.

===Ancient Rome===

====Cicero====
The English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character [[Scipio Africanus Minor|Scipio Africanus]] expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.

''Res publica'' is not an exact translation of Plato's Greek title ''politeia''. Rather, ''politeia'' is a general term for the actual and potential forms of government for a ''Polis'' or city-state, and Plato attempts to survey all possible forms of the state. Cicero's discussion is more parochial, focusing on the improvement of the participants' own state, the [[Roman Republic]] in its final stages.

====Tacitus====
In antiquity, Plato's works were largely acclaimed, but a few commentators regarded them as too theoretical. [[Tacitus]], commented on such works as ''The Republic'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Politics'']] in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' (IV, 33):
{|-
|-
|&amp;nbsp;
|valign="top"|''Nam cunctas nationes et urbes populus aut primores aut singuli regunt: delecta ex iis (his) et consociata (constituta) rei publicae forma laudari facilius quam evenire, vel si evenit, haud diuturna esse potest.''
|&amp;nbsp;
|valign="top"|Indeed, a nation or city is ruled by the people, or by an upper class, or by a monarch. A government system that is invented [[Mixed government|from a choice of these same components]] is sooner idealised than realised; and even if realised, there will be no future for it.
|}
In this work, Tacitus undertakes the prosaic description and minute analysis of how real states are governed, attempting to derive more practical lessons about good versus bad governance than can be deduced from speculations on ideal governments.

====Augustine====
In the pivotal era of Rome's move from its ancient [[polytheism|polytheist]] religion to Christianity, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote his magnum opus ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'': Again, the references to Plato, Aristotle and Cicero and their visions of the ideal state were legion: Augustine equally described a model of the "ideal city", in his case the eternal [[Jerusalem]], using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.

===Islam===
Islamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]) produced instead a commentary on
Plato's ''Republic''. He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society.

===Hegel===
[[Hegel]] respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]], whose theories proceeded from a fictional "[[state of nature]]" defined by humanity's "natural" needs, desires and freedom.  For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the  freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history.  Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature.  Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:

{{Quotation|Plato is not the man to dabble in abstract theories and principles; his truth-loving mind has recognized and represented the truth of the world in which he lived, the truth of the one spirit that lived in him as in Greece itself.  No man can overleap his time, the spirit of his time is his spirit also; but the point at issue is, to recognize that spirit by its content.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:

{{Quotation|Plato recognized and caught up the true spirit of his times, and brought it forward in a more definite way, in that he desired to make this new principle an impossibility in his Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greece being at a crossroads, Plato's new "constitution" in the ''Republic'' was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.

===20th century===

====Gadamer====
In his 1934 ''Plato und die Dichter'' (''Plato and the Poets''), as well as several other works, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] describes the utopic city of the ''Republic'' as a [[heuristic]] [[utopia]] that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are [[irony|ironic]], a line of thought initially pursued by [[Kierkegaard]].

====Popper====
The city portrayed in the ''Republic'' struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as [[totalitarian]]. [[Karl Popper]] gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper divorced Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the [[humanitarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] tendencies of his teacher. In particular, Popper accuses Plato of betraying Socrates. [[Gilbert Ryle]], reviewing Popper's text just two years after its publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Ryle |authorlink=Gilbert Ryle |title=Popper, K.R. - ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |date=1 April 1947 |volume=56 |issue=222 |page=167–172 |doi=10.1093/mind/LVI.222.167 |jstor=2250518}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato "was Socrates' Judas."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G. (1947). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EgIxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22was+Socrates'+Judas%22 169]. See also: {{cite book |first=T.E. |last= Burke |title=The Philosophy of Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1983 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=Manchester |isbn=978-0-71900911-2 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=141&amp;dq=%22As+Gilbert+Ryle+put+it,+according+to+Popper,+Plato+was+Socrates'+Judas.+The+very+things+for+which+Socrates+lived+and+died+are+the+things+which+Plato+tries+to+demolish+with+words+put+into+Socrates'+mouth%22 141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as "human cattle"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolving of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as "keeping one's place".&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, Karl]] (1950) ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]], Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voegelin====
[[Eric Voegelin]] in ''Plato and Aristotle'' (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave  meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II-V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that [[Socrates]] himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of [[knowledge]]. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of [[social mobility]]. The exercise of power is built on the '[[noble lie]]' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no [[family]] among the guardians, another crude version of [[Max Weber|Max Weber's]] concept of [[bureaucracy]] as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.

====Strauss and Bloom====

Some of [[Plato]]'s proposals have led theorists like [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Allan Bloom]] to ask readers to consider the possibility that [[Socrates]] was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the "Just City in Speech" that seem [[contradictory]], which raise the possibility Socrates is employing [[irony]] to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, [[Plato]] has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the ''Republic''.

One of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class '[[sacred]]'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.

Leo Strauss's approach developed out of a belief that [[Plato]] wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the [[exoteric]]-[[esoteric]] distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the "Just City in Speech" of Books V-VI come to pass, or whether it is just an [[allegory]]. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing [[Cicero]]'s opinion that the ''Republic's'' true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the "Just City in Speech" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the ''Republic'' "is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros".&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that [[Plato's Academy]] produced a number of [[tyrant]]s who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus]], tyrant of [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]; [[Chaeron of Pellene|Chaeron]], tyrant of [[Pellene]]; [[Erastus of Scepsis|Erastus]] and [[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]], tyrants of [[Skepsis]]; [[Hermias of Atarneus]] and [[Assos]]; and [[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became "tyrants" through studying in the Academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, [[totalitarian]] sense of the concept.  Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Schofield, "Plato and Practical Politics", in C. Rowe and M. Schofield (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on the city–soul analogy====
Many critics, both ancient and modern (like [[Julia Annas]]), have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different "members" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive "government." Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. In a definitive treatment of the subject, Blössner (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Blössner, Norbert. The City-Soul Analogy, G. R. F. Ferrari (Translator). In: G. R. F. Ferrari (Ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 2007. (Ch. 13; pp. 345–385).&lt;/ref&gt; presents and argues for the case that the ''Republic'' is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the ''Republic'' as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.

====Practicality====
The above-mentioned views have in common that they view the ''Republic'' as a theoretical work, not as a set of guidelines for [[good governance]]. However, Popper insists that the Republic, "was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1950) The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato, New York: Routledge. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] argues that at least in ''intent'', and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the ''Republic'' was meant as a practical one by Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (2004) ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', end of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

One of Plato's recurring techniques in the ''Republic'' is to refine the concept of justice with reference to various examples of greater or lesser injustice.  However, in ''The Concept of Injustice'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Heinze]] challenges the assumption that 'justice' and 'injustice' form a mutually exclusive pair.  Heinze argues that such an assumption traces not from strict deductive logic, but from the arbitrary etymology of the word 'injustice'.   Heinze critiques what he calls 'classical' Western justice theory for having perpetuated that logical error, which first appears in Plato's ''Republic'', but manifests throughout traditional political philosophy, in thinkers otherwise as different as [[Aristotle]], [[Aquinas]], Locke, [[Rousseau]], [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]].

In 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the ''Republic'' the greatest philosophical text ever written. [[Julian Baggini]] argued that although the work "was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/07/books.humanities |title=The thinking person's favourite thinkers  |last=Gibbons |first=Fiachra |date=September 7, 2001 |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, [[Jo Walton]]'s 2015 novel ''[[The Just City]]'' explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the ''Republic'' in practice.

==Place in Plato's corpus==
The ''Republic'' is generally placed in the ''[[Plato#Dialogues|middle period]]'' of Plato's dialogues—that is, it is believed to be written after the ''early period'' dialogues but before the ''late period'' dialogues.  However, the distinction of this group from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others.  Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—with their separate methodologies—all agreed that the ''Republic'' was well distinguished, along with ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'' and ''Theaetetus''.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood, Leonard, ''The Chronology of Plato's Dialogues'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first book of the ''Republic'', which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood (1990), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Several [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as [[Phaedo]], or the dialogue [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], written around 200-300 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/oxyrhynchuspapyr15gren#page/186/mode/2up/search/plato|title=The Oxyrhynchus papyri|authors=Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt|year=1898|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], written ca. 350 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/essenes/plato_at_nag_hammadi.htm|title=Plato's Republic at Nag Hammadi c.350 CE|author=Mountain Man Graphics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.

Rings such as the ring of integers are semiprimitive, and an [[artinian ring|artinian]] semiprimitive ring is just a [[semisimple ring]].  Semiprimitive rings can be understood as [[subdirect product]]s of [[primitive ring]]s, which are described by the [[Jacobson density theorem]].

==Definition==
A ring is called '''semiprimitive''' or '''Jacobson semisimple''' if its [[Jacobson radical]] is the [[zero ideal]].

A ring is semiprimitive if and only if it has a [[faithful module|faithful]] [[semisimple module|semisimple left module]].  The semiprimitive property is left-right symmetric, and so a ring is semiprimitive if and only if it has a faithful semisimple right module.

A ring is semiprimitive if and only if it is a subdirect product of left [[primitive ring]]s.

A [[commutative ring]] is semiprimitive if and only if it is a subdirect product of [[field (mathematics)|fields]], {{harv|Lam|1995|p=137}}.

A left [[artinian ring]] is semiprimitive if and only if it is [[semisimple ring|semisimple]], {{harv|Lam|2001|p=54}}. Such rings are sometimes called [[semisimple Artinian]], {{harv|Kelarev|2002|p=13}}.

==Examples==

* The ring of integers is semiprimitive, but not semisimple.
* Every primitive ring is semiprimitive.
* The product of two fields is semiprimitive but not primitive.
* Every [[von Neumann regular ring]] is semiprimitive.

[[Nathan Jacobson|Jacobson]] himself has defined a ring to be "semisimple" if and only if it is a [[subdirect product]] of [[simple ring]]s, {{harv|Jacobson|1989|p=203}}.  However, this is a stricter notion, since the endomorphism ring of a countably infinite dimensional vector space is semiprimitive, but not a subdirect product of simple rings, {{harv|Lam|1995|p=42}}.

'''Social metabolism''' or '''socioeconomic metabolism''' is the set of [[Stock and flow|flow]]s of [[material]]s and [[energy]] that occur between [[Nature]] and [[society]], between different societies, and within societies. These human-controlled material and energy flows are a basic feature of all societies but their magnitude and diversity largely depend on specific [[culture|cultures]], or sociometabolic regimes.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Manuel |first1= |last2= Toledo |first2= Víctor M. |year= 2014|title= The Social Metabolism: A Socio-Ecological Theory of Historical Change|url= https://books.google.es/books/about/The_Social_Metabolism.html?id=JwzvAwAAQBAJ| publisher= Springer |isbn= 978-3-319-06357-7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"&gt;{{es}}[http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/rz/v34n136/v34n136a4.pdf El metabolismo social: una nueva teoría socioecológica.] Relaciones. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Social or socioeconomic metabolism is also described as "the self-reproduction and evolution of the biophysical structures of human society. It comprises those biophysical transformation processes, distribution processes, and flows, which are controlled by humans for their purposes. The biophysical structures of society (‘in use stocks’) and socioeconomic metabolism together form the biophysical basis of society."
&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social metabolic processes begin with the [[human]] ''appropriation'' of materials and energy from nature. These can be ''transformed'' and ''circulated'' to be ''consumed'' and ''excreted'' finally back to Nature itself. Each of these processes has a different [[environmental impact]] depending on how it is performed, the amount of materials and energy involved in the process, the area where it occurs, the time available or the Nature's regenerative capacity.&lt;ref name= "Metabolism"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "metabolismo"/&gt;

Social metabolism represents an extension of the metabolism concept from human bodies to the biophysical basis of society. Humans build and operate mines and farms, oil refineries and power stations, factories and infrastructure to supply the energy and material flows needed for the physical reproduction of a specific culture. In-use stocks, which comprise buildings, vehicles, appliances, infrastructure, etc., are built up and maintained by the different industrial processes that are part of social metabolism. These stocks then provide service to people in form of shelter, transportation, or communication.

Society and its metabolism together form an [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] system, a complex system that reproduces itself. Neither culture nor social metabolism can reproduce themselves in isolation. Humans need food and shelter, which is delivered by social metabolism, and the latter needs humans to operate it.

Studies of social metabolism can be carried out at different levels of system aggregation, see [[material flow analysis]]. In material flow accounting, for example, the [[Factor of production|inputs]] and [[Output (economics)|outputs]] of materials and energy of a particular [[State (polity)|state]] or region, as well as [[import]]s and [[export]]s, are analysed. Such studies are facilitated by the ease of access to information about [[commercial transaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year= 2000|title= The Weight of Nations: Material Outflows from Industrial Economies |url= http://pdf.wri.org/weight_of_nations.pdf |publisher= World Resources Institute |isbn=978-1-56973-439-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carpintero Redondo |first= Óscar |year= 2005|title= El metabolismo de la economía española: recursos naturales y huella ecológica (1955-2000) |url= http://www.fcmanrique.org/recursos/publicacion/elmetabolismo.pdf|language= Spanish|publisher= Fundación César Manrique |isbn=978-84-88550-60-6 }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

Social or socioeconomic metabolism stipulates that human society and its interaction with Nature form a complex  self-reproducing system, and it can therefore be seen as [[paradigm]] for studying the biophysical basis of human societies under the aspect of self-reproduction. "A common paradigm can facilitate model combination and integration, which can lead to more robust and comprehensive interdisciplinary assessments of sustainable development strategies. ... The use of social or socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm can help to justify alternative economic concepts."&lt;ref name="Pauliuk Hertwich 2015 pp. 83–93"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pauliuk | first=Stefan | last2=Hertwich | first2=Edgar G. | title=Socioeconomic metabolism as paradigm for studying the biophysical basis of human societies | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=119 | year=2015 | issn=0921-8009 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.08.012 | pages=83–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use American English|date=October 2017}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Feminine Hygiene Products in a Walmart.png|thumb|Feminine hygiene products are subject to tax in a number of countries]]
A '''tampon tax''' is a popular term used to call attention to the fact that [[tampons]]—and other [[feminine hygiene]] products—are subject to [[value-added tax]], unlike the [[tax exemption]] status granted to other products considered basic necessities. Proponents of tax exemption argue that tampons, [[sanitary napkins]], [[menstrual cups]] and comparable products constitute basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt.

Proponents argue that feminine hygiene products serving the basic menstrual cycle should be classified alongside other unavoidable, [[tax exempt]] necessities, such as groceries and personal medical items.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; The [[BBC]] estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use [[feminine hygiene]] products for about a week each month for about 30 years.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; While [[sales tax]] policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed at the same rate as non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general [[consumption tax]] on sanitary products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; When asked about equivalent exemptions for men, proponents argue that no male products, [[condoms]] included, are comparable to feminine hygiene products, since menstruation is biological and "[[feminine hygiene]] is not a choice".&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; As the vast majority of consumers of feminine hygiene products are women, the increased cost has been criticized as being discriminatory against women.&lt;ref name="Hinckley Journal of Politics:Public Discourse of Policies Concerning Menstrual Taboo"/&gt; The tampon tax is not a special tax levied directly on feminine hygiene products.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;

After the tax in Canada was removed mid-2015, women began protesting in other countries later that year.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On July 21, 2018, India eliminated the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 12% from sanitary napkins.

== Tax law by jurisdiction ==

* Ireland levies no value-added tax on tampons, panty liners, and sanitary towels. While other European Union countries are barred from creating zero-rated value added, Ireland's exemptions are [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]].&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;
* Slovakia levies a 20% tax on sanitary products—the basic goods rate. A Slovakian film director commented that there are no plans to change the law and that east Europe missed elements of feminist change while living under communist government.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom has levied a [[value-added tax (United Kingdom)|value-added tax]] on sanitary products since it joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. This rate was reduced to 5% specifically for sanitary products in 2000 with lobbying from [[Member of Parliament]] [[Dawn Primarolo]] saying that this reduction was "about fairness, and doing what we can to lower the cost of a necessity."&lt;ref name="theweek: UK News"/&gt; This is the lowest rate possible under the [[European Union]]'s [[European Union value added tax|value added tax law]], which as of 2015 does not allow zero rates. The [[UK Independence Party]] raised the issue in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] with promises to withdraw from the European Union and allow the zero rate. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] commented, when prompted, that the tampon tax campaign was "long-standing" and a complicated issue within the European Union.&lt;ref name="BBC: international"/&gt; In England, one in ten women between 14 and 21 cannot afford menstrual management products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/plan-international-uks-research-on-period-poverty-and-stigma|title=Plan International UK's Research on Period Poverty and Stigma|last=|first=|date=December 20, 2017|website=Plan International UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/one-in-10-young-women-struggle-to-afford-pads-and-tampons-a8008671.html|title=Period Poverty: Why One in 10 Young Women Struggle to Afford Pads and Tampons|last=Rowlingson|first=Karen|date=October 21, 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Coryton]] led a "Stop taxing periods, period" campaign with an online petition to have the European Union remove the value-added tax for sanitary products.&lt;ref name="Coryton"/&gt; [[George Osborne]] mentioned the petition by name in his 2015 [[Autumn Statement]] pledge to end the tampon tax at the European Union level. The petition platform's CEO cited the campaign as an example of successful [[clicktivism]],&lt;ref name="Clicktivism"/&gt; with over 320,000 signatures.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_student"/&gt; In March 2016, Parliament created legislation to eliminate the tampon VAT.&lt;ref name="BBC: wiki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ind_Cameron"/&gt; It was expected to go into effect by April 2018 but did not do so; several British women protested for it publicly while displaying blood stains from their periods.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; On the 3rd October 2018, new EU VAT rules that will allow the UK to stop taxing sanitary products were approved by the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobarik: UK one step closer to ending the tampon tax |url= http://conservativeeurope.com/news/mobarik-uk-a-step-closer-to-ending-the-tampon-tax|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 October 2018|author=Nosheena Mobarik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
In July 2017, a pilot program began in Scotland to have free sanitary products available at schools and food banks for women who cannot afford them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/access-sanitary-products-aberdeen-pilot-evaluation-report/pages/2/|title=Access to sanitary products Aberdeen pilot: evaluation report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot scheme was launched for six months in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], with £42,500 of funding from the devolved [[Scottish Government]] in order to address the growing scandal of "period poverty". It was believed 1,000 girls would benefit from the scheme, as there were reports of teenage girls using tissues, toilet roll, torn T-shirts and even newspaper as makeshift sanitary products, with some girls even skipping school altogether. It was decided to launch the scheme to improve attainment and school attendance, as well as improve confidence amongst teenage girls during their period; and Scotland is believed to be the first country in the world to give out free sanitary products as part of a government-sponsored initiative.

Further to this half year pilot program, Scotland's opposition Labour Party intends to introduce a bill to make this permanent. Scotland is the first country to ban period poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-hampshire-43148080/period-poverty-helping-homeless-and-vulnerable-women |title=Period poverty: Helping homeless and vulnerable women - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2018-02-26 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the WHO and UNICEF showed that one out of five women in Scotland have been forced to improvise with items including toilet paper and old clothes due to the high cost of commercial products.

In the United States, almost all states tax "tangible individual property" but exempt non-luxury "necessities": groceries, [[medical prescription|prescriptions]], [[prosthetics]], agriculture supplies, and sometimes clothes—the exemptions vary between states.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Five states do not have a state sales tax (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon), and {{As of|2018|11|lc=yes}}, ten states specifically exempted essential hygiene products (Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, and Pennsylvania).&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/these-are-the-u-s-states-that-tax-women-for-having-per-1793848102|title=These are the U.S. states that tax women for having periods|last=Hillin|first=Taryn|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ktnv.com/news/national/democracy-2018/election-results-2018-nevada-ballot-questions-1-6|title=Election Results 2018: Nevada Ballot Questions 1-6|work=KNTV|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., most states charge sales tax for women's pads and tampons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten states have dropped the tampon tax — Minnesota, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, according to NPR and CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Diaz |first=Andrea |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/nevada-tampon-tax-repealed-trnd/index.html |title=Nevada becomes the 10th state to eliminate 'pink tax' on menstrual products |publisher=CNN |date=2015-09-01 |accessdate=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven other states have introduced such legislation, most recently Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In January 2018, California rejected a proposal to eliminate tampon tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/18/scotland-end-period-poverty-tampon-tax/502020002/|title=Women get their periods every month — and it's incredibly expensive|work=USA TODAY|accessdate=2 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many federal assistance programs such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and WIC (Women, Infants and Children) don’t allow the use of an EBT for products such as pads or tampons despite the products' classification as medical devices.  The IRS does not classify female products as medical devices, thus blocking women from buying them with pre-tax dollars in both flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/education/2018/08/14/lack-feminine-hygiene-products-keeps-girls-out-school/948313002/|title=Teen girls are missing school because they don't have access to feminine hygiene products|work=The Tennessean|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some changes to the tampon taxes but most of these changes are state level or by city. On a smaller scale, individual cities have also changed their laws in favor of eliminating the tampon tax. 

==== California ====
California Assemblywoman [[Cristina Garcia (politician)|Cristina Garcia]] reported that California women each pay roughly [[US$]]7 per month over 40 years, constituting US$20 million in annual taxes. Garcia and [[Ling Ling Chang]] proposed a bill to remove the tampon tax in early 2016. At this period, only a handful of the country's states exempted tampons, and several others had no state sales tax. Garcia held that women were taxed "for being women" and bore an economic burden for having no other choice but to buy these products. Garcia and Chang added that the tax was "regulatory discrimination" that disproportionately affected poor women and women of color, and that it likely persisted due to [[taboo|social taboos]] against discussing menstruation.&lt;ref name="WaPo: Garcia"/&gt; Both houses of the [[California State Legislature]] voted to exempt tampons from taxation in June 2016,&lt;ref name="USAT: NY"/&gt; but the bill was vetoed by the state's governor, [[Jerry Brown]], three months later.&lt;ref name="Reuters: Cali veto"/&gt;

California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed AB-1561 due to the potential loss of money in taxing feminine hygiene products. In response, Cristina Garcia co-authored AB-0479: Common Cents Tax Reform Act with Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, which is a new measure outlining a solution to offset the feminine product and diaper tax exemption by increasing the tax on hard liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/03/13/theres-no-happy-hour-for-menstruation-tax-liquor-instead-of-tampons-lawmakers-say/?utm_term=.f1b7dfe6354e|title='There's no happy hour for menstruation': Tax liquor instead of tampons, lawmakers say|last=Phillips|first=Kristine|date=March 13, 2017|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, California State Legislature passed AB 10 requiring public middle schools and high schools where at least 40% of students meet the federal poverty level to stock half of the restrooms with free tampons and sanitary napkins. The law was passed in an effort to eliminate the cost burden and keep low-income students in schools during their menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB10|title=Bill Text  - AB-10 Feminine hygiene products: public school restrooms.|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/TA/AC/PL/tier1.asp|title=Tier I Schools - Persistently Lowest-Achieving Schools (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies involved in supplying the necessary feminine hygiene products (tampons and pads) for complete menstrual care in the restrooms of schools include WAXIE and Hospeco. They also supply various options for menstrual product dispensers that have a time delay mechanism to prevent products from being overused and/or abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.waxie.com/ab10-menstrual-care|title=AB10 Menstrual Care {{!}} Waxie Sanitary Supply|last=Supply|first=WAXIE Sanitary|website=info.waxie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hospeco.com/assets/user/documents/HSC_school_rules_L-HSC-0113-S_online.pdf|title=Do you know the new school rules?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hospeco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New York ====
In July 2016, New York State exempted feminine hygiene products from taxation, reducing the state's tax revenue by an estimated US$10 million annually.&lt;ref name="USAT: NY" /&gt; Connecticut and Illinois also removed their tax in 2016, with Florida following suit in 2017.&lt;ref name="BBC_Why" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff_Florida" /&gt;

==== New Jersey ====
A 2018 empirical study on New Jersey's 2005 tax break on menstrual products found that "repealing tampon taxes removes an unequal tax burden and could make menstrual hygiene products more accessible for low-income consumers."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cotropia|first=Christopher Anthony|last2=Rozema|first2=Kyle|date=2017|title=Who Would Benefit from Repealing Tampon Taxes? Empirical Evidence from New Jersey|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2999970|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2999970|issn=1556-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study utilized data from more than 16,000 purchases in 2004-2006 made in New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, using these latter nearby states as the control group. Through a differences-in-differences approach, they found that after the repeal, consumer prices on menstrual products decreased by 7.3%, relative to the control states. This was greater than the 6.9% sales tax, suggesting that the consumers benefitted from the tax break. Upon further analysis, the study also found that the decrease in consumer prices was greater for low-income consumers than high-income consumers (3.9% decrease versus 12.4% decrease).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This suggests that low-income consumers received the most benefit from the tax break, while high-income consumers shared the benefit with producers of menstrual products.

== Activism ==
Supporters of the exemption of said taxes are calling their efforts "menstrual equity", explaining it as a social movement that strives for feminine products like tampons to be considered necessities. Things that are considered necessities, for example toilet paper, are not taxed. Activists are often being led by members of government. Councilwomen Julissa Ferreras-Copeland led a movement with a tampon tax pilot project ultimately providing free pads and tampons at a local high school in Queens, New York. Ferreras-Copeland's effort has now been expanded into 25 different schools around New York City. Other democrats including Ydanis Rodriguez and council speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito are advocating for state legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. 

Free the Tampon, an advocate for free menstrual products estimates that it would cost less than $5 a year per user to provide tampons and pads in restrooms at schools and businesses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/new-york-city-bill-to-call-for-free-tampons-in-public-restrooms-shelters-and-jails/|title=New York City Bill to Call for Free Tampons in Public School Restrooms, Shelters and Jails|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|work=Well|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Tatsuo Miyajima'''|宮島 達男|Miyajima Tatsuo|January 16, 1957 – }} is a [[Japan]]ese [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[installation art]]ist who lives in [[Moriya, Ibaraki|Moriya]], in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] prefecture, [[Japan]]. His work frequently employs digital [[LED]] counters and is primarily concerned with the function and significance of time and space, especially within the context of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.

==Early life==
Miyajima was born in [[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa City]], [[Tokyo]] on January 16, 1957. He graduated from the Oil Painting course in the Fine Arts department of [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] in 1984, and completed his MA at the same university in 1986.&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/tatsuo-miyajima/cv|title=Tatsuo Miyajima CV {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Although Miyajima originally trained as a [[painting|painter]], and briefly considered himself to be a [[performance art]]ist, the majority of his work now takes the form of [[installation art|installation]] and [[sculpture]]. He has admitted that, in effect, his work now "performs" on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/arts/tatsuo-miyajima-is-keeper-of-the-light-fantastic-6801850.html|title=Tatsuo Miyajima is keeper of the light fantastic|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; His core artistic concepts are: "Keep Changing, Connect with Everything, Continue Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tatsuomiyajima.com/concepts/|title=Concepts|work=Tatsuo Miyajima|access-date=2018-07-19|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Work===

In 1970s, Miyajima practised performance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/1995/running_time_clear_zero/about_the_artist/tatsuo_miyajima|title=Running Time / Clear Zero|website=www.artangel.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially influenced by the work of [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Allan Krapow]] and [[Christo]], and considered his performance work as an "action for society".&lt;ref name=friezearticle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/keep_changing_connect_with_everything |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211135749/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/keep_changing_connect_with_everything/ |archivedate=2014-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire to create more enduring work - in contrast to the necessarily ephemeral nature of his performance and actions - motivated him to begin working on sculpture and installations.&lt;ref name = friezearticle /&gt;

===LED works===

Miyajima made his first LED counter in 1988; this has formed the basis for much of his later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tatsuo-miyajima-2300|title=Tatsuo Miyajima born 1957 {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a block will display two digits in red or green, and count from 1 to 99. The counters never register zero, because, for Miyajima, the idea of [[zero (number)|zero]] is a purely Western concept.&lt;ref name = friezearticle /&gt;  He has subsequently linked together different displays so that they can respond to each other; he calls these systems 'regions'.

==Exhibitions==
Miyajima's first solo exhibitions include "Human Stone" at Gallery Parergon, Tokyo in 1983, and "Time" at Maki Gallery, Tokyo in 1986.&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com"/&gt; More recently he has shown at [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]] (1996), [[Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain]] (1996), [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1997), [[Miyanomori Art Museum]], Hokkaido (2010), and [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]],  Beijing (2011).&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt;

He has exhibited as part of numerous group exhibitions, notably the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1988 and 1999, as well [[Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art]] (2008), and [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]] (2012).&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt;

==Art market==
Miyajima is represented by Buchmann Galerie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buchmanngalerie.com/artists/tatsuo-miyajima/works|title=Tatsuo Miyajima – Works {{!}} Buchmann Galerie|website=www.buchmanngalerie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lisson Gallery]].&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt; In 2010, one of Miyajima's works, "T.

[[File:TheStoryOfArt.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Story of Art''''', by [[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]], is a survey of the [[art history|history of art]] from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]] (2006), ''The Story of Art'', London: [[Phaidon Press]], 978-0-7148-324-70&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1950 by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]], the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the [[visual arts]]. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over seven million copies have been sold, making it the best selling art book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/17/story-of-art-eh-gombrich Picture perfect.] William Skidelsky, ''[[The Observer]]'', 17 May 2009. theguardian.com Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its 16th edition and has been translated into approximately 30 languages.

==Summary==
The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. The first chapter starts examining [[prehistoric art]] and native cultures. The next four chapters are dedicated to the greater ancient cultures, especially Greece and Rome. Starting with chapter 8, Gombrich then begins to focus on Central European art, returning to a more global view in chapter 24 that deals with art of the late 18th and early 19th century in England, France and America. A striking property of ''The Story of Art'' is the amount of illustrations it contains, with more than 50% of the book's pages devoted to color photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

The first two sentences of the book have become famous: ″There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=E.

The '''Theory of Narrative Thought''' is a theory of thought designed to bridge the gap between the [[Brain|neurological functioning of the brain]] and the flow of everyday [[Consciousness|conscious experience.]] Proposed by Lee Roy Beach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Decision making: Linking narratives and action|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2009|journal = Narrative Inquiry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The psychology of narrative thought: How the stories we tell ourselves shape our lives.|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2010|journal = Bloomington IN: Xlibris|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cognitive errors and the narrative nature of epistemic thought|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2011|journal = Perspectives on thinking, judging, and decision making.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Universitesforlaget.|editor-first = W.|editor-last = Brun|editor2-last = Keren|editor2-first = G.|editor3-last = Kirkebøen|editor3-first = G.|editor4-last = Montgomery|editor4-first = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory is expanded by Beach, Byron Bissell, and James Wise (2016).

==Background==

	The theory of narrative thought (TNT) is a refinement of image theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image theory: Decision making in personal and organizational contexts|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|publisher = Wiley|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Chichester UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Image theory: Principles, goals, and plans in decision making|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 1987|journal = Acta Psychologica|doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(87)90034-5|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mitchell|first2 = T. R. |volume=66 |pages=201–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed as an alternative to [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theory of games and economic behavior|last = von Neumann|first = J.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1947|isbn = |location = Princeton NJ|pages = |last2 = Morgenstern|first2 = O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of image theory is that decisions are shaped by long-term attempts to manage the future rather than short-term results. The image theory model of the decision process, called the compatibility test, held up in both laboratory and field tests (Beach, L. R., &amp; Connolly, T. (2005). The Psychology of Decision Making: People in Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and has been retained, but renamed, as the discrepancy test in TNT.

	Image theory’s weakness was its failure to adequately specify the concept of image.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Subsequent attempts to specify it led to its replacement by narrative, the specification of which was based upon the work of Walter R. Fisher (1987) in [[Communication theory|communications theory]]. Exploration of the specification’s implications led to TNT, in which [[narrative]] is supposed to be the natural mode of human thought in a story that defines what led up to this moment, what is happening now, and what can be expected to happen in the future. This, in turn, led to examination of the apparently “natural” urge to think narratively and its roots in known neurological processes that format neural events in a rudimentary narrative form. This, in turn, led to the view that narrative thinking is a product of [[evolution]].

==Narrative development==
The theory of narrative thought (TNT) describes the brain as being composed of subsystems that act together to give rise to consciousness. Some of these subsystems, such as perception and memory, contribute content to consciousness. One subsystem in the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] codes the content in language while a corresponding subsystem in the right hemisphere links it with emotions. Working together as a single system, called the “interpreter,” they organize the content of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s in charge? Free will and the science of the brain|last = Gazzaniga|first = M. S.|publisher = HarperCollins|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order is the origin of narrative but at this point it is rudimentary, a proto-narrative. The proto-narrative is simple but up-to-date; it reflects what is happening at the moment. For infants, proto-narratives are pretty much the whole story, but as memories are formed, past proto-narratives become linked with present proto-narratives and, as caregivers lend a hand, more elaborate narratives take shape. As a store of elaborated narratives develops, proto-narratives continue to update them with current information from the [[perceptual system]]. This keeps the narratives aware of what is going on in the internal and external environments. Over time, two kinds of narratives develop.

== Two kinds of narrative ==
Chronicle narratives are about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what is expected to happen in the future. They are the ongoing story of one’s conscious experience. Procedural narratives are about how to do things. They are about the actions one can take to better inform one’s chronicle narratives. They also are about the actions one can take to shape the future by acting directly upon the internal or external environment to produce desired results. Procedural narratives are subordinate to chronicle narratives. When used alone, the word “narrative” refers to chronicle narratives. [Note that chronicle and procedural narratives are parallel to, but not identical to, Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) System 1 and System 2.]

==Nature of narratives==
Narratives are more than just updated memories about what has happened recently. They are the stuff of ongoing conscious experience, of moment-to-moment thinking, of the richness of mental life, and they are the foundations for informed guesses about the future. They are a mixture of memories and of visual, auditory, and other imagery as well as the accompanying emotions. Their elements are symbols that stand for real or imagined events and actors (including oneself), where the actors are animate beings or inanimate forces. The events and actors are linked by causality. Causality implies temporality and, for animate actors, purpose. That is, a narrative consists of a temporal arrangement of events that are purposefully caused by animate beings (including oneself) or are the result of inanimate forces. The narrative’s storyline is its meaning, which is created by a coherent arrangement of the events and actors.

==Causality, plausibility, and coherence==
Causality is the structural backbone of all narratives, both chronicle and procedural. This is because it is the source of narrative temporality. This temporal aspect of causality works retrospectively, from effect to cause, which allows one to account for what is happening now as a result of what has happened in the past. And it works prospectively, from cause to effect, which allows one to set expectations for what will happen in the future as a result of what is happening now and what came before. A good narrative is plausible if its actors’ actions contribute to the story line and are not uncharacteristic, i.e., are reasonably consistent across narratives. A good narrative is coherent if the actions of the actors and the effects of those actions conform to one’s causal rules. In short, a good narrative makes sense in that there are no loose ends.

==Causal rules==
Noncontingent rules are about what to expect to happen as a result of actions by other people or outside forces over which one has no control. Contingent rules are about what one expects to happen as a result of one’s own actions. These rules form the causal linkages among narratives’ elements and are the bases of expected and action projections respectively.

Causal rules tell one what caused something to happen or how to make something happen. Another kind of rule, normative rules, tell one why something should happen. Normative rules are about what qualifies as desirable and what does not. That is, normative rules are standards for what is ethical, right, proper, principled, reasonable, appropriate, preferred, and so on, all of which are one’s values and preferences.

==Current narrative==
The current narrative is the narrative one is focused upon at the moment. It is the narrative that makes sense of what has happened leading up to the present, what is happening right now, and what will happen next. The latter, results from extrapolating the past and present segments of current narrative to make educated guesses about the future. A guess about how the future might unfold if one does not make an effort to change it is called an expected projection and a guess about how the future might unfold as a result of one’s efforts to change it is called an action projection. Both projections are narratives. Both are extrapolations of the current narrative. Both are constructed using one’s store of causal rules. Both are subject to the scrutiny of normative rules. Both are imaginary.

==Decision making==
When the future is projected, based upon the current narrative, the emotions associated with the relevant normative rules provide the criteria for evaluating the desirability of that future. Each feature of the projected future elicits an emotion that reflects how well it meets the relevant standard(s) set by one’s normative rule(s). A positive emotion is elicited if it meets the standard(s) and a negative emotion is elicited if it doesn’t. The strength of the elicited emotion is a function of the degree to which the feature exceeds or falls short of the standard(s). When evaluating the desirability of the projected future, the focus is on the features that fall short of one’s standards—called violations. If the violations are too abundant, too large, or too important, the associated negative emotions mount to a point at which one must conclude that the projected future will be undesirable. When this happens, survival, or simply unacceptable discomfort, dictates that something must be done to change the future so that when it arrives it will be more desirable than if things are simply allowed to happen as they will. The action agenda for changing the future is called a plan and execution of that plan is called implementation. The anticipated result of implementing the plan is the action projection. An acceptable plan is one that offers a sufficiently desirable future, a future that is compatible with one’s values and preferences.

==Plans==
A plan is a narrative about how one intends to go from the present to a more desirable future—how one intends to influence the course of ongoing events in a desirable direction. Like other narratives, plans must be plausible and coherent. Plausibility means that all the relevant elements, including oneself, are included and that their proposed actions are reasonable. Coherence means that the sequence of tactics creates a feasible causal chain from the present to the desired future. Plausibility is revealed by the ease with which one can imagine oneself and other actors engaging in a successful implementation of the plan, even if it will require hard work. Plausibility also requires that this activity seems natural and lifelike, and that success doesn’t rely on unlikely events or unrealistic amounts effort and resources. Coherence is revealed by the completeness of the causal chain of tactics, even though one knows one probably won’t end up doing things exactly as planned. A plan that lacks plausibility and/or coherence inspires little confidence (which is an emotion associated with a normative standard), which prompts its revision or replacement by another plan.

Briefly stated: (1) There are two kinds of narratives: chronicle narratives, which are stories about ongoing events, including the expected future, and procedural narratives, which are stories about how to do things; (2) both kinds of narrative are structured by time and causality and both are “good narratives” if they are plausible and coherent; (3) the undesirability of the expected future is assessed by its failure to meet standards set by one’s values and preferences; (4) action is prompted when the projected future is determined to be so undesirable as to be unacceptable.

==TNT as a theory of mind==

Both Beach (2010) and Beach, Bissell, and Wise (2016) open with a historical description of the ebbing fortunes of “executive mind,” as a scientific concept but how, over the past 50 years, it has come back, albeit on firmer ground, as “the brain.” But while “the brain” may be the new name for “mind,” the fact that the old name continues to be used in both scientific and everyday discourse suggests that the new name doesn’t quite do the job. That is, rather than merely reflecting sloppy usage, the word “mind” reflects something more than merely neural activity in the brain.

Other than the computer analogy and the information processing metaphor, cognitive science has produce no encompassing theory. But it seems to be widely assumed that when such a theory appears, it will necessarily be in terms of brain function to which conscious experience is subsidiary and derivative. TNT challenges this assumption by recognizing that brain functioning and conscious experience are two qualitatively different things. Although subjective experience derives from brain activity, it is not reducible to it. Therefore, the theory recognizes the importance of the brain and how it works, but it also recognizes the importance of conscious experience and how it works. Putting the two together as equally legitimate and complementary provides the “something more” than neural activity in the brain that is implied by the word “mind.”
 
Much has been written about the characteristics of mind, mostly by philosophers. The commonalities across those discussions reveals three primary characteristics that a theory of mind should address and that are, in fact, addressed by TNT: Thinking that is both reflective and reflexive—that is able to consider both itself and things other than itself. Knowing that allows distinctions between truth and falsity, error and ignorance, and belief and opinion. Purpose that results in actions aimed at foreseen objectives. In addition, TNT addresses the most common questions raised in these philosophical discussions: How does the mind operate? What are its “intrinsic excellences or defects?” How is it related to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, and to other minds? Is it possessed in common with animals? Does it exist separate from corporeality? Insofar as the theory adequately deals with these characteristics and answers these questions, it qualifies as a modern theory of mind.

[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|In Western business cultures, a [[handshake]] when meeting someone is a signal of initial cooperation.]]

'''Tit for tat''' is an English saying meaning "equivalent [[retaliation]]". It is also a highly effective [[strategy]] in [[game theory]] for the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]]. The strategy was first introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]] in [[Robert Axelrod]]'s two tournaments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawrules.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/the-axelrod-tournaments/ The Axelrod Tournaments]&lt;/ref&gt; held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the [[simplest]] strategy and the most successful in direct competition.

The phrase originally came from another phrase "tip for tap", first used in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Game theory: a critical text|author=Shaun Hargreaves Heap, [[Yanis Varoufakis]]|page=191|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-25094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intelligent agent|agent]] using this strategy will first cooperate, then subsequently replicate an opponent's previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to [[superrationality]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in [[biology]].

== Implications ==
The success of the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasizes an adversarial nature, took many by surprise. Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions. After the first competition, new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other; a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat would have had to be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind.

This result may give insight into how groups of animals (and particularly human societies) have come to live in largely (or entirely) cooperative societies, rather than the individualistic "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.#Nature, red in tooth and claw|red in tooth and claw]]" way that might be expected from individuals engaged in a [[Hobbes]]ian state of nature. This, and particularly its application to human society and politics, is the subject of [[Robert Axelrod]]'s book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]''.

Moreover, the tit-for-tat strategy has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals who have been in competition for a period of time no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.

In the case of conflict resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as ''clear'', ''nice'', ''provocable'', and ''forgiving''. Firstly, It is a ''clear'' and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to be ''nice'' as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also ''provocable'' because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is ''forgiving'' as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.

The implications of the tit-for-tat strategy have been of relevance to conflict research, resolution and many aspects of applied social science.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010) ''Group Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
While Axelrod has empirically shown that the strategy is optimal in some cases of direct competition, two agents playing tit for tat remain vulnerable.  A one-time, single-bit error in either player's interpretation of events can lead to an unending "death spiral": if one agent defects and the opponent cooperates, then both agents will end up alternating cooperate and defect, yielding a lower payoff than if both agents were to continually cooperate. This situation frequently arises in real world conflicts, ranging from schoolyard fights to civil and regional wars. The reason for these issues is that tit for tat is not a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]], except under knife-edge conditions on the [[Discounted utility|discount rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Game Theory Evolving
  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-691-00943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While this subgame is not directly reachable by two agents playing tit for tat strategies, a strategy must be a [[Nash equilibrium]] in all subgames to be subgame perfect.  Further, this subgame may be reached if any noise is allowed in the agents' signaling.  A subgame perfect variant of tit for tat known as "contrite tit for tat" may be created by employing a basic reputation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boyd |first= Robert |title= Mistakes Allow Evolutionary Stability in the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game |journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume = 136 |pages = 47–56 |year = 1989 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80188-2 |pmid= 2779259 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tit for two tats could be used to mitigate this problem; see the description below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = The Selfish Gene
  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]
  | year = 1989
  | isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tit for tat with forgiveness" is a similar attempt to escape the death spiral. When the opponent defects, a player employing this strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next move anyway. The exact probability that a player will respond with cooperation depends on the line-up of opponents.

Furthermore, the tit-for-tat strategy is not proved optimal in situations short of total competition.  For example, when the parties are friends it may be best for the friendship when a player cooperates at every step despite occasional deviations by the other player.  Most situations in the real world are less competitive than the total competition in which the tit-for-tat strategy won its competition.

==Tit for two tats==
'''Tit for two tats''' is similar to tit for tat in that it is nice, retaliating, forgiving and non-envious{{clarify|date=February 2018}}, the only difference between the two being how forgiving the strategy is.

In a tit for tat strategy, once an opponent defects, the tit for tat player immediately responds by defecting on the next move.  This has the unfortunate consequence of causing two retaliatory strategies to continuously defect against each other resulting in a poor outcome for both players.  A tit for two tats player will let the first defection go unchallenged as a means to avoid the "death spiral" of the previous example.  If the opponent defects twice in a row, the tit for two tats player will respond by defecting.

This strategy was put forward by [[Robert Axelrod]] during his second round of computer simulations at [[RAND]].  After analyzing the results of the first experiment, he determined that had a participant entered the tit for two tats strategy it would have emerged with a higher cumulative score than any other program.  As a result, he himself entered it with high expectations in the second tournament.  Unfortunately, owing to the more aggressive nature of the programs entered in the second round, which were able to take advantage of its highly forgiving nature, tit for two tats did significantly worse (in the game-theory sense) than tit for tat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{See also|BitTorrent_(protocol)#Downloading torrents and sharing files}}

[[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] peers use tit-for-tat strategy to optimize their download speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Bram | last=Cohen |title=Incentives Build Robustness in BitTorrent | publisher=BitTorrent.org | date=2003-05-22 | accessdate=2011-02-05 |url= http://www.bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use a variant of Tit for two Tats which is called ''regular unchoking'' in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have a limited number of upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will ''choke'' the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. ''Regular unchoking'' corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner's dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (''unchoke''). This is called ''optimistic unchoking''. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.

===Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities===

Studies in the prosocial behaviour of animals have led many ethologists and evolutionary psychologists to apply tit-for-tat strategies to explain why altruism evolves in many animal communities.  Evolutionary game theory, derived from the mathematical theories formalised by [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1953), was first devised by [[Maynard Smith]] (1972) and explored further in bird behaviour by [[Robert Hinde]]. Their application of game theory to the evolution of animal strategies launched an entirely new way of analysing animal behaviour.

[[Reciprocal altruism]] works in animal communities where the cost to the benefactor in any transaction of food, mating rights, nesting or territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary. The theory also holds that the act of altruism should be reciprocated if the balance of needs reverse. Mechanisms to identify and punish "cheaters" who fail to reciprocate, in effect a form of tit for tat, are important to regulate reciprocal altruism. For example, tit-for-tat is suggested to be the mechanism of cooperative predator inspection behavior in [[guppy|guppies]].

=== War ===
The tit-for-tat inability of either side to back away from conflict, for fear of being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the source of many conflicts throughout history.

However, the tit for tat strategy has also been detected by analysts in the spontaneous [[non-violent]] behaviour, called "[[Live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]" that arose during trench warfare in the [[First World War]]. Troops dug in only a few hundred feet from each other would evolve an unspoken understanding. If a sniper killed a soldier on one side, the other could expect an equal retaliation. Conversely, if no one was killed for a time, the other side would acknowledge this implied "truce" and act accordingly. This created a "separate peace" between the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''. Richard Dawkins. BBC. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UML logo.svg|frameless|right|UML logo]]
The '''Unified Modeling Language''' ('''UML''') is a general-purpose, developmental,  [[modeling language]] in the field of [[software engineering]], that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. It was developed by [[Grady Booch]], [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[James Rumbaugh]] at [[Rational Software]] in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1997 UML was adopted as a standard by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 UML was also published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) as an approved ISO standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32620 |title=ISO/IEC 19501:2005 - Information technology - Open Distributed Processing - Unified Modeling Language (UML) Version 1.4.2 |publisher=Iso.org |date=2005-04-01 |accessdate=2015-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=32624 |title=ISO/IEC 19505-1:2012 - Information technology - Object Management Group Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML) - Part 1: Infrastructure |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-04-20 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:OO Modeling languages history.jpg|thumb|320px|History of object-oriented methods and notation]]

=== Before UML 1.0 ===

UML has been evolving since the second half of the 1990s and has its roots in the [[object-oriented programming]] methods developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The timeline (see image) shows the highlights of the history of object-oriented modeling methods and notation.

It is originally based on the notations of the [[Booch method]], the [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE), which it has integrated into a single language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Rational Software Corporation]] hired [[James Rumbaugh]] from [[General Electric]] in 1994 and after that the company became the source for two of the most popular object-oriented modeling approaches of the day:&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Zendler (1997) ''Advanced Concepts, Life Cycle Models and Tools for Objeckt-Oriented Software Development''. p.122&lt;/ref&gt; Rumbaugh's [[object-modeling technique]] (OMT) and [[Grady Booch]]'s method. They were soon assisted in their efforts by [[Ivar Jacobson]], the creator of the [[object-oriented software engineering]] (OOSE) method, who joined them at Rational in 1995.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book

=== UML 1.x ===

Under the technical leadership of those three (Rumbaugh, Jacobson and Booch), a consortium called the [[UML Partners]] was organized in 1996 to complete the ''Unified Modeling Language (UML)'' specification, and propose it to the Object Management Group (OMG) for standardisation. The partnership also contained additional interested parties (for example [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]], [[IBM]] and [[Microsoft]]). The UML Partners' UML 1.0 draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997 by the consortium. During the same month the UML Partners formed a group, designed to define the exact meaning of language constructs, chaired by [[Cris Kobryn]] and administered by Ed Eykholt, to finalize the specification and integrate it with other standardization efforts. The result of this work, UML 1.1, was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ad/97-08-11 |title=UML Specification version 1.1 (OMG document ad/97-08-11) |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first release a task force was formed&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to improve the language, which released several minor revisions, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/ |title=UML |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standards it produced (as well as the original standard) have been noted as being ambiguous and inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Génova et alia 2004 "Open Issues in Industrial Use Case Modeling"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml-forum.com/docs/papers/CACM_Jan02_p107_Kobryn.pdf |title=Will UML 2.0 Be Agile or Awkward? |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cardinality notation ====

As with database Chen, Bachman, and ISO [[ER diagram]]s, class models are specified to use "look-across" [[Cardinality (data modeling)|cardinalities]], even though several authors ([[Merise]],&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Tardieu, Arnold Rochfeld and René Colletti La methode MERISE: Principes et outils (Paperback - 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Elmasri &amp; Navathe&lt;ref&gt;Elmasri, Ramez, B. Shamkant, Navathe, Fundamentals of Database Systems, third ed., Addison-Wesley, Menlo Park, CA, USA, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=odZK99osY1EC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;img=1&amp;pgis=1&amp;dq=genova&amp;sig=ACfU3U3tDC_q8WOMqUJW4EZCa5YQywoYLw&amp;edge=0 ER 2004 : 23rd International Conference on Conceptual Modeling, Shanghai, China, 8-12 November 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527133330/https://books.google.com/books?id=odZK99osY1EC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;img=1&amp;pgis=1&amp;dq=genova&amp;sig=ACfU3U3tDC_q8WOMqUJW4EZCa5YQywoYLw&amp;edge=0 |date=27 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) prefer same-side or "look-here" for roles and both minimum and maximum cardinalities. Recent researchers (Feinerer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-inf_4582.pdf |title=A Formal Treatment of UML Class Diagrams as an Efficient Method for Configuration Management 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dullea et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/faculty/song/publications/p_DKE_03_Validity.pdf |title=James Dullea, Il-Yeol Song, Ioanna Lamprou - An analysis of structural validity in entity-relationship modeling 2002 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;) have shown that the "look-across" technique used by UML and ER diagrams is less effective and less coherent when applied to ''n''-ary relationships of order strictly greater than 2.

Feinerer says: "Problems arise if we operate under the look-across semantics as used for UML associations. Hartmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crpit.com/confpapers/CRPITV17Hartmann.pdf |title="Reasoning about participation constraints and Chen's constraints" S Hartmann - 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigates this situation and shows how and why different transformations fail.", and: "As we will see on the next few pages, the look-across interpretation introduces several difficulties which prevent the extension of simple mechanisms from binary to ''n''-ary associations."

=== UML 2 ===

UML 2.0 major revision replaced version 1.5 in 2005, which was developed with an enlarged consortium to improve the language further to reflect new experience on usage of its features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.0/ |title=UML 2.0 |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although UML 2.1 was never released as a formal specification, versions 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 appeared in 2007, followed by UML 2.2 in February 2009. UML 2.3 was formally released in May 2010.&lt;ref name="spec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/ |title=UML |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; UML 2.4.1 was formally released in August 2011.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; UML 2.5 was released in October 2012 as an "In progress" version and was officially released in June 2015.&lt;ref name="spec"/&gt; Formal version 2.5.1 was adopted in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.5.1 |title=UML 2.5.1 specification |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four parts to the UML 2.x specification:

* The Superstructure that defines the notation and semantics for diagrams and their model elements
* The Infrastructure that defines the core metamodel on which the Superstructure is based
* The [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL) for defining rules for model elements
* The UML Diagram Interchange that defines how UML 2 diagram layouts are exchanged

The current versions of these standards are&lt;ref name="Versions"&gt;{{cite web|author=OMG|title=OMG Formal Specifications (Modeling and Metadata paragraph)|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/#M&amp;M|accessdate = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* UML Superstructure version 2.4.1
* UML Infrastructure version 2.4.1
* OCL version 2.3.1
* UML Diagram Interchange version 1.0.

It continues to be updated and improved by the revision task force, who resolve any issues with the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/issues/uml2-rtf.open.html |title=Issues for UML 2.6 Revision task Force mailing list |publisher=Omg.org |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

UML offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram, including elements such as:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1/Superstructure/PDF |title=OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure. Version 2.4.1 |publisher=Object Management Group |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* any [[Activity (UML)|activities]] (jobs);
* individual [[Component (UML)|components]] of the system;
** and how they can interact with other [[Component-based software engineering|software components]];
* how the system will run;
* how entities interact with others (components and interfaces);
* external [[user interface]].

Although originally intended for object-oriented design documentation, UML has been extended to a larger set of design documentation (as listed above),&lt;ref&gt;Satish Mishra (1997). [http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~hs/Lehre/2004-WS_SWQS/20050107_Ex_UML.ppt "Visual Modeling &amp; Unified Modeling Language (UML): Introduction to UML"]. Rational Software Corporation. Accessed 9 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and been found useful in many contexts.&lt;ref name="UML, Success Stories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uml.org/uml_success_stories/index.htm|title=UML, Success Stories|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software development methods ===

UML is not a development method by itself;&lt;ref&gt;John Hunt (2000). ''The Unified Process for Practitioners: Object-oriented Design, UML and Java''. Springer, 2000. {{ISBN|1-85233-275-1}}. p.5.door&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was designed to be compatible with the leading object-oriented software development methods of its time, for example [[Object-modeling technique|OMT]], [[Booch method]], [[Objectory]] and especially [[Rational Unified Process|RUP]] that it was originally intended to be used with when work began at Rational Software.

=== Modeling ===

It is important to distinguish between the UML model and the set of diagrams of a system. A diagram is a partial graphic representation of a system's model. The set of diagrams need not completely cover the model and deleting a diagram does not change the model. The model may also contain documentation that drives the model elements and diagrams (such as written use cases).

UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model:&lt;ref&gt;Jon Holt Institution of Electrical Engineers (2004). ''UML for Systems Engineering: Watching the Wheels'' IET, 2004, {{ISBN|0-86341-354-4}}. p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

* Static (or ''structural'') view: emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. It includes [[class diagram]]s and [[composite structure diagram]]s.
* Dynamic (or ''behavioral'') view: emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes [[sequence diagram]]s, [[activity diagram]]s and [[UML state machine|state machine diagrams]].

UML models can be exchanged among UML tools by using the [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI) format.

In UML, one of the key tools for behavior modelling is the use-case model, caused by [[OOSE]]. Use cases are a way of specifying required usages of a system. Typically, they are used to capture the requirements of a system, that is, what a system is supposed to do.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Almendros-Jiménez, Jesús &amp; Iribarne, Luis. (2007). Describing Use-Case Relationships with Sequence Diagrams. Comput. J.. 50. 116-128. 10.1093/comjnl/bxl053. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagrams ==
{{UML diagram types}}

UML 2 has many types of diagrams, which are divided into two categories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some types represent ''structural'' information, and the rest represent general types of ''behavior'', including a few that represent different aspects of ''interactions''. These diagrams can be categorized hierarchically as shown in the following class diagram:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:UML diagrams overview.svg|center|600px|Hierarchy of UML 2.2 Diagrams, shown as a [[class diagram]]]]

These diagrams may all contain comments or notes explaining usage, constraint, or intent.

=== Structure diagrams ===

Structure diagrams emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the [[software architecture]] of software systems. For example, the [[component diagram]] describes how a software system is split up into components and shows the dependencies among these components.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Policy Admin Component Diagram.PNG|[[Component diagram]]
BankAccount1.svg|[[Class diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Behavior diagrams ===

Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the behavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems. As an example, the [[activity diagram]] describes the business and operational step-by-step activities of the components in a system.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

UML Use Case diagram.svg|[[Use case diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Interaction diagrams ===

Interaction diagrams, a subset of behavior diagrams, emphasize the flow of control and data among the things in the system being modeled. For example, the [[sequence diagram]] shows how objects communicate with each other regarding a sequence of messages.

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
CheckEmail.svg|[[Sequence diagram]]
UML Communication diagram.svg|[[Communication diagram]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Metamodeling ==
{{Main article|Meta-Object Facility}}

[[File:M0-m3.png|thumb|320px|Illustration of the Meta-Object Facility]]

The Object Management Group (OMG) has developed a [[metamodeling]] architecture to define the UML, called the [[Meta-Object Facility]].&lt;ref&gt;Iman Poernomo (2006) "[http://calcium.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/1259/1/acm-paper.pdf The Meta-Object Facility Typed]" in: ''Proceeding SAC '06 Proceedings of the 2006 ACM symposium on Applied computing''. pp. 1845-1849&lt;/ref&gt; MOF is designed as a four-layered architecture, as shown in the image at right. It provides a meta-meta model at the top, called the M3 layer. This M3-model is the language used by Meta-Object Facility to build metamodels, called M2-models.

The most prominent example of a Layer 2 Meta-Object Facility model is the UML metamodel, which describes the UML itself. These M2-models describe elements of the M1-layer, and thus M1-models. These would be, for example, models written in UML. The last layer is the M0-layer or data layer. It is used to describe runtime instances of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1/Infrastructure/PDF/ |title=UML 2.4.1 Infrastructure |publisher=Omg.org |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meta-model can be extended using a mechanism called [[stereotype (UML)|stereotyping]]. This has been criticised as being insufficient/untenable by [[Brian Henderson-Sellers]] and Cesar Gonzalez-Perez in "Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1.x and 2.0".&lt;ref name="UsesAbusesStereotype"&gt;B. Henderson-Sellers; C. Gonzalez-Perez (2006). "Uses and Abuses of the Stereotype Mechanism in UML 1.x and 2.0". in: ''Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems''. Springer Berlin / Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==

UML has been marketed for many contexts.&lt;ref name="UML, Success Stories"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/uml-25-do-you-even-care/240163702?queryText=uml|title = UML 2.5: Do you even care?}} "UML truly is ubiquitous"&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been treated, at times, as a design [[no silver bullet|silver bullet]], which leads to problems. UML misuse includes overuse (designing every part of the system with it, which is unnecessary) and assuming that novices can design with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=984495|title = Death by UML Fever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is considered a large language, with many [[Syntax (programming languages)|constructs]]. Some people (including [[Ivar Jacobson|Jacobson]]) feel that UML's size hinders learning (and therefore, using) it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.infoq.com/interviews/Ivar_Jacobson|title = Ivar Jacobson on UML, MDA, and the future of methodologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm  Mautner''' (1889-1944) was born in [[Vienna]]. He was an Austrian-German economist and attorney-in-fact of the Rotterdamse Bank who spent a part of his life in the Netherlands. Mautner was born Jewish. He was also an art collector.

==Early years==
After a short professional career in banking and industry, he studied economics in Paris, Vienna and Tübingen, where he finished his studies and wrote a thesis about Bolshevism in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mautner|first1=Wilhelm|title=Der Bolschewismus - Voraussetzungen und Geschichte|publisher=W. Kohlhammer|location=Stuttgart|edition=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he moved to the Netherlands.

==World War II==

From 1929 until 1944 he lived in Amsterdam. Mautner never married and had no children. On 22 July 1941, he drew up a will in which he appointed his brother in Ohio in the United States as his sole heir. During the war Mautner attempted unsuccessfully to escape from the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/en/recommendations/recommendation_189_a.html All the information used for this article is from the Restitutions Committee] [RC. 1.89]-[9 February 2009], unless otherwise specified. &lt;/ref&gt; Mautner tried to get an exit visa for the United States with the help of his brother, who lived in New York. In December 1943 Mautner was removed from his home in Amsterdam during a raid and transported to [[Westerbork transit camp]] and from there to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]]&lt;ref&gt;Prisoners of Ghetto Theresienstadt (1940-1945) Database Personal records&lt;/ref&gt; concentration camp. Mautner died on or around 29 September 1944 in [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

==Art collection==

Mautner collected paintings. His collection also included some Dutch old masters. He continued purchasing works of art during the war. At that time he was in frequent contact with [[Max Jakob Friedlander]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprovenance.nl/varia/|title=Ruth Kaloena Krul - Kunsthistorische Herkomst|website=www.artprovenance.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1941, he was no longer able to do so in his own name because of his Jewish origins. He gave works of art to various people for safekeeping. In February 1942, Mautner was ordered to move to Tugelaweg in Amsterdam as a result of the forced relocation of Jews. He sent 15 paintings for safe-keeping with the collector Dr J. van Dongen on the city's Museumplein. The latter kept all of these items until after the war. Other works, including a Brueghel and a Timmermann, were sold under duress in 1943 by Mautner. Various of Mautner's works of art and other possessions were recovered for his heirs, by custodians of his estate after the war. The 15 paintings in J.A. van Dongen's custody were probably bought by van Dongen with the consent of Mautner's heirs.
Three of the paintings that Mautner sold under duress are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The latter two were acquired by the [[Führermuseum|Sonderauftrag Linz]] and returned to the Netherlands after the war, where they became part of the NK-Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl, Search, Undirected Search, "Mautner", retrieved April 8, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sold 12 paintings, primarily 19th century, to W. Kadzik from Vienna. Mautner could not act as a seller, due to his Jewish origin, so he asked his friend Hans Alfred Wetzlar to fulfill the formalities. It is unknown where the works are.

He is also Professor in the Department of English at [[Matsuyama University]].

==Education and career==
Tsuda was born in [[Kanagawa]], Japan in 1950. He majored in English and graduated from [[Yokohama National University]] in 1973. He received his M.A. in [[TEFL]] (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) in 1978 and his Ph.D. in [[Speech Communication]] in 1985 from [[Southern Illinois University]] at Carbondale.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Tehranian (Ed.), ''Worlds Apart: Human Security and Global Governance'', New York, NY: I. B. Tauris, 1999, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuda held several faculty positions in his academic career. He was Associate Professor in the Faculty of Economics at [[Nagasaki University]] from 1986 to 1988. He then moved to [[Nagoya University]] where he was Associate Professor in the Institute of Languages and Cultures from 1988 to 1993 and Professor in the Department of International Communication and in the Graduate School of International Development from 1993 to 2001.

Tsuda had been Professor in the Doctoral Program in Modern Cultures and Public Policies in the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Tsukuba since 2001. He retired from the University of Tsukuba and founded the Institute of Peace Linguistics in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] in 2014. He is currently Professor in the Department of English at Matsuyama University in [[Ehime Prefecture]].

Tsuda was Visiting Professor at the [[International Research Center for Japanese Studies]] in [[Kyoto]] in 1996 &lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda (Ed.), "The Japanese and the English Language: An Interdisciplinary Study of Anglicized (Americanized) Japan" (Special Section), ''Japan Review'', 1998, No. 10, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[College of San Mateo]] in California in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Nat Friedland, "Fulbright Scholar in Residence a first for CSM," ''The San Francisco Examiner'', March 3, 2007 (http://www.sfexaminer.com/fulbright-scholar-in-residence-a-first-for-csm/).&lt;/ref&gt; He was also [[Braj Kachru]] Fellow in the "Internationalization Forum" program in 1996 and Visiting Fellow in 1999 at the [[East-West Center]] in Honolulu, Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;East-West Center (Ed.), ''Building an Asia Pacific Community'' (Annual Report 1999), Honolulu, HI: East-West Center, 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsuda's academic interests include [[language policy]], cross-cultural [[psychoanalysis]], and international and [[intercultural communication]]. Among his publications are ''Language Inequality and Distortion in Intercultural Communication: A Critical Theory Approach'' (John Benjamins, 1986), ''Language, Education, and Intercultural Communication'' (Nagasaki University, 1988), ''Eigo Shihai-no Kouzou'' [''The Structure of the Dominance of English''] (Daisan Shokan, 1990), ''Shinryaku-suru Eigo, Hangeki-suru Nihongo'' [''The Invading English, The Counter-Attacking Japanese''] (PHP Institute, 1996), and ''Eigo Shihai-to Kotoba-no Byoudou'' [''The Hegemony of English and Linguistic Equality''] (Keio University Press, 2006).

==The Ecology of Language Paradigm==
Tsuda is well known as a critic of the [[hegemony]] of English and as an advocate of linguistic and [[cultural pluralism]]. He believes that the domination of English is tantamount to [[linguicism]] and [[language death|linguicide]], and that addressing the problem of linguistic hegemony is crucial to the development of human and cultural security.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Anglomania Muddies Japan's Self-Image," ''Asahi Evening News'', January 23, 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Language Problems in Intercultural Communication: Review and Suggestions," ''Studies in Language and Culture'', Vol. 10, No. 1, 1988, pp. 17-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "Speaking Against the Hegemony of English," in ''Special Research Project: Civil Society, the State and Culture in Comparative Perspective'' (Annual Report), Tsukuba, Japan: University of Tsukuba, 2005, pp. 235-244.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in ''The San Matean'', a San Mateo Community College newspaper, dated March 19, 2007, Tsuda was quoted to say: "It is more important to be students learning other languages than being a teacher only teaching one." He proposed the "ecology of language" paradigm as opposed to the "diffusion of English" paradigm.

{{Quotation|The Diffusion of English Paradigm, which is a dominant position not only in the Anglo-American world but also in the former British colonies in Asia and Africa, is characterized by theoretical orientations such as capitalism, science and technology, modernization, monolingualism, ideological globalization and internationalization, transnationalization, Americanization, the homogenization of the world culture, and linguistic, cultural, and media imperialism. In contrast, an alternative theoretical orientation critical of the Diffusion of English Paradigm is what I call the "Ecology of Language Paradigm." This paradigm is based on the theoretical positions such as the human rights perspective, equality in communication, multilingualism, the maintenance of languages and cultures, the protection of national sovereignties, and the promotion of foreign language education.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "The Diffusion of English: Its Impact on Culture and Communication," ''Keio Communication Review'', No. 16, March 1994, pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tsuda urges international and intercultural communication scholars to recognize the hegemony of English as a subject of academic inquiry in the fields especially in the English-speaking countries. He also suggests that English-language teaching professionals incorporate the ecology of language paradigm into the contents and methods of teaching as well as teacher education. Finally, he insists that both native speakers and non-native speakers of English learn the philosophy of the ecology of language so that they will become more sensitive to the ethical aspects of international and intercultural communication.&lt;ref&gt;Yukio Tsuda, "The Hegemony of English and Strategies for Linguistic Pluralism: Proposing the Ecology of Language Paradigm," in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), ''The Global Intercultural Communication Reader'' (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt;
