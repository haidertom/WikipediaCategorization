'''''ABISMO''''' ('''A'''utomatic '''B'''ottom '''I'''nspection and '''S'''ampling '''Mo'''bile) is a [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]] (ROV) built by the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]] (JAMSTEC) for exploration of the [[deep sea]]. It is the only remaining ROV rated to 11,000-meters (after ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'', built and operated by the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] was lost at sea in 2014), ''ABISMO'' is intended to be the permanent replacement for ''[[Kaikō]]'', a ROV that was lost at sea in 2003.

==''Kaikō''==
{{Main|Kaikō}}
Between 1995 and 2003, ''Kaikō'' conducted more than 250 dives, collecting 350 biological species (including 180 different bacteria), some of which could prove to be useful in medical and industrial applications.&lt;ref name=Kakuchi&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kaikō'' made its last visit to Challenger Deep in May 1998. On 29 May 2003, ''Kaikō'' was lost at sea off the coast of [[Shikoku|Shikoku Island]] during [[2003 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Chan-hom|Typhoon Chan-Hom]], when a steel secondary cable connecting it to its launcher at the ocean surface broke.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008/&gt; In May 2004, JAMSTEC resumed its research operations, using a converted ROV as its vehicle. This ROV, formerly known as ''UROV 7K'', was rechristened ''Kaikō7000II''. The ''7000'' designation indicates that this vessel is rated for diving to a maximum depth of 7,000 meters.

==RV ''Kairei''==
[[File:JAMSTEC Deep Sea Research Ship Kairei.jpg|right|thumb|RV ''Kairei'']]
RV ''Kairei'' ([[:ja:かいれい|かいれい]]) is a deep sea research vessel that served as the support ship for ''[[Kaikō]]'', and for its replacement [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]], ''Kaikō7000II''. It now serves as the support ship for ''ABISMO''. ''Kairei'' uses ''ABISMO'' to conduct surveys and observations of [[oceanic plateau]]s, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[oceanic basin]]s, [[submarine volcano]]es, [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[oceanic trench]]es and other underwater terrain features to a maximum depth of 11,000 meters. ''Kairei'' also conducts surveys of the structure of deep sub-bottoms with complicated geographical shapes in subduction zones using its on-board multi-channel reflection survey system.&lt;ref name=Kairei&gt;{{cite web

==Development of ''ABISMO''==
While the temporary replacement ROV (''Kaikō7000II'') has a remarkable performance record, it is only rated to 7,000 meters and cannot reach the deepest oceanic trenches. For this reason, JAMSTEC engineers began work on a new 11,000-meter class of ROV in April 2005.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is called '''''ABISMO''''' (Automatic Bottom Inspection and Sampling Mobile), which translates to ''abyss'' in Spanish and Portuguese.

Like ''Kaikō'', ''ABISMO'' consists of 4 major parts:&lt;ref name=Itoh2008/&gt;
#[[Deep-sea exploration#Oceanographic Instrumentation.5B13.5D|electronic instruments]] aboard RV ''Kairei'', the support ship
#Launcher (a sampling station)
#Vehicle (a sediment probe)
#Samplers (a [[Deep-sea exploration#Oceanographic Instrumentation.5B13.5D|gravity corer]] or Smith Macintyre type sampler)
Except for the sampler and the smaller size of the ROV itself, the system configuration is the same as for ''Kaikō''. The launcher launches and recovers the ROV along with its sampler. Click [https://web.archive.org/web/20111004094404/http://www.isope.org/publications/proceedings/ISOPE-PACOMS/PACOMS2008/papers/P08-57itoh.pdf here] to see a photograph of ''ABISMO'' and its launcher, as well as RV ''Kairei'', the support ship.

The lower part of the launcher is constructed of a [[stainless steel]] framework, within which the vehicle is stored. [[Submarine hull|Pressure hulls]] for electronic devices, a [[winch]], a secondary [[Cable reel|cable drum]] and two electric [[transformer]]s are located in the upper part of the launcher. The samplers include a gravity core sampler and a bottom grab sampler. There is also a docking system and an acoustic positioning system in the lower part of the launcher. The vehicle is hung in the launcher by the docking system. When the system detaches it and the cable drum feeds the secondary cable, the vehicle can dive down, and its position is measured by the acoustic positioning system. The position of the launcher is measured by RV ''Kairei'', the support ship. The launcher also has a [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) camera with pan and tilt functions.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008/&gt;

Initial sea trials of ''ABISMO'' were conducted in 2007. The craft successfully reached a planned depth of 9,760-meters, the deepest part of [[Izu-Ogasawara Trench]], where it collected core samples of sediment from the seabed.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Itoh2008/&gt; Plans are underway for a mission to the Challenger Deep.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The purpose of this is to provide an open standard, [[Ethernet]] based approach to the networking of linear (uncompressed) digital audio with extremely high quality-of-service alongside standard [[Internet Protocol]] connections.

This standard specifies a method, also known as "ATM-E", of carrying [[asynchronous transfer mode]] (ATM) cells over hardware specified for [[IEEE 802.3]] (Ethernet). It is intended as a companion standard to [[AES47]] (Transmission of digital audio over ATM networks), to provide a standard method of carrying ATM cells and real-time clock over hardware specified for Ethernet.

Active living brings together [[urban planners]], [[architects]], [[transportation engineers]], [[public health]] professionals, activists and other professionals to build places that encourage active living and physical activity.  One example includes efforts to build sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian crossing signals and other ways for children to walk safely to and from school, as seen in the Safe Routes to School program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes|url=http://www.saferoutesinfo.org/|publisher=National Center for Safe Routes to School|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safe Routes To School|url=http://www.saferoutespartnership.org/|publisher=Safe Routes to School National Partnership|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recreational opportunities (parks, fitness centres etc.) close to the home or workplace, walking trails and bike lanes for transportation also encourage a more active lifestyle.  Active living is a combination of physical activity and recreation activities aimed at the general public to encourage a healthier lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living |url=http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403195030/http://www.healthyalberta.com/155.htm |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active living is a growing field that emerged from the early work of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) with the release of the Surgeon's General Report on Physical Activity and Health in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|url=https://www.cdc.gov/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997, the CDC began the development of an initiative called Active Community Environments (ACEs) coordinated by Rich Killingsworth (the founding director of active living by Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living by Design|url=http://www.activelivingbydesign.org/|publisher=North Carolina Institute for Public Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) and Tom Schmid, a senior health scientist.  The main programming thrust of ACEs was an emerging initiative called Safe Routes to School that was catalyzed by a program designed by Rich Killingsworth and Jessica Shisler at CDC called KidsWalk-to-School. This program provided much needed attention to the connections of the built environment and health, especially obesity and physical inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACES - Active Community Environments |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307013100/http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/professionals/environment/aces.html |archivedate=March 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]] formally launched their active living initiative which comprised three national programs - [[Active Living by Design]], Active Living Research, and Active for Life.  The main goal of these programs was to develop an understanding how the built environment impacted physical activity and what could be done to increase physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|url=http://www.rwjf.org/|publisher=Robert Wood Johnson Foundation|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
There are many health related benefits to being physically active and living an active life.  Active living can help to reduce the risk of [[chronic diseases]], improve your overall health and well-being, reduce stress levels, minimize health related medical costs, help you to maintain a healthy weight, assist in proper balance and posture and the maintenance of healthy bones and strong muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Benefits of Physical Activity|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/alw-vat/intro/key-cle-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active living can also improve your sleeping patterns and aid in the prevention of risk factors for [[heart disease]] such as [[blood cholesterol]] levels, [[diabetes]] and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Living Benefits |url=http://asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |publisher=Alberta Sport, Recreation, Parks and Wildlife Foundation |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320014025/http://www.asrpwf.ca/recreation-active-living/active-living.aspx |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Being Active|url=http://www.dairygoodness.ca/good-health/healthy-active-living/the-benefits-of-being-active|publisher=Dairy Goodness|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of physical activity==
There are three types of [[physical exercise]]s that a person can do to keep active: [[endurance]], [[flexibility]] and [[Physical strength|strength]] activities.  
* Endurance activities increase your heart rate and strengthen your heart and your lungs.  Examples include: dancing, skating, cycling, swimming and brisk walking.
* Flexibility activities improve your body’s ability to move and assist in keeping your muscles and joints relaxed.  Examples include: yard work, vacuuming, stretching and golf.
* Strength activities create and maintain muscle and keep bones strong.  Examples include: raking leaves, climbing stairs, lifting free weights and push-ups.
It is easy to incorporate endurance, flexibility and strength activities into your daily routine for active living.  Activities such as normal household chores can fit into more than one of the above categories, and it is simple enough to switch to using the stairs instead of taking the elevators at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Active at Work|url=http://www.peelregion.ca/health/workplace/employees/active/3groups.htm|publisher=Account for Health|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recommendations==
In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] supported the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) to review the  Canada's Physical Activity Guides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines|url=http://www.csep.ca/CMFiles/Guidelines/CSEP-InfoSheetsComplete-ENG.pdf|publisher=The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were updated and replaced with the Get Active Tip Sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tips to Get Active|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hp-ps/hl-mvs/pa-ap/04paap-eng.php|publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Get Active Tip Sheets are broken down into 4 age categories (5-11, 12-17, 18-64 and 65 &amp; older).

The Get Active Tip Sheets recommend that children aged 5–11 and youth aged 12–17 should participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day.  The recommendation for adults 18-64 and for older adults 65 years and older is at least 2.5 hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week. These minutes do not all need to be done at the same time, but the recommendation is a minimum of 10 minutes at a time.

==Initiatives==
In Canada, there are many active living initiatives currently in place.  One of the most well known programs is the [[ParticipACTION]] program, which aims to encourage Canadians to move more and increase their [[physical activity level]]s.  Their mission statement is "ParticipACTION is the national voice of physical activity and sport participation in Canada. 
Through leadership in communications, capacity building and knowledge exchange, we inspire and support Canadians to move more."  Since the 1970s, ParticipACTION has been motivating Canadians to live actively and participate in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About ParticipACTION |url=http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |publisher=ParticipACTION |accessdate=March 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403131834/http://www.participaction.com/en-us/About-Participaction/About-ParticipACTION.aspx |archivedate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active at old age==
To help be active at older ages you should look into programs like ALC(active living center)

The '''Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology''' ({{lang-es|Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnología Marina}}, CACYTMAR) is a joint institute of investigation sponsored by the [[University of Cádiz]] and the Andalusian Council for Education and Science (''Consejería de Educación y Ciencia de la Junta de Andalucía''). It was created as an outcome of the II Plan Andaluz de Investigación, as one of several thematic regional investigative centers. Although it is linked to a specific university, the objective is to bring together and serve all related institutions in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]] working in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uca.es/centro/cacytmar/cacytmar/presentacion/presentacion.html Presentación], CACYTMAR (official site). Accessed online 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

CACYTMAR is organized around five major thematic areas: [[oceanography]], coasts, natural resources, environmental quality, and marine technology. It is the umbrella for approximately 30 investigative projects, most of them financed by the ''Plan Nacional de I+D+i'' (National Research and Development Plan), although some are financed by the [[European Union]] or by the [[Andalusian Autonomous Government]]. There are also about 40 contracts for investigation in cooperation with businesses or other administrations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

An '''artist's portfolio''' is an edited collection of their best artwork intended to showcase an artist's style or method of work. A portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work. Typically, the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work.

Historically, portfolios were printed out and placed into a book. With the increased use of the internet and email, however, there are now websites that host [[online portfolio]]s that are available to a wider audience. Sometimes an artist's portfolio can be referred to as a [[lookbook]].

== Photography ==
A [[photography]] portfolio can focus on a single subject. It can be a collection of photographs taken with a certain type of camera, in one geographic area, of one person or a group of people, only black &amp; white or sepia photos, a special event, etc.

Many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry. For example, wedding photographers may put together a book of their best wedding photos to show to engaged couples who are looking for a wedding photographer. [[Photojournalists]] may take a collection of their best freelance work with them when looking for a job.

==Artist design book ==
An artist design book is a collection of photographs meant to show off a model, photographer, style, or clothing line.  Sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity, politician or socialite. This is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers.

Artist design books, or ADBs, in their online form, can be described as "fashion diaries" because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis. 

It is common for stores or clothing designers to use an ADB to show off products.&lt;ref&gt;Fasanella, Kathleen. [http://www.fashion-incubator.com/archive/what_are_look_books/ "What are Look books?], ''Fashion-Incubator'', 2005-26-08. Retrieved on 2010-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; They may include photos of multiple types of clothes, shoes and other accessories from a season or line.

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count --&gt;
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1305">'''Biomedical technology''' broadly refers to the application of [[engineering]] and [[technology]] principles to the domain of living or biological [[system]]s. Usually inclusion of the term ''biomedical'' denotes a principal emphasis on problems related to human health and diseases, whereas terms like "biotechnology" can be medical, environmental, or agricultural in application. But most terms in this general realm still lack clear boundaries. [[Biomedical engineering]] and [[Biotechnology]] alike are often loosely called ''Biomedical Technology'' or [[Bioengineering]]. The Biomedical technology field is currently growing at a rapid pace. Required jobs for the industry expect to grow 23% by 2024, and with the pay averaging over $86,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Biomedical_Technology.html|title=What Is Biomedical Technology?|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3342">'''Biometeorology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or shorter (by opposition to [[bioclimatology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==
[[Weather]] events influence biological processes on short time scales. For instance, as the [[Sun]] rises above the horizon in the morning, light levels become sufficient for the process of [[photosynthesis]] to take place in plant [[Leaf|leaves]]. Later on, during the day, air [[temperature]] and [[humidity]] may induce the partial or total closure of the [[stoma]]ta, a typical response of many plants to limit the loss of water through [[transpiration]]. More generally, the daily evolution of meteorological variables controls the [[circadian rhythm]] of plants and animals alike.

Living organisms, for their part, can collectively affect weather patterns. The rate of [[evapotranspiration]] of forests, or of any large vegetated area for that matter, contributes to the release of [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere. This local, relatively fast and continuous process may contribute significantly to the persistence of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]s in a given area. As another example, the [[wilting]] of plants results in definite changes in [[leaf angle distribution]] and therefore modifies the rates of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[Transmittance|transmission]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar light in these plants. That, in turn, changes the [[albedo]] of the ecosystem as well as the relative importance of the [[Sensible heat|sensible]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes from the surface to the atmosphere. For an example in [[oceanography]], consider the release of [[dimethyl sulfide]] by biological activity in sea water and its impact on atmospheric [[aerosol]]s.

==Human biometeorology==
The methods and measurements traditionally used in biometeorology are not different when applied to study the interactions between human bodies and the atmosphere, but some aspects or applications may have been explored more extensively. For instance, [[wind chill]] has been investigated to determine the time period an individual can sustain exposure to given temperature and wind conditions. Another important example concerns the study of airborne [[allergen]]s (such as [[pollen]]s and [[aerosol]]s) and their impact on individuals: [[weather]] conditions can favor or hinder the release as well as the transport and deposition of these allergens, sometimes severely affecting the well-being of sensitive populations.

'''Brookhaven National Laboratory''' ('''BNL''') is a [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|United States Department of Energy national laboratory]] located in [[Upton, New York]], on [[Long Island]], and was formally established in 1947 at the site of [[Camp Upton]], a former [[List of United States Army installations|U.S. Army base]]. Its name stems from its location within the [[Brookhaven, New York|Town of Brookhaven]], approximately 60 miles east of [[New York City]].

Research at BNL specializes in nuclear and high energy physics, energy science and technology, environmental and bioscience, nanoscience and national security. The 5,300 acre campus contains several large research facilities, including the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] and [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. Seven [[Nobel prize]]s have been awarded for work conducted at Brookhaven lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/history/nobel/ |title=Nobel Prizes at BNL |publisher=Bnl.gov |access-date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
BNL is staffed by approximately 2,750 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support personnel, and hosts 4,000 guest investigators every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/about/|title=About BNL|publisher=BNL.gov|accessdate=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory has its own police station, fire department, and [[ZIP code]] (11973).  In total, the lab spans a {{convert|5265|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} area that is mostly coterminous with the hamlet of [[Upton, New York]]. BNL is served by a rail spur operated as-needed by the [[New York and Atlantic Railway]].

===Operation===
Brookhaven National Lab was originally owned by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and is now owned by that agency's successor, the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE). DOE subcontracts the research and operation to universities and research organizations.  It is currently operated by Brookhaven Science Associates LLC, which is an equal partnership of [[Stony Brook University]] and [[Battelle Memorial Institute]]. From 1947 to 1998, it was operated by [[Associated Universities, Inc.]] (AUI), but AUI lost its contract in the wake of two incidents: a 1994 fire at the facility's high-beam flux reactor that exposed several workers to radiation and reports in 1997 of a tritium leak into the groundwater of the [[Long Island Central Pine Barrens]] on which the facility sits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10614FD3B5A1B7B93C3A91788D85F438485F9 Atomic Laboratory on Long Island to Be Mighty Research Center – New York Times – March 1, 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1997/5/21/laboratory-loses-federal-contract-pin-fallout/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundations===
Following [[World War II]], the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|US Atomic Energy Commission]] was created to support government-sponsored peacetime research on atomic energy. The effort to build a [[nuclear reactor]] in the American northeast was fostered largely by physicists [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and [[Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.]], who during the war witnessed many of their colleagues at [[Columbia University]] leave for new remote research sites following the departure of the [[Manhattan Project]] from its campus. Their effort to house this reactor near [[New York City]] was rivalled by a similar effort at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to have a facility near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Involvement was quickly solicited from representatives of northeastern universities to the south and west of [[New York City]] such that this city would be at their geographic center. In March 1946 a nonprofit corporation was established that consisted of representatives from nine major research universities — [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Rochester]], and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crease |first=Robert P. |date= 1999|title= Making Physics: A Biography of Brookhaven National Laboratory|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soldier_records,_Camp_Upton_(LOC)_(23546348723).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers during [[World War I]] at the [[Camp Upton]] site,  which would in 1947 be repurposed as BNL]]
Out of 17 considered sites in the Boston-Washington corridor, [[Camp Upton]] on [[Long Island]] was eventually chosen as the most suitable in consideration of space, transportation, and availability. The camp had been a training center from the [[United States Army|US Army]] during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].  After the latter war, Camp Upton was deemed no longer necessary and became available for reuse. A plan was conceived to convert the military camp into a research facility.

On March 21, 1947, the Camp Upton site was officially transferred from the [[U.S. War Department]] to the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], predecessor to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)]].

===Research and facilities===
====Reactor history====
In 1947 construction began on the first [[nuclear reactor]] at Brookhaven, the [[Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor]]. This reactor, which opened in 1950, was the first reactor to be constructed in the United States after World War II.  The [[High Flux Beam Reactor]] operated from 1965 to 1999. In 1959 Brookhaven built the first US reactor specifically tailored to medical research, the [[Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor]], which operated until 2000.

====Accelerator history====
[[File:Satoshi Ozaki 1991.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|[[Satoshi Ozaki]] posed with a magnet for the [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] in 1991]]
In 1952 Brookhaven began using its first [[particle accelerator]], the [[Cosmotron]]. At the time the Cosmotron was the world's highest energy accelerator, being the first to impart more than 1 [[GeV]] of energy to a particle. The Cosmotron was retired in 1966, after it was superseded in 1960 by the new [[Alternating Gradient Synchrotron]] (AGS). The AGS was used in research that resulted in 3 [[Nobel prize]]s, including the discovery of the [[muon neutrino]], the [[charm quark]], and [[CP violation]]. The [[National Synchrotron Light Source]] operated from 1982 to 2014 and was involved with two Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. It has since been replaced by the [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]]. The [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) has been operational since 2000. One of the world's only two operating heavy-ion colliders, RHIC is as of 2010 the second-highest-energy collider after the [[Large Hadron Collider]]. RHIC is housed in a tunnel 2.4 miles (3.9&amp;nbsp;km) long and is visible from space.

====Other discoveries====

In 1958, Brookhaven scientists created one of the world's first [[video game]]s, [[Tennis for Two]]. In 1968 Brookhaven scientists patented [[Maglev]], a transportation technology that utilizes [[magnetic levitation]].

==Major facilities==

Brookhaven was also responsible for the design of the SNS accumulator ring in partnership with [[Spallation Neutron Source]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

Brookhaven plays a role in a range of neutrino research projects around the world, including the [[Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment]] in China and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/science/neutrinos.php|title=BNL {{!}} Neutrino Research History|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public access==
[[File:National Synchrotron Light Source II.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of [[National Synchrotron Light Source II]] facility in 2012, during a Brookhaven National Laboratory "Summer Sundays" public tour.]]
For other than approved Public Events, the Laboratory is closed to the general public. The lab is open to the public on several Sundays during the summer for tours and special programs. The public access program is referred to as 'Summer Sundays' and takes place on four Sundays from mid-July to mid-August, and features a science show and a tour of the lab's major facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/summersundays.php|title=BNL {{!}} Summer Sundays|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory also hosts science fairs, science bowls, and robotics competitions for local schools, and lectures, concerts, and scientific talks for the local community. The Lab estimates that each year it enhances the science education of roughly 35,000 kindergarten to 12th grade LI students, more than 200 undergraduates, and 550 teachers from across the United States.

== Controversy and environmental cleanup ==
In January 1997, ground water samples taken by BNL staff revealed concentrations of tritium that were twice the allowable federal drinking water standards—some samples taken later were 32 times the standard. The tritium was found to be leaking from the laboratory's High Flux Beam Reactor's spent-fuel pool into the aquifer that provides drinking water for nearby Suffolk County residents.

DOE's and BNL's investigation of this incident concluded that the tritium had been leaking for as long as 12 years without DOE's or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in DOE's oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.

The responsibility for failing to discover Brookhaven's tritium leak has been acknowledged by laboratory managers, and DOE admits it failed to properly oversee the laboratory's operations. Brookhaven officials repeatedly treated the need for installing monitoring wells that would have detected the tritium leak as a low priority despite public concern and the laboratory's agreement to follow local environmental regulations. DOE's on-site oversight office, the Brookhaven Group, was directly responsible for Brookhaven's performance, but it failed to hold the laboratory accountable for meeting all of its regulatory commitments, especially its agreement to install monitoring wells. Senior DOE leadership also shared responsibility because they failed to put in place an effective system that encourages all parts of DOE to work together to ensure that contractors meet their responsibilities on environmental, safety and health issues. Unclear responsibilities for environment, safety and health matters has been a recurring problem for DOE management.

Since 1993, DOE has spent more than US$580 million on remediating soil and groundwater contamination at the lab site and completed several high-profile projects. These include the decommissioning and decontamination of the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/brookhaven-lab-reactor-fully-decommissioned-1.4027164|title=Lab reactor fully decommissioned|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; removal of mercury-contaminated sediment from the Peconic River, and installation and operation of 16 on- and off-site groundwater treatment systems that have cleaned more than 25 billion gallons of groundwater since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/community/cleanup/|title=Environmental Cleanup, Brookhaven National Laboratory|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after winning the contract to operate the lab in 1997, BSA formed a Community Advisory Council (CAC) to advise the laboratory director on cleanup projects and other items of interest to the community. The CAC represents a diverse range of interests and values of individuals and groups who are interested in or affected by the actions of the Laboratory. It consists of representatives from 26 local business, civic, education, environment, employee, government, and health organizations. The CAC sets its own agenda, brings forth issues important to the community, and works to provide consensus recommendations to Laboratory management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnl.gov/stakeholder/cac.php|title=BNL {{!}} Community Advisory Council|website=www.bnl.gov|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Comparative genomics has a root in the comparison of [[virus]] genomes in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=koonin/&gt; For example, small [[RNA viruses]] infecting animals ([[picornaviruses]]) and those infecting plants ([[cowpea mosaic virus]]) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 12| issue = 18| pages = 7251–7267| authors = Argos, P.; Kamer, G.; Nicklin, M.J.; Wimmer, E.| title = Similarity in gene organization and homology between proteins of animal picornaviruses and a plant comovirus suggest common ancestry of these virus families| journal = Nucleic Acids Research| year = 1984| doi = 10.1093/nar/12.18.7251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of [[varicella-zoster virus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] that contained more than 100 genes each.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 14| issue = 10| pages = 4281–4292| first1 = D.J.|last1= McGeoch

The first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called  [[MUMmer|MUMMER]] and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms.  In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.

With the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including [[Human Genome Project|human]], the [[Japanese pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu rubripes]]'', and [[House mouse|mouse]], precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a [[genome browser]].

[[Next-generation sequencing]] methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]], [[Insertion (genetics)|insertions]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] by mapping [[Sequence assembly|unassembled reads]] against a well [[Genome annotation|annotated]] reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.&lt;ref name=hu/&gt;

==Evolutionary principles==
One character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.

Similarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour ([[synteny]]), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.

Orthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for  collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.

[[File:BrowserFoxp2.jpg| Human [[FOXP2]] gene and evolutionary conservation is shown in and multiple alignment (at bottom of figure) in this image from the [[UCSC Genome Browser]].  Note that conservation tends to cluster around coding regions (exons). |thumb|right]]
Comparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the [[proteins]], [[RNA]], and [[regulatory regions]] of different organisms to infer how [[Selection (biology)|selection]] has acted upon these elements.  Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different [[species]] should be conserved through time ([[stabilizing selection]]), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent ([[Directional selection|positive selection]]).  Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).

One of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small [[model organisms]] (for example the model [[Caenorhabditis elegans]] and closely related [[Caenorhabditis briggsae]]) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stein, L.D. |year=2003 |title=The genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae: a platform for comparative genomics |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=E45 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000045 |pmid=14624247 |pmc=261899|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Newly Sequenced Worm a Boon for Worm Biologists | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = e4–e4 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000044}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polymorphisms==
===Single nucleotide polymorphisms===

SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) refers to the genome level by single nucleotide position, such as transformation or transversion mutation caused the DNA sequence polymorphism. According to the SNP in gene location, it can be divided into 3 classes: the genes code area SNP (coding - region SNPS, cSNP), gene surrounding SNP (perigenic SNPS, pSNP) and gene SNP (intergenic SNPS, iSNP). Published on February 17, 2005, the first human gene polymorphisms mapping is based on gene "linkage disequilibrium theory", using gene chip in 71 European Americans (white), African Americans (black) and the han Chinese Americans (yellow race), this research identified 1.58 million single nucleotide mutation of DNA locus, the map will help to predict the likelihood of certain diseases and make the best treatment plan, make an important step in the journey which based on gene of individualized health goals.

===Copy number polymorphism===
Before the invention of whole genome sequencing and gene chip technology, limited by high-throughput DNA genome copy number detection means, within the scope of the whole genome copy number polymorphism (copy number polymorphism, CNP), people know very little about the number and distribution. In 2004, a number of "human genome project" research bases in the world accidentally found that in the phenotypes of normal population, there are some differences in some gene copy numbers between different individuals, some people lost a lot of gene copy, while others have extra, extend the copies of the gene, the researchers call this phenomenon of “polymorphic gene copy number". It was because the CNP that caused the different between individuals such as disease, appetite and efficacy. Research shows that it has average 11 differences between 2 individuals, the average length of CNP is 465 KB, of which more than half of the CNP are repeated in more than one individual, and often in other types of chromosome rearrangement nearby.

==Classification==
===Interspecific comparative genomics===
Through the comparison of different related species genome sequence, can identify coding sequences, regulation and control of non-coding sequences and unique sequence of a given species. And within the scope of genome sequence alignment, can understand the similarities and differences in gene sequence, nucleotide composition, linear relationship of different objects, and then get the aspects of information about forecasts and positioning of genetic analysis, evolutionary relationship between biological systems.

===Intraspecific comparative genomics===
With same population in genome，there are a lot of mutation and polymorphism, because of these differences in the genome sequence constitutes the different disease susceptibility and genetic basis of different reactions to drugs and environmental factors in individuals and groups.

==Tools==

Computational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Bergman, N.H. |title=Comparative Genomics: Volumes 1 and 2 |location=Totowa, New Jersey |publisher=Humana Press |year=2007 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1732/ |isbn=978-193411-537-4 |pmid=21250292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.&lt;ref name="Humana Press"/&gt;

==Applications==

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice [[landrace]]s revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, [[amylose]] content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, X.H.  |year=2010 |title=Genome-wide association studies of 14 agronomic traits in rice landraces  |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=42 |issue=11 |page=961-U76 |doi=10.1038/ng.695 |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Morrell, P.L., Buckler, E.S., Ross-Ibara, J. |year=2012 |title=Crop genomics: advances and applications |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=85–96 |doi=10.1038/nrg3097}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as [[reverse vaccinology]], researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seib, K.L., Zhao, X., Rappuoli, R. |year=2012 |title=Developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=18 |issue=SI |pages=109–116 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03939.x}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for [[Streptococcus agalactiae|Group B Streptococcus]], a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maione, D.  |year=2005 |title=Identification of a Universal Group B Streptococcus Vaccine by Multiple Genome Screen |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5731 |pages=148–150 |doi=10.1126/science.1109869 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2005Sci...309..148M |pmid=15994562 |pmc=1351092}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rasco, D.A.  |year=2008 |title=The pangenome structure of Escherichia coli: Comparative genomic analysis of E-coli commensal and pathogenic isolates  |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=20 |pages=6881–6893 |doi=10.1128/JB.00619-08|display-authors=etal |pmid=18676672 |pmc=2566221}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Comparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rodgers J.; Gibbs R.A. |year=2014 |title=Applications of Next-Generation Sequencing Comparative primate genomics: emerging patterns of genome content and dynamics |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=347–359 |doi=10.1038/nrg3707|pmc=4113315 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six [[Hominidae|great ape]] species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Prado-Martinez, J.  |year=2013 |title=Great ape genetic diversity and population history |journal=Nature |volume=499 |issue=7459 |pages=471–475 |doi=10.1038/nature12228 |display-authors=etal |bibcode = 2013Natur.499..471P }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng, J.; Konopa, G.; Hunt, B.G.; Preuss, T.M.; Geschwind, D.; Yi, S.V. |year=2012 |title=Divergent Whole-Genome Methylation Maps of Human and Chimpanzee Brains Reveal Epigenetic Basis of Human Regulatory Evolution |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=455–465|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.07.024 |pmid=22922032 |pmc=3511995}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of frescoes''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[fresco]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== Technology==
[[Fresco]] is a technique of mural painting in which pigment is applied to freshly-laid or wet lime plaster. Water acts as a type of binding agent that allows the pigment to merge with the plaster, and once the plaster sets the painting becomes an integral part of the wall.

===Materials (chemical make-up)===
[[File:LIME CYCLE.jpg|thumb|Lime cycle]]
Fresco chemicals consist of the following:
* Silicon dioxide (sand)
* Calcium oxide (quick lime)
* Dihydrogen oxide (water)
* Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime)
* Carbon dioxide 
* Calcium carbonate (limestone)

Calcium carbonate (limestone) is decomposed by heat to produce calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide gas. Then calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) which is accompanied by the release of heat, a reaction known as exothermic.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R.

===Pigments used from Antiquity to the early 19th century===

* Carbon black - created by heating wood or other plant material (amphorous carbon)
* Bone black - charring of bones or waste ivory in absence of air (10% carbon, 84% calcium phosphate, 6% carbon carbonate)
* Umber - Natural minerals red bole and cinnabrese with silica and clay attributing to its color (iron(III)-oxide, manganese oxide, aluminum oxide)     
* Red ochre - natural minerals containing silica and clay some of which is composed of iron oxide and hematite (anhydrous iron(III)-oxide)
* Yellow ochre - natural minerals that contain silica and clay, and attributing to its color, goethite (iron oxyhydroxide)
* Lime white - chalk (calcium carbonate and calcite)
* Madder lake - an extract from the root of the madder plant (rubia tintorum)
* Carmine lake - an extract from two types of scale insects: the cochineal and kermes
* Realgar - natural mineral (arsenic sulfide)
* Malachite - natural mineral (basic copper carbonate)
* Orpiment - natural mineral (arsenic sulfide)
* Egyptian blue - first artificial pigment and only used during antiquity (calcium copper silicate)
* Indigo - plant base pigment derived from the woad plant (Isatis tinctoria L.)
* Red lead - natural mineral minium (lead(II,IV)-oxide)
* Green earth - natural minerals glauconite or celadonite (aluminum silicate)

== Deterioration of frescoes ==
[[File:Hades abducting Persephone.jpg|thumb|Hades abducting Persephone]]
Frescoes can be found in places of worship such as churches, ancient temples and tombs, as well as private residences and commercial establishments used for public entertainment.  It is these environments and their pollutants that interact with the chemicals, both organic and inorganic, utilized to create the frescoes and the pigments used that contribute to their aesthetic and structural deterioration.  Additionally, wall paintings such as frescoes depending on the technique used, possess a layered structure consisting of support, ground or paint layer.  These constituents of wall paintings undergo deterioration physically, chemically or biologically. Although factors like moisture, salts, and atmospheric pollution have generally been the main contributors to the deterioration of wall paintings in most cases, many in the field believe the growth of biological agencies like fungi and microbial flora is also responsible for decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical degradation ==
The presence of pigment discoloration, stains and the formation of bio-film are indicative of chemical degradation. Given the variety of organic and inorganic molecules present in frescoes, many type of micro-organisms may grow on the substrate of the fresco provided that environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, light, and pH) are fostered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciferri|first1=Orio|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=March 1999|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical deterioration can be attributed to fungi through their metabolites either by assimilation or dissimulation processes. In the assimilation process, the fungi use the components of frescoes as a carbon source through enzyme production, whereas in the dissimulation process, the decay is mainly by the excretion of waste products or secretion of metabolic intermediates including acids and pigments which can damage, stain or disfigure the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K.|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical degradation==
[[File:Fresco in the Terrace Houses in Ephesus (6).JPG|thumb|Fresco in the terrace houses in Ephesus]]
Signs of cracking and disintegration of paint layers and the formation of paint blisters is indicative of physical/structural degradation.  Industrial pollutants contain gases and burning fossil fuels which react with oxygen and water to produce sulfuric acid and nitric acids.  These acids convert calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium sulfate which becomes soluble in the water and it forms large crystals within the surface layer causing the fresco to blister and flake off.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R. "Chemistry and Fresco Painting".[http://www2.fiu.edu/~gardinal/class_syllabi/IDS4290%20FALL2010/Lecture%2010%20frescos.pdf] Florida International University. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the adverse effects of environmental pollutants, fungal growth either on or below the surface can cause the dislodging of the paint layers further contributing to the physical and structural degradation of frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Kaml|first2=Jain|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventive care ==
Frescoes that have been removed from their original context and relocated to cultural institutions have the benefit of being in a more stable environment that is consistently monitored, even though they are at low risk. However, for frescoes still at their place of origin, such as cultural heritage sites, are at high risk because they are vulnerable to environmental elements due to a high volume of tourist traffic in conjunction with other pollutants.  Therefore, as with any similar object, data loggers are useful to monitor ambient conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, as well as thermohygrometric sensors for micro-climate monitoring for fresco paintings in indoor, outdoor or semi-confined environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merello|first1=P.|last2=Garcia-Diego|first2=F.|last3=Zarzo,|first3=M.|title=Microclimate Monitoring of Aridane's House (Pompeii, Italy) for Preventive Conservation of Fresco Painting|journal=Chemistry Central|date=2012|volume=6|issue=145|pmc=3541997|pmid=23190798|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-6-145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleaning methods ==
Cleaning aims to restore artworks to how the artist intended them to look; however, how an artwork is cleaned will depend on the nature of the material to be removed. With paintings, a variety of organic solvents are used, but the most common solvent is water, often with chelating agents, surfactants or salts to control pH. Applying solutions through tissues, gels and sponges is becoming the norm, due to the level of control offered by holding the cleaning system at the upper surface of the art. Such gels, introduced in the late 1980s, are usually water-based emulsions thickened with cellulose or synthetic polymers. By slowly releasing the solvent, they prevent some of the swelling damage that free solvents cause to paint layers. During the 1960s, it became popular to use synthetic polymers to consolidate and stabilise frescoes – plaster-based wall paintings. They seemed like the perfect replacement for the wax coatings previously used, but over time it became clear that this was not the case. Their presence drastically changed the paintings’ surface properties, causing mechanical stresses and crystallisation of salts beneath the painting leading to accelerated disintegration. In addition, the polymers themselves became discoloured and brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1990s, laser cleaning was established for stone and started to be used for other materials such as gilded bronzes and frescoes. A major breakthrough came when an Italian physicist at the National Research Council Institute of Applied Physics in Florence, Salvatore Siano, developed a method that used even shorter pulses, of only micro- to nanosecond duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major innovation in the last decade is the use of colloid science and nanotechnology in conservation. In the mid 1990s colloid scientist Piero Baglioni came up with a microemulsion: a clear mixture of organic solvent and water, stabilised with a surfactant that sits at the interface between the water and organic phases.  Another unusual method of cleaning frescoes is with the use of specific types of bacteria to remove inorganic crusts and animal glues from frescoes. Because bacteria can produce a whole host of enzymes they can deal with complex cleaning problems, metabolising organic and inorganic matter into hydrogen sulfide, molecular nitrogen or carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and restoration techniques ==
[[File:IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007.jpg|thumb|IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007]]
During the 18th century, new techniques were perfected for the restoration and conservation of ancient works of art, including methods of detaching fresco paintings from walls. Detachment involves separating the layer of paint from its natural backing, generally stone or brick, and can be categorized according to the removal technique used.

The oldest method, known as the a massello technique, involves cutting the wall and removing a considerable part of it together with both layers of plaster and the fresco painting itself.

The stacco technique, on the other hand, involves removing only the preparatory layer of plaster, called the arriccio together with the painted surface.

Finally, the strappo technique, without doubt the least invasive, involves removing only the topmost layer of plaster, known as the intonachino, which has absorbed the pigments, without touching the underlying arriccio layer. In this method, a protective covering made from strips of cotton and animal glue is applied to the painted surface. A second, much heavier cloth, larger than the painted area, is then laid on top and a deep incision is made in the wall around the edges of the fresco. A rubber mallet is used to repeatedly strike the fresco so that it detaches from the wall. Using a removal tool, a sort of awl, the painting and the intonachino attached to the cloth and glue covering are then detached, from the bottom up.

The back of the fresco is thinned to remove excess lime and reconstructed with a permanent backing made from two thin cotton cloths, called velatini, and a heavier cloth with a layer of glue. Two layers of mortar are then applied; first a rough one and then a smoother, more compact layer.

The mortars make up the first real layer of the new backing. The velatini cloths and the heavier cloth serve only to facilitate future detachments, and are therefore known as the strato di sacrificio, or sacrificial layer. Once the mortar is dry, a layer of adhesive is applied and the fresco is attached to a rigid support made from synthetic material which can be used to reconstruct the architecture that originally housed the fresco. After the backing has completely dried, the cloth covering used to protect the front of the fresco during detachment is removed using a hot water spray and decoloured ethyl alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nocentini|first1=Serena|title='Strappo' Detachment|url=http://www.museobenozzogozzoli.it/technics/StrappoDetachment.html|publisher=Museo Benozzo Gozzoli|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piero Baglioni has also pioneered the use of nanoparticles for repairing deteriorating frescoes. Artists generally painted directly onto wet calcium hydroxide plaster, which reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (calcite). Over centuries, pollution and humidity causes the carbonate layer to break down and sulfate, nitrate and chloride salts within the walls recrystallize, leading to deterioration of the painted surface. Baglioni was sure that nanoparticles would improve on conventional conservation methods. His treatment injects calcium hydroxide nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol and their small size, just 10–100&amp;nbsp;nm, allows them to penetrate several centimetres into the frescoes and slowly reform the depleted calcite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotics such as amoxicillin can be used to treat strains of bacteria living in a fresco's natural pigment which can turn them into powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|publisher=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of fresco repair is the application of a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses, and the wall and pictorial layer are strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cacci., ed|first1=Leonardo|title=La Fenice Reconstructed 1996-2003: A Building Site|date=2003|publisher=Marsilio|location=Venezia|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}

=== Sistine Chapel ===

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was restored in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. This was one of the most significant, largest and longest art restoration projects in history. The entire project took twelve years to complete, not taking into account the inspections, planning and approval of the project. Among the many parts of the chapel that was restored, what drew the most attention were Michelangelo's frescoes.  The restoration sparked controversy. A number of experts criticized the proposed techniques, claiming that the restoration procedure would scrape off the layers of various materials on the frescoes, which would lead to damage beyond repair, and  that the removal of the materials would expose the pigments on the frescoes which were fragile and dated to artificial light, temperature variations, humidity and pollution. Such exposure, they feared, would cause massive damage to the original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sistine Chapel Restoration Controversy|url=http://apecsec.org/sistine-chapel-restoration-controversy/|website=APECSEC.org|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii===
[[File:Fresque des mytères, Pompéi.jpg|thumb|Fresque des mytères, Pompéi]]
For the frescos of [[Villa of the Mysteries]] in Pompeii, early conservation efforts sometimes involved removing frescoes, rebuilding or reinforcing the walls, and then reattaching the paintings. The first conservators also applied a coat of wax mixed with oil to clean the paintings’ surfaces, preserve the ancient pigments, and stabilize the fragile works, giving the frescoes a glossy appearance the ancient artists never intended them to have. At the same time, the wax filled in cracks in the surfaces, sealing moisture inside the walls, further weakening them by compromising the strength of the mortar holding the walls together. By 2013 the villa, like most of Pompeii, was in dire need of modern conservation, as was a protective covering that had been constructed in different phases throughout the years. Parts of paintings were crumbling from unstable walls and the mosaics had been severely damaged by millions of visitors’ feet. Repeated applications of wax had caused the pigments to oxidize and darken, and the frescoes to yellow, significantly altering their appearance. All the surface decorations of the villa, both mosaics and frescoes, had been conserved before, but in irregular ways. Some of the methods currently being employed have been used by decades of conservators at Pompeii. Frescoes have been cleaned by hand using a scalpel or a chemical solution. Painted surfaces have been consolidated with an acrylic resin diluted with deionized water and then injected into cracks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lobell|first1=Jaretta A.|title=Saving the Villa of the Mysteries|url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/124-1403/features/1813-pompeii-saving-the-villa-of-the-mysteries|website=Archaeology Magazine|publisher=Archaeology Institute of America|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the use of antibiotics for the removal of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|website=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams today also have more high-tech tools at their disposal, including lasers to clean the frescoes, and ultrasound, thermal imaging, and radar to evaluate the level of decay of the walls and paintings. Drones are being used to examine the entirety of the villa's protective covering.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31637">The '''conservation and restoration of time-based media art''' is the study and practice of conserving time-based media and its components. The conservation and restoration of time-based media art is a complex undertaking within the field of conservation that includes understanding both physical and digital conservation methods; there are many facets of time-based media conservation. Its major aim is to detect and monitor short and long-term changes that an artwork may undergo in response to its environment, technological developments, exhibition-design, or technicians' preferences.&lt;ref name="guggenheimENP"&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420201942/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |archivedate=2015-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time-based media art==
Time-based media is any media that takes time to view, in other words it has a dimension of duration (e.g. five minutes and 10 seconds). Time based-media also contains a technology component, as hardware will be required to view the work.&lt;ref name="smithsonianND"&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Time-Based Media Art at the Smithsonian. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/tbma/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814070709/http://www.si.edu/tbma/about |archivedate=2015-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Time-based media art may be made on a physical media, such as film stock, by a digital means, or a combination of the two. Examples of time-based media include artworks and installations composed of video, audio, film, slides, software-based art or other forms of technology-based artworks.&lt;ref name="smithsonianND"/&gt; A time-based media artwork will consist of the medium- for example a video tape or DVD, the equipment it is played on, and any additional installation components.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"&gt;Iles, Chrissie and Huldisch, Henriette (2005). Keeping Time: On Collecting Film and Video Art in the Museum. In ''Collecting the New''. Altshuler, Bruce (Ed.) NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Works containing video and/or audio may at times be referred to as "4D" (four-dimensional), referencing time as the fourth dimension, in addition to the other three dimensions in artwork: length, width, and height. Some time-based media works may overlap, in some respects, with [[New media art|New Media Art]]. Other terms that may also refer to time-based media art include "variable media art", "electronic art", "moving-image art", "technology-based art" and "time-based media". Time-based media collections may be housed in libraries and archives, but time-based media art collections are typically housed in museums, where film and video are collected as fine art and where the collection is typically smaller than in a library or archive.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums are more likely to collect video and installation-specific equipment as well.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; The majority of time-based media art is completed on noncommercial films stocks, such as 8mm or 16mm, on videotape, or via a digital means. Time-based media art is differentiated from professional or commercial film-making.

== Preservation and conservation strategies ==
Guidelines for collecting and preserving time-based media art are still evolving, and standards have not yet been reached.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Generally though, video and film must be looked at differently because of the difference between the two mediums, despite having the similarity of being recorded in time. Thus procedures for preservation and conservation will vary between the mediums. Video is a coded system, the information stored on the magnetic or digital tape can be retrieved only with a specific electronic playback device; the images on the film strip, however, are legible on their own, though the projector provides the only means by which they can be viewed.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; When collecting film and video art, a master and at least one sub-master should be obtained. In some cases, and exhibition copy will be obtained as well, in other cases it will be copied by the museum. The Guggenheim Museum provides preservation models for [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_5.pdf Analog Standard Definition Video], [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_6.pdf Digital Standard Definition Video], and [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/7-2_TBM_Practices_7.pdf High Definition Video]. Some conservators recommend that sub-masters be in digital format, as analog tape suffers from [[generation loss]], each time it is duplicated.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Digital formats can suffer from generation loss as well, but it can be avoided through good practice. The sub-master will be used to make new copies of the work and the format of the sub-master needs to be updated when it nears obsolescence. Obsolescence is of particular concern to time-based media art conservationists as many artworks are tied to hardware which is no longer manufactured or supported. File formats reaching obsolescence are another concern, as operating systems change and old formats are replaced by newer ones. Fortunately there are some methods in place to help prevent the total loss of time-based media artworks.

=== Preventative measures ===
The protection against physical loss, technological obsolescence, and digital loss of the file are important aspects of a holistic approach to preservation strategies. Measures must also be taken against environmental factors, such as humidity and pests to ensure the long-term preservation of any physical media. [[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] is an important part of any museum preventative conservation plan. It is important to note that preventative measures do not stop deterioration fully, they merely prolong the time it takes for the media to deteriorate. Some media, like certain film stocks, are more stable than others, and some media, such as magnetic videotape are potentially unstable, so again different approaches will be necessary.

==== Storage and maintenance of physical objects ====
Good storage practices help ensure the long-life of an artwork and should be incorporated into a museum's conservation strategy. Storage practices vary by media, so a museum will need to employ a range of storage options to best care for their time-based media art collections. A variety of physical media, such as film, tape, and disks must be stored properly to prevent physical loss. Prevention is the best measure of protection against loss. How media is stored will be dependent on the type of media it is, film has different considerations than disks or videotape. Generally, time-based media storage will require cool temperatures and low humidity.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"&gt;IMAP. (2009). Preservation 101. Retrieved from www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film''' - film reels are typically stored in their metal or plastic canisters, laid flat, and stacked on top of each other. Film must be stored in a climate-controlled room due to its susceptibility to heat and humidity. Film may also have additional special storage considerations, which may involve low temperature freezes to retard further damage.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service (n.d.) Cold Storage. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303014739/http://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/html/intro1_1.html |archivedate=2015-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; How stable the film is depends largely on the type of stock, but film, if well taken care of, is generally able to last for long periods of time. Film has been made on a variety of materials, including nitrate-based stock (see: [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|Nitrocellulose]]) and acetate-based stocks, and polyester-backed film, each have their own considerations. Nitrate film must be handled carefully, as it is highly flammable; [[Cellulose acetate film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|cellulose acetate film]] stocks are at risk of vinegar syndrome, whereas polyester-backed films are not.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Film is stored in a colder environment than other time-based media, and different types of film have different optimum storage temperatures. "Color film should be stored at the coldest possible temperature to reduce fading," 0-30 degrees Fahrenheit, while black and white film can be stored at a temperature of 25-50 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Magnetic Videotape'''- Magnetic videotape was never meant to last, and often has a short life (often only a few decades) especially if exposed to warm or humid conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes, should be stored in upright, under cool, dry, dust-free conditions.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Videotapes may be stored in polypropylene cases, but without paper inside the cases and "magnetic media should never be stored at temperatures below 46 degrees Fahrenheit".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt; Magnetic media should also be kept away from magnetic sources, which could demagnetize them.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Optical Digital Media''' - DVDs and CDs are another media that will need storage space. Optical media should be stored in hard plastic jewel cases or other inert plastic containers; avoid storage in plastic sleeves. DVDs and CDs can be stored at temperatures ranging from 62-68 degrees Fahrenheit, with 33-45% relative humidity, but cooler temperatures are recommended to ensure a longer life.&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

'''Playback Devices''' - Because time-based media is dependent on technology to view it, playback devices must also be stored. There are some devices that will apply to many works in a time-based media art collection, but specific types of technological devices may be required for the art or preferred by the artist. Maintaining the technology that the time-based media art is played on is one conservation strategy, and what is stored depends on the device. Consumer products, for example, are not meant for repeated viewing on such a large scale and are usually not expected to have a long enough life to maintain the device well into the future. Due to rapid changes in video technology and the high cost of maintaining and storing equipment, storage and maintenance of some playback devices may not practical for a museum as a primary strategy.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; Museums do at times need to store obsolete technology though, such as VCRs, old computers, video game systems, etc., particularly if they have been customized for the artwork by the artist. In these cases, conservation strategies could included acquiring spare parts (early on in the acquisition process, before the technology goes out of manufacture), making new components if necessary, and/or "recreating significant features by inexact substitution" (in order words, using the "best match").&lt;ref name="PLManagement"&gt;Laurenson, Pip (2005). The Management of Display Equipment in Time-based Media Installations. Tate Papers. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926045821/http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/7344 |archivedate=2015-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until better solutions are found, keeping and maintaining old technology will remain a necessity. Unlike video equipment, film equipment is far more stable and museums may be more likely to conserve the equipment along with the media because there is less upkeep and film equipment does not need constant replacement due to obsolescence.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt; A working projector will always run film. Technological devices should be stored in a clean, climate controlled environment, as humidity can be damaging to electronic components.

====Digital preservation====
Digital files must be preserved and stored as well, otherwise they also risk degradation. Due to the large amounts of storage space that may be needed, museums may want to employ the use of a digital repository that offers digital preservation as a service. Repositories will keep the digital file stored, perform migration (moving the old format to a new, usable format), and typically offer some guarantee of preservation for a specified period of time. Artists may also wish to seek out a repository for storage of their digital artwork. Rhizome's [http://rhizome.org/artbase/?ref=header Artbase] is an online archive that seeks to preserve contemporary digital art. Part of digital media storage is to ensure continuity of the digital file through format changes, thus migration becomes a likely strategy. Some conservators recommend that medium upgrades take place at least every five years, making duplication a main strategy of digital conservation.&lt;ref name="keepingtime"/&gt;

Time-based media art that either has an inherent digital component (i.e. a born-digital work) or has been digitized will have the need to be preserved digitally. While this work may not entirely be completed by the conservator, conservators will be aware of the methods used to preserve digital media. The Variable Media Approach, a strategy that comes from the Guggenheim Museum's Variable Media Initiative research, offers a way in which to define the artwork "independently from medium so that the work can be translated once its current medium is obsolete." &lt;ref&gt;Variable Media Network (n.d.) Retrieved from http://www.variablemedia.net/e/welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is a methodology that approaches a work as independent from its media, so that is may be thought of as a behavior and not something tied to its hardware.&lt;ref&gt;Depocas, Alain  (2003). The Guggenheim Museum and the Daniel Langlois Foundation: The Variable Media Network. Retrieved from http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=98&lt;/ref&gt; This process looks to preserve works despite the uncertainty of technological developments of the future. By making a work independent from its medium, the Variable Media Approach hopes to ensure the life of the artwork well into the future, beyond the obsolescence of all current technology. The approach encompasses four aspects: Storage, Migration, Emulation, and Reinterpretation.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"&gt;Guggenheim Museum. (n.d.). The Variable Media Initiative. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423083848/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media |archivedate=2015-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage is the most basic strategy. Migration simply means to copy the files to new storage media. With migration, conservators preserve the original aspects of the work. Emulation is not as straight forward, it involves some amount of interpretation and is more an imitation of the original work. In the context of digital media, "emulation offers a powerful technique for running an out-of-date computer on a contemporary one".&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Reinterpretation is the most radical strategy, as it involves recreation of the work.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt;

When formats or storage media become obsolete, "time-based art is typically migrated to newer, accessible platforms".&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"&gt;Smithsonian Institution (2010). Collaborations in Conserving Time-Based Art: A Summary of Discussion Group Sessions of a Colloquium. Smithsonian Institution. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505095855/http://www.si.edu/content/tbma/documents/Time-Based-Art_Report.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will mean updating the file format so that it is playable on newer technology. In some cases, this may not be in keeping with the artist's wishes, as he or she may wish to continue viewings of their work in a specific format. If the format is integral to the work, then upkeep becomes more involved and maintaining the usability of the artwork against the odds of obsolescence in both media and technology becomes a major preservation challenge.&lt;ref name="SICollaborations"/&gt; For this reason, it is encouraged that artists allow for some flexibility in future iterations of the artwork.

=== Examination and documentation ===
Examining and documenting the physical state of an object is an important part of understanding its overall condition. The process of examination and documentation will alert conservators to any problems that need immediate or future attention.

==== Physical examination ====
The physical components of time-based media art must be examined in order to understand their physical condition. With film, physical examination will identify a variety of deterioration processes, such as vinegar syndrome in safety films or color dye fading in color film stock. It is important to identify these early, not only to try to prevent further deterioration, but to intervene with treatment or to make a duplicate copy. Without the examination process, time-based media may degrade beyond repair and possibly be lost entirely.

==== Condition assessments ====
Condition assessments are procedures that are carried out by conservators or other collections care professionals to document the overall condition of an object. These assessments are necessary for all the types of media and technology associated with time-based media art. The assessments stay in the object's file and give future conservators insight into the object's life history. They are performed upon intake of an object into a collection, before and after the object goes on loan, and as necessary. They make note of any physical issues that may be present, such as tears, stains, scratches, or other damage. Film is especially vulnerable to tears and warping, while DVDs and CDs scratch easily. Other issues cannot be seen, such as demagnetization of tape, and require other methods of examination. After the condition of a physical object is assessed, the examiner may recommend treatment if necessary.

Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) recommends taking certain steps to assessing the condition of time-based media: 1) Examine the container - damage on the outside of a container could mean damaged media inside the container. Cases should be examined for dents, stains, and molds or fungus. 2) Check for odor - it may be an indication that the media has deteriorated. Vinegar syndrome emits a vinegar-like odor when present. If media smells musty it could indicate magnetic decay. 3) Examine the surface and the edges - look for powder, dust, dirt and residue, they may indicate deterioration or surface contamination. 4) Identify the format - Knowing the media format is important to proper handling. 5) Play the tape - In some cases it may be necessary to play the tape, a process that if not handled carefully could damage the media. Playback can detect "noise, color shift, distortion, and timing flaws".&lt;ref name="IMAPP101"/&gt;

==== Further documentation ====
Because time-based media has a fourth dimension of time, not present in other types of works, additional documentation to understand the allographic nature of the media may be required, and is recommended. Such documents include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://media.guggenheim.org/content/New_York/collections/Conservation/Iteration_Report.pdf Iteration Report] or [http://variablemediaquestionnaire.net/ Variable Media Questionnaire] (VMQ), developed as part of the Variable Media Initiative. The reports collect information about the nature or behavior of the art, so that future curators and conservators can understand it from an artistic and behavioral point of view, as well as a technical point of view. This allows museum professionals to recreate, or make a new iteration, of a particular time-based media artwork. The most common behaviors assigned to time-based media art are interactive, encoded, and networked.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; Because a new viewing of a time-based work can only be an iteration, by making each viewing as close to the artist's desires as possible, the nature of the artwork is conserved.&lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; The reports collect information such as how to install the artwork, what the space (walls, floors, ceilings, additions) should look like and how it should be arranged, how equipment should be installed, and the technical set-up of the work. Each iteration will be dependent on the physical constraints of the room, so that no two installations will be completely alike. In the VMQ, an artist can order his or her preferences for technical specifications and whether any technology other than the original is allowed to be used. The reports are an important means of understanding how to set-up a work and make it as close to the prior iterations as possible.

===Research===
The history of time-based media art is not long, compared to more traditional forms of art. Much research is still needed in this area in order to move toward and achieve standardizations of practice.

====Research projects====
Two major research projects into time-based media include the Guggenheim Museum's [http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/conservation-projects/variable-media Variable Media Initiative] and the Smithsonian's [http://www.si.edu/tbma/about Time Based Media and Digital Art Working Group].

=====The Variable Media Initiative=====
The Guggenheim Museum's research has led to the Variable Media Approach, and the Variable Media Questionnaire, a tool of the Variable Media Approach. Beginning in 1999, the Variable Media Initiative is one of the museum's most well-known research initiatives. Originally funded by a grant from the Daniel Langlois Foundation for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, Canada, the Variable Media Network (VMN) has grown into a group of international institutions and consultants, including University of Maine, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archives, Franklin Furnace, Rhizome.org, and Performance Art Festival &amp; Archives &lt;ref name="GuggenheimVMI"/&gt; It defined a new approach to documenting contemporary artworks dependent on media, by defining the media as "variable", the artwork becomes untangled from its material aspects, allowing preservation of the work through time without loss of meaning.

===Treatment===
Treatment methods of time-based media art include a mix of both traditional and new techniques. Not all of the work will fall to a conservator, because of the highly technical nature of some of the devices, "certain tasks have to be delegated to respective experts, such as media technicians, video engineers, programmers, film-lab professionals, service technicians, and similar specialists".&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim Museum (n.d.). Establishing New Practices. Retrieved from {{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420201942/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/conservation/time-based-media/establishing-new-practices |archivedate=2015-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maintenance of the technology is an important part of the conservation process for many works of art.

====Treatment of physical objects====
Time-based media conservators will treat and maintain a variety of objects, including film reels, projectors, computers, TVs, and other types of technology. In cases of videotape and DVDs, migration of the work to another format will more likely be the case. Because there are so many types of media that support time-based media art, treatment of each type will vary. While the prevention of physical film degradation is important, the preservationist's main goal is to preserve the image, as the film itself often decays rapidly and beyond repair (see: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]). Film preservation falls into several categories: conservation, which is the "protection of the original film artifact"; duplication, which is the "making of a surrogate copy"; and restoration, which is the attempt to "reconstruct a specific version of a film", which will include piecing together footage from all known sources.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"&gt;National Film Preservation Foundation (2004). The Film Preservation Guide: The basics for archives, libraries, and museums. San Francisco, CA: National Film Preservation Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Film restoration will involve the use of duplicates, not the originals.&lt;ref name="NFPFGuide"/&gt; Duplication of an original to a new and stable film stock (a continuing process, as eventually the duplicate will degrade) and repairing tears in the physical film are common types of treatment for film stock. There is a growing need to understand digital processes of duplication as well. While much duplication still requires that film be moved to a new and stable film stock, digital has been advancing as a method of duplication, though many argue it should not be used alone as digital files are unproven in the long term (see again: [[Film preservation|Film Preservation]]).

In the case of technology, treatment will look more like maintenance and will be required to keep the object functional. Obsolescence of technology is a major concern as discussed under Storage and Maintenance of Physical Objects.

=== Education and outreach  ===

====Access====
Access is the process through which artistic content is shared with public, such as providing researchers access to materials for scholarly work. Museums will more likely lend copies for study purposes, though study of the original may be warranted at times.

====Community outreach====
Festivals such as Portland's [[Time-Based Art Festival]] take place annually and are reflective of the general acceptance of time-based media art outside the walls of the museum.

== Education and training==

===Educational programs===
There are few conservation programs specific to time-based media art, but the [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch/en/ Bern University of the Arts] in Bern, Switzerland offers an MA program for the Conservation of Modern Materials and Media. Programs that include some aspect of time-based media include [https://www.rochester.edu/College/FMS/graduate/selznick.html The Selznick Graduate Program in Film and Media Preservation at the University of Rochester] in New York and [http://cinema.tisch.nyu.edu/page/miap.html New York University's Moving Image Archiving and Preservation program]. At UCLA, there is an [http://mias.gseis.ucla.edu/ M.A. in Moving Image Archive Studies]. The latter three programs deal primarily in archival film preservation, which requires specialized training in a variety of film stocks. A film preservationist must be knowledgeable about and trained to work with many types of film. In a museum context, the film is more likely to be consumer sizes like super 8mm and 16mm, not the 35mm that is used in commercial film making, as they are the preferred medium of artist and amateur filmmakers. Typically, the 35mm stock will be more prevalent in a library or archive. Because of the few formalized education programs in time-based media, most conservators of time-based media art make their way there through a professional path.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="954">A '''conservation headland''' is a strip along the edge of an [[agricultural]] field, where [[pesticide]]s is sprayed only in a selective manner. This increases the number and type of [[weed]] and insect species present, and benefits the bird species that depend on them. The [[grey partridge]] is one such bird.
Conservation headlands were introduced in the 1980s by scientists working for [[Game &amp; Wildlife Conservation Trust]] in [[Great Britain]]. Trials have taken place in southern [[Sweden]].

A '''DNA sequencer''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to automate the [[DNA sequencing]] process.  Given a sample of [[DNA]], a DNA sequencer is used to determine the order of the four bases: G ([[guanine]]), C ([[cytosine]]), A ([[adenine]]) and T ([[thymine]]). This is then reported as a text [[String (computer science)|string]], called a read. Some DNA sequencers can be also considered [[optical instrument]]s as they analyze light signals originating from [[fluorochrome]]s attached to [[nucleotides]].

The first automated DNA sequencer, invented by [[Lloyd M. Smith]], was introduced by [[Applied Biosystems]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook-Deegan|first1=Robert Mullan|title=Origins of the Human Genome Project|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/mccurdy/Project.doc|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the [[Sanger sequencing]] method, a technology which formed the basis of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers&lt;ref name=Metzker&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzker, M. L. |title=Emerging technologies in DNA sequencing |journal=Genome Res. |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1767–1776 |year=2005 |pmid=16339375 |doi= 10.1101/gr.3770505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C.

Therefore, these sequencers can also be used in the [[genotyping]] of genetic markers where only the length of a DNA fragment(s) needs to be determined (e.g. [[microsatellite]]s, [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLPs]]).

The [[Human Genome Project]] catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as [[Next-generation sequencing|Next Generation Sequencers]] (NGS) to sequence the [[human genome]]. These include the 454, [[ABI Solid Sequencing|SOLiD]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] DNA sequencing platforms. Next generation sequencing machines have increased the rate of DNA sequence substantially compared with previous Sanger methods. DNA samples can be prepared automatically in as little as 90 mins,&lt;ref name="a tale of three" /&gt; while a human genome can be sequenced at 15 times coverage in a matter of days.&lt;ref name="large genome centre"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael A.

More recent, third-generation  DNA sequencers such as [[Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing|SMRT]] and [[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore]] measure the addition of nucleotides to a single DNA molecule in real time.

Because of limitations in DNA sequencer technology these reads are short compared to the length of a [[genome]] therefore the reads must be [[Sequence assembly|assembled]] into longer [[contig]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Heng Li, Jue Ruan, and Richard Durbin (2008) http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851 Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores. Genome Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The data may also contain errors, caused by limitations in the DNA sequencing technique or by errors during [[PCR amplification]]. DNA sequencer manufacturers use a number of different methods to detect which DNA bases are present. The specific protocols applied in different sequencing platforms have an impact in the final data that is generated. Therefore, comparing data quality and cost across different technologies can be a daunting task. Each manufacturer provides their own ways to inform sequencing errors and scores. However, errors and scores between different platforms cannot always be compared directly. Since these systems rely on different DNA sequencing approaches, choosing the best DNA sequencer and method will typically depend on the experiment objectives and available budget.&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;

==History==

The first [[DNA sequencing]] methods were developed by Gilbert (1973)&lt;ref name="Gilbert 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert W, Maxam A |title=The Nucleotide Sequence of the lac Operator |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=13581–3584 |year=1973 |pmc=427284 |pmid=4587255 |doi=10.1073/pnas.70.12.3581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Sanger (1975).&lt;ref name=Sanger75&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanger F, Coulson AR |title=A rapid method for determining sequences in DNA by primed synthesis with DNA polymerase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=441–8 |date=May 1975 |pmid=1100841 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(75)90213-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert introduced a sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA followed by cleavage at specific bases whereas Sanger’s technique is based on [[dideoxynucleotide]] chain termination. The Sanger method became popular due to its increased efficiency and low radioactivity. The first automated DNA sequencer was the AB370A, introduced in 1986 by [[Applied Biosystems]]. The AB370A was able to sequence 96 samples simultaneously, 500 kilobases per day, and reaching read lengths up to 600 bases. This was the beginning of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers,&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C. A. III. 2007 6227–6237"/&gt; which implemented Sanger sequencing, fluorescent dideoxy nucleotides and polyacrylamide gel sandwiched between glass plates - slab gels.  The next major advance was the release in 1995 of the AB310 which utilized a linear polymer in a capillary in place of the slab gel for DNA strand separation by electrophoresis. These techniques formed the base for the completion of the human genome project in 2001.&lt;ref name="F. S. Collins, M. Morgan, and A. Patrinos 2003 286–290"/&gt; The human genome project catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as Next Generation Sequencers (NGS). In 2005, 454 Life Sciences released the 454 sequencer, followed by Solexa Genome Analyzer and SOLiD (Supported Oligo Ligation Detection) by Agencourt in 2006. Applied Biosystems acquired Agencourt in 2006, and in 2007, Roche bought 454 Life Sciences, while Illumina purchased Solexa. Ion Torrent entered the market in 2010 and was acquired by Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific). These are still the most common NGS systems due to their competitive cost, accuracy, and performance.

More recently, a third generation of DNA sequencers was introduced. The sequencing methods applied by these sequencers do not require DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction&amp;nbsp;– PCR), which speeds up the sample preparation before sequencing and reduces errors. In addition, sequencing data is collected from the reactions caused by the addition of nucleotides in the complementary strand in real time. Two companies introduced different approaches in their third-generation sequencers. Pacific Biosciences sequencers utilize a method called Single-molecule real-time (SMRT), where sequencing data is produced by light (captured by a camera) emitted when a nucleotide is added to the complementary strand by enzymes containing fluorescent dyes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies is another company developing third-generation sequencers using electronic systems based on nanopore sensing technologies.

==Manufacturers of DNA sequencers==

DNA sequencers have been developed, manufactured, and sold by the following companies, among others.

===Roche===
The 454 DNA sequencer was the first next-generation sequencer to become commercially successful.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin Liu |author2=Yinhu Li |author3=Siliang Li |author4=Ni Hu |author5=Yimin He |author6=Ray Pong |author7=Danni Lin |author8=Lihua Lu |author9=Maggie Law |title = Comparison of Next-Generation Sequencing Systems|journal = Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|volume = |issue = |pages = |pmid = |doi = |url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/251364/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by 454 Life Sciences and purchased by Roche in 2007. 454 utilizes the detection of pyrophosphate released by the DNA polymerase reaction when adding a nucleotide to the template strain.

Roche currently manufactures two systems based on their pyrosequencing technology: the GS FLX+ and the GS Junior System.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/index.asp Products : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The GS FLX+ System promises read lengths of approximately 1000 base pairs while the GS Junior System promises 400 base pair reads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-flx-system/index.asp Products - GS FLX+ System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-junior-system/index.asp Products - GS Junior System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A predecessor to GS FLX+, the 454 GS FLX Titanium system was released in 2008, achieving an output of 0.7G of data per run, with 99.9% accuracy after quality filter, and a read length of up to 700bp. In 2009, Roche launched the GS Junior, a bench top version of the 454 sequencer with read length up to 400bp, and simplified library preparation and data processing.

One of the advantages of 454 systems is their running speed, Manpower can be reduced with automation of library preparation and semi-automation of emulsion PCR. A disadvantage of the 454 system is that it is prone to errors when estimating the number of bases in a long string of identical nucleotides. This is referred to as a homopolymer error and occurs when there are 6 or more identical bases in row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mardis|first=Elaine R.|title=Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Methods|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=1 September 2008|volume=9|issue=1|pages=387–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164359|pmid=18576944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage is that the price of reagents is relatively more expensive compared with other next-generation sequencers.

In 2013 Roche announced that they would be shutting down development of 454 technology and phasing out 454 machines completely in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/roche-shutting-down-454-sequencing-business Roche Shutting Down 454 Sequencing Business&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/4/23/roche-shuts-down-third-generation-ngs-research-programs.html Roche Shuts Down Third-Generation NGS Research Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche produces a number of software tools which are optimised for the analysis of 454 sequencing data.&lt;ref name=454analysis&gt;[http://454.com/products-solutions/analysis-tools/gs-de-novo-assembler.asp Products - Analysis Software : 454 Life Science, a Roche Company]&lt;/ref&gt; GS Run Processor&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequence.otago.ac.nz/download/ManualPartB.pdf Genome Sequencer FLX System Software Manual, version 2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; converts raw images generated by a sequencing run into intensity values. The process consists of two main steps: image processing and signal processing. The software also applies normalization, signal correction, base-calling and quality scores for individual reads. The software outputs data in Standard Flowgram Format (or SFF) files to be used in data analysis applications (GS De Novo Assembler, GS Reference Mapper or GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer). GS De Novo Assembler is a tool for ''de novo'' assembly of whole-genomes up to 3GB in size from shotgun reads alone or combined with paired end data generated by 454 sequencers. It also supports de novo assembly of transcripts (including analysis), and also isoform variant detection.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; GS Reference Mapper maps short reads to a reference genome, generating a consensus sequence. The software is able to generate output files for assessment, indicating insertions, deletions and SNPs. Can handle large and complex genomes of any size.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; Finally, the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer aligns reads from amplicon samples against a reference, identifying variants (linked or not) and their frequencies. It can also be used to detect unknown and low-frequency variants. It includes graphical tools for analysis of alignments.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt;

===Illumina===
[[File:GA2.JPG|thumbnail|Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencing machine]]
[[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] produces a number of next-generation sequencing machines using technology acquired from [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] and developed by Solexa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-11-05/solexas-progress-is-in-the-genes Solexa's Progress Is In The Genes - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Illumina makes a number of next generation sequencing machines using this technology including the HiSeq, Genome Analyzer IIx, MiSeq and the HiScanSQ, which can also process [[DNA microarray|microarrays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illumina.com/systems.ilmn Illumina Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology leading to these DNA sequencers was first released by Solexa in 2006 as the Genome Analyzer.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;  Illumina purchased Solexa in 2007. The Genome Analyzer uses a sequencing by synthesis method. The first model produced 1G per run. During the year 2009 the output was increased from 20G per run in August to 50G per run in December. In 2010 Illumina released the HiSeq 2000 with an output of 200 and then 600G per run which would take 8 days. At its release the HiSeq 2000 provided one of the cheapest sequencing platforms at $0.02 per million bases as costed by the [[Beijing Genomics Institute]].

In 2011 Illumina released a benchtop sequencer called the MiSeq. At its release the MiSeq could generate 1.5G per run with paired end 150bp reads. A sequencing run can be performed in 10 hours when using automated DNA sample preparation.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The Illumina HiSeq uses two software tools to calculate the number and position of DNA clusters to assess the sequencing quality: the HiSeq control system and the real-time analyzer. These methods help to assess if nearby clusters are interfering with each other.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

===Life Technologies===
[[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) produces DNA sequencers under the [[Applied Biosystems]] and [[Ion Torrent]] brands. Applied Biosystems makes the SOLiD next-generation sequencing platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/appliedbiosystems SOLiD]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sanger-based DNA sequencers such as the 3500 Genetic Analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/sanger-sequencing.html Sanger Sequencing | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ion Torrent brand, Applied Biosystems produces four next-generation sequencers: the Ion PGM System, Ion Proton System, Ion S5 and Ion S5xl systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thermofisher.com/iontorrent Ion Torrent&lt;/ref&gt;. The company is also believed to be developing their new capillary DNA sequencer called SeqStudio that will be released early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/products-and-services/promotions/life-science/seqstudio-genetic-analyzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

SOLiD systems was acquired by Applied Biosystems in 2006. SOLiD applies sequencing by ligation and [[2 base encoding|dual base encoding]]. The first SOLiD system was launched in 2007, generating reading lengths of 35bp and 3G data per run. After five upgrades, the 5500xl sequencing system was released in 2010, considerably increasing read length to 85bp, improving accuracy up to 99.99% and producing 30G per 7-day run.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The limited read length of the SOLiD has remained a significant shortcoming&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/absite/us/en/home/applications-technologies/solid-next-generation-sequencing.html SOLiD system accuracy]&lt;/ref&gt; and has to some extent limited its use to experiments where read length is less vital such as resequencing and transcriptome analysis and more recently ChIP-Seq and methylation experiments.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt; The DNA sample preparation time for SOLiD systems has become much quicker with the automation of sequencing library preparations such as the Tecan system.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The colour space data produced by the SOLiD platform can be decoded into DNA bases for further analysis, however software that considers the original colour space information can give more accurate results. Life Technologies has released BioScope,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifetechnologies.com/au/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing-data-analysis-solutions/solid-bioscope-software.html SOLiD BioScope Software | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; a data analysis package for resequencing, ChiP-Seq and transcriptome analysis. It uses the MaxMapper algorithm to map the colour space reads.

===Beckman Coulter===
[[Beckman Coulter]] (now [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]]) has previously manufactured chain termination and capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencers under the model name CEQ, including the CEQ 8000.  The company now produces the GeXP Genetic Analysis System, which uses [[dye terminator sequencing]]. This method uses a [[thermocycler]] in much the same way as [[PCR]] to denature, anneal, and extend DNA fragments, amplifying the sequenced fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Alex J.|author2=Kamath, Rashmi M. |author3=Gerald, William |author4= Fleisher, Martin |title=Analytical validation of the GeXP analyzer and design of a workflow for cancer-biomarker discovery using multiplexed gene-expression profiling|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=29 October 2008|volume=393|issue=5|pages=1505–1511|doi=10.1007/s00216-008-2436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/research-and-discovery/products-and-services/genetic-analysis-systems/genomelab-gexp-genetic-analysis-system/index.htm#overview Beckman Coulter, Inc - GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Biosciences===
[[Pacific Biosciences]] produces the PacBio RS and Sequel sequencing systems using a [[single molecule real time sequencing]], or SMRT, method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/ Pacific Biosciences: PacBio Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; This system can produce read lengths of multiple thousands of base pairs.  Higher raw read errors are corrected using either circular consensus - where the same strand is read over and over again - or using optimized [[Sequence assembly|assembly]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koren|first=S |author2=Schatz, MC |author3=Walenz, BP |author4=Martin, J |author5=Howard, JT |author6=Ganapathy, G |author7=Wang, Z |author8=Rasko, DA |author9=McCombie, WR |author10=Jarvis, ED |author11=Phillippy, AM|title=Hybrid error correction and de novo assembly of single-molecule sequencing reads.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 1, 2012|pmid=22750884|doi=10.1038/nbt.2280|volume=30|issue=7|pages=693–700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have reported 99.9999% accuracy with these strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/full/nmeth.2474.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Sequel system was launched in 2015 with an increased capacity and a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2015/10/1/a-worthy-sequel.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/pacbio-launches-higher-throughput-lower-cost-single-molecule-sequencing-system&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxford Nanopore ===
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] has begun shipping early versions of its [[nanopore sequencing]] MinION sequencer to selected labs. The device is four inches long and gets power from a [[USB port]]. MinION decodes DNA directly as the molecule is drawn at the rate of 450 bases/second through a [[nanopore]] suspended in a membrane. Changes in electric current indicate which base is present. It is 60 to 85 percent accurate, compared with 99.9 percent in conventional machines. Even inaccurate results may prove useful because it produces long read lengths. GridION is a slightly larger sequencer that processes up to five MinION flow cells at once. PromethION is another (unreleased) product that will use as many as 100,000 pores in parallel, more suitable for high volume sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530746/radical-new-dna-sequencer-finally-gets-into-researchers-hands|title = Radical New DNA Sequencer Finally Gets into Researchers’ Hands|last = Regalado|first = Antonio|date = September 17, 2014|work = Technology Review|accessdate = October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design/Build/Fly''', or '''DBF''', is a [[radio-controlled aircraft]] competition sponsored by the American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ([[AIAA]]), [[Cessna Aircraft Company]], and [[Raytheon Missile Systems]]. The [[Office of Naval Research]] was also a sponsor until 2006. The competition is intended to challenge the AIAA student branches of each university to design, build, and fly a remote controlled airplane that can complete specific ground and flight missions. Additionally, the teams are required to submit a comprehensive design report detailing the most important aspects of their designs.

The competition rules change every year. Usually, rules are published in late August and the competition fly-off is held in April. The rules define a mathematical formula used to determine the score for an entry. Recent competitions' formulas have used a combination of design report score, mission score determined by performance conducting one or more mission tasks at the fly-off, and Rated Aircraft Cost, a variable used to define the complexity of the design.

'''Diffuse interstellar bands''' (DIBs) are [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] features seen in the [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectra]] of [[astronomical object]]s in the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies.  They are caused by the absorption of light by the [[interstellar medium]]. Circa 500 bands have now been seen, in [[ultraviolet]], [[visible light|visible]] and [[infrared]] wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160004200&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of DIBs was unknown and disputed for many years, and the DIBs were long believed to be due to [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s and other large [[carbon]]-bearing molecules.&lt;ref name="nature1997"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The interstellar chemistry of PAH cations|journal=Nature|volume= 391|page=259-260|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6664/full/391259a0.html|doi=10.1038/34602|bibcode = 1998Natur.391..259S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal|title=The unidentified diffuse interstellar bands as evidence for large organic molecules in the interstellar medium|journal=Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy|volume= 57|page=615-626|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142500004327|doi=10.1016/S1386-1425(00)00432-7|bibcode = 2001AcSpA..57..615S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rapid and efficient deactivation when photoexcited accounts for their remarkable photostability&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal|title=Ultrafast Studies on the Photophysics of Matrix-Isolated Radical Cations of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume= 108 |page=25–31|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp021832h|doi=10.1021/jp021832h|bibcode = 2004JPCA..108...25Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal|title=Fluorescence of the perylene radical cation and an inaccessible D0/D1 conical intersection: An MMVB, RASSCF, and TD-DFT computational study|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|volume= 132 |page= 044306|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/132/4/10.1063/1.3278545|doi=10.1063/1.3278545

However, no agreement of the bands could be found with laboratory measurements or with theoretical calculations until July 2015, when the group of John Maier (University of Basel) announced the unequivocal assignment of two lines for C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laboratory confirmation of C60+ as the carrier of two diffuse interstellar bands|journal=Nature|volume=523|page=322|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v523/n7560/full/nature14566.html|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirming a prediction made in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C60 in space and the Diffuse Interstellar Bands - History and State of the Art|url=http://www.kroto.info/dibs/|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and history==
Much astronomical work relies on the study of [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] - the light from [[astronomical object]]s dispersed using a [[prism (optics)|prism]] or, more usually, a [[diffraction grating]].  A typical stellar spectrum will consist of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]], containing [[absorption line]]s, each of which is attributed to a particular [[atom]]ic [[energy level]] transition in the atmosphere of the star.

All astronomical objects are affected by [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], the absorption of [[photon]]s by the [[interstellar medium]].  Interstellar absorption predominantly affects the whole spectrum in a continuous way, rather than causing absorption lines, but in 1922 astronomer [[Mary Lea Heger]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; first observed a number of line-like absorption features which seemed to be interstellar in origin.

Their interstellar nature was shown by the fact that the strength of the observed absorption was roughly proportional to the extinction, and that in objects with widely differing [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] the absorption bands were not affected by [[Doppler shift]]ing, implying that the absorption was not occurring in or around the object concerned.&lt;ref name="BibcodeARAHdoiannurevaa"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Diffuse Interstellar Band, or DIB for short, was coined to reflect the fact that the absorption features are much broader than the normal absorption lines seen in stellar spectra.

The first DIBs observed were those at wavelengths 578.0 and 579.7&amp;nbsp;nanometres. (Visible light corresponds to a wavelength range of 400 - 700 nanometers). Other strong DIBs are seen at 628.4, 661.4 and 443.0&amp;nbsp;nm.  The 443.0&amp;nbsp;nm DIB is particularly broad at about 1.2&amp;nbsp;nm across - typical intrinsic stellar absorption features are 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm or less across.

Later [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] studies at higher [[spectral resolution]] and sensitivity revealed more and more DIBs; a catalogue of them in 1975 contained 25 known DIBs, and a decade later the number known had more than doubled. The first detection-limited survey was published by [[Peter Jenniskens]] and Xavier Desert in 1994 (see Figure above),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the first conference on The Diffuse Interstellar Bands at the University of Colorado in Boulder on May 16–19, 1994. Today circa 500 have been detected.

In recent years, very high resolution [[spectrograph]]s on the world's most powerful [[telescope]]s have been used to observe and analyse DIBs.&lt;ref&gt;

==The nature of the carrier==
The great problem with DIBs, apparent from the earliest observations, was that their central wavelengths did not correspond with any known [[spectral line]]s of any [[ion]] or [[molecule]], and so the material which was responsible for the absorption could not be identified.  A large number of theories were advanced as the number of known DIBs grew, and determining the nature of the absorbing material (the 'carrier') became a crucial problem in [[astrophysics]].

One important observational result is that the strengths of most DIBs are not strongly correlated with each other.  This means that there must be many carriers, rather than one carrier responsible for all DIBs.  Also significant is that the strength of DIBs is broadly correlated with the [[interstellar extinction]].  Extinction is caused by [[interstellar dust]]; however, DIBs, are not likely to be caused by dust grains.

The existence of sub-structure in DIBs supports the idea that they are caused by molecules. Substructure results from band heads in the rotational band contour and from isotope substitution. In a molecule containing, say, three [[carbon]] atoms, some of the carbon will be in the form of the [[carbon-13]] [[isotope]], so that while most molecules will contain three [[carbon-12]] atoms, some will contain two &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atoms and one &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C atom, much less will contain one &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and two &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and a very small fraction will contain three &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C molecules.  Each of these forms of the molecule will create an absorption line at a slightly different rest wavelength.

The most likely candidate molecules for producing DIBs are thought to be large carbon-bearing molecules, which are common in the interstellar medium.  [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, long carbon-chain molecules such as [[polyyne]]s, and [[fullerenes]] are all potentially important.&lt;ref name="BibcodeARAHdoiannurevaa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Fullerene C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; identified as carrier of two diffuse interstellar bands==
After nearly 100 years since they were first observed, the [[Buckminsterfullerene]] ion, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, was assigned as the carrier of two diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs).&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt; The paper by E.K. Campbell, M. Holz, D. Gerlich and J.P. Maier was published on August 16, 2015.

The first prediction that C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was a carrier of DIBs was put forward by chemist [[Harry Kroto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C60 in space and the diffuse interstellar bands|url=http://www.kroto.info/dibs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-discoverer of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;, and later with astronomer Mike Jura.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Circumstellar and interstellar fullerenes and their analogues|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=263|pages=275–280|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1992A%26A...263..275K&amp;amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;amp;type=PRINTER&amp;amp;filetype=.pdf|bibcode=1992A&amp;A...263..275K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kroto wrote in 1988, "Starlight will ionize much of the interstellar C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; present and so C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; should be ubiquitously distributed in space, making it a viable candidate for the carrier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Space, Stars, C60, and soot|journal=Nature|volume=242|pages=1139–1145|url=http://www.kroto.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Kroto-Space-Stars-C60-and-Soot-1988_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Kroto also proposed that "The present observations indicate that C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; might survive in the general medium (probably as the ion C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) protected by its unique ability to survive processes so drastic that most, if not all, other known molecules are destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chains and Grains in Interstellar Space|journal=Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons and Astrophysics|date=1987|pages=197–206|url=http://www.kroto.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HWKroto-1987-discussing-the-possibiliy-of-C60-and-its-analogues-in-space-and-as-DIB-carriers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement in 2015 was the result of many years of work, performed by the group of John Maier at the University of Basel, developing state of the art spectroscopic techniques to create conditions in the laboratory that simulated the extremely low temperature and low pressure of interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Buckyballs' Solve Century-Old Mystery About Interstellar Space|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/16/423291426/buckyballs-solve-century-old-mystery-about-interstellar-space|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bountiful buckyballs resolve interstellar mystery|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/jul/16/bountiful-buckyballs-resolve-interstellar-mystery|accessdate=31 July 2015|publisher=physicsworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical experiment in the final phase leading up to the assignment was carried out by Maier's group which originally observed two lines of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in a neon matrix at low temperature in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Electronic and infrared spectra of C60+ and C60- in neon and argon matrices|journal=Chemical Physics Letters|volume=211|pages=227–234|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000926149385190Y|doi=10.1016/0009-2614(93)85190-Y|bibcode = 1993CPL...211..227F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on that result, B.H. Foing and P. Enhrenfreund were able to detect two strong DIBs in close proximity to the two laboratory absorption lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Detection of two interstellar absorption bands coincident with spectral features of C60+|journal=Nature|volume=369|pages=296–298|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v369/n6478/abs/369296a0.html|doi=10.1038/369296a0|bibcode = 1994Natur.369..296F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the matrix caused shifts in the laboratory reference spectrum, and therefore, an unequivocal assignment to DIBs could not be made at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fullerene's faint fingerprint?|journal=Nature|volume=369|page=274|doi=10.1038/369274a0|bibcode = 1994Natur.369..274K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maier spent the next 20 years developing the demanding state of the art techniques to permit direct comparison of laboratory results to DIBs.

'''Ecological assessment''' (EA) implies the monitoring of [[Natural resource|ecological resources]], to discover the current and changing conditions. EAs are required components of most [[hazardous waste]] site investigations. Such assessments, in conjunction with contamination and human health risk assessments, help to evaluate the [[List of environmental health hazards|environmental hazards]] posed by contaminated sites and to determine remediation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/concept?cp=2440 ecological assessment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ecological assessment many abiotic and biotic indicators, reflecting the pluralistic components of [[ecosystem]]s, are used. Reporting on the state of the [[Natural environment|environment]] requires that information on separate indicators are integrated into comprehensive yardsticks or indices. EA is extremely complex because of regional and temporal variation in vulnerability of ecosystems and because of limited understanding of ecosystem functioning and health.&lt;ref name=Latour1994&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |first2=C. |last2=Groen |title=Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=141–145 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
[[File:Indicator 3.0.JPG|thumb|Indicators of ecological assessment]]
Ecological indicators are able to
* assess the condition of the environment
* provide an early warning signal of changes in the environment, or
* diagnose the cause of an environmental problem.
Ideally the suite of indicators should represent key information about structure, function, and composition of the ecological system.&lt;ref name="Dale"&gt;{{Citation |last=Dale |first=V. H. |last2=Beyeler|first2=S. C. |title= Challenges in the development and use of ecological indicators |journal= Ecological Indicators |year=2001 |volume=1|issue=1 |pages=3–10 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X01000036 |doi=10.1016/S1470-160X(01)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general EA indicators can be divided into abiotic and biotic indicators. Due to the complexity of ecosystems and environmental processes, a set of indicators reflecting the many facets of ecosystems is needed. Chemical, physical, and biological indicators each have specific advantages and disadvantages for monitoring and assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zonneveld |first=I.S. |title=Principles of bio-indication |journal=Environmental Monitoring and Assessment |publisher= Springer Netherlands |year=1983 |volume=3|issue=3 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1007/BF00396213
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Abiotic component|Abiotic]]''' indicators, which may give information on the risks or threats from stressors to ecosystems &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Rapport | first=D. J. | year=1989 | title=What constitutes ecosystem health? | journal=Perspectives in Medicine and Biology | volume=30 | pages=120–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; are comparatively well correlated with sources of [[Pollution|pollutants]] and disturbances but may not reflect ecological end points in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Suter |first=G. |title=Endpoints for regional ecological risk assessments |journal= Environmental Management |publisher= Springer New York |year=1990|volume=14|issue=1 |pages=9–23 |doi=10.1007/BF02394015
|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14....9S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Biotic component|Biotic]]''' indicators may reflect end points &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kelly |first=J. |last2=Harwell |first2=M. |title=Indicators of ecosystem recovery |journal=Environmental Management |year=1990 |volume=14|issue=5 |pages=527–545 |doi=10.1007/BF02394708|bibcode = 1990EnMan..14..527K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be used to differentiate "healthy" from "sick" ecosystems. Correlation of biotic indicators with sources of pollutants and other disturbances is relatively difficult due to the complexity of environmental processes and the multitude of potential stressors.&lt;ref name=latour&gt;{{Citation |last=Latour |first=J. |last2=Groen |first2=C. |title= Ecological assessment of natural resources in agroecosystems of Dutch Lowland Peat area |journal=Environmental Management |year=1994 |volume=18|issue=3 |pages=455–464 |doi=10.1007/BF02393873|bibcode = 1994EnMan..18..455L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical appraisal:
* small number of indicators lead to fail considering the full complexity of the ecological system
* choice of ecological indicators depends on management programs that have vague long-term goals and objectives
* monitoring programs miss predominantly the scientific demand (lack of defined protocol for identifying ecological indicators)&lt;ref name="Dale"/&gt;

==Types of ecological assessment==
'''Strategic ecological assessment (SEcA)''' is required to ensure that proposed new developments are compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of Environmental Impact Assessment, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the
* availability
* accuracy
* reliability and
* resolution
of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Muchoney |first=D.M. |last2=Grossman |first2=D. H. |first3=R. |last3=Solomon |title=Rapid Ecological Assessment for conservation planning |journal=Technical papers ACSM-ASPRS annual convention |year=1991 |volume=4 |pages=141–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] has developed '''Rapid Ecological Assessment (REA)''', an integrated methodology to provide the multiple scale, up-to-date information required to guide conservation actions. REA relies on analysis of aerial photography, videography, and satellite image data to identify conservation sites and to direct field sampling and research for cost-effective biological and ecological data acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Krotscheck |first=C. |last2=König |first2=F. H. |first3=I. |last3=Obernberger |title=Ecological assessment of integrated bioenergy systems using the Sustainable Process Index |journal=Biomass and Bioenergy |year=2000 |volume=18 |pages=341–368 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953499000963 |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(99)00096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The goal of EA is to understand the structure and function of ecosystems in order to develop improved management options. Furthermore, developing models to predict the response of ecosystems to changes contributes to finding a particular management strategy.
The results of the EA will be used to suggest possible improvements of the pollutant´s properties to reduce the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=geldermann&gt;{{Citation |last=Geldermann |first=J. |last2=Gabriel |first2=R. |first3=O. |last3=Rentz |title=Ecological assessment of the environmental impacts of the kerosene burning in jet turbines and its improvement assessment |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |year=1999 |volume=6 |pages=115–121 |doi=10.1007/BF02987564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological assessment in the U.S.==
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has set a definition for EA. Ecological assessment is a “qualitative or quantitative assessment of the actual or potential effects of a hazardous waste site on plants and animals other than people and domesticated species”. The methodologies used for EA noted down in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)are only vaguely defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency |title=Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act |year=1980 |url=http://epw.senate.gov/cercla.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, assessment methods applied by both consultants and regulatory agencies range from qualitative approaches, such as listings of potential biotic receptors at a contaminated site, to fully quantitative approaches that include detailed exposure estimations, quantitative toxicity comparisons, and supplementary biota sampling to evaluate uptake estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lemont |first=S. |last2=Eaton |first2=W.

'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">The '''[[fugacity]] capacity constant''' (Z) is used to help describe the concentration of a chemical in a system (usually in mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Pa). Hemond and Hechner-Levy (2000) describe how to utilize the fugacity capacity to calculate the [[concentration]] of a [[chemical]] in a system. Depending on the chemical, fugacity capacity varies. The concentration in media 'm' equals the fugacity capacity in media 'm' multiplied by the fugacity of the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Fate and Transport in the Environment|first=Hemond HF |last=Fechner-Levy EJ|edition= Academic Press|year= 2000|isbn=0-12-340275-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For a chemical system at equilibrium, the fugacity of the chemical will be the same in each media/phase/compartment. Therefore equilibrium is sometimes called "equifugacity" in the context of these calculations.&lt;ref&gt;D. MacKay &amp; S. Paterson. 1991. Evaluating the Multimedia Fate of Organic Chemicals: a Level III Fugacity Model. Environmental Science and Technology. 25(3):427.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:FC.JPG]] --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_m = Z_m \cdot f&lt;/math&gt;

where Z is a proporational constant, termed ''fugacity capacity''. This equation does not necessarily imply that C and f are always linearly related. Non-linearity can be accommodated by allowing Z to vary as a function of C or f.

For a better understanding of the fugacity capacity concept, [[heat capacity]] may provide a precedent for introducing Z as a capacity of a phase to absorb particular quantity of chemical. However, phases with high fugacity capacity do not necessarily retain high [[fugacity]].  

In calculations of fugacity capacity key factors would be (a) the nature of the solute (chemical), (b) the nature of the medium or compartment, (c) temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Multimedia environmental models|first=Donald |last=Mackay|edition= Lewis Publishers|year= 1991|isbn=0-87371-242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expressions for Fugacity Capacity==
The expression for Z&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on the media/phase/compartment. The following list gives the fugacity capacities for common medias:&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKay. 2001. Multimedia Environmental Models: The Fugacity Approach, 2nd Ed. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air (under [[ideal gas]] assumptions): Z&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/RT
* Water: Z&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/H
* Octanol: Z&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;/H
* Pure Phase of Target Chemical: Z&lt;sub&gt;pure&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/P&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;v

Where: R is the [[Ideal gas constant]] (8.314 Pa*m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol*K); T is the absolute temperature (K); H is the [[Henry's law]] constant for the target chemical (Pa/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mol); K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt; is the octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] for the target chemical (dimensionless ratio); P&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; is the vapor pressure of the target chemical (Pa); and v is the molar volume of the target chemical (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol). 

Notice that the ratio between Z-values for different media (e.g. octanol and water) is the same as the ratio between the concentrations of the target chemical in each media at equilibrium. 

When using a fugacity capacity approach to calculate the concentrations of a chemical in each of several medias/phases/compartments, it is often convenient to calculate the prevailing fugacity of the system using the following equation if the total mass of target chemical (M&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) and the volume of each compartment (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) are known:

:&lt;math&gt;f = M_T / \Sigma_m (V_m Z_m) &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, if the target chemical is present as a pure phase at equilibrium, its vapor pressure will be the prevailing fugacity of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7095">'''Gerontechnology''' is an inter- and multidisciplinary academic and professional field combining [[gerontology]] and [[technology]]. Sustainability of an ageing society depends upon our effectiveness in creating technological environments, including [[assistive technology]] and [[inclusive design]], for innovative and independent living and social participation of older adults in any state of health, comfort and safety. In short, gerontechnology concerns matching technological environments to [[health]], [[House|housing]], mobility, [[communication]], [[leisure]] and work of older people. Research outcomes form the basis for [[designers]], [[Construction worker|builders]], [[engineers]], [[manufacturers]], and those in the health professions ([[nursing]], [[medicine]], [[gerontology]], [[geriatrics]], [[environmental psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], etc.), to provide an optimum living environment for the widest range of  ages.

==Description==
Gerontechnology, which has also been called '''''gerotechnology''''' is considered an adjunct to the promotion of human [[health]] and [[well-being]]. It pertains to both human development and aging with the aim to compress [[morbidity]] and to increase [[vitality]] and [[quality of life]] throughout the [[life-span]]. It creates solutions to extend the working phase in society by maximizing the vital and productive years in the later years of life, which consequently reduces the [[cost of care]].

The overall framework of gerontechnology may be seen as a matrix of '''domains of human activity''': (1) health &amp; self-esteem, housing &amp; [[activities of daily living]], communication &amp; governance, mobility &amp; transport, work &amp; leisure, and (2) '''technology interventions''' or impact levels (enhancement &amp; satisfaction, prevention &amp; engagement, compensation &amp; assistance, care and care organisation). Underpinning all these elements are generic and applied [[evidence-based]] research. Such research supports the development of products and services.

Gerontechnology has much in common with other interdisciplinary domains, such as [[Assistive Technology]] (for the compensation &amp; assistance and the care support &amp; care organisation rows of the matrix), and [[Universal Design]] for the development of all products and services pertaining to gerontechnology.

==Gerontological design==
Gerontological design focuses on providing effective solutions to improve the way of life for aging people, through gerontological knowledge and [[design research]] methods to obtain a better understanding of individuals' preferences and requirements.

Gerontological design also refers specifically to the study and practice of building design methods that support elderly users in the built environment.  Some universities host professors, commonly in architecture or interior design departments, that specialize in the study and teaching of this design specialization.  Not only does this include the examination of building design characteristics that impact older adults' physiological well-being, but it can also include the investigation of building design characteristics that impact informational needs (i.e. finding one's way around in a space) or social interaction needs (Campbell, 2012).

Between 2008 and 2030, [[Singapore]] will witness an age profile shift in its population's history. In 2005, one in 12 residents was 65 years or older. By 2030, one in five residents will be 65 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ministry of Community Development, Committee on Ageing Issues |year=2006 |title=Report on the Ageing population.

By 2050, it is envisaged that the percentage could rise to nearly 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2004|title=Global population at a glance: 2002 and beyond.

Products and services relevant to the "silver industry" or the "mature market" increasingly abound in the marketplace. The demand for designers with a keen sense for the aging population's needs who employ gerontological design process knowledge concomitantly rises.

Greenhouse gas monitoring is the direct [[measurement]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and levels.  There are several different methods of measuring carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, including [[Infrared gas analyzer|infrared analyzing]] and [[manometry]]. [[Methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are measured by other instruments. Greenhouse gases are measured by [[satellite monitoring]] such as the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] and networks of [[ground station]]s such as the [[Integrated Carbon Observation System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15603891 |title=Highs and lows |publisher=The Economist |date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Carbon dioxide monitoring ===

==== Manometry ====
Manometry is a key measurement tool for atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by first measuring the volume, temperature, and pressure of a particular amount of dry air. The air sample is dried by passing it through multiple dry ice traps and then collecting it in a five liter vessel. The temperature is taken via a thermometer and pressure is calculated using [[manometry]]. Then, [[liquid nitrogen]] is added, causing the [[carbon dioxide]] to condense and become measurable by volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|date=2010|title=Charles David Keeling and the Story of Atmospheric CO2 Measurements|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/ac1001492|journal=Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=82|issue=19|pages=7865–7870|doi=10.1021/ac1001492|issn=0003-2700|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ideal gas law]] is accurate to 0.3% in these pressure conditions.

==== Infrared gas analyzer ====
Infrared analyzers were used at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] and at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] between 1958 and 2006. IR analyzers operate by pumping an unknown sample of dry air through a 40 cm long cell. A reference cell contains dry [[carbon dioxide]]-free air.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A glowing [[nichrome]] filament radiates broadband [[IR radiation]] which splits into two beams and passes through the gas cells. [[Carbon dioxide]] absorbs some of the radiation, allowing more radiation that passes through the reference cell to reach the detector than radiation passing through the sample cell. Data is collected on a strip chart recorder. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the sample is quantified by calibrating with a standard gas of known [[carbon dioxide]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Titrimetry ====
[[Titrimetry]] is another method of measuring atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] that was first used by a Scandinavian group at 15 different [[Ground station|ground stations.]] They began passing a 100.0 mL air sample through a solution of [[barium hydroxide]] containing [[cresolphthalein]] indicator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methane gas monitoring ===

==== Differential absorption lidar ====
Range-resolved infrared [[differential absorption lidar]] (DIAL) is a means of measuring [[methane emissions]] from various sources, including active and closed landfill sites.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innocenti|first=Fabrizio|last2=Robinson|first2=Rod|last3=Gardiner|first3=Tom|last4=Finlayson|first4=Andrew|last5=Connor|first5=Andy|date=2017|title=Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Measurements of Landfill Methane Emissions|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/953|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=953|doi=10.3390/rs9090953|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Differential absorption lidar|DIAL]] takes vertical scans above [[methane]] sources and then spatially separates the scans to accurately measure the [[methane emissions]] from individual sources. Measuring [[methane emissions]] is a crucial aspect of [[climate change research]], as methane is among the most impactful gaseous [[hydrocarbon]] species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Nitrous oxide monitoring ===

====Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is one of the most prominent [[Anthropogenic climate change|anthropogenic]] [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheese|first=Patrick E.|last2=Walker|first2=Kaley A.|last3=Boone|first3=Chris D.|last4=Bernath|first4=Peter F.|last5=Funke|first5=Bernd|date=2016|title=Nitrous oxide in the atmosphere: First measurements of a lower thermospheric source|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067353|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2866–2872|doi=10.1002/2015gl067353|issn=0094-8276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released into the atmosphere primarily through natural sources such as soil and rock, as well as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] process like farming. Atmospheric [[nitrous oxide]] is also created in the atmosphere as a product of a reaction between nitrogen and electronically excited [[ozone]] in the lower [[thermosphere]].

The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer ([[ACE-FTS]]) is a tool used for measuring [[nitrous oxide]] concentrations in the upper to lower [[troposphere]]. This instrument, which is attached to the Canadian satellite [[SCISAT-1|SCISAT]], has shown that [[nitrous oxide]] is present throughout the entire atmosphere during all seasons, primarily due to energetic particle precipitation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Measurements taken by the instrument show that different reactions create [[nitrous oxide]] in the lower thermosphere than in the mid to upper [[mesosphere]].  The [[ACE-FTS]] is a crucial resource in predicting future [[ozone depletion]] in the upper stratosphere by comparing the different ways in which [[nitrous oxide]] is released into the atmosphere. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Satellite monitoring ==

=== Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO, OCO-2, OCO-3) ===
The [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] (OCO) was first launched in February of 2009 but was lost due to launch failure.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/oco.htm|title=OCO 1, 2 (ESSP 5)|website=space.skyrocket.de|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Satellite]] was launched again in 2014, this time called the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2]], with an estimated lifespan of about two years.  The apparatus uses [[Spectrometer|spectrometers]] to take 24 [[carbon dioxide]] concentration measurements per second of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/1060/nasas-oco-2-brings-sharp-new-focus-on-global-carbon/|title=NASA's OCO-2 brings sharp new focus on global carbon – Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|last=Team|first=By Carol Rasmussen, NASA Earth Science News|work=Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurements taken by [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2|OCO-2]] can be used for [[Atmospheric models|global atmospheric models]] and will allow scientists to locate [[Carbon source|carbon sources]] when its data is paired with [[Prevailing winds|wind patterns]]. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 is ready to be launched in 2018 and will stands alone on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSat) ===
[[Satellite]] observations provides accurate readings of carbon dioxide and methane [[gas]] concentrations for short-term and long-term purposes in order to detect changes over time. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/fulltext.cfm?uri=ao-48-35-6716&amp;id=190794|title=Thermal and near infrared sensor for carbon observation Fourier-transform spectrometer on the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite for greenhouse gases monitoring|last=Kuze, Akihiko; Suto, Hiroshi; Nakajima, Masakatsu; Hamazaki, Takashi|first=|date=|website=www.osapublishing.org|doi=10.1364/AO.48.006716|issn=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of this [[satellite]], released in January of 2009, is to monitor both [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane gas]] in the atmosphere, and to identify their sources.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[GOSAT|GOSat]] is a project of three main entities: the [[JAXA|Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] (MOE), and the [[National Institute for Environmental Studies]] (NIES).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Ground stations ==

=== Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) ===
[[Integrated Carbon Observation System|The Integrated Carbon Observation System]] was established in October 2015 in [[Helsinki|Helsinki, Finland]] as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium|European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC)]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2015/2097/oj/eng|title=Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2015/2097 of 26 October 2015 on setting up the Integrated Carbon Observation System European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ICOS ERIC)|last=|first=|date=26 October 2018|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=english|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main task of [[Integrated Carbon Observation System|ICOS]] is to establish an Integrated Carbon Observation System Research Infrastructure (ICOS RI) that facilitates research on [[greenhouse gas emissions]], [[Sinks, Sources,and Reservoirs|sinks]], and their causes. The [[Integrated Carbon Observation System|ICOS ERIC]] strives to link its own research with other [[greenhouse gas emissions]] research to produce coherent [[data]] products and to promote [[education]] and [[innovation]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9249">A '''hyperaccumulator''' is a plant capable of growing in soils with very high concentrations of [[metal]]s, absorbing these metals through their roots, and concentrating extremely high levels of metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Rascio&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rascio|first=Nicoletta|author2=Navari-Izzo, Flavia|title=Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: How and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?|journal=Plant Science|date=1 February 2011|volume=180|issue=2|pages=169–181|doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2010.08.016|pmid=21421358}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metals are concentrated at levels that are [[Phytotoxin|toxic]] to closely related species not adapted to growing on the metalliferous soils. Compared to non-hyperaccumulating species, hyperaccumulator roots extract the metal from the soil at a higher rate, transfer it more quickly to their shoots, and store large amounts in leaves and roots.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hossner|first=L.R.|author2=Loeppert, R.H. |author3=Newton, R.J. |author4=Szaniszlo, P.J. |title=Literature review: Phytoaccumulation of chromium, uranium, and plutonium in plant systems|journal=Amarillo National Resource Center for Plutonium, TX (United States) Technical Report|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to hyperaccumulate toxic metals compared to related species has been shown to be due to differential [[gene expression]] and [[gene regulation|regulation]] of the same [[gene]]s in both plants.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt; Over 500 species of [[flowering plant]]s have been identified as having the ability to hyperaccumulate metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Sarma&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarma|first=Hemen|title=Metal hyperaccumuulation in plants: A Review focusing on phytoremediation technology|journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Technology|year=2011|volume=4|issue=2|pages=118–138|doi=10.3923/jest.2011.118.138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyperaccumulating plants hold interest for their ability to extract metals from the soils of contaminated sites ([[phytoremediation]]) to return the ecosystem to a less toxic state. The plants also hold potential to be used to mine metals from soils with very high concentrations ([[phytomining]]) by growing the plants then harvesting them for the metals in their tissues.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;

The genetic advantage of hyperaccumulation of metals may be that the toxic levels of heavy metals in leaves deter [[herbivore]]s or increase the toxicity of other anti-herbivory metabolites.&lt;ref name=Rascio /&gt;

==Genetic basis==

Several gene families are involved in the processes of hyperaccumulation including upregulation of absorption and sequestration of heavy metal metals.&lt;ref name="Rascio, Nicoletta 2011"&gt;Rascio, Nicoletta, and Flavia Navari-Izzo. "Heavy metal hyperaccumulating plants: how and why do they do it? And what makes them so interesting?." Plant science 180.2 (2011): 169-181.&lt;/ref&gt; These hyperaccumulation genes (HA genes) are found in over 450 plant species, including the model organisms ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' and [[Brassicaceae]]. The expression of such genes is used to determine whether a species is capable of hyperaccumulation.  Expression of HA genes provides the plant with capacity to uptake and sequester metals such as As, Co, Fe, Cu, Cd, Pb, Hg, Se, Mn, Zn, Mo and Ni in 100–1000x the concentration found in sister species or populations.&lt;ref name="C. Pagliano, 2006 pp. 70"&gt;C. Pagliano, et al. Evidence for PSII-donor-side damage and photoinhibition induced by cadmium treatment on rice (Oryza sativa L.)J. Photochem. Photobiol. B: Biol., 84 (2006), pp. 70–78&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity for hyperaccumulation is dependent on two major factors: environmental exposure and expression of members of the ZIP gene family.
Although experiments have shown that the hyperaccumulation is partially dependent on environmental exposure (i.e. only plants exposed to a metal are observed with high concentrations of that metal), hyperaccumulation is ultimately dependent on the presence and upregulation of genes involved with that process. It has been shown that hyperaccumulation capacities can be inherited in ''[[Thlaspi caerulescens]]'' (Brassicaceae) and others. As there is wide variety among hyperaccumulating species that span across different plant families, it is likely that HA genes were ecotypically selected for. 
In most hyperaccumulating plants, the main mechanism for metal transport are the proteins coded by genes in the ZIP family, however other families such as the HMA, MATE, YSL and MTP families have also been observed to be involved. The ZIP gene family is a novel, plant-specific gene family that encodes Cd, Mn, Fe and Zn transporters. The ZIP family plays a role in supplying Zn to metalloproteins.&lt;ref name="Poschenrieder C. 2006"&gt;Poschenrieder C., Tolrá R., Barceló J. (2006). Can metals defend plants against biotic stress? Trends Plant Sci. 11 288–295 &lt;/ref&gt;

In one study on ''Arabidopsis'', it was found that the metallophyte ''[[Arabidopsis halleri]]'' expressed a member of the ZIP family that was not expressed in a non-metallophytic sister species. This gene was an iron regulated transporter (IRT-protein) that encoded several primary transporters involved with cellular uptake of cations above the concentration gradient. When this gene was transformed into yeast, hyperaccumulation was observed.&lt;ref name="Becher, Martina 2004"&gt;Becher, Martina, et al. "Cross‐species microarray transcript profiling reveals high constitutive expression of metal homeostasis genes in shoots of the zinc hyperaccumulator ''Arabidopsis halleri''." The Plant Journal 37.2 (2004): 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that overexpression of ZIP family genes that encode cation transporters is a characteristic genetic feature of hyperaccumulation. 
Another gene family that has been observed ubiquitously in hyperaccumulators are the ZTP and ZNT families. A study on T. caerulescens identified the ZTP family as a plant specific family with high sequence similarity to other zinc transporter4. Both the ZTP and ZNT families, like the ZIP family, are zinc transporters.&lt;ref name="Persans, Michael W. 2001"&gt;Persans, Michael W., Ken Nieman, and David E. Salt. "Functional activity and role of cation-efflux family members in Ni hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi goesingense." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 98.17 (2001): 9995-10000&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in hyperaccumulating species, that these genes, specifically ZNT1 and ZNT2 alleles are chronically overexpressed.&lt;ref name="Assunção, A. G. L. 2001"&gt;Assunção, A. G. L., et al. "Elevated expression of metal transporter genes in three accessions of the metal hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens." Plant, Cell &amp; Environment 24.2 (2001): 217-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the exact mechanism by which these genes facilitate hyperaccumulation is not yet characterized, expression patterns correlate heavily with individual hyperaccumulation capacity and metal exposure, suggesting these gene families play a regulatory role.  As the presence and expression zinc transporter gene families are highly prevalent in hyperaccumulators, the capacity to accumulate a wide range of heavy metals is likely due to an inability of the zinc transporters to discriminate against certain metal ions. The response of the plants to hyperaccumulation of any metal also supports this theory as it has been observed that AhHMHA3 is expressed in hyperaccumulating individuals. AhHMHA3 has been identified to be expressed in response to and aid of Zn detoxification.&lt;ref name="C. Pagliano, 2006 pp. 70"/&gt; In another study, using metallophytic and non-metallophytic ''Arabidopsis'' populations, back crosses indicated [[pleiotropy]] between Cd and Zn tolerances.&lt;ref name="Bert, V. 2003"&gt;Bert, V., Meerts, P., Saumitou-Laprade, P. et al. Plant and Soil (2003) 249: 9. doi:10.1023/A:1022580325301&lt;/ref&gt;  This response suggests that plants are unable to detect specific metals, and that hyperaccumulation is likely a result of an overexpressed Zn transportation system.&lt;ref name="Pollard, A. J 1996"&gt;Pollard, A. J. and BAKER, A. J.M. (1996), Quantitative genetics of zinc hyperaccumulation in Thlaspi caerulescens. New Phytologist, 132: 113–118. doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.1996.tb04515.x&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall effect of these expression patterns has been hypothesized to assist in plant defense systems. In one hypothesis, "the elemental defense hypothesis", provided by Poschenrieder, it is suggested that the expression of these genes assist in [[antiherbivory]] or pathogen defenses by making tissues toxic to organisms attempting to feed on that plant.&lt;ref name="Poschenrieder C. 2006"/&gt; Another hypothesis, "the joint hypothesis", provided by Boyd, suggests that expression of these genes assists in systemic defense.&lt;ref name="Boyd R. S. 2012"&gt;Boyd R. S. (2012). Plant defense using toxic inorganic ions: conceptual models of the defensive enhancement and joint effects hypotheses.

'''Institute of Psychology''' of the [[University of Szeged]], [[Szeged]], Hungary, is located at 2 Egyetem Street, at the Szeged University Campus of the Faculty of Arts. The Institute of Psychology in Szeged is the longest-standing psychology institute in Hungary (founded on 18 December 1929).&lt;ref&gt;The first, earliest university was the [[University of Budapest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Institute provides a three-year Psychology Bachelor of Arts (BA) training, followed by a two-year Master of Arts (MA) course in two possible majors: Cognitive and Neuropsychology, or Counseling and Educational Psychology.

== The beginnings (1872-1919) ==
The legal predecessor of the University of Szeged was the University of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (Kolozsvár) ([[Franz Joseph University]]), which was founded in 1872 by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] as the second university in Hungary of that time.&lt;ref&gt;The name of the second Hungarian university founded in 1872 was University of Cluj-Napoca, from 1882 was called Franz Joseph Royal Hungarian University.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology-oriented studies existed from the earliest days, but were taught by professors of Philosophy and Pedagogy. Psychology was first recognized as a separate subject by Professor Imre Sándor at the University of Szeged.

== The beginnings of psychology education in Szeged (1921-1929) ==
[[File:Bölcsészettudományi Kar Szeged Bejárat3xxx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Faculty of Arts, [[University of Szeged]]]]
[[File:Sándor Imre (1877-1945) pedagogue.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Sándor Imre (1877&amp;ndash;1945) pedagogue]]
By 1919, the turmoils of history forced the University of Cluj-Napoca to relocate, and in 1921, the Hungarian National Assembly (according to the terms of Act XXV of 1921) designated the town of Szeged as the temporary location of the university. The former campus site was the Neo-Renaissance building in Szeged's Dugonics Square, originally built as a secondary school for modern languages and sciences in 1873. From 1925, the Faculty of Arts and part of the Faculty of Sciences were moved to the Neo-Roman building at 2 Egyetem Street, formerly a railway discount broker's office. The three-story building was built in 1912, according to the plans of Ottoway István and Winkler Imre.&lt;ref&gt;Péter, L. (1981). Panorama, pg. 138. Szeged : {{ISBN|963-243-186-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology was first recognized as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized that the study of psychology is just as important as that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university for the establishment of a fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.

== Psychology education between 1929 and 1940 ==

[[File:Várkonyi Hildebrand Dezső.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Dezső Hildebrand Várkonyi]]&lt;br&gt;(1888&amp;ndash;1971)]]

In 1929, the establishment of the Second Department of Pedagogy and Psychology was brought about by lucky circumstances, given that the petition of Imre Sándor and György Málnási Bartók would not have been sufficient by itself. At the University of Szeged, which had been relocated from Cluj-Napoca, the Faculty of Arts had a very low number of attending students, which threatened the very existence of the university. In the fall of 1928, to aid the foundering university, the Minister of Culture, Kuno Klebelsberg, ordered the relocation of the Paedagogum and the academic section of Erzsébet Girls’ School to Szeged. Thus, the Teacher Training College for secular elementary schools was founded. As part of their curriculum, students of the college had to complete a part of their training – essentially one of the two compulsory majors – at the university, hence boosting the number of students there. At the same time, the Minister abrogated secular teacher training at nun schools, which meant that nuns also had to attend the University of Szeged to receive such training.

Kuno Klebelsberg himself did not consider religion an important factor in university appointments. However, under the pressure of Catholic bishops, he founded separate Catholic departments. Thus, the first head of the Second Department of Philosophy was János Mester (1879–1954), a Catholic professor, while the First Department of Philosophy was led by the Protestant György Málnási Bartók. Likewise, the Second Department of Literature and the Second Department of Pedagogy and Psychology were founded with the leaderships of Catholic professor Sándor Sík and Dezső Várkonyi Hildebrand from the Benedictine Order respectively, on the other hand, the Protestant First Department of Literature and the First Department of Pedagogy and Psychology were led by Lajos Dézsi and Sándor Imre respectively. A very useful followed. Both Dezső Várkonyi Hildebrand and Sándor Sík were excellent educators at the university and besides Philosophy, János Mester also engaged himself in studies of Psychology and Pedagogy.

On 18 December 1929, [[Dezső Hildebrand Várkonyi]], a [[Benedictine monk]] was appointed as the Head of the Independent Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology. His appointment brought changes to the education at the University of Szeged. In Hungary, such an Independent Institute of Pedagogy and Psychology was founded in Szeged for the first time, only later to be followed by the establishment of the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Budapest]], under the supervision of [[Pál Schiller Harkai]] in 1936.

Following the appointment of Várkonyi, psychology training at the University of Szeged could developed further, primarily focusing on the mainstream Psychology of that time, namely on questions of Paedology, Developmental Psychology and Educational Psychology.

Várkonyi introduced more modern fields of Psychology, including the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]] and [[Jean Piaget]]. According to the recollections of his students, his lectures sometimes deviated from the formal rhetorical style and took on a more familiar character.

In the 1930s, István Boda, a Privatdocent at the University, held a series of lectures on the survey of the intellectuals, and the practical psychology of self-development.

The year 1940 brought another change in the life of the Institute and the university itself. Following the re-annexation of Northern Transylvania, the Franz Joseph University of Sciences was relocated back to [[Cluj-Napoca]], together with the majority of its teachers, Dezső Várkonyi Hildenbrand among them.

== Psychology education at Horthy Miklós University of Sciences ==
[[File:Pál Cecil Bognár (1883-1967) psychologist.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Pál Cecil Bognár (1883&amp;ndash;1967) psychologist]]
In 1940, a new university was founded in Szeged, named after [[Horthy Miklós]]. The Institute of Psychology was established in 1941, as a new unit, with the Bendectine Pál Bognár Cecil – well known in the scientific circles of the time - appointed as Head of Institute.

Cecil Bognár's work at the Institute was focused on Child Psychology and Educational Science; in his publications, he primarily examined the idiosyncrasies of primary school children, and the issues of child personality types.

== The decades following World War II ==
[[File:Béla Tettamanti (1884-1959) pedagogue and psychologist.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Béla Tettamanti (1884&amp;ndash;1959)]]

Following the retirement of Cecil Bognár, the Institute of Psychology was incorporated into the Institute of Education and Psychology, in the academic year of 1950-1951. It was led by the university's former Privatdocent, Béla Tettamanti (1884–1959).

It is important to note that the amount of Psychology in the curriculum was reduced in the 1950s, mainly due to political reasons. It was taught at a rate of merely two lectures per week, and only the study of General Psychology was allowed. This was due to the influence of high Party echelons, who disapproved of Psychology. Psychology, together with [[Sociology]], was claimed to be seditionary and counter-ideological, and was generally thought of as a media of bourgeois ideology. Thus, under the leadership of Béla Tettamanti, the only possible approach for the Institute was to mimic the Soviet example, and teach in accordance with the ideology prescribed by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. 
[[File:Duró Lajos pedagógus, pszichológus.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Lajos Duró leadership (1970&amp;ndash;1990)]]
In 1959, Béla Tettamanti was replaced by the new director of the Institute of Education and Psychology, György Ágoston. Ágoston presented the Marxist pedagogy, nearly eliminated the teaching of mainstream psychology. György Ágoston directed the Institute of Education and Psychology from 1959 to 1970 and the Department of Education between 1970 and 1. January 1990.

== The restitution of psychology ==
[[File:Ferenc Erős psychologist11.jpg|thumb|right|90px|Ferenc Erős leadership 1992&amp;ndash;1994]]

[[File:Szokolszky Ágnes pszichológus, habiltált egyetemi docens, intézetvezető.jpg|thumb|right|90px|[[Ágnes Szokolszky]]&lt;br&gt;Director of Institute of Pschychology]]
The Department of Psychology became independent from other disciplines in 1970, under the leadership of Lajos Dúró, until 1990. During that period, research and tuition was mainly focused on Educational and Developmental Psychology.

In the early 1990s, the Faculty of Arts of the [[University of Szeged|József Attila University of Sciences]] called for the reorganization of its departments as institutes. As a result, the Department of Education and the Department of Psychology were merged as the Institute of Education and Psychology.

Under Vajda Zsuzsanna's leadership, Psychology was made available as a major from the academic year 1996/1997; initially under the aegis of the Institute of Psychology (director: Zoltán Kovács) of the Kossuth Lajos University of Sciences (now [[University of Debrecen]]).

The founding father of the independent Psychology major, available from the turn of the millennium, is Professor [[Csaba Pléh]], member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who organized the Cognitive Science Group at the Department of Psychology, and in 1999, started the [[Cognitive Science and Neuropsychology Program of Szeged]], or in short, the Cognitive Program. He laid the foundation for a professional psychology training course at the University of Szeged. [[Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical University|The university's Medical Faculty]] and the Cognitive Science Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/szegedkognitiv/english Cognitiv Science Group, Szeged]&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Csaba Pléh]], organized the VIII. Conference of the Hungarian Cognitive Science Association (MAKOG),&lt;ref&gt;[http://phil.elte.hu/MAKOG2009/ Cognitive Science Association Conferences, I-XVII. (1993-2009.)]&lt;/ref&gt; titled The Development and Disorders of Cognitive Functions for 4–6 February 2000 in Szeged.

From 1 September 1999, the independent Department of Psychology functioned as an independent department at the József Attila University of Sciences (now [[University of Szeged]]).

As possibly a final chapter in the long and strife-filled history of Psychology tuition and research in Szeged, Psychology training is again in operation within the Institute of Psychology. The Head of the Institute – and formerly Head of the Department of Psychology – is Associate Professor [[Ágnes Szokolszky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kognit.edpsy.u-szeged.hu/szokolszky/ Homepage of Ágnes Szokolszky] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923234145/http://kognit.edpsy.u-szeged.hu/szokolszky/ |date=2009-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2008, the Institute was moved to a new location, into a recently renovated wing of the Faculty of Arts. Currently there are three research laboratories on the premises:

* The Kardos Lajos&lt;ref&gt;Kardos Lajos (1890-1985) doctor, psychologist, professor of Eötvös Lóránd University. He made achievements in the field of perception studies (phenomenon of constancy). Hungarian Biographical Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory of Cognitive Sciences
* The Grastyán Endre&lt;ref&gt;. Grastyán Endre (1924-1988) neurophysiologist, professor, Correspondent Member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Head of the Physiological Institute of the Pécs Medical University. Hungarian Biographical Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; EEG Laboratory
* [[Ferenc Mérei|Mérei Ferenc]] Behavior Analysis Laboratory (a reference laboratory of Noldus Information Technology)

== The Institute of Psychology today ==

[[István Winkler]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogpsyphy.hu/~iwinkler/ Homepage of István Winkler.]&lt;/ref&gt; is Professor of Psychology at Institute of Psychology, University of Szeged from 2008. He's the Head of the Department of General Psychology, Institute for 
Psychology, [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].
[[File:István Winkler psychologist.JPG|thumb|right|90px|[[István Winkler]] (1958-)]]
The institute has strong ties to the international Psychology mainstream, as is proven by the lectures given by visiting professors and the large number of students spending months at foreign universities on Erasmus grants.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note too the American spellings of '''integrated assessment modeling''' and '''integrated modeling'''.}} is a type of [[scientific modelling]] often used by the [[environmental sciences]] and [[environmental policy]] analysis. The modelling is '''integrated''' because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as '''assessment''' because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated assessment modelling is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical '''models'''.

Integrated assessment modelling has a long history, and scholars disagree on the first precedent. However, it became recognizable as a sub- or inter-discipline in the late 1980s with a focus on understanding and regulating [[acid rain|acidification]]. Integrated assessment modelling was further developed in the area of [[climate change]], inter alias in the context of the [[Energy Modeling Forum]].

Notable centres of integrated assessment modelling are [[IIASA]], [[MIT]], [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]], and [[International Futures]]. Notable scholars are [[Barry B. Hughes]], [[William Nordhaus|Bill Nordhaus]], [[Robert O. Mendelsohn|Robert Mendelsohn]], [[Richard G. Richels|Rich Richels]], [[Michael Schlesinger]], [[Stephen Schneider]], [[Richard Tol]], [[John Weyant]], and [[Gary Yohe]].

== Interpretation ==

While the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) relies heavily on integrated modeling, [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] lead author Thomas Bruckner cautions against overinterpreting the results from such modeling.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  With regard to future technology choice, Bruckner observes that "The ''quantitative deployment'' of [[nuclear power]] or [[Carbon capture and storage|CCS]] technologies that has been found by the IPCC authors in the different mitigation scenarios, for instance, occasionally has been (mis)interpreted as an IPCC ''recommendation for their factual usage''."&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}{{nnbsp}}{{rp|at=emphasis per original}}  Bruckner continues "The scale of deployment of low-carbon technologies shown in [IPCC] diagrams{{nbsp}}... reveals neither the ''possible contribution'' of the respective energy technology to GHG mitigation nor the ''required contribution''.{{nbsp}}... The possible contribution (without considering costs) might be higher whereas the strictly required one could be lower.&lt;ref name="bruckner-2016"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

== Criticism ==

Economist [[Robert Pindyck]] argues that IAMs are problematic and "close to useless as tools for policy analysis". He argues that "IAM-based analyses of [[Climate change policy of the United States|climate policy]] create a perception of knowledge and precision that is illusory, and can fool policy-makers into thinking that the forecasts the models generate have some kind of scientific legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert S. |last1=Pindyck |title=The Use and Misuse of Models for Climate Policy |journal=Review of Environmental Economics and Policy |volume=11 |issue=1 |year=2017 |pages=100–114 |doi=10.1093/reep/rew012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irrumatio''' is a form of oral sex where a man [[pelvic thrust|thrusts]] his [[penis]] into someone else's mouth, in contrast to ''fellatio'' where the penis is being actively orally excited by a fellator. The difference lies mainly in which party takes the active part. By extension, ''irrumatio'' can also refer to the sexual technique of thrusting the penis between the thighs of a partner ([[intercrural sex]]), or between the [[abdomen|abdomens]] of two men.&lt;ref name="SL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/irrumatio|title=irrumatio in Sex-Lexis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Latin erotic terminology actually distinguishes two acts. First, ''fellation'', in which the man’s penis is orally excited by the fellator. Second, ''irrumation'', in which the man (the irrumator)&amp;nbsp;... engages in motions by moving his hips and body in a rhythm of his own choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=G.|first=Legman|title=[[Oragenitalism]]: Oral Techniques in Genital Excitation|publisher=The Julian Press|year=1969|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Latin]] synonym for "irrumator" is ''labda'' (Varr. ap. Non. 70,11; Aus. Epigr. 126).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis &amp; Charles Short : ''A Latin Dictionary''. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press. (s.v {{Clarify|date=December 2012}} "2. labda").&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|ancient Roman sexual vocabulary]], ''irrumatio'' is strictly a form of [[oral rape]] (''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|os impurum]]''), in which a man forces his penis into someone else's mouth, almost always that of another man.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "The Meaning of irrumare in Catullus and Martial", Classical Philology 76.1 (1981) 40–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and history ==
{{originalresearch|section|date=May 2016}}
The [[English language|English]] noun ''irrumatio'' or ''irrumation'' and verb ''irrumate'' come from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|irrumare}}'', to force receptive male oral sex.&lt;ref name="Whitaker irrumare"&gt;[http://archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=irrumatio Whitaker's Words: irrumatio]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=269544|title=Richlin, A.  1981.  "The Meaning of Irrumare in Catullus and Martial".  ''Classical Philology'' 76 (1): 40–46.  Link to preview available from the WWW.|pages=40–46|last1=Richlin|first1=A.|volume=76|issue=1|journal=Classical Philology|year=1981|doi=10.1086/366597}}&lt;/ref&gt;  J.&amp;nbsp;L. Butrica, in his review of R.&amp;nbsp;W. Hooper's edition of ''The Priapus Poems'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-02-23.html|title=Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2000.02.23|last=James L. Butrica|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[text corpus|corpus]] of poems known as ''[[Priapeia]]'' in Latin, states that "some [[Roman Empire|Roman]] sexual practices, like ''irrumatio'', lack simple English equivalents".&lt;ref name="."&gt;{{cite book|last=Richard W. Hooper (ed. {{Clarify|date=December 2012}})|title=The Priapus Poems|publisher=Urbana and Chicago, IL, University of Illinois Press|year=1999|isbn=0-252-06752-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some conjecture among linguists, as yet unresolved, that ''irrŭmātio'' may be connected with the Latin word ''rūmen, rūminis'', the throat and gullet, whence 'ruminate', to chew the cud, therefore meaning 'insertion into the throat'. Others&lt;ref&gt;Adams (1982), ''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; connect it with ''rūma'' or ''rūmis'', an obsolete word for a teat, hence it would mean "giving milk", "giving to suck". (Compare the word ''fellō'', which literally meant "suck (milk)" before it acquired its sexual sense.)

As the [[quotation]] from Butrica suggests and an article by W.&amp;nbsp;A. Krenkel shows, ''irrumatio'' was a distinct sexual practice in ancient Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krenkel, W.&amp;nbsp;A.|title="Fellatio and Irrumatio" in W.&amp;nbsp;Bernard and C.&amp;nbsp;Reitz (eds.).

N. Adams states that "it was a standard joke to speak of ''irrumatio'' as a means of silencing someone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams, J.&amp;nbsp;N.|title=''The Latin Sexual Vocabulary''|publisher=Baltimore|year=1982|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Os impurum|Oral sex]] was considered to be an act of defilement: the mouth had a particularly defined role as the organ of oratory, as in [[Greece]], to participate in the central public sphere, where discursive powers were of great importance. Thus, to penetrate the mouth could be taken to be a sign of massive power differential within a relationship. [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Erotic art from Pompeii]] depicts ''irrumatio'' along with ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male–female sex|fututio]]'', [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Cunnilingus and fellatio|fellatio and cunnilingus]], and ''[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Anal sex|pedicatio]]'' or anal sex.&lt;ref name="Pomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |title=Roman Sex ?C Hot Sex from the Frescos in Pompeii |last=Tarkovsky, S. |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094859/http://www.focusarticle.com/children/article349.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extant wall paintings depicting explicit sex often appear to be in bathhouses and brothels, and oral sex was something usually practiced with [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitutes]] because of their lowly status.
Craig A. Williams argues that ''irrumatio'' was regarded as a degrading act, even more so than anal rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams, C.&amp;nbsp;A.|title=''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity''|publisher=Oxford:  Oxford University Press:|year=1999|pages=331}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.&amp;nbsp;Tarkovsky states that, despite being popular, it was thought to be a hostile act, "taken directly from the Greek, whereby the Greek men would have to force the fellatio by violence".&lt;ref name="Pomp"/&gt; Furthermore, as A.&amp;nbsp;Richlin has shown in an article in the ''[[Journal of the History of Sexuality]]'', it was also accepted as "oral [[rape]]", a [[punitive]] act against [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3704392|title=Preview of "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the Cinaedus and the Roman Law against Love between Men"|pages=523–573|last1=Richlin|first1=A.|volume=3|issue=4|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catullus]] threatens two friends who have insulted him with both ''irrumatio'' and ''pedicatio'' in his [[Catullus 16|''Carmen'' 16]], although the use could also mean "go to hell," rather than being a literal threat. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Micaela Wakil Janan|title=When the Lamp Is Shattered: Desire and Narrative in Catullus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gG9Zcc6aeUC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=26 May 2016|date=18 January 1994|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-1765-3|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern English, the term "fellatio" has expanded to incorporate ''irrumatio'', and the latter has fallen out of widespread use. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sex-lexis.com/Sex-Dictionary/fellatio|title="Fellatio" in Sex-Lewis|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''irrumatio'' might today be called "forced fellatio" or "oral rape". The concept remains in more vulgar expressions like ''face-fuck'' and ''skull-fuck''.

Another synonym for ''irrumatio'' is ''Egyptian rape'' or simply ''Egyptian''; this goes back to the time of the [[Crusades]] when [[Mamluk]]s were alleged to force their Christian captives to do this.&lt;ref&gt;Edwardes, Allen; Masters, Robert E. L. ''The cradle of erotica'', New York: Julian Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2016}}

'''Issue advocacy ads''' (also known as '''interest advocacy ads''' or '''issue only ads''') are communications intended to bring awareness to a certain problem.  Groups that sponsor this form of communication are known by several names including: [[Advocacy group|interest advocacy group, issue advocacy group, issue only group, or special interest group]].  The problems these groups raise awareness of can be either a social or political issue.

==Interest versus express advocacy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The bright-line test doesn't cover forms of communication that are indirect or debatable.  Consider this message to voters:

*''If you like candidate X, you need to know he did Y.''

In a communication like this, there is no mention about voting, however, the plain intention is to cast doubt on voters that supported candidate X.  

Campaigning like this is typically called [[negative campaigning]], making attack ads, or making thinly veiled promotional ads on the behalf of the candidate.

===Interest advocacy===
Interest advocacy is the act of making generalized communication regarding a public issue or problem without advocating voters to take a specific action at the election booth.&lt;ref name="moritz"&gt;[http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part3/campaign_finance_fed_glossary.html by Michelle Robinson, Section 3.1 - Campaign finance, Subsection 3.1.1 Federal law, Glossary of term, Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of a pure "issue only ads" made by interest advocacy groups is difficult.  Groups that sponsored messages needed to make it clear, to a voter with [[reasonable person|reasonable intelligence]], that the voter should cast their ballot in a manner the group wanted.

Keeping an advertisement issue important to only groups like [[501(c)(3)]] non-profits. They were subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. Organizations can participate in nonpartisan voter education efforts, including registration and "get-out-the-vote" drives and issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="Elacqua"&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on 501(c)(3) organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, p. 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Express advocacy===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Express advocacy is largely used in connection with a debate in the US regarding when issue advocacy turns into [[political campaign|campaigning]]. 

Many groups that made what appeared to most to be campaign advertisements claimed that their communications to voters were really issue advocacy and not express advocacy. To help understand the difference, examine these two communications to voters: 

*''Select John Smith.''
*''Vote no! on Proposition 99.''

In both examples the message's intention is clear. Using a standard that looks for specific words or phrases in a communication is called conducting a [[bright-line]] test. Bright-line is a standard if there is no mistake.  One or more of the "[[Eight Magic Words]]" or their {{clarify|reason=definition?|text=equivalents|date=March 2016}} is present or not present.  

Express advocacy is associated with [[independent expenditure]]s.

===History===
In the 1970s, changes to regulations permitted non-candidate organizations to make [[independent expenditure]]s and use their money in election season. They could neither give it directly to a candidate nor make advertisement on a candidates behalf.  Typical expenditures were described as being "party building" and [[get out the vote]] campaigns. Organizations, especially non-profits were supposed to do it on a [[nonpartisan]] basis. However, groups tended to focus efforts on signing up and getting the type of voters to the polls that were most likely to hold similar views.

The only barrier stopping a group from campaigning directly for their favorite candidate or cause was something called the "reasonable person" test: if a reasonable person, viewing the communication, comes to the conclusion the sponsor wants them to vote in one way, it is express advocacy, not interest advocacy.&lt;ref name="BlueRibbon"&gt;[http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm Governor’s Blue-Ribbon Commission on campaign finance reform for State of Wisconsin, Final Report, Section 5. Level the playing field, Promoting freedom of speech, paragraph 3-6, Chairman Donald F. Kettl, May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209063419/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One problem with the reasonable person test is it is not definitive or a [[bright-line rule]].  There was no clear line that clearly stated if you cross this point you are on the wrong side. In an attempt to help the situation, in 1976 a footnote was included in a US Supreme Court ruling provided eight examples.&lt;ref name="BuckleyValeo"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Buckley v. Valeo |last=Smith |first=Craig R. |title=Free Speech on Trial: Communication Perspectives on Landmark Supreme Court Decisions |editor=Parker, Richard A. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-1301-X |pages=203&amp;ndash;217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, rather than using them as examples, many found it easier to just leave out the "magic words" and claim their communications to voters were fine. By 1996, interest advocacy groups were spending millions of dollars on campaigns claiming their advertisements were "issue only" since they left out the "magic words."

By 2000, voters were inundated with $500 million worth of this type of advertisement.&lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~smpa/faculty/documents/Swift_Boat_Article_FALR_000.pdf Swift boat Vets in 2004: Press coverage of an independent campaign, First Amendment Law Review, University of North Carolina School of Law, Vol. 4, 2005, by Albert L. May, July 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the "shame issue ads," scandals, and the amount of spending, Congress held a congressional investigation.  It reinvigorated campaign finance reform, and led to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002, which is more commonly known as McCain-Feingold.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|75}}

In 2003, in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', the Court detailed the difference between interest versus express advocacy. It ruled looking for [[Eight Magic Words|"magic words"]] as "functionally meaningless" since an advertiser can communicate its intention to voters without them.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|15}} Therefore, instead of looking for words, the Court again ruled that if a communication to voters had  "no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for, or against, a specific candidate," it is "the functional equivalent of express advocacy."&lt;ref name="GSUlaw"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1878727 Has the tide turned in favor of disclosure? Revealing money in politics after Citizens United and Doe v. Reed, by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Georgia State University Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2011, July 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1092}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], "issue only" ads continued and some famous ones were made by a group called [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat]].  They claimed their advertisements were issue only ads, not express advocacy. According to at least one analyst, voters voted exactly how the sponsors intended and the advertisements "torpedoed" [[Massachusetts]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/wyly-brothers-republican-campaign-donations_n_664550.html "Wyly Brothers Gave Millions To Over 200 Republican Candidates"], ''The Huffington Post'', Marcus Baram, July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[political action committee]] [[Progress of America]], ran an advertisement that showed the horrors of terrorism and stated that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] want to kill American citizens. At the end, ot asked, "Would you trust Kerry against these killers?" "George Bush did not start this War, but he will end it." The "magic words" are missing.  

In 2007, the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' ruled that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. The test to tell the difference between interest and express advocacy remained the [[reasonable person]] test.

However, that is said to have created a difficulty. A test that requires someone to consider how a [[reasonable person]] views a communication to voters requires someone to decide. The only definitive answer comes from a judge and that takes time. Election commissions are not judges, but they can issue [[advisory opinion]] on the matter. That led to a concern that in federal elections, that officials at the [[Federal Election Commission]] and state-level commissions would have to do work. Anyone cautious, wanting to make sure the communication to voters, was interest and not express advocacy would contact it for an opinion.  Communications to voters covers a wide range of areas including advertisements, e-mails, signs, and even speeches on the pulpit might want to ask someone.  

To resolve this issue, the [[US Supreme Court]] looked back at a prior ruling. In 1976, in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', the Supreme Court held that one thing of key importance was protecting free speech. 

In 2010, ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''  determined, among other things, that it would be basically not possible for the federal government to be in the business of determining what does and does not constitute issue advocacy or express advocacy.

==Disclosure requirements==
In 2010, ''Citizens United'' "expressly rejected the contention that election-law disclosure requirements are limited to express
advocacy or its functional equivalent." While it and a subsequent case affected certain spending limitations, it did not permit those making the spending from evading disclosure requirements by claiming they were performing issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1091-1092}}

Also in 2010 in a case known as ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to keep signatures upon a referendum from voters, based upon a claim it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Lower courts are already applying these new standards to uphold a gamut of state disclosure laws ranging from ballot measures to candidate elections, and from express advocacy to issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1103}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1190">'''Kinemation''' was one of the first [[inverse kinematics]] packages for 3D [[computer animation]], created for [[Wavefront Technologies]]' package [[The Advanced Visualizer]] (TAV).  In 1995, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] described Kinemation as "a huge breakthrough in motion animation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The New Hollywood|author=Paula Parisi|journal=Wired|issue=12|volume=3|date=December 1995|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/new.hollywood_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was used  in the mid-1990s by companies such as [[Kleiser-Walczak Construction Company]] ([[Judge Dredd (film)|Judge Dredd]]).  Portions of Kinemation were disassembled and re-assembled into [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias-Wavefront]]'s flagship product [[Maya (software)|Maya]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">Obstetric complications are those complications that develop during pregnancy. A woman may develop an infection, syndrome or complication that is not unique to pregnancy and that may have existed before pregnancy. Pregnancy often is complicated by preexisting and concurrent conditions. Though these pre-existing and concurrent conditions may have great impact on pregnancy, they are not included in the following list.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">The '''Division of Ecological Restoration''' (DER) is a Division of the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game within the [[Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs|Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]]. DER was created in 2009 with the merger of the Riverways and Wetlands Restoration Programs. DER coordinates ecological restoration to improve ecological condition and to restore important [[ecosystem services]] that improve the quality of life for all Massachusetts citizens.

The Riverways Program ([https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter21a MGL Chapter 21A Section 8]) has been maintained within DER and coordinates outreach and technical assistance to support [[drainage divide|watershed]] conservation and protection.

The Division and partners facilitate capital-based projects including (but not limited to) dam removal and [[culvert]] replacement with the goal of restoring [[aquatic habitat]]s (e.g. salt marshes)
and ecosystems across the state. These projects support commercial and recreational fisheries and provide many other benefits such as reduced flooding, improved water quality, [[carbon sequestration]] and increased public safety.

Ecological restoration is a core component of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts efforts to build habitat resiliency to better allow fish and wildlife to adapt to climate change – including sea level rise, elevated water temperatures, and increased floods and periods of drought.

[[File:Logo Tagline MADFG.jpg|thumbnail|Division of Ecological Restoration seal]]

Tim Purinton currently serves as the Director of the Division of Ecological Restoration.

==Philosophy==
*DER espouses a comprehensive, holistic approach to restoration, that prioritizes ecosystems over habitats.
*DER places an emphasis on restoring ecological processes, rather than species specific habitats, focusing on implementation of restoration actions at a watershed scale.
*DER staff identifies the most detrimental stressors in the larger watershed context and coordinates restoration actions to improve conditions in partnership with local organizations.
*DER bases its programs on engaging and working with stakeholders in the communities to maximize impact and stewardship.

Later the mural crown developed into a symbol of European [[heraldry]], mostly for cities and towns, and in the 19th and 20th centuries was used in some [[republic|republican]] heraldry. 

==Usage in ancient times==
In [[Hellenistic]] culture, a mural crown identified [[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] such as the goddess [[Tyche]] (the embodiment of the fortune of a city, familiar to Romans as [[Fortuna]]), and [[Hestia]] (the embodiment of the protection of a city, familiar to Romans as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]). The high cylindrical ''[[polos]]'' of [[Cybele]] too could be rendered as a mural crown in Hellenistic times, specifically designating the [[mother goddess]] as patron of a city.&lt;ref&gt;The mural crown as an indicator of the personification of a city was thoroughly explored by: {{cite book| last = Allègre| first = Fernand| authorlink = Fernand Allègre| title = Étude sur la déesse grecque Tyché| place = Paris| year = 1889| pages = 187–92| language = French| url=https://archive.org/details/tudesurlades00alluoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural crown became an [[Roman military decorations and punishments|ancient Roman military decoration]]. The  ''corona muralis'' (Latin for "walled crown") was a [[gold]]en crown, or a circle of gold intended to resemble a [[battlement]], bestowed upon the [[soldier]] who first climbed the wall of a besieged [[city]] or [[fortress]] to successfully place the [[flag|standard]] of the attacking [[army]] upon it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Attici'', V.6.4; [[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', XXVI.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxfield1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie A. Maxfield|title=The Military Decorations of the Roman Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nuex2PW7QR0C&amp;pg=PA77|date=1 January 1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04499-9|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman mural crown was made of gold, and decorated with turrets,&lt;ref&gt;''muri pinnis'' according to Aulus Gellius&lt;/ref&gt; as is the heraldic version.  As it was among the highest order of military decorations, it was not awarded to a claimant until after a strict investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Livy. l.c.; cf. [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Augustus]] 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[rostrata]]'' mural crown, composed of the ''[[rostra]]'' indicative of captured ships, was assigned as naval prize to the first in a boarding party, similar to the [[naval crown]].

The Graeco-Roman goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]'s attributes on [[Greek coinage]] usually include her mural crown, signifying Rome's status as a loyal protector of [[Hellenic city-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, R., "The Goddess Roma" in Haase, W., Temporini, H., (eds), ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt'', de Gruyter, 1991, pp 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heraldic use ==
[[File:Corona muralis.svg|thumb|A heraldic mural crown]]
The Roman military decoration was subsequently employed in European [[heraldry]], where the term denoted a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] modeled after the walls of a [[castle]], which may be tinctured ''[[or (heraldry)|or]]'' (gold), ''[[argent]]'' (silver), ''[[gules]]'' (red), or ''proper'' (i.e. stone-coloured). In 19th-century Germany, mural crowns (''{{lang|de|Mauerkronen}}'') came to be adopted for the arms of cities, with increasingly specific details: "Residential (i.e. having a [[Residenz|''royal'' residence]]) cities and capital towns usually bear a ''{{lang|de|Mauerkrone}}'' with five towers, large towns one with four towers, smaller towns one with three", observed [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], in ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', adding "Strict regulations in the matter do not yet exist" and warning that the usage was not British.&lt;ref&gt;William Newton, ''Display of Heraldry'' (1846, p. 307) however, instances the crest of [[Viscount Beresford]], and notes examples supporting the crest "to be seen over the arms of many of the British officers who distinguished themselves in the [[Napoleonic Wars|late war]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} mural crowns were used, rather than royal crowns, for [[Medieval commune|medieval]] and modern [[Italy|Italian]] {{lang|it|[[comune|comuni]]}}. A mural-crowned lady, [[Italia Turrita]], personifies Italy. In Italy, {{lang|it|comuni}} and some provinces and military corps have mural crowns on their coats of arms: gold with five towers for cities, and silver with nine-towered for others. The coat of arms of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had a mural crown.

In the early 20th century [[Portugal]] established strict rules for its municipal heraldry, in which each coat of arms contains a mural crown, with three silver towers signifying a village or an urban parish, four silver towers representing a town, five silver towers standing for a city and five gold towers for a capital city. The Portuguese rules are also applied to most municipal coats of arms of [[Brazil]] and some other members of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].

[[Romania]]n municipal coats of arms contain a mural crown, with one or three towers for villages and communes, five and seven towers for towns and municipalities.

The eagle on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] wears a mural crown to signify its status as a republic. This is in contrast to the royal crowns that adorned the [[double-headed eagle]] (and the imperial crown positioned above it) in the [[coat of arms of Austria-Hungary]] until their defeat in [[World War I]]. The mural-crowned eagle was abandoned under the [[Clerical fascism|clerico-fascist]] [[Federal State of Austria]] from 1934, but was reinstated in [[Allied-occupied Austria]] following [[World War II]] and remains in place to this day.

'''Music psychology''', or the '''psychology of music''', may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |title=Music, Thought, and Feeling: Understanding the Psychology of Music, 2nd Edition |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=320 |isbn= 0195377079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]]. Music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], [[skill]], [[Performance science|performance]], [[intelligence]], [[creativity]], and [[social behavior]].

Music psychology can shed light on non-psychological aspects of [[musicology]] and musical practice. For example, it contributes to [[music theory]] through investigations of the [[perception]] and [[Cognitive musicology|computational modelling]] of musical structures such as [[melody]], [[harmony]], [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], [[Meter (music)|meter]], and [[Musical form|form]]. Research in [[music history]] can benefit from systematic study of the history of [[musical syntax]], or from psychological analyses of composers and compositions in relation to perceptual, affective, and social responses to their music. [[Ethnomusicology]] can benefit from psychological approaches to the study of [[Culture in music cognition|music cognition in different cultures]].

==History==

===Early history (pre-1860)===

The study of sound and musical phenomenon prior to the 19th century was focused primarily on the mathematical modelling of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Musical tone|tone]].&lt;ref name = Oxford1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Psychology of Music, History, Antiquity to the 19th century |encyclopedia = Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online |last = Deutsch |first = Diana |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42574pg1 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded experiments date from the 6th century BCE, most notably in the work of [[Pythagoras]] and his establishment of the simple string length ratios that formed the [[consonance]]s of the [[octave]].  This view that sound and music could be understood from a purely physical standpoint was echoed by such theorists as [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Boethius]]. An important early dissenter was [[Aristoxenus]], who foreshadowed modern music psychology in his view that music could only be understood through human perception and its relation to human memory. Despite his views, the majority of musical education through the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] remained rooted in the Pythagorean tradition, particularly through the [[quadrivium]] of [[astronomy]], [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], and [[music]].&lt;ref name = Oxford1 /&gt;

Research by [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (father of [[Galileo]]) demonstrated that, when string length was held constant, varying its tension, thickness, or composition could alter perceived pitch. From this he argued that simple ratios were not enough to account for musical phenomenon and that a perceptual approach was necessary. He also claimed that the differences between various tuning systems were not perceivable, thus the disputes were unnecessary. 
Study of topics including [[vibration]], [[consonance]], the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]], and [[Acoustic resonance|resonance]] were furthered through the [[scientific revolution]], including work by [[Galileo]], [[Kepler]], [[Mersenne]], and [[Descartes]]. This included further speculation concerning the nature of the sense organs and higher-order processes, particularly by [[Félix Savart|Savart]], [[Helmholtz]], and [[Rudolph Koenig|Koenig]].&lt;ref name = Oxford1 /&gt;

===Rise of empirical (1860–1960)===

[[Image:Helmholtz resonator.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A brass, spherical Helmholtz resonator based on his original design, circa 1890-1900.]]

The latter 19th century saw the development of modern music psychology alongside the emergence of a [[History of psychology|general empirical psychology]], one which passed through similar stages of development. The first was [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralist]] psychology, led by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], which sought to break down experience into its smallest definable parts. This expanded upon previous centuries of acoustic study, and included Helmholtz developing the [[Helmholtz resonance|resonator]] to isolate and understand pure and complex tones and their perception, the philosopher [[Carl Stumpf]] using church organs and his own musical experience to explore [[timbre]] and [[absolute pitch]], and Wundt himself associating the experience of rhythm with kinesthetic tension and relaxation.&lt;ref name = Oxford2&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Psychology of Music, History, 1860-1960 |encyclopedia = Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online |last = Gabrielsson |first = Alf |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42574pg1 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As structuralism gave way to [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[behaviorism]] at the turn of the century, music psychology moved beyond the study of isolated tones and elements to the perception of their inter-relationships and human reactions to them, though work languished behind that of [[visual perception]].&lt;ref name = Oxford2 /&gt;  In Europe Géza Révész and Albert Wellek developed a more complex understanding of musical pitch, and in the US the focus shifted to that of music education and the training and development of musical skill. [[Carl Seashore]] led this work, producing his ''The Measurement of Musical Talents'' and ''The Psychology of Musical Talent''. Seashore used bespoke equipment and standardized tests to measure how performance deviated from indicated markings and how musical aptitude differed between students.

===Modern (1960–present)===

Music psychology in the second half of the 20th century has expanded to cover a wide array of theoretical and applied areas. From the 1960s the field grew along with [[cognitive science]], including such research areas as music perception (particularly of pitch, rhythm, harmony, and melody), musical development and aptitude, music performance, and [[Music and emotion|affective responses to music]].&lt;ref name = Oxford3&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Psychology of Music, History, The late 20th century |encyclopedia = Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online |last = Sloboda |first = John |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42574pg1 |accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period has also seen the founding of music psychology-specific journals, societies, conferences, research groups, centers, and degrees, a trend that has brought research toward specific applications for [[music education]], performance, and [[Music therapy|therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ockelford |first=Adam |chapter=Beyond music psychology |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the techniques of [[cognitive psychology]] allowed for more objective examinations of musical behavior and experience, the theoretical and technological advancements of [[Cognitive neuroscience of music|neuroscience]] have greatly shaped the direction of music psychology into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thaut |first=Micahel |chapter=History and research |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the majority of music psychology research has focused on music in a Western context, the field has expanded along with [[ethnomusicology]] to examine how the perception and practice of music differs between cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thaut |first=Micahel |chapter=History and research |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=William Forde |last2=Balkwill |first2=Laura-Lee |chapter=Cross-cultural similarities and differences|editor1-last=Juslin |editor1-first=Patrik |editor2-last=Sloboda |editor2-first=John |title=Handbook of Music and Emotion: Theory, Research, Applications (ch. 27)|date=2010 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199604968|pages=755–788}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also emerged into the public sphere. In recent years several bestselling [[popular science]] books have helped bring the field into public discussion, notably [[Daniel Levitin]]'s ''[[This Is Your Brain On Music]]'' (2006) and ''[[The World in Six Songs]]'' (2008), [[Oliver Sacks]]' ''[[Musicophilia]]'' (2007), and [[Gary Marcus]]' ''[[Guitar Zero]]'' (2012). In addition, the controversial "[[Mozart effect]]" sparked lengthy debate among researchers, educators, politicians, and the public regarding the relationship between [[classical music]] listening, education, and [[intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alison |last=Abbott |title=Mozart doesn't make you clever |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070413/full/news070409-13.html |publisher=Nature.com |accessdate= 2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research areas==

===Perception and cognition===

Much work within music psychology seeks to understand the cognitive processes that support musical behaviors, including [[perception]], comprehension, [[memory]], [[attention]], and [[performance]]. Originally arising in fields of [[psychoacoustics]] and [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]], cognitive theories of how people understand music more recently encompass [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]], [[music theory]], [[music therapy]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Music, 3rd Edition |year=2013|publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego, California |author=Deutsch, Diana (Editor)|isbn=012381460X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences |year=2014|publisher=Sage Press |location=New York, New York |author=Thompson, William Forde (Editor)|isbn= 9781452283036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Affective response====
{{Main|Music and emotion}}

Music has been shown to consistently elicit emotional responses in its listeners, and this relationship between human [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[music]] has been studied in depth.&lt;ref name = Oxford4&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Psychology of Music, Affect |encyclopedia = Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online |last = Sloboda |first = John |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42574pg3 |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes isolating which specific features of a musical work or performance convey or elicit certain reactions, the nature of the reactions themselves, and how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as [[philosophy]], [[musicology]], and [[aesthetics]], as well the acts of [[musical composition]] and [[performance]]. The implications for casual listeners are also great; research has shown that the pleasurable feelings associated with emotional music are the result of [[dopamine]] release in the [[striatum]]—the same anatomical areas that underpin the anticipatory and rewarding aspects of drug [[addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=21217764|year=2011|last1=Salimpoor|first1=VN|last2=Benovoy|first2=M|last3=Larcher|first3=K|last4=Dagher|first4=A|last5=Zatorre|first5=RJ|title=Anatomically distinct dopamine release during anticipation and experience of peak emotion to music|volume=14|issue=2|pages=257–62|doi=10.1038/nn.2726|journal=Nature Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}

A significant amount of research concerns brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music perception and performance. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, neurology, neuroanatomy, psychology, music theory, computer science, and other allied fields, and use such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

The [[cognition|cognitive process]] of performing music requires the interaction of neural mechanisms in both motor and auditory systems.  Since every action expressed in a performance produces a sound that influences subsequent expression, this leads to impressive [[sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] interplay.&lt;ref name="Zatorre2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Chen | first2 = Joyce L. | last3 = Penhune | first3 = Virginia B. | year = 2007 | title = When the Brain Plays Music: Auditory–motor Interactions in Music Perception and Production | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 7| pages = 547–58 | doi=10.1038/nrn2152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Processing pitch====
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]
Perceived pitch typically depends on the [[fundamental frequency]], though the dependence could be mediated solely by the presence of [[harmonic]]s corresponding to that fundamental frequency. The perception of a pitch without the corresponding fundamental frequency in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the [[missing fundamental]].&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Neurons lateral to A1 in marmoset monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the fundamental frequency of a complex tone,&lt;ref name= Bendor&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bendor | first1 = D. | last2 = Wang | first2 = X. | year = 2005 | title = The neuronal representation of pitch in primate auditory cortex | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 436 | issue = | pages = 1161–1165 | doi=10.1038/nature03867 | pmid=16121182 | pmc=1780171}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that ''pitch constancy'' may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.

Pitch constancy refers to the ability to perceive pitch identity across changes in acoustical properties, such as loudness, temporal envelope, or [[timbre]].&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; The importance of cortical regions lateral to A1 for pitch coding is also supported by studies of human cortical lesions and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain.&lt;ref name= Zatorre1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre1 | first1 = R. J. | year = 1988 | title = Pitch perception of complex tones and human temporal-lobe function | url = | journal = J. Acoust. Soc.

Absolute pitch (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |title=Absolute pitch |year=1993 |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Annie H. |last2=Hulse |first2=Stewart H. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=345–61 |pmid=8451339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sacks1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliver Sacks |date=May 1995 |title=Letters: Musical Ability |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5211 |pages=621–622 |doi=10.1126/science.7732360 |pmid=7732360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which this ability is innate or learned is debated, with evidence for both a [[genetics|genetic]] basis and for a "critical period" in which the ability can be learned, especially in conjunction with early musical training.&lt;ref name="Theusch, E. et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theusch, E., Basu, A., and Gitschier, J. |year=2009 |title=Genome-wide Study of Families with Absolute Pitch Reveals Linkage to 8q24.21 and Locus Heterogeneity |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=85 |pages=112–119 |doi= 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.06.010 |pmid=19576568 |issue=1 |pmc=2706961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=Bob |chapter=Memory for music |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Processing rhythm====

Behavioural studies demonstrate that rhythm and pitch can be perceived separately,&lt;ref name= Krumhansl&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krumhansl | first1 = C.

Studies of auditory rhythm discrimination and reproduction in patients with brain injury have linked these functions to the [[Auditory cortex|auditory regions]] of the [[temporal lobe]], but have shown no consistent localization or lateralization.&lt;ref name= Penhune&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penhune | first1 = V.

Even in studies where subjects only listen to rhythms, the [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebellum]], [[Premotor cortex|dorsal premotor cortex]] (dPMC) and [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA) are often implicated.&lt;ref name= Sakai&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakai | first1 = K.| year = 1999 | title = Neural representation of a rhythm depends on its interval ratio | url = | journal = J.

J. in Society for Neuroscience Abst. 747.15 (Atlanta GA, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis of rhythm may depend on interactions between the auditory and motor systems.

====Neural correlates of musical training====
Although auditory–motor interactions can be observed in people without formal musical training, musicians are an excellent population to study because of their long-established and rich associations between auditory and motor systems. Musicians have been shown to have anatomical adaptations that correlate with their training.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Some neuroimaging studies have observed that musicians show lower levels of activity in motor regions than non-musicians during the performance of simple motor tasks, which may suggest a more efficient pattern of neural recruitment.&lt;ref name= Hund-Georgiadis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hund-Georgiadis | first1 = M. | last2 = von Cramon | first2 = D.

====Motor imagery====
Previous neuroimaging studies have consistently reported activity in the SMA and premotor areas, as well as in auditory cortices, when non-musicians imagine hearing musical excerpts.&lt;ref name= Zatorre&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre | first1 = R.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{Main|Psychoacoustics}}
{{Further|Hearing (sense)|Auditory illusion}}
Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of [[sound]] perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). Topics of study include perception of the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[timbre]], [[loudness]] and [[duration (music)|duration]] of musical sounds and the relevance of such studies for [[music cognition]] or the [[perceived structure of music]]; and [[auditory illusion]]s and how humans [[Sound localization|localize sound]], which can have relevance for musical composition and the [[Architectural acoustics|design of venues for music performance]]. Psychoacoustics is a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Laske | first = Otto | title = Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-313-30632-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive musicology can be differentiated from the fields of music cognition and [[cognitive neuroscience of music]] by a difference in methodological emphasis. Cognitive musicology uses computer modeling to study music-related [[knowledge representation]] and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]]. The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories.&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O. (1999). AI and music: A cornerstone of cognitive musicology. In M. Balaban, K. Ebcioglu, &amp; O. Laske (Eds.), ''Understanding music with ai: Perspectives on music cognition.'' Cambridge: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. Biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs.&lt;ref&gt;Graci, C. (2009-2010) A brief tour of the learning sciences featuring a cognitive tool for investigating melodic phenomena.  ''Journal of Educational Technology Systems'', 38(2), 181-211.&lt;/ref&gt; This field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. By using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Hamman, M., 1999. "Structure as Performance: Cognitive Musicology and the Objectification of Procedure," in Otto Laske: Navigating New Musical Horizons, ed. J. Tabor. New York: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary musicology===
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Cultural differences===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's [[culture]] or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]]. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soley|first=G.|last2=Hannon|first2= E.

==Applied research areas==

{{Expand section|date=April 2014}}

Many areas of music psychology research focus on the application of music in everyday life as well as the practices and experiences of the amateur and professional musician. Each topic may utilize knowledge and techniques derived from one or more of the areas described above. Such areas include:

===Music in society===
Including:
*everyday music listening
*musical [[rituals]] and gatherings (e.g. [[religious]], [[festive]], [[sport]]ing, [[political]], etc.) 
*the role of music in forming [[Identity (social science)|personal]] and [[Collective identity|group identities]] 
*the relation between music and [[dancing]]
*[[social influences]] on musical preference (peers, family, experts, social background, etc.)

====Musical preference====
{{Main|Psychology of music preference}}
Consumers' choices in music have been studied as they relate to the [[Big Five personality traits]]: [[openness to experience]], [[agreeableness]], [[extraversion]], [[neuroticism]], and [[conscientiousness]]. In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Dave |author2=Morizot, Julien |author3=Gaudreau, Patrick|title=Personality Metatraits and Music Preferences in Adolescence: A Pilot Study|journal=International Journal of Adolescence and Youth|date=27 March 2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=289–301|doi=10.1080/02673843.2010.9748036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender has been shown to influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons.&lt;ref name="ChamorroPremuzic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=Tomas |author2=Swami, Viren |author3=Cermakova, Blanka|title=Individual differences in music consumption are predicted by uses of music and age rather than emotional intelligence, neuroticism, extraversion or openness|journal=Psychology of Music|date=22 December 2010|volume=40|issue=3|pages=285–300|doi=10.1177/0305735610381591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood&lt;ref name="Vuoskoski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vuoskoski|first=Jonna K.|author2=Eerola, Tuomas|title=Measuring music-induced emotion: A comparison of emotion models, personality biases, and intensity of experiences|journal=Musicae Scientiae|date=13 July 2011|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159–173|doi=10.1177/1029864911403367}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nostalgic association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barret|first=Frederick S.|author2=Grimm, Kevin J. |author3=Robins, Richard W. |author4=Wildschut, Tim |author5=Constantine, Sedikides |author6=Janata, Petr |title=Music-evoked nostalgia: Affect, memory, and personality|journal=Emotion|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=3|pages=390–403|doi=10.1037/a0019006|pmid=20515227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Music and productivity ====
{{Main|Background music#Effects on cognitive performance}}
Several studies have recognized that listening to music while working affects the [[productivity]] of people performing complex cognitive tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/conquering-cyber-overload/201305/is-background-music-boost-or-bummer|title=Is Background Music a Boost or a Bummer?|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that listening to one’s preferred genre of music can enhance productivity in the workplace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesiuk |first1=Teresa |title=The effect of music listening on work performance |journal=Psychology of Music |date=29 June 2016 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=173–191 |doi=10.1177/0305735605050650}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other research has found that listening to music while working can be a source of [[distraction]], with loudness and lyrical content possibly playing a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicatwork.net/music-at-work-distracting-or-beneficial/|title=Music at work: distracting or beneficial? - Anneli B. Haake PhD|website=musicatwork.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors proposed to affect the relationship between music listening and productivity include musical structure, task complexity, and degree of control over the choice and use of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/melissa-chu/research-shows-listening-to-music-increases-produc.html|title=Research Shows Listening to Music Increases Productivity (and Some Types of Music Are Super Effective)|date=2017-09-19|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music education===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A primary focus of music psychology research concerns how best to teach music and the effects this has on childhood development.]]
Including:
*optimizing [[music education]]
*[[developmental psychology|development]] of musical behaviors and abilities throughout the lifespan 
*the specific skills and processes involved in [[learning]] a [[musical instrument]] or [[singing]]
*activities and practices within a [[music school]]
*individual versus group learning of a musical instrument
*the effects of musical education on intelligence 
*optimizing [[Practice (learning method)|practice]]

====Musical aptitude====

Musical aptitude refers to a person's innate ability to acquire skills and knowledge required for musical activity, and may influence the speed at which learning can take place and the level that may be achieved. Study in this area focuses on whether aptitude can be broken into subsets or represented as a single construct, whether aptitude can be measured prior to significant achievement, whether high aptitude can predict achievement, to what extent aptitude is inherited, and what implications questions of aptitude have on educational principles.&lt;ref name = Oxford5&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title = Psychology of Music, Musical ability |encyclopedia = Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online |last1 = O'Neill |first1 = Susan |last2 = Sloboda |first2 = John |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42574pg6 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an issue closely related to that of [[intelligence]] and [[IQ]], and was pioneered by the work of [[Carl Seashore]]. While early tests of aptitude, such as Seashore's ''The Measurement of Musical Talent'', sought to measure innate musical talent through discrimination tests of pitch, interval, rhythm, consonance, memory, etc., later research found these approaches to have little predictive power and to be influenced greatly by the test-taker's mood, motivation, confidence, fatigue, and boredom when taking the test.&lt;ref name= Oxford5 /&gt;

== Cancer-associated neochromosomes ==

Cancer-associated neochromosomes are giant supernumerary chromosomes. They harbor the mutations that drive certain cancers (highly amplified copies of key [[oncogene]]s, such as [[Mdm2|MDM2]], [[Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|CDK4]], [[HMGA2]]). They may be circular or linear chromosomes. They have functional [[centromere]]s, and [[telomere]]s when linear. They are rare overall, being found in about 3% of cancers, but are common in certain rare cancers. For example, they are found in 90% of parosteal [[osteosarcomas]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Neochromosomes from well- and de-differentiated [[liposarcoma]] have been studied at high resolution by isolation (using flow sorting) and sequencing, as well as microscopy. They consist of hundreds of fragments of DNA, often derived from multiple normal chromosomes, stitched together randomly, and contain high levels of DNA amplification (~30-60 copies of some genes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Using [[statistical inference]] and [[mathematical model]]ling, the process of how neochromosomes initially form and evolve has been made clearer. Fragments of DNA, produced following [[chromothripsis|chromothriptic]] shattering of [[Chromosome 12 (human)|chromosome 12]] undergo [[DNA repair]] to form of a circular or [[ring chromosome]]. This undergoes hundreds of circular [[breakage-fusion-bridge cycle]]s, causing random amplification and deletion of DNA with selection for the amplification of key oncogenes. DNA from additional chromosomes is somehow added during this process. Erosion of [[centromere]]s can lead to the formation of [[neocentromere]]s or the capture of new native centromeres from other chromosomes. The process ends when the neochromosome forms a linear chromosome following the capture of telomeric caps, which can be chromothriptically derived.

{{Bible-related |interpretation}}

"'''Pardes'''" refers to (types of) [[Hermeneutics|approaches]] to biblical [[exegesis]] in rabbinic [[Judaism]] or to [[Zohar|interpretation]] of text in [[Torah study#Forms of traditional Jewish Torah study|Torah study]]. The term, sometimes also spelled '''PaRDeS''', is an [[acronym]] formed from the same initials of the following four approaches:
*[[Peshat|'''P'''esh'''a'''t]] ({{Hebrew|פְּשָׁט}}) – "surface" ("straight") or the literal (direct) meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=225&amp;letter=P Peshat] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''R'''emez ({{Hebrew|רֶמֶז}}) – "hints" or the deep (allegoric: hidden or symbolic) meaning beyond just the literal sense.
*'''De'''rash ({{Hebrew|דְּרַשׁ}}) – from Hebrew ''darash'': "inquire" ("seek") – the comparative ([[midrash]]ic) meaning, as given through similar occurrences.
*'''S'''od ({{Hebrew|סוֹד}}) (pronounced with a long O as in 'lore') – "secret" ("mystery") or the esoteric/mystical meaning, as given through inspiration or revelation.

Each type of ''Pardes'' interpretation examines the extended meaning of a text.  As a general rule, the extended meaning never contradicts the base meaning.  The ''[[Peshat]]'' means the plain or contextual meaning of the text.  ''Remez'' is the allegorical meaning.  ''Derash'' includes the metaphorical meaning, and ''Sod'' represents the hidden meaning.  There is often considerable overlap, for example when legal understandings of a verse are influenced by mystical interpretations or when a "hint" is determined by comparing a word with other instances of the same word.

Some books such as ''[[Tolaat Yaakov]]'', divide Pardes into Peshat, Remez, ''Din'' (law), and Sod.  According to this understanding, ''Derash'' is divided into the homiletics, which are classified under Remez, and legal interpretations, which are classified under Din.

==Context==

===Exoteric and esoteric in ''Sod''===
* [[Exoteric]] means that Scripture is read in the context of the physical world, human orientation, and human notions. The first three exegetical methods: ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'', and ''Drush-Homiletic'' belong to the exoteric "''Nigleh-Revealed''" part of Torah embodied in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], and exoteric-type [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].
* [[Esoteric]] means that the surface meaning of Scripture, as with esoteric texts in general, while it may also be true, is not the real truth to which Scripture refers. Instead, the surface meaning hides/covers/conceals its real intention. The real truth is the secret hidden within the deceptive covering. The fourth level of exegesis, ''Sod-Secret'', belongs to the esoteric "''Nistar-Hidden''" interpretations of Scripture found alternatively in [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mysticism-Kabbalah]] or in [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophy-Metaphysics]]. Religious adherents of Kabbalah and of Rationalism fought over their alternative claims to know the esoteric meaning. In Medieval Jewish Rationalism, the hidden truth within Scripture was human-centred [[Divine transcendence]] philosophical depths. In Kabbalistic mysticism, it was God's Persona-centred [[Divine immanence]] emanations. Therefore, each tradition interpreted classic Rabbinic references to [[Pardes (legend)]], ''Maaseh Bereishit/Maaseh Merkabah'' ([[Talmudic]] passages about esotericism) and to the connected 4-fold structure of PaRDeS exegesis differently.

Both mystical and rational religious Judaism, however, together rooted in mainstream [[Rabbinic literature]] and [[Mitzvot]] observance, accepted common truth in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'' levels of Judaism. In this way, Jewish religious esotericism is inseparable from exoteric Judaism. Their esoteric meanings did not deny the truth of exotericism, but rather reinforced the need for exoteric [[Halacha]] Jewish law and practical observance of the [[613 Mitzvot]] as God's plan in Creation.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The mystical view of esoteric ''Sod-Secret'' as the elite doctrines of [[Kabbalah]] also gave conceptual context to ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', and ''Drush'': in the mystical unfolding of the spiritual [[Four Worlds]], each realm corresponds to a level in PaRDeS. God's immanence is found at successively descending levels of reality. Torah descends from on High, while man ascends the levels of PaRDeS exegesis in Torah from Below. In this sense, ascending the four levels of interpretation reveals greater divinity in Torah; the exoteric and esoteric are linked in a continuous chain. While rationalists read Rabbinic [[Aggadah]] legends metaphorically, kabbalists read them as allusions to Kabbalah.

===Halacha and Aggadah in ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush''===
Within mainstream exoteric classic [[Rabbinic literature]], such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrashim]], [[Halacha]] is Jewish legal discussion and ruling, while [[Aggadah]] is Jewish theological/narrative discussion. As two approaches in exoteric Judaism, so ''Peshat-Simple'', ''Remez-Hinted'' and ''Drush-Homiletic'' exegeses methods, which work exoterically, can be used in either Halachic or Aggadic contexts.

==Examples==

===Peshat===
(Gen. 1,2) And the earth was empty (tohu) and formless (bohu).&lt;br /&gt;
[[Rashi]] - The Hebrew word 'tohu' means astonishment in English and the word 'bohu' means emptiness and next to emptiness. Thus the phrase is 'amazement and desolation'. This means that a person would be amazed and astonished at anything that was there.

===Remez===
'''Aggadic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;There is a traditional Rabbinic passage describing spiritual history that relates the 6 days of Creation to the 6000 years the World will exist, and the Sabbath to the 7th Millennium Messianic Era. The first 2000 years of Creation from Adam, through Noah and the Tower of Babel, to Abraham were 2000 years when God was hidden. The next 2000 years from the Israelite Patriarchs, through the Giving of the Torah at Sinai, to the 1st and 2nd Jewish Commonwealths and Temples in Jerusalem, were 2000 years of Divine revelation. The final 2000 years of preparation when the [[Jewish Messiah]] is waited for, are 2000 years balanced between Divine concealment and revelation.

A Remez-allusion to this is found in the first verse of the Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth''"&lt;br /&gt;בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of these 7 words, only ''Hashamayim-Heavens'' has no letter א [[Aleph]], the first letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], numerical value of 1 ([[gematria]]). Aleph, hints at its etymological variants "Aluph" (Chief/Ruler) and "Eleph" (One Thousand), the first representing the 1 God, the second representing 1,000 years. Hebrew root words are generally made from three consonant letters, as vowels are read in pronunciation instead. Hebrew reads from right to left. Of the 6 words with Aleph in them in the verse: in the first 2 Aleph is positioned as third letter (concealed God in the first 2,000 years), in the next 2 Aleph is positioned as first letter (revealed God in the middle 2,000 years), in the last 2 Aleph is positioned as second letter (balance between concealed and revealed God in the last 2,000 years).

This is a Remez-allusion exegesis, but gains further meaning in [[Kabbalah]] Jewish mysticism (Sod-Secret exegesis) by the Kabbalistic doctrine that Creation was ennacted through the Hebrew letters of the Torah.

'''Halachic example:'''
&lt;br /&gt;(gemara makkos 2b) Q. A hint that the law of conspiring witnesses is in the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. There is no such hint, because it is stated explicitly (Deut 19:19) You do to them what they conspired to do to the accused.

Q. But a hint that conspiring witnesses receive a whipping [if they cannot be punished by doing to them as they conspired] according to the Torah, where is it? &lt;br /&gt;
A. As it says (Deut 25:1–2) They caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

Q. Because they caused the righteous to be righteous and the evil to be evil. And therefore the evil get whipped? &lt;br /&gt;
A. But there must have been witnesses who testified that the righteous were evil. And other witnesses came and caused the righteous to be known as righteous as they were before, and caused the previous witnesses to be known as evil. And therefore the evil get whipped.

===Derash (Midrash)===
(gemara makkos 23b) Rabbi Simlai deduced that there were 613 [[mitzvot]] taught to Moses at Mount Sinai. The verse says that (Deut 33,4) Torah was given to us through Moses at Sinai. The [[gematria]] of Torah is 611. And one should add to them the first two of the [[Ten Commandments]] that were given directly by God to the Jews [this is known because they are written in the first person singular], making the total 613.

===Sod===
'''Maimonides:'''
&lt;br /&gt;In his ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', [[Maimonides]] wrote the most important book of Medieval [[Jewish philosophy]]. In it he declares his intention to conceal from the average reader his explanations of ''Sod'' &lt;ref&gt;Within [the Torah] there is also another part which is called ‘hidden’ (mutsnaʿ), and this [concerns] the secrets (sodot) which the human intellect cannot attain, like the meanings of the statutes (ḥukim) and other hidden secrets. They can neither be attained through the intellect nor through sheer volition, but they are revealed before Him who created [the Torah] (Rabbi [[Abraham ben Asher]], ''The Or ha-Sekhel'')&lt;/ref&gt; esoteric meanings of Torah. Religious Jewish Rationalists read Maimonides' Aristotelianism as a mutually-exclusive alternative metaphysics to [[Kabbalah]],&lt;ref&gt;Such as the first (religious) criticism of Kabbalah, ''Ari Nohem'', by [[Leon Modena]] from 1639. In it, Modena urges a return to Maimonidean Aristotelianism. ''The Scandal of Kabbalah: Leon Modena, Jewish Mysticism, Early Modern Venice'', Yaacob Dweck, Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mainstream academic view on Maimonides. According to this, Medieval Jewish Rationalists and their [[Dor Daim|heirs]] today hold that only [[philosophy]] can extend the human capacity as much as possible to understand Divine secrets, rather than a revealed theosophy like Kabbalah. Some academics hold that Maimonides' project fought against the Proto-Kabbalah of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Menachem Kellner, ''Maimonides' Confrontation With Mysticism'', Littman Library, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kabbalists and their heirs, however, read Maimonides according to Kabbalah or as an actual covert subscriber to Kabbalah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/107784/jewish/Philosopher-and-Mystic.htm Maimonides: Philosopher and Mystic] from ''Chabad.org''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this, he employed rationalism to defend Judaism rather than limit enquirey of ''Sod'' only to rationalism. His rationalism, if not taken as an opposition,&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary academic views in the study of Jewish mysticism, hold that 12-13th century Kabbalists wrote down and systemised their transmitted oral doctrines in oppositional response to Maimonidean rationalism. See e.g. Moshe Idel, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives''&lt;/ref&gt; also assisted the Kabbalists, purifying their transmitted teaching from mistaken [[Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah|corporeal]] interpretations that could have been made from [[Heichalot|earlier Jewish mysticism]],&lt;ref&gt;The first comprehensive systemiser of Kabbalah, [[Moshe Cordovero]], for example, was influenced by Maimonides. One example is his instruction to undercut any conception of a Kabbalistic idea after grasping it in the mind. One's intellect runs to God in learning the idea, then returns back in qualified rejection of false spatial/temporal conceptions of the idea's truth, as the human mind can only think in material references. Cited in Louis Jacobs, ''The Jewish Religion: A Companion'', Oxford University Press, 1995, entry on Cordovero&lt;/ref&gt; though Kabbalists held that their theosophy alone allowed human access to Divine mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lamm, ''The Religious Thought of Hasidism: Text and Commentary'', Ktav Pub, 1999: Introduction to chapter on Faith/Reason has historical overview of religious reasons for opposition to Jewish philosophy, including the Ontological reason, one Medieval Kabbalist holding that "we begin where they end"&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Maimonides mentions Divine secrets within Torah:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Adam and Eve were at first created as one being, having their backs united: they were then separated, and one half was removed and brought before Adam as Eve." Note how clearly it has been stated that Adam and Eve were two in some respects, and yet they remained one, according to the words, "Bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. ii. 23). The unity of the two is proved by the fact that both have the same name, for she is called ishah (woman), because she was taken out of ish (man), also by the words, "And shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (ii. 24). How great is the ignorance of those who do not see that all this necessarily includes some [other] idea [besides the literal meaning of the words].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', book 2 section 30&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Kabbalah:'''
{{quote|My beloved came down to His garden&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tikkun Chatzot]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;br /&gt;Kabbalah does not read Scripture as analogy, but as theosophical symbols of dynamic processes in the Supernal Divinity. According to this, Creation was ennacted through the letters of the [[Hebrew language]], particularly [[Names of God in Judaism|Divine Names]]. The [[Midrash]] describes God "looking into the Torah to Create the World", which Kabbalah extended into a linguistic mysticism. United with the [[Ein Sof|Infinite Divine]], the text of the Torah becomes one long Name of God, or alternatively, God's revealed Being as represented in this World. Kabbalists endeavoured to perceive the unlimited Divinity in the Torah of the [[Tree of life (biblical)|Tree of life]], through the exoteric Torah of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]], the two representing [[Divine transcendence|transcendent]] and [[Divine immanence|immanent]] revelations of God in the [[Sephirot]], uniting [[Tiferet]] ("The Holy One Blessed Be He") and [[Malkuth]] (Feminine [[Shekhinah]]).

The teachings of [[Isaac Luria]], which form the basis of modern esoteric [[Kabbalah]], read the mythological [[Lurianic Kabbalah|doctrine]] of ''[[Tohu and Tikun|Shevirat HaKeilim]]'' ("Shattering of the [[sephirot|vessels]] in God's Persona) from the account of the [[Edomite]] [[List of rulers of Edom|Kings]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 36:31 and I [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 1:43:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Kabbalah, based on exoteric [[Midrash]], the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Hebrew Patriarchs]]: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, embody the sephirot of ''Chesed-Kindness'', ''Gevurah-Strength'' and ''Tiferet-Beauty''. Kindness and Judgement are polar forces and Beauty harmonises. The imbalances emerged in [[Ishmael]] and [[Esau]], while the harmony fathered the [[12 tribes of Israel]]. Ishmael and Esau are considered the spiritual roots of the Nations, deriving from the initial unrectified spiritual Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]-Chaos, whose pristine Divine potential was too high to be contained in Existence, shattering its vessels which fell down into exile. The Israelites relate to the lower Realm of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]]-Rectification. The [[Jewish Messianism|Messianic Era]] for all people will embody both advantages of the high lights of Tohu in the rectified vessels of Tikun, when "all Nations will ascend the mountain of God".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 2:3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edom]], the progeny of Esau, corresponds to unrectified [[Gevurah]]-Strength, the waste of which vitalises the [[kelipot]] shells. Gevurah is the [[Tzimtzum|constricting]] force in Creation, allowing independent Existence, but also causing the initial vessels of Tohu to act independently and shatter. The Edomite Kings who reigned before any king in Israel, while also being historical people according to ''Peshat'', in Kabbalah both embody and symbolise the vessels of Tohu that shattered. The verses name eight kings, the breakages in the eight emotional sephirot from Daat to Malchut. Death is the lights-souls reascending and the vessel fragments falling, animated by remnant sparks of light. Of the eighth king, only Genesis says he died, as Malchut remained partially intact. The sparks of holiness animate Creation down to Material Existence. In the highest [[Four Worlds|World]] [[Atziluth]], the general root-sparks number 288, read out by [[gematria]] from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:2–3:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the Earth was [[Tohu wa-bohu|chaos and void]] (the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tohu]]), with darkness upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God hovered (מרחפת-"''Merachepet''", the sparks animating the fragments [[Ohr|externally]]) over the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light..(the World of [[Tohu and Tikun|Tikun]], allowing stable reception of Divine revelation)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"''Merachepet''" divides into 288 (רפח) sparks animating within the מת-"dead"-fallen fragments.

==Pardes exegesis and essence==
In a discourse [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Lubavitch Rebbe, asks where [[Hasidic thought]] fits in with Pardes exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Essence of Chasidus: A Chasidic Discourse by Rabbi Menachem M Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe'', Kehot publications, reissued 2003. This is a bi-lingual translation of the original Hebrew [[Maamarim (Chabad)|Maamar]] ''Inyana Shel Toras HaHasidus-The Concept of the Torah of Hasidism'', originally delivered orally in 1965, then edited by the Rebbe with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Habad]] is the intellectualist school in [[Hasidic Judaism]], translating the mystical faith of General-Hasidism and the movement's [[Baal Shem Tov|founder]] into intellectual articulation. The works of the last Habad leader focus on uniting the different aspects of traditional Jewish thought, exoteric and esoteric, through the Hasidic explanation. The four levels of Pardes in [[Kabbalah]] articulate the [[Four Worlds|Four spiritual Worlds]] and the four [[Kochos hanefesh|soul levels]] in Action, Emotion, Understanding and Wisdom. In the discourse he describes General-Hasidism relating through faith to the [[Atzmus|essence]] of the soul, the Torah, and God (Hasidic focus on Divine [[Panentheism|Omnipresence]] perceived by the soul's essence). In esoteric Kabbalistic terminology this relates to the fifth (highest) primary World of [[Adam Kadmon]], and the above-conscious fifth (highest) soul level of Will (internal aspect: soul-root "Delight"), called in Kabbalah "Yehida-Unity". He describes Habad thought articulating in intellectual grasp the essence-fifth level of Torah exegesis, ''Hasidut-Yehida'' not listed above the four levels of PaRDeS because as essence it is not limited to a particular form. ''Peshat'', ''Remez'', ''Drush'' and ''Sod'' are constrained by their limited disciplines: from ''Peshat'' describing material perception to ''Sod-Kabbalah'' limited to the esoteric supernal emanations of God. As essence, Hasidic thought, investigated intellectually in Habad, both transcends all four levels of Pardes in its own exegetical explanation, and permeates within the four. ''Yechida-Essence'' is revealed through the four levels of Pardes, but not constrained by them. The particular exegeses of PaRDeS become connected together in light of the Hasidic exegesis. In this way, the discourse describes Kabbalah, which gains psychological understanding through Hasidism, being actually a limited esoteric commentary on Hasidism's ''Yehida-Essence''. Kabbalah remains transcendent, while Hasidic thought emphasises action, as the [[Atzmut]] essence of God receives its only true revelation in the ultimate Material purpose to Creation, the Omnipresent Divinity related to in Hasidic thought.

==Association with paradise==
{{Main|Pardes (legend)}}
The Pardes system is often regarded as mystically linked to the word ''pardes'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] פָּרְדֵּס), meaning [[orchard]]. "Pardes" is etymologically related to the English word "[[paradise]]", and the [[Quran]]ic Firdaus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] فِردَوس) among various other forms, in that they all share a common origin in an [[Old Iranian]] root, attested in the [[Avestan language]] as ''pairi.daêza-''.&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs only three times in the [[Tanakh]], namely, in [[Song of Songs]] 4:13, [[Ecclesiastes]] 2:5, and [[Nehemiah]] 2:8. In the first of these passages it means "garden"; in the second and third, "park." In the apocalypses and in the [[Talmud]] the word is used of the [[Garden of Eden]] and its heavenly prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Compare references in Weber's ''Jüdische Theologie'', 2d ed., 1897, pp. 344 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; From this usage, comes [[Christianity]]'s denotation of Paradise as the [[Heaven|abode of the blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:43; [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|II Cor]]. 12:4; [[Book of Revelation|Rev]] 2:7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=65&amp;letter=P Paradise] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pardes and modern exegesis==
The Pardes exegesis system flows from traditional belief in the text as Divine revelation; [[Mosaic authorship]] in regard to the [[Torah]], prophetic inspirations in the rest of [[Tanakh]], and belief in [[Oral Torah]] transmission. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the validity of applying modern historical-critical exegetical methods to Scripture. [[Haredi]] Judaism regards the Oral Torah texts as revelation, and can apply Pardes method to read classic [[Rabbinic literature]]. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] is open to historical critical study of Rabbinic literature and some application to the later Biblical canon. Additionally, some Modern Orthodox scholars have looked at [[Biblical Criticism]] on the Torah, incorporating some of its views within traditional belief in Mosaic revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'' (The Orthodox Forum Series), Shalom Carmy editor, Jason Aronson publishers, 1996. Also Rabbi Dr. Nathan Lopes Cardozo study: [http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_cardozo.html On Bible Criticism and Its Counterarguments] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Orthodox denominations apply critical method throughout, but with different theological conclusions.

Beginning with [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] in the nineteenth century, there has been an approach to understanding the Torah that finds statements in classical [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] that would allow acceptance of revelation, and still use [[Lower Criticism]].&lt;ref name=Heschel&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312/ Aggadic Man: The Poetry and Rabbinic Thought of Abraham Joshua Heschel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023856/http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,312 |date=2016-03-04 }}, Alan Brill, ''Meorot'' Journal - ''A Forum of Modern Orthodox Discourse'' 6:1, 2006. Pages 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Comments of Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Ibn Caspi, Judah Ha-Hasid, and Abravenel have been used in this historical-philological form of ''Peshat''.&lt;ref name=Heschel/&gt;

In the 20th Century, the [[Conservative Judaism]] philosopher-theologian [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], while accepting modern scholarship, saw existentialist revelation and Divine encounter as the foundation of legitimate Bible interpretation. His 1962 masterwork, ''Torah min HaShamayim BeAspaklariya shel HaDorot'' (English: ''Torah from Heaven in the Light of the Generations'') is a study of classical rabbinic theology and [[aggadah]] (spiritual thought), as opposed to [[halakha]] (Jewish law) in revealing the Divinity of [[Torah study]]. It explores the views of the Rabbis in the Talmud, Midrash and among the philosophical and mystical traditions, about the nature of Torah, the revelation of God to mankind, prophecy, and the ways that Jews have used scriptural exegesis to expand and understand these core Jewish texts in a living, fluid spiritual exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;An English translation by Gordon Tucker is titled ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with other traditions==
The Pardes typology has some similarities to the contemporary Christian [[Allegory in the Middle Ages|fourfold allegorical scheme]]. The great Muslim scholar and Imam, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the last Caliph before the schism of Sunni and Shia expresses in similar fashion that the Quran has four levels of interpretation similar to that of the PaRDeS: “The Book of God has four things: literal expression (‘ibāra), allusion (ishāra), subtleties (laṭā’if), and deepest realities (ḥaqā’iq). The literal expression is for the common folk (‘awāmm), the allusion is for the elite (khawāṣṣ), the subtleties are for the friends of God (awliyā’), and the deepest realities are for the prophets (anbiyā’)." &lt;ref&gt;From ''Spiritual Gems: The Mystical Qur’an Commentary'' ascribed to Ja’far al-Sadiq as contained in Sulami’s ''Haqa’iq al-Tafsir'' (Louisville: Fons Vitae, 2011), trans. Farhana Mayer, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Persian Letters''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettres persanes}}) is a literary work, written in 1721, by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]], recounting the experiences of two [[Persia]]n noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who are traveling through [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1051588x/f5.image.r=| title =  Lettres persanes | access-date= 13 June 2016 | year = 1721| publisher = P.

Brunel | place=Amsterdam| volume = II |via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1711 Usbek leaves his [[seraglio]] in [[Isfahan]] to take the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in [[Paris]] (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and [[mullah]]s, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and [[Moors]], ending with a biting satire of the System of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

The Chronology breaks down as follows:

*Letters 1–21 [1–23]: The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
*Letters 22 [24]–89 [92]: Paris in the reign of [[Louis XIV]], 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
*Letters 90 [93]–137 [143] or [supplementary Letter 8 =145]: the Regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
*Letters 138 [146]– 150 [161]: the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

The first edition of the novel, which consists of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: [[Pierre Marteau]], a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business is now run by his widow, Susanne de Caux.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Called edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of ''Lettres persanes'' for the complete works of Montesquieu published by the Voltaire Foundation in 2004. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author’s lifetime (i.e., until 1755) derive from A or B. A new edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu’s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled "Quelques réflexions sur les ''Lettres persanes''." This latter edition has been used for all subsequent editions until the ''Œuvres complètes'' of 2004, which reverts to the original edition but includes the added letters marked as "supplementary" and, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

==An epistolary novel==
[[File:Persianische Briefe.jpg|thumb|An early illustration depicting Usbek and Rica]]
Montesquieu never referred to ''Lettres persanes'' (Persian Letters) as a [[novel]] until "Quelques remarques sur les ''Lettres persanes''," which begins: "Nothing about the ''Lettres persanes'' was more ingratiating than to find in it unexpectedly a sort of novel. There is a visible beginning, development, and ending […]." Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, it was not considered primarily a novel, and even less an "[[epistolary novel]]" (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues’s ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Lettres portugaises]]'' of 1669. A collection of "letters" in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as ''Lettres historiques'' (1692–1728), the Jesuits’ famous ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'' (1703–1776), not to mention [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer|Mme Dunoyer’s]] ''Lettres historiques et galantes'' (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. The ''Lettres persanes'' thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already established. But it is in its numerous imitations – such as ''Lettres juives'' (1738) and ''Lettres chinoises'' (1739) of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d’Argens]], ''Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur'' (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with ''Lettres persanes''), and perhaps especially [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Françoise de Graffigny]]’s ''Lettres d’une Péruvienne'' (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]] – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed ''Lettres persanes'' into an "epistolary novel." Whence this remark in Montesquieu’s ''Mes Pensées'': "My ''Lettres persanes'' taught people to write letter-novels" (no. 1621).

The [[Epistolary novel|epistolary structure]] is quite flexible: nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two different recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the final 161). Ibben, who functions more as addressee than correspondent, writes only two letters but receives forty-two. Likewise, an unnamed person (designated only as ***) – if always the same – receives eighteen letters and writes none at all. There is even one complete anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere in the novel.

The letters are apparently all dated in accordance with a [[lunar calendar]] which, as [[Robert Shackleton]] showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own, by simple substitution of Muslim names, as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

==Social commentary==

In Paris, the Persians express themselves on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less implicated and more free, and more attracted by Parisian life. Both retain Montesquieu's rich satirical tone, as in Rica's ''Lettre 72'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Je me trouvai l’autre jour dans une compagnie où je vis un homme bien content de lui. Dans un quart d’heure, il décida trois questions de morale, quatre problèmes historiques, et cinq points de physique : Je n’ai jamais vu un décisionnaire si universel ; son esprit ne fut jamais suspendu par le moindre doute. On laissa les sciences ; on parla des nouvelles du temps : il décida sur les nouvelles du temps. Je voulus l’attraper, et je dis en moi-même : Il faut que je me mette dans mon fort ; je vais me réfugier dans mon pays. Je lui parlai de la Perse ; mais, à peine lui eus-je dit quatre mots, qu’il me donna deux démentis, fondés sur l’autorité de messieurs Tavernier et Chardin. Ah ! bon Dieu ! dis-je en moi-même, quel homme est-ce là ? Il connoîtra tout à l’heure les rues d’Ispahan mieux que moi ! Mon parti fut bientôt pris : je me tus, je le laissai parler, et il décide encore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_persanes/Lettre_72 Lettre 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I found myself recently in a company where I met am man very well satisfied with himself. In a quarter of an hour, he decided three questions in morals, four historical problems, and five points in physics. I have never seen so universal a decider; his mind was not once troubled with the least doubt. We left science, and talked of the current news: he decided upon the current news. I wished to catch him, so I said to myself, “I must get to my strong point; I will betake me to my own country.” I spoke to him of Persia; but hardly had I opened my mouth, when he contradicted me twice, basing his objections upon the authority of Tavernier and Chardin. “Ah! Good heavens!” said I to myself, “what kind of man is this? He will know next all the streets in Ispahan better than I do!” I soon knew what part to play-to be silent, and let him talk; and he is still laying down the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Persian_Letters/Letter_72 Letter 72], trans. [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this takes place in the declining years of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies ([[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Jesuits]], etc.), public places and their publics (the [[Tuileries]], the [[Palais Royal]]), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts [300] for the blind, the [[Les Invalides|Invalides]] for those wounded in war). They describe a thriving culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon, thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café&amp;nbsp;– where debates take place (letter 34 [36])&amp;nbsp;– has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the [[philosopher's stone]]; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the [[University of Paris|university]], the [[Académie française|Academy]], Sciences, the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'') via groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes to the eye of the reader.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious contrasts. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a [[Muslim]], and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the [[Trinity]], [[Communion rite|communion]]), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop more fully a particular subject, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza on the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on [[demography]], letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch analyses that will later be developed in [[The Spirit of the Laws|''L’Esprit des lois'']] for many subjects such as the types of powers, the influence of climate and the critique of colonization.

==The dénouement==

While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous and lonely lovers, he the role of master and lover, with no true communication and without revealing much about their true selves. Usbek’s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Knowing, moreover, from the outset that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused about their attitude (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a hothouse from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the preceding letters. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which is unmentioned in any guise from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the edition of 1758 from supplementary letter 8 (97) to 145. Moreover, all the letters from 126 (132) to 137 (148) are from Rica, which means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is completely silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, the reader does not learn of them until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758. Although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that "the seraglio is in disorder" (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to act, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: "I shall deliver my head to my enemies" (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the whole history of Law’s "System," are in fact posterior to Roxane’s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720.

==Sources==

Montesquieu’s "sources" are legion, since they doubtless extend to readings and conversations which are modified en route. The impact of [[Jean Chardin]]’s ''Voyages en Perse'', to which he owes most of his information about Persia – which is far from superficial – must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the ''Voyages'' of [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] and [[Paul Rycaut]], not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes from his own experience, and from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s ''L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens'' (''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]''), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of [[Antoine Galland]]’s ''Mille et Une Nuits'' (''[[The Arabian Nights]]'') contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with the ''Lettres persanes''.

==Critical history==

The ''Lettres persanes'' was an immediate success and often imitated, but it has been diversely interpreted over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was its "spirit" of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. No one had the notion of attaching it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the novel tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious "oriental" impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed perspectives. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière and the research of [[Robert Shackleton]] on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work’s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek’s contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on ''Lettres persanes'', with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident.

The American philosopher [[Marshall Berman]] devotes several chapters in his book ''The Politics of Authenticity'' (1970) to the radical humanism of the Persian Letters.

===The Jewish Letters===
{{main article|Jewish Letters}}
The Jewish Letters of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d'Argens]] were published in 1738, composed in a total of 180 letters that originally spanned 30 volumes. Although they are certainly an imitation of the Persian Letters, they are not considered plagiarism due to the distinction of content between the two works. Although he titled himself as the work's "translator", he is most ascribed as the work's author.

==Key themes==
* [[Comparative religion]]
* [[Exile]]
* [[Humanism]]
* [[National identity]] and [[nationalism]]
* [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">As the tip of a plant [[shoot]] grows, new leaves are produced at regular time intervals if temperature is held constant. This time interval is termed the '''plastochron''' (or '''plastochrone''').&lt;ref name="Silk"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Silk | first=Wendy Kuhn | last2=Erickson | first2=Ralph O. | title=Kinematics of plant growth | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume=76 | issue=4 | year=1979 | pages=481–501 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(79)90014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''plastochrone index''' and the [[leaf plastochron index]] are ways of measuring the age of a plant dependent on morphological traits rather than on chronological age.{{clarify|date=November 2016}} Use of these indices removes differences caused by germination, developmental differences and exponential growth.

==Definitions==
The spatial pattern of the arrangement of leaves is called [[phyllotaxis|phyllotaxy]] whereas the time between successive leaf initiation events is called the plastochron and the rate of emergence from the [[Bud#Types_of_buds|apical bud]] is the [[phyllochron]].

==Plastochron ratio==
In 1951, F. J. Richards introduced the idea of the plastochron ratio and developed a system of equations to describe mathematically a centric representation using three parameters: plastochron ratio, divergence angle, and the angle of the cone tangential to the apex in the area being considered.&lt;ref&gt;FJ Richards, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 235, 509 (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/3/455.short Orthostichy, Parastichy and Plastochrone Ratio in a Central Theory of Phyllotaxis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging [[Petiole (botany)|phyllodes]] or leaf variants experience a sudden change from a high [[humidity]] environment to a more [[arid]] one. There are other changes they encounter such as variations in light level, [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]] and the gaseous content of the air.

'''The Regional Research Institute (RRI)''' at [[West Virginia University]] is a university-wide [[regional science]] research center for graduate students and faculty members in the fields of economics, resource economics, geography, history and sociology. Professor William H. Miernyk, a regional economist trained at Harvard, came to West Virginia University and founded RRI and served as the 1st Director. Since its opening in 1965, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities. Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad.

== About ==
The Regional Research Institute conducts and promotes interdisciplinary research on the economic and social development of lagging regions. As a center of regional research excellence for more than four decades, the RRI has served as an international recognized center for the advancement of regional science-an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of geography, economics, and planning.

The orientation William H. Miernyk established is at the heart of the Institute today:
* The Regional Research Institute exists for scholarly research. Scholars define the research projects, and scholars evaluate the proposals and results. The overall objective is to increase knowledge through publication of journal articles and books.
* Graduate students are an integral part of the Institute.  As their educations progress, so do their roles on research projects.  They learn research skills, conduct and publish research, and present papers at conferences in the U.S. and worldwide.
* The scope of the Institute extends beyond the economic and social problems of Appalachia to similar regions elsewhere.  It incorporates an enduring focus on quantitative methods for studying regions and evaluating policy directions.
*The Institute encourages and nurtures international and multidisciplinary research.  It organizes conferences and seminars, initiates research activities, creates research opportunities abroad, and hosts visiting scholars.

For 50 years, the Regional Research Institute has helped scholars do research. For numerous individuals, both at West Virginia University and elsewhere, it has provided crucial encouragement, stimulation, and opportunities.  Its programs involve faculty members, graduate students, and an extensive network of scholars in the United States and abroad.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">The '''Spanish era''' or '''era of Caesar''' was a dating system commonly used in the states of the [[Iberian peninsula]] until the 14th–15th centuries, when it was phased out in favour the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system. The calendar began with year one in what is 38 BC,&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"&gt;Roth, Norman. ''Medieval Iberia An Encyclopedia''. Routledge, 2003, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the date of a new tax imposed by the [[Roman Republic]] on the subdued population of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} Whatever the case, the date signifies the beginning of the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' in Iberia. To convert from an ''Anno Domini'' date to the corresponding year in the Spanish era, add 38 to the ''Anno Domini'' year.&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt; A date in the Spanish era was written thus: "Era CMXLI" for "anno domini 903".

The use of the Caesar Era probably began in Iberia in the 3rd century. The reason for its particular popularity is unknown. Official usage ceased in different parts of the Iberian peninsula at different times: in [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1349, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] 1358, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] 1383 and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] 1422. While the year officially began on 1 January under the Spanish era, that was changed to 25 December when the ''Anno Domini'' system was adopted. (The church, however, used 11 January.)&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt;

'''Spontaneous glass breakage''' is a phenomenon by which [[toughened glass]] (or tempered) may spontaneously break without any apparent reason. 
The most common causes are:
:* Minor damage during installation such as nicked or chipped edges later developing into larger breaks normally radiating from point of defect.
:* Binding of the glass in the frame, causing stresses to develop as the glass expands and contracts due to thermal changes or deflects due to wind
:* Internal defects within the glass such as [[nickel sulfide inclusion]]s
:* Thermal stresses in the glass
:* Inadequate glass thickness to resist wind load

== Installation damage ==

While glass is being moved and installed, it is easy for the glaziers to nick or chip the edges of the glass with various tools. It is also possible for fasteners such as nails or screws used to attach glass stops to nick the glass edges if these fasteners are installed at an improper angle. These small nicks or chips may not result in immediate breakage. However, over time, as the glass expands and contracts, stress concentrations can develop around the nick, leading to breakage. In the case of [[tempered glass]] the entire unit usually breaks.

== Binding in the frame ==

Glass expands and contracts with changes in temperature and deflects due to wind, so almost all modern glass is set on resilient blocks at the bottom and with space for expansion at the sides and top. The gaskets holding the glass in the frame are also usually resilient to cushion the glass against wind buffeting. If no space is provided at the perimeter of the unit, the glass will bind against the frame, causing internal stresses to develop in the glass which can exceed the strength of glass, resulting in breakage.

== Internal defects and inclusions in the glass ==

[[Nickel sulfide inclusion]]s ("stones") can be present in the glass. The most common cause of these inclusions is the use of stainless-steel machinery in the glassmaking and handling process. Small shavings of [[stainless steel]] containing [[nickel]] change structure over time and grow, creating internal stresses in the glass. When these stresses exceed the strength of the glass, breakage results. This type of breakage is almost always found in tempered glass and is indicated by a distinctive "figure eight" pattern, with each "loop" of the figure eight approx. 30mm in diameter.

Alternatively, small pieces of refractory brick can be eroded by the molten glass from the internal walls of the furnace during processing and become embedded in the finished glass. These are also known as "stones", and can also break the glass when the glass is heated, as they create thermal anomalies.

== Thermal stresses ==

Breakage due to thermal stress is most common in large pieces of [[sealed insulating glass]] with heavy heat-absorbing (reflective) coatings. The coating is usually applied to the "number two" surface (the inside face of the outside lite). This causes the outside lite of glass to heat up more than the inside lite as the coating converts radiant heat from the Sun into sensible heat. As the outer lite expands due to heating, the entire unit bends outward. If the spacer bar or other edge condition connects the two lites of glass in a very rigid manner, bending stresses can develop which exceed the strength of the glass, causing breakage. This was the cause of extensive glass breakage at the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston.

== Inadequate glass thickness ==

A pane that is too large or thin, having not been properly engineered for wind loads on the site, can be broken by the wind. See [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli's Principle]] on wind.

== Remedies ==

Any breakage problem has more severe consequences where the glass is installed overhead or in public areas (such as in high-rise buildings). A [[Safety and security window film|safety window film]] can be applied to the tempered panes of glass to protect from its falling. An old-fashioned precaution was to install metal screens below skylights.

'''The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing''' ('''TILDA''') is a nationally representative [[longitudinal study]] of the population of Ireland aged 50 and above.  TILDA aims to understand how the health, social and financial circumstances of the older Irish population and how these factors interact. The study is led by [[Trinity College Dublin]] (TCD) in collaboration with a majority of the other principal academic institutions in Ireland. A wide range of experts from many disciplines have been involved from the outset in the development and execution of this study.

== Study design ==

The respondents for the TILDA study were derived from a nationally representative study of the population of Ireland aged 50 years and over. 8500 people were interviewed for Wave 1 of the study. This involved a Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI), a [[Health Assessment]] and a Self Completion Questionnaire. The Health Assessment involved [[cognitive]], [[gait]] and [[cardiovascular]] tests, as well as procedure to measure [[macular degeneration]]. This Health Assessment was carried out in TILDA health centres in [[Dublin]] and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A health assessment will be performed in Waves 1, 3 and 5. The CAPI and the SCQ will be performed in all waves.&lt;ref name="TILDA Background site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenny|first=Rose Anne|title=TILDA|url=http://www.tcd.ie/tilda/about/background/|work=TILDA Research Study|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data collection ==
The first wave of data collection was conducted between October 2009 and July 2011.  The second wave of data collection began in January 2012, and was scheduled to be completed in December 2012.&lt;ref name="Fifty Plus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenny|first=Rose Anne|title=Fifty Plus in Ireland 2011|year=2011|isbn=9781907894015|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TILDA Results"&gt;{{cite web|last=Reilly|first=James|title=First Results from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA)|url=http://healthupdate.gov.ie/minister-james-reilly/first-results-from-the-irish-longitudinal-study-on-ageing-tilda.html|work=TILDA Research Study|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related studies==
TILDA is designed to maximise comparability with other well-established international longitudinal studies, in particular [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) in the US, the [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe]] (SHARE), and the [[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA), and thereby to facilitate cross-country comparisons.

A [[Turing machine]] is a hypothetical computing device, first conceived by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936. Turing machines manipulate symbols on a potentially infinite strip of tape according to a finite table of rules, and they provide the theoretical underpinnings for the notion of a computer algorithm.

While none of the following models have been shown to have more power than the single-tape, one-way infinite, multi-symbol Turing-machine model, their authors defined and used them to investigate questions and solve problems more easily than they could have if they had stayed with Turing's ''a''-machine model.

== Machines equivalent to the Turing machine model ==

'''Turing equivalence'''

Many machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[John Hopcroft]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] | year = 1979| title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages and Computation| publisher = Addison–Wesley, Reading Mass| edition = 1st | isbn = 0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (The [[Church–Turing thesis]] ''hypothesizes'' this to be true: that anything that can be “computed” can be computed by some Turing machine.)

'''The sequential-machine models'''

All of the following are called "sequential machine models" to distinguish them from "parallel machine models".&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;[[Peter van Emde Boas]], ''Machine Models and Simulations''; [[Jan van Leeuwen]], ed. ''Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science. Volume A: Algorithms and Complexity'', p. 3-66, The MIT Press/Elsevier, 1990. {{ISBN|0-262-72014-0}} (volume A). QA76.H279 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tape-based Turing machines ==

'''Turing's ''a''-machine model'''

Turing's a-machine (as he called it) was left-ended, right-end-infinite. He provided symbols '''əə''' to mark the left end. Any of finite number of tape symbols were permitted. The instructions (if a universal machine), and the "input" and "out" were written only on "F-squares", and markers were to appear on "E-squares". In essence he divided his machine into two tapes that always moved together. The instructions appeared in a tabular form called "5-tuples" and were not executed sequentially.

=== Single-tape machines with restricted symbols and/or restricted instructions ===
The following models are single tape Turing machines but restricted with (i) restricted tape symbols { mark, blank }, and/or (ii) sequential, computer-like instructions, and/or (iii) machine-actions fully atomized.

==== Post's "Formulation 1" model of computation ====
{{details|Post–Turing machine}}

[[Emil Post]] in an independent description of a computational process, reduced the symbols allowed to the equivalent binary set of marks on the tape { "mark", "blank"=not_mark }. He changed the notion of "tape" from 1-way infinite to the right to an infinite set of rooms each with a sheet of paper in both directions. He atomized the Turing 5-tuples into 4-tuples—motion instructions separate from print/erase instructions. Although his 1936 model is ambiguous about this, Post's 1947 model did not require sequential instruction execution.

His extremely simple model can emulate any Turing machine, and although his 1936 ''Formulation 1'' does not use the word "program" or "machine", it is effectively a formulation of a very primitive programmable computer and associated [[programming language]], with the boxes acting as an unbounded bitstring memory, and the set of instructions constituting a program.

==== Wang machines ====
{{details|Wang B-machine}}

In an influential paper, [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] reduced Post's "[[Post–Turing machine#1936: Post model|formulation 1]]" to machines that still use a two-way infinite binary tape, but whose instructions are simpler — being the "atomic" components of Post's instructions — and are by default executed sequentially (like a "computer program").  His stated principal purpose was to offer, as an alternative to Turing's theory, one that "is more economical in the basic operations".  His results were "program formulations" of a variety of such machines, including the 5-instruction Wang W-machine with the instruction-set

: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, MARK-SQUARE, ERASE-SQUARE, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx }

and his most-severely reduced 4-instruction [[Wang B-machine]] ("B" for "basic") with the instruction-set
 
: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, MARK-SQUARE, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx }

which has not even an ERASE-SQUARE instruction.

Many authors later introduced variants of the machines discussed by Wang:

Minsky evolved Wang's notion with his version of the (multi-tape) "counter machine" model that allowed SHIFT-LEFT and SHIFT-RIGHT motion of the separate heads but no printing at all.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt; In this case the tapes would be left-ended, each end marked with a single "mark" to indicate the end. He was able to reduce this to a single tape, but at the expense of introducing multi-tape-square motion equivalent to multiplication and division rather than the much simpler { SHIFT-LEFT = DECREMENT, SHIFT-RIGHT = INCREMENT }.

Davis, adding an explicit HALT instruction to one of the machines discussed by Wang, used a model with the instruction-set

: { SHIFT-LEFT, SHIFT-RIGHT, ERASE, MARK, JUMP-IF-SQUARE-MARKED-to xxx, JUMP-to xxx, HALT }

and also considered versions with tape-alphabets of size larger than 2.

====Böhm's theoretical machine language P"====
{{details|P"}}
In keeping with Wang's project to seek a Turing-equivalent theory "economical in the basic operations", and wishing to avoid unconditional jumps, a notable theoretical language is the 4-instruction language [[P"]] introduced by [[Corrado Böhm]] in 1964 — the first "GOTO-less" imperative "[[structured programming]]" language to be proved [[Turing-complete]].

=== Multi-tape Turing machines ===
{{details|Multitape Turing machine}}

In practical analysis, various types of multi-tape Turing machines are often used.  Multi-tape machines are similar to single-tape machines, but there is some constant ''k'' number of independent tapes.

===Deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines===
{{details|non-deterministic Turing machine}}

If the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state then the machine is a "deterministic Turing machine" (DTM).  If the action table contains multiple entries for a combination of symbol and state then the machine is a "non-deterministic Turing machine" (NDTM). '''The two are computationally equivalent, that is, it is possible to turn any NDTM into a DTM (and ''vice versa'').''' This can be proved via construction.

=== Oblivious Turing machines ===

An oblivious Turing machine is a Turing machine where movement of the various heads are fixed functions of time, independent of the input.  In other words, there is a predetermined sequence in which the various tapes are scanned, advanced, and written to.  Pippenger and Fischer showed that any computation that can be performed by a multi-tape Turing machine in ''n'' steps can be performed by an oblivious two-tape Turing machine in {{tmath|O(n \log n)}} steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Nicholas|last=Pippenger|authorlink=Nick Pippenger|first2=Michael J.|last2=Fischer|authorlink2=Michael J. Fischer|title=Relations Among Complexity Measures|journal=J ACM|year=1979|volume=26|issue=3|pages=361–381|doi=10.1145/322123.322138}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Register machine models ==
{{details|Register machine}}

[[Peter van Emde Boas]] includes all machines of this type in one class, "the register machine".&lt;ref name="Boas" /&gt; However, historically the literature has also called the most primitive member of this group i.e. "the counter machine" -- "the register machine". And the most primitive embodiment of a "counter machine" is sometimes called the "Minsky machine".

=== The "counter machine", also called a "register machine" model ===
{{details|Counter machine}}

The primitive model register machine is, in effect, a multitape 2-symbol Post–Turing machine with its behavior restricted so its tapes act like simple "counters".

By the time of Melzak, Lambek, and Minsky the notion of a "computer program" produced a different type of simple machine with many left-ended tapes cut from a Post–Turing tape. In all cases the models permit only two tape symbols { mark, blank }.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt;

Some versions represent the positive integers as only a strings/stack of marks allowed in a "register" (i.e. left-ended tape), and a blank tape represented by the count "0". Minsky eliminated the PRINT instruction at the expense of providing his model with a mandatory single mark at the left-end of each tape.&lt;ref name="Marvin" /&gt;

In this model the single-ended tapes-as-registers are thought of as "counters", their instructions restricted to only two (or three if the TEST/DECREMENT instruction is atomized). Two common instruction sets are the following:
:(1): { INC ( r ), DEC ( r ), JZ ( r,z ) }, i.e.
::{ INCrement contents of register #r; DECrement contents of register #r; IF contents of #r=Zero THEN Jump-to Instruction #z}
:(2): { CLR ( r ); INC ( r ); JE ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, z ) }, i.e.
::{ CLeaR contents of register r; INCrement contents of r; compare contents of r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and if Equal then Jump to instruction z}

Although his model is more complicated than this simple description, the Melzak "pebble" model extended this notion of "counter" to permit multi-
pebble adds and subtracts.

=== The random-access machine (RAM) model ===
{{details|Random-access machine}}
 
Melzak recognized a couple serious defects in his register/counter-machine model:&lt;ref&gt;[[Z. A. Melzak]], ''An informal Arithmetical Approach to Computability and Computation'', Canadian Mathematical Bulletin, vol. 4, no. 3. September 1961 pages 279-293.&lt;/ref&gt; (i) Without a form of indirect addressing he would not be able to "easily" show the model is [[Turing completeness|Turing equivalent]], (ii) The program and registers were in different "spaces", so self-modifying programs would not be easy. When Melzak added indirect addressing to his model he created a random access machine model.

(However, with [[Gödel numbering]] of the instructions Minsky offered a proof that with such numbering the general [[recursion (computer science)|recursive function]]s were indeed possible; he offers proof that [[μ recursion]] is indeed possible&lt;ref name="Marvin"&gt;[[Marvin Minsky]], ''Computation: Finite and Infinite Machines'', Prentice–Hall, Inc., N.J., 1967. See Chapter 8, Section 8.2 "Unsolvability of the Halting Problem."&lt;/ref&gt;).

Unlike the RASP model, the RAM model does not allow the machine's actions to modify its instructions. Sometimes the model works only register-to-register with no accumulator, but most models seem to include an accumulator.

van Emde Boas divides the various RAM models into a number of sub-types:&lt;ref name="Boas" /&gt;
* SRAM, the "successor RAM" with only one arithmetic instruction, the successor (INCREMENT h). The others include "CLEAR h", and an IF equality-between-register THEN jump-to xxx.
* RAM: the standard model with addition and subtraction
* MRAM: the RAM agumented with multiplication and division
* BRAM, MBRAM: Bitwise Boolean versions of the RAM  and MRAM
* N****: Non-deterministic versions of any of the above with an N before the name

=== The random-access stored program (RASP) machine model ===
{{details|Random-access stored-program machine}}

The RASP is a RAM with the instructions stored together with their data in the same 'space' -- i.e. sequence of registers. The notion of a RASP was described at least as early as Kiphengst. His model had a "mill"—an accumulator, but now the instructions were in the registers with the data—the so-called [[von Neumann architecture]]. When the RASP has alternating even and odd registers—the even holding the "operation code" (instruction) and the odd holding its "operand" (parameter), then indirect addressing is achieved by simply modifying an instruction's operand.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Cook|Stephen A. Cook]] and Robert A. Reckhow (1972), ''Time-bounded random access machines'', Journal of Computer Systems Science 7 (1973), 354-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original RASP model of Elgot and Robinson had only three instructions in the fashion of the register-machine model,&lt;ref&gt;[[Calvin Elgot]] and [[Abraham Robinson]] (1964), ''Random-Access Stored-Program Machines, an Approach to Programming Languages'', Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Vol. 11, No. 4 (October, 1964), pp. 365-399.&lt;/ref&gt; but they placed them in the register space together with their data. (Here COPY takes the place of CLEAR when one register e.g. "z" or "0" starts with and always contains 0. This trick is not unusual. The unit 1 in register "unit" or "1" is also useful.) 
: { INC ( r ), COPY ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; ),  JE ( r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, z ) }

The RASP models allow indirect as well as direct-addressing; some allow "immediate" instructions too, e.g. "Load accumulator with the constant 3". The instructions may be of a highly restricted set such as the following 16 instructions of Hartmanis.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Hartmanis]] (1971), "Computational Complexity of Random Access Stored Program Machines," Mathematical Systems Theory 5, 3 (1971) pp. 232-245.&lt;/ref&gt; This model uses an accumulator A. The mnemonics are those that the authors used (their CLA is "load accumulator" with constant or from register; STO is "store accumulator"). Their syntax is the following, excepting the jumps: "n, &lt;n&gt;, &lt;&lt;n&gt;&gt;" for "immediate", "direct" and "indirect"). Jumps are via two "Transfer instructions" TRA—unconditional jump by directly "n" or indirectly "&lt; n &gt;" jamming contents of register n into the instruction counter, TRZ (conditional jump if Accumulator is zero in the same manner as TRA): 
:{ ADD n , ADD &lt; n &gt;, ADD &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, SUB n, SUB &lt; n &gt;, SUB &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, CLA n, CLA &lt; n &gt;, CLA &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, STO &lt; n &gt;, STO &lt;&lt; n &gt;&gt;, TRA n, TRA &lt; n &gt;, TRZ n, TRA &lt; n &gt;, HALT }

=== The Pointer machine model ===
{{details|Pointer machine}}

A relative late-comer is Schönhage's Storage Modification Machine or [[pointer machine]]. Another version is the Kolmogorov-Uspensii machine, and the Knuth "linking automaton" proposal. (For references see [[pointer machine]]). Like a state-machine diagram, a node emits at least two labelled "edges" (arrows) that point to another node or nodes which in turn point to other nodes, etc. The outside world points at the center node.

==Machines with input and output==
Any of the above tape-based machines can be equipped with input and output tapes; any of the above register-based machines can be equipped with dedicated input and output registers. For example, the Schönhage pointer-machine model has two instructions called "''input'' ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and "''output'' ''β''".

It is difficult to study [[sublinear]] [[space complexity]] on multi-tape machines with the traditional model, because an input of size ''n'' already takes up space ''n''.  Thus, to study small [[DSPACE]] classes, we must use a different model.  In some sense, if we never "write to" the input tape, we don't want to charge ourself for this space.  And if we never "read from" our output tape, we don't want to charge ourself for this space.

We solve this problem by introducing a ''k''-string Turing machine with input and output.  This is the same as an ordinary ''k''-string Turing machine, except that the transition function {{mvar|&amp;delta;}} is restricted so that the input tape can never be changed, and so that the output head can never move left.  This model allows us to define deterministic space classes smaller than linear.  Turing machines with input-and-output also have the same time complexity as other Turing machines; in the words of Papadimitriou 1994 Prop 2.2:

:For any ''k''-string Turing machine ''M'' operating within time bound {{tmath|f(n)}} there is a {{tmath|(k+2)}}-string Turing machine ''M''’ with input and output, which operates within time bound {{tmath|O(f(n))}}.

''k''-string Turing machines with input and output can be used in the formal definition of the complexity resource [[DSPACE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = [[Christos Papadimitriou]] | year = 1993 | title = Computational Complexity | publisher = Addison Wesley | edition = 1st | isbn = 0-201-53082-1}} Chapter 2: Turing machines, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uniform field theory''' is a formula for determining the effective [[electrical resistance]] of a parallel wire system. By calculating the mean square field acting throughout a section of coil, formulae are obtained for the effective resistances of single- and multi-layer solenoidal coils of either solid or stranded wire.&lt;ref&gt;E.

'''''Uriel's Machine: The Prehistoric Technology That Survived the Flood''''' is a bestselling book published in 1999 by [[Christopher Knight (author)|Christopher Knight]] and [[Robert Lomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Books: Best-sellers|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=11 July 1999|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's name is derived from a character of the same name in the ''[[Book of Enoch]]''.  In Knight and Lomas's interpretation of the ''Book of Enoch'', [[Uriel]] warns [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] about the impending [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]], giving him instructions for building a form of solar observatory for the purpose of preserving advanced knowledge into a time of global disaster by teaching him the movement of the Sun against the horizon over a period of time, which Enoch then records in detail in the ''[[Book of Enoch#The Astronomical Book|Book of the Courses of the Heavenly Luminaries]]''.

== Summary ==
In [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] mythology there are many references to seven, which the authors speculate could refer to seven cometary fragments. These seven cometary fragments are described in the book as hitting the earth in prehistory causing [[tsunami]]s. The authors link this speculation to [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide|the work of geologists Edith and Alexander Tollmann]].&lt;ref name="Kristan-TollmannOthers1994"&gt;Kristan-Tollmann, E. and A. Tollmann, 1994, ''The youngest big impact on Earth deduced from geological and historical evidence''. Terra Nova. v. 6, no. 2, pp. 209-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Their work proposes a series of meteors hitting the earth over the last 10,000 years, especially circa 7640 BC. Their evidence and counter-evidence is discussed in the article [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]].

The book proposes that what the authors believe to have been stellar observatories (such as the first wooden [[Stonehenge]]) in Britain, and structures in the [[Boyne Valley]] in Ireland, show sufficient knowledge to be able to predict prescribed solar, lunar and venusian events and cycles, such as solstices and equinoxes. If rituals at Stonehenge involved stargazing, there is then the opportunity for an anomalous object to be spotted far more quickly if the cycles of observed celestial objects are known.

The authors quote textual evidence from the [[book of Enoch]], noting other coincidences made between Enoch and astronomy; for example, it is said he lived 365 years, which could be a reference to a year (365.25 days).
 
The authors suggest that chambers ([[souterrain]]s) found in Britain might have been attempts to build shelters to be sealed against [[tsunamis]] that would have been caused by a cometary impact in the sea. However, the souterrains have been dated to the late Iron Age, thousands of years after the supposed impact event.

Archaeologists and astronomers have been extremely sceptical about this idea. Prof Archie Roy (an astronomer and psychic researcher) and [[Robert Lomas]] gave a joint talk about technological possibilities in Megalithic society at the 2000 Orkney International Science.

== Critical response ==
[[Tim Schadla-Hall]], archaeologist and editor of the journal ''[[Public Archaeology]]'', has cited the book as an example of [[pseudoscience]], in which the authors "quote established academics in such a way as to make it seem as though they support their arguments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The comforts of unreason: the importance and relevance of alternative archaeology|editor-last=Merriman|editor-first=Nick|title=Public Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London|date=2004|page=260|isbn=9780415258890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geology in the book is based on [[Tollmann's hypothetical bolide]] which has been rejected by specialists in [[meteorite]] and [[comet]] impacts.&lt;ref name="DeutschOthers1993"&gt;Deutsch, A., C. Koeberl, J.D. Blum, B.M. French, B.P. Glass, R. Grieve, P. Horn, E.K. Jessberger, G. Kurat, W.U. Reimold, J. Smit, D. stoffler, and S.R. Taylor, 1994, ''The impact-flood connection: Does it exist?'' Terra Nova. v. 6, pp. 644-650.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Tonkin, author and astronomer, said: "I believe that the astronomical basis of this book is sufficiently flawed as to render any conclusions that the authors draw from it to be highly suspect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tonkin|first=Stephen|date=2003|url=http://astunit.com/astrocrud.php?topic=uriel|title=Uriel's Machine – a Commentary on some of the Astronomical Assertions|work=The Astronomical Unit|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|Mike Pitts]], archaeologist and journalist, says that the book contains "what we might politely call a radically alternative approach to Grooved Ware pottery" and notes that the book's bibliography contains "such items as Myths and Legends of Australia, Robert the Bruce ''and'' The Pleistocene Elephants of Siberia, but not a single primary archaeological source for England (where, it has to be said, a great deal of Grooved Ware has been found)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitts|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Pitts (archaeologist)|date=2000|title=Hengeworld|publisher=[[Random House|Century]]|location=London|isbn=9780099278757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|vascular tissue in plants|transport in animals|Circulatory system}}
'''Vascular tissue''' is a complex conducting [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], formed of more than one cell type, found in [[vascular plant]]s. The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two [[meristem]]s associated with vascular tissue: the [[vascular cambium]] and the [[cork cambium]].  All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the '''vascular tissue system''' of that plant.

The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes.  The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue [[cellular differentiation|differentiates]] in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant.
The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called [[vascular bundles]].  These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells.  In [[plant stem|stems]] and [[root]]s, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem.  In the stems of some Asterales [[dicot]]s, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.

Between the xylem and phloem is a [[meristem]] called the vascular cambium.  This tissue divides off [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length.  As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout.  In [[tree]]s and other plants that develop [[wood]], the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the stem, woody plants also have a [[cork cambium]] that develops among the phloem.  The cork cambium gives rise to thickened [[cork (tissue)|cork]] cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.  Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of [[secondary growth]].

In [[leaf|leaves]], the vascular bundles are located among the spongy [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]]. The xylem is oriented toward the [[adaxial]] surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the [[abaxial]] surface of the leaf.  This is why [[aphid]]s are typically found on the undersides of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
