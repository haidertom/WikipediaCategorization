'''Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud''' (18 June 1923 – 8 May 2007) was a [[Saudi]] [[businessman]] and a senior member of [[House of Saud]]. He held several cabinet posts in the [[government of Saudi Arabia]] in the 1950s.

==Early life and education==
Prince Abdullah was born in [[Riyadh]] in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources list 1921 or 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chai2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Winberg Chai|title=Saudi Arabia: A Modern Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lh4bENPP_HEC&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=22 September 2005|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-88093-859-4|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{cite web|title=Abdullah Al Faisal|url=http://rulers.org/indexa1.html|publisher=Rulers|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the eldest son of [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]].&lt;ref name=ssabri/&gt;&lt;ref name=nlud5apr&gt;{{cite news|last=Luddington|first=Nick|title=King Faisal's eight sons|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j58gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m2gFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1190,870999&amp;dq=kamal+adham&amp;hl=en|accessdate=26 February 2013|newspaper=Lewiston Evening Journal|date=5 April 1975|agency=AP|location=Jeddah}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Sultana Al Sudairi, daughter of Ahmed bin Muhammad Al Sudairi.&lt;ref name=succ/&gt; Abdullah bin Faisal's mother and the mother of the [[Sudairi Seven]], [[Hussa bint Ahmed Al Sudairi]], were sisters.

They never saw each other until the marriage. She also bore him three daughters. They later divorced.&lt;ref name=dasultana/&gt;

Abdullah bin Faisal completed his education in [[Mecca]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=ssabri/&gt; He was older than the majority of [[King Abdulaziz]]'s children i.e. his uncles and aunts.&lt;ref name=succ/&gt;

==Career==
Abdullah bin Faisal assumed a number of government positions. He started his political career in 1945 when he disputed his half-uncle [[Mansour bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Mansour]]'s appointment as acting viceroy of [[Hijaz]] and actually assumed the office one year later.&lt;ref name=succ&gt;{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79Fs5bLPgBYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=succession+in+saudi+arabia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFljq6DjSQ&amp;sig=jUyMCiI4Fo3DWpozWA8fR6pC9jY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CuZ-T7bEK9Gp0AWAuoGTBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=succession%20in%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the minister of health from 1949 to 1950.&lt;ref name=anews2007/&gt; Then, he was appointed minister of interior in 1951, being the first interior minister of the Kingdom.&lt;ref name=ssabri/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1953&gt;{{cite book|title=Advisers, heirs and heir apparent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=21 April 2013|date=21 December 1953|publisher=Time|pages=72|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in this post during the reign of King Abdulaziz and also, of [[King Saud]].&lt;ref name="Inc1953"&gt;{{cite book|title=House of Saud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=21 December 1953|publisher=Time|pages=66|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His term lasted until 1959 when he resigned.&lt;ref name=anews2007&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmad|first=Mahmoud|title=Abdullah Al-Faisal Passes Away|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/298147|accessdate=25 March 2012|newspaper=Arab News|date=9 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment as minister of health and of interior was a move to make him equal in status to then-minister of defense [[Mishaal bin Abdul-Aziz|Prince Mishaal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertog|first=Steffen|title=Shaping the Saudi State: Human agency's shifting role in rentier-state formation|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|year=2007|volume=39|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29872/1/Shaping_the_Saudi_state_(publisher).pdf|pages=539–563|doi=10.1017/S0020743807071073|accessdate=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah bin Faisal received a number of international honors including an honorary doctorate degree in humanities.&lt;ref name=anews2007/&gt; He was rewarded with the State Acknowledgement Award for Literature in 1984. A composer of both classical and colloquial poetry, his works include the collection The Inspiration of Deprivation (Min Wahye al Hirman), 1980. A number of singers have sung his poems, including the famous Egyptian singer, Um Kulthoum.

He was formerly chairman of [[Al-Ahli SC (Jeddah)|Al-Ahli]] Club.&lt;ref name=anews2007/&gt;

==Works==
His publications include:
* ''Mahrum: Min Wahye al Hirman''

Prince Abdullah's poems were put into music and sung by the Egyptian singer [[Umm Kulthum|Umm Khalthoum]].&lt;ref name=nlud5apr/&gt;

'''Abrasive blasting''', more commonly known as '''sandblasting''', is the operation of forcibly propelling a stream of [[abrasive]] material against a surface under high [[pressure]] to smooth a [[surface roughness|rough]] surface, roughen a smooth surface, shape a surface or remove surface [[contaminant]]s. A pressurised fluid, typically [[compressed air]], or a [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] wheel is used to propel the blasting material (often called the ''media''). The first abrasive blasting process was [[patent]]ed by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]] on 18 October 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smil|first=Vaclav|title=Creating the twentieth century: technical innovations of 1867–1914 and their lasting impact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3Mh7qQRM-IC&amp;pg=PA211|isbn=978-0-19-516874-7|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variants of the process, using various media; some are highly abrasive, whereas others are milder. The most abrasive are shot blasting (with metal [[shot (pellet)|shot]]) and sandblasting (with [[sand]]). Moderately abrasive variants include glass bead blasting (with glass [[bead]]s) and media blasting with ground-up plastic stock or [[walnut]] shells and [[corncob]]s.  Some of these substances can cause anaphylactic shock to both operators and passers by.&lt;ref&gt;See: Travis McEwan, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-walnut-death-work-site-1.4368171 Edmonton worker allergic to walnuts dies after inhaling particles at worksite,"] [[CBC News]], 23 October 2017. ''(Retrieved 2017-10-25)''&lt;/ref&gt; A mild version is [[sodablasting]] (with [[sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]]). In addition, there are alternatives that are barely abrasive or nonabrasive, such as [[ice blasting (cleaning)|ice blasting]] and [[dry-ice blasting]].

==Types==
===Sandblasting===
Sandblasting or bead blasting is a generic term for the process of smoothing, shaping and cleaning a hard surface by forcing solid particles across that surface at high speeds; the effect is similar to that of using [[sandpaper]], but provides a more even finish with no problems at corners or crannies. Sandblasting can occur naturally, usually as a result of particles blown by [[wind]] causing [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] [[erosion]], or artificially, using [[compressed air]].  An artificial sandblasting process was [[patent]]ed by [[Benjamin Chew Tilghman]] on 18 October 1870.

Sandblasting equipment typically consists of a chamber in which sand and air are mixed. The mixture travels through a hand-held nozzle to direct the particles toward the surface or workpiece. Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. Boron carbide is a popular material for nozzles because it resists abrasive wear well.

===Wet abrasive blasting===
One of the original pioneers of the wet abrasive (vapourmatting) process was Norman Ashworth who found the advantages of using a wet process a strong alternative to dry blasting. The process is available in all conventional formats including hand cabinets, walk-in booths, automated production machinery and total loss portable blasting units. Advantages include the ability to use extremely fine or coarse media with densities ranging from [[plastic]] to [[steel]] and the ability to use hot water and soap to allow simultaneous degreasing and blasting.  The reduction in dust also makes it safer to use silicacious materials for blasting, or to remove hazardous material such as [[asbestos]], [[Radiation|radioactive]] or poisonous products.

Process speeds are generally not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media, in part because the presence of water between the media and the substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the surface and the media, reducing breakdown rates. Reduced impregnation of blasting material into the surface, dust reduction and the elimination of static cling can result in a very clean surface. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[stainless steel]] and [[carbon steel|mild steel]] items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.

===Bead blasting===
[[Image:2018 Bead blasting.jpg | right | thumb | 220px | Bead blasting paint from a concrete curb. Mixing particles with water substantially reduces dust.]]
''Bead blasting'' is the process of removing surface deposits by applying fine glass beads at a high pressure without damaging the surface. It is used to clean calcium deposits from pool tiles or any other surfaces, remove embedded fungus, and brighten [[grout]] color. It is also used in [[auto body]] work to remove paint.  In removing paint for auto body work, bead blasting is preferred over sand blasting, as sand blasting tends to create a greater surface profile than bead blasting.  Bead blasting is often used in creating a uniform surface finish on machined parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://parts-badger.com/the-cnc-process/surface-finishes/|title=Surface Finishes - Parts Badger|work=Parts Badger|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is additionally used in cleaning mineral specimens, most of which have a [[Mohs scale|Mohs hardness]] of 7 or less and would thus be damaged by sand.

===Wheel blasting===
In wheel blasting, a spinning wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation because there is no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, [[Wire saw|cut wire]], grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and [[rubber]] components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted as well as on the expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRIDGEPORT PROJECT / SOUTHWEST DIVISION HISTORY|url=http://www.crra.org/pages/proj_bridgeport_history.htm|accessdate=9 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100931/http://crra.org/pages/proj_bridgeport_history.htm| archivedate= 23 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro-blasting===
Hydro blasting is not a form of abrasive blasting as no abrasive media is used. Hydro-blasting, commonly known as water blasting, is commonly used because it usually requires only one operator. In hydro-blasting, a highly pressured stream of water is used to remove old paint, chemicals, or buildup without damaging the original surface. This method is ideal for cleaning internal and external surfaces because the operator is generally able to send the stream of water into places that are difficult to reach using other methods. Another benefit of hydro-blasting is the ability to recapture and reuse the water, reducing waste and mitigating environmental impact.

===Micro-abrasive blasting===
{{Main|Abrasive jet machining}}
Micro-abrasive blasting is dry abrasive blasting process that uses small nozzles (typically 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm to 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter) to deliver a fine stream of abrasive accurately to a small part or a small area on a larger part. Generally the area to be blasted is from about 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to only a few cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at most. Also known as pencil blasting, the fine jet of abrasive is accurate enough to write directly on glass and delicate enough to cut a pattern in an [[eggshell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary F. |last=Benedict |title=Nontraditional Manufacturing Processes |chapter=Figure 2.1 An AJM-machined egg shell... |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdmNVSio8jUC&amp;pg=PA6 |date=1987 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-7352-6 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abrasive media particle sizes range from 10 micrometres up to about 150 micrometres. Higher pressures are often required.

The most common micro-abrasive blasting systems are commercial bench-mounted units consisting of a power supply and mixer, exhaust hood, nozzle, and gas supply. The nozzle can be hand-held or fixture mounted for automatic operation. Either the nozzle or part can be moved in automatic operation.

===Automated blasting===
Automated blasting is simply the [[automation]] of the abrasive blasting process. Automated blasting is frequently just a step in a larger automated procedure, usually involving other surface treatments such as preparation and coating applications. Care is often needed to isolate the blasting chamber from mechanical components that may be subject to [[Fouling|dust fouling]].

=== Dry-ice blasting ===
{{main|Dry-ice blasting}}
In this type of blasting, air and [[dry ice]] are used. Surface contaminants are dislodged by the force of frozen carbon dioxide particles hitting at high velocity, and by slight shrinkage due to freezing which disrupts adhesion bonds. The dry ice [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimates]], leaving no residue to clean up other than the removed material. Dry ice is a relatively [[hardness|soft]] material, so is less destructive to the underlying material than sandblasting.

===Bristle blasting===
{{Main|Bristle blasting}}
Bristle blasting, unlike other blasting methods, does not require a separate blast media. The surface is treated by a brush-like [[rotary tool]] made of dynamically tuned high-[[carbon steel]] wire bristles. Repeated contact with the sharp, rotating bristle tips results in localized impact, rebound, and crater formation, which simultaneously cleans and coarsens the surface.

===Vacuum blasting===
{{Main| Vacuum blasting}}
Vacuum blasting is a method that generates very little [[dust]] and spill, as the blast tool does dry abrasive blasting and collects used blast media and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. Blast media consumption is relatively low with this method, as the used blast media is automatically separated from dust and loosened particles, and reused several times.

==Equipment==
[[File:Sandblasting2.jpg|thumb|upright|Device used for adding sand to the compressed air (top of which is a sieve for adding the sand)]]

===Portable blast equipment===
Mobile dry abrasive blast systems are typically powered by a diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple "blast pots". Blast pots are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main blasting line. The number of blast pots is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-tractor trailers]], offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site. Others are [[Hopper (particulate collection container)|hopper]]-fed types making them lightweight and more mobile.

In wet blasting, the abrasive is introduced into a pressurized stream of water or other liquid, creating a [[slurry]]. Wet blasting is often used in applications where the minimal dust generation is desired. Portable applications may or may not recycle the abrasive.

===Blast cabinet===
[[File:Cabine de sablage arena.JPG|thumb|upright|A sand-blasting cabinet]]

A blast cabinet is essentially a closed loop system that allows the operator to blast the part and recycle the abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-sandblasting-cabinet.htm|title=What is a Sandblasting Cabinet? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of four components; the containment (cabinet), the abrasive blasting system, the abrasive recycling system and the dust collection. The operator blasts the parts from the outside of the cabinet by placing his arms in gloves attached to glove holes on the cabinet, viewing the part through a view window, turning the blast on and off using a foot pedal or [[treadle]]. Automated blast cabinets are also used to process large quantities of the same component and may incorporate multiple blast nozzles and a part conveyance system.

There are three systems typically used in a blast cabinet. Two, siphon and pressure, are dry and one is wet:

* A siphon blast system (suction blast system) uses the compressed air to create vacuum in a chamber (known as the blast gun). The negative pressure pulls abrasive into the blast gun where the compressed air directs the abrasive through a blast nozzle. The abrasive mixture travels through a nozzle that directs the particles toward the surface or workpiece.

Nozzles come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. [[Tungsten carbide]] is the liner material most often used for mineral abrasives. Silicon carbide and boron carbide nozzles are more wear resistant and are often used with harder abrasives such as aluminum oxide. Inexpensive abrasive blasting systems and smaller cabinets use ceramic nozzles.

* In a pressure blast system, the abrasive is stored in the pressure vessel then sealed. The vessel is pressurized to the same pressure as the blast hose attached to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The abrasive is metered into the blast hose and conveyed by the compressed gas through the blast nozzle.
* Wet blast cabinets use a system that injects the abrasive/liquid slurry into a compressed gas stream. Wet blasting is typically used when the heat produced by friction in dry blasting would damage the part.

===Blast room===
A blast room is a much larger version of a blast cabinet. Blast operators work inside the room to roughen, smooth, or clean surfaces of an item depending on the needs of the finished product. Blast rooms and blast facilities come in many sizes, some of which are big enough to accommodate very large or uniquely shaped objects like rail cars, commercial and military vehicles, construction equipment, and aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Eric G.|date=2005-09-01|title=How to Create an Abrasive Air Blast Room|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0026057605807226|journal=Metal Finishing|volume=103|issue=9|pages=44–46|doi=10.1016/S0026-0576(05)80722-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each application may require the use of many different pieces of equipment, however, there are several key components that can be found in a typical blast room:
* An enclosure or containment system, usually the room itself, designed to remain sealed to prevent blast media from escaping
* A blasting system; wheel blasting and air blasting systems are commonly used
* A blast pot — a pressurized container filled with abrasive blasting media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.corrosionpedia.com/definition/1979/blast-pot-corrosion|title=What is a Blast Pot? - Definition from Corrosionpedia|work=Corrosionpedia|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A dust collection system which filters the air in the room and prevents particulate matter from escaping
* A material recycling or media reclamation system to collect abrasive blasting media so it can be used again; these can be automated mechanical or pneumatic systems installed in the floor of the blast room, or the blast media can be collected manually by sweeping or shoveling the material back into the blast pot
Additional equipment can be added for convenience and improved usability, such as overhead cranes for maneuvering the workpiece, wall-mounted units with multiple axes that allow the operator to reach all sides of the workpiece, and sound-dampening materials used to reduce noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.delongequipment.com/blast-rooms/|title=Blast rooms|last=|first=|date=|work=DeLong Equipment|access-date=2017-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113193022/http://www.delongequipment.com/blast-rooms/|archive-date=2016-11-13|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In the early 1900s, it was assumed that sharp-edged grains provided the best performance, but this was later demonstrated not to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;1919 Popular Science article on types of minerals found to be suitable for sandblasting – ''Little Grains of Sand'', ''[[Popular Science]]'' monthly, February 1919, page 64, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=7igDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral: [[Silica sand]] can be used as a type of mineral abrasive. It tends to break up quickly, creating large quantities of dust, exposing the operator to the potential development of [[silicosis]], a debilitating [[Respiratory disease|lung disease]]. To counter this hazard, silica sand for blasting is often coated with resins to control the dust. Using silica as an abrasive is not allowed in [[Germany]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Sweden]], or [[Belgium]] for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSHA Asked to Ban Silica in Abrasive Blasting|url=http://www.paintsquare.com/news/?fuseaction=view&amp;id=2875|publisher=Paint Square|accessdate=9 June 2011|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silica is a common abrasive in countries where it is not banned.&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/blasting/ |title = Abrasive Blasting |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date = 16 April 2011 |accessdate = 22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common mineral abrasive is [[garnet]]. Garnet is more expensive than silica sand, but if used correctly, will offer equivalent production rates while producing less dust and no safety hazards from ingesting the dust.  Magnesium sulphate, or [[kieserite]], is often used as an alternative to [[baking soda]].

Agricultural: Typically, crushed nut shells or fruit kernels. These soft abrasives are used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing [[graffiti]], or the removal of coatings from printed [[circuit board]]s being repaired.

Synthetic:  This category includes [[corn starch]], [[wheat starch]], [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[dry-ice blasting|dry ice]]. These "soft" abrasives are also used to avoid damaging the underlying material such when cleaning brick or stone, removing graffiti, or the removal of coatings from printed circuit boards being repaired. Sodablasting uses baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) which is extremely [[Friability|friable]], the micro fragmentation on impact exploding away surface materials without damage to the substrate.

Additional synthetic abrasives include process byproducts (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[copper slag]], [[nickel]] [[slag]], and [[coal]] slag), engineered abrasives (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[aluminum oxide]], [[silicon carbide]] or carborundum, glass beads, ceramic shot/grit), and recycled products (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;plastic abrasive, glass grit).

Metallic: Steel shot, steel grit, stainless steel shot, cut wire, copper shot, aluminum shot, zinc shot.

Many coarser media used in sandblasting often result in energy being given off as sparks or light on impact. The colours and size of the spark or glow varies significantly, with heavy bright orange sparks from steel shot blasting, to a faint blue glow (often invisible in [[sunlight]] or brightly lit work areas) from garnet abrasive.

Cleaning operations using abrasive blasting can present risks for [[occupational safety and health|workers' health and safety]], specifically in portable air blasting or blast room (booth) applications. There is a large amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt; Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (steel shot and grit, cast iron, [[aluminum oxide]], garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, [[copper slag]], nickel slag, and [[staurolite]]) have varying degrees of hazard (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye [[lesion]]s), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an [[explosive]] atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system.&lt;ref name="niosh_topic"&gt;{{cite web|title = Abrasive Blasting|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/blasting/|work = NIOSH Topics|publisher = NIOSH|accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) mandates engineered solutions to potential hazards, however silica sand continues to be allowed even though most commonly used blast helmets are not sufficiently effective at protecting the blast operator if ambient levels of dust exceed allowable limits. Adequate levels of respiratory protection for blast operations in the United States is approved by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH).
{{Clear}}
Typical safety equipment for operators includes:
* Positive pressure blast hood or helmet – The hood or helmet includes a head suspension system to allow the device to move with the operator's head, a view window with replaceable lens or lens protection and an air-feed hose.
* Grade‑D air supply (or self-contained oil-less air pump) – The air feed hose is typically attached to a grade‑D pressurized air supply.  Grade‑D air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less air pump to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less air pump does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate [[carbon monoxide]].
* Hearing protection – ear muffs or ear plugs
* Body protection – Body protection varies by application but usually consists of gloves and overalls or a leather coat and chaps. Professionals would wear a cordura/canvas blast suit (unless blasting with steel abrasives, then they would use a leather suit).

In the past, when sandblasting was performed as an open-air job, the worker was exposed to risk of injury from the flying material and lung damage from inhaling the dust. The [[silica]] dust produced in the sandblasting process would cause silicosis after sustained [[inhalation]] of the dust. In 1918, the first sandblasting enclosure was built, which protected the worker with a viewing screen, revolved around the workpiece, and used an exhaust fan to draw dust away from the worker's face.&lt;ref&gt;''Making Things Easier for the Sand-Blaster'', Popular Science monthly, December 1918, page 76, scanned by [https://books.google.com/books?id=EikDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Silicosis is still a risk when the operator is not completely isolated from the sandblasting apparatus.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt;

Sandblasting also may present secondary risks, such as falls from [[scaffolding]] or confinement in a small space.&lt;ref name="NIOSH" /&gt; [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is another potential risk, from the use of small gasoline-powered engines in abrasive blasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FACE 9131|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/face/In-house/full9131.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries and territories now regulate sandblasting such that it may only be performed in a controlled environment using ventilation, protective clothing and breathing air supply.

===Worn-look jeans===
Many consumers are willing to pay extra for [[jeans]] that have the appearance of being used. To give the fabrics the right worn look sandblasting is used. Sandblasting has the risk of causing [[silicosis]] to the workers, and in [[Turkey]], more than 5,000 workers in the [[textile industry]] suffer from silicosis, and 46 people are known to have died from it. Silicosis was shown to be very common among former denim sandblasters in Turkey in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/5/1295|title=An epidemic of silicosis among former denim sandblasters|first1=M.|last1=Akgun|first2=O.|last2=Araz|first3=I.|last3=Akkurt|first4=A.|last4=Eroglu|first5=F.|last5=Alper|first6=L.|last6=Saglam|first7=A.|last7=Mirici|first8=M.|last8=Gorguner|first9=B.|last9=Nemery|date=1 November 2008|publisher=|journal=European Respiratory Journal|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1295–1303|accessdate=2 April 2018|via=erj.ersjournals.com|doi=10.1183/09031936.00093507|pmid=18579544}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study confirmed that silicosis is almost inevitable among former sandblasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silicosis Appears Inevitable Among Former Denim Sandblasters |date=September 2015 |url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=2108970 |journal=Chest |publisher=American College of Chest Physicians |volume=148 |issue=3 |doi=10.1378/chest.14-2848|pmc=4556121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sweden]]'s Fair Trade Center conducted a survey among 17 textile companies that showed very few were aware of the dangers caused by manually sandblasting jeans. Several companies said they would abolish this technique from their own production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Buer, Kathleen |title= Dette dør folk for |trans-title=People are dying for this |url= http://www.tv2nyhetene.no/utenriks/dette-doer-folk-for-3363725.html |work= [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV&amp;nbsp;2 Norway]] |language= Norwegian |date= 11 December 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, research claimed that in China some factories producing worn-look jeans are involved in varied non-compliance with health and safety regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waronwant.org/news/latest-news/17936-the-human-cost-of-distressed-jeans |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714155350/http://www.waronwant.org/news/latest-news/17936-the-human-cost-of-distressed-jeans |archive-date=14 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
The lettering and engraving on most modern [[cemetery]] monuments and markers is created by abrasive blasting.

Sandblasting can also be used to produce three-dimensional signage. This type of signage is considered to be a higher-end product as compared to flat signs. These signs often incorporate gold leaf overlay and sometimes crushed glass backgrounds which is called [[Cobalt glass|smalt]]s. When sandblasting wood signage it allows the wood grains to show and the [[Dendrochronology#Growth rings|growth rings]] to be raised, and is a popular way to give a sign a traditional carved look. Sandblasting can also be done on clear [[acrylic glass]] and [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as part of a store front or [[interior design]].

Sandblasting can be used to refurbish buildings or create works of art (carved or [[frosted glass]]). Modern masks and resists facilitate this process, producing accurate results.

Sandblasting techniques are used for cleaning boat [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s, as well as brick, stone, and concrete work. Sandblasting is used for cleaning industrial as well as commercial structures, but is rarely used for non-metallic workpieces.

A fairly small stake (less than 10% of outstanding shares) may be enough to launch a successful campaign. In comparison, a full takeover bid is a much more costly and difficult undertaking.

The financial form of shareholder activism has gained popularity as management compensation at [[publicly traded]] companies and cash balances on corporate [[balance sheet]]s have risen. Not only are the aggregate dollars invested in the activist asset class continuing to grow, but activists are also generating significant positive attention from mainstream media by taking more sophisticated approaches to identifying their platforms and running their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grossman|first1=Richard|last2=Arcano|first2=Stephen|title=Navigating Today’s Shareholder Activism Landscape|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/navigating-today%E2%80%99s-shareholder-activism-landscape|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108172335/https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/navigating-today%E2%80%99s-shareholder-activism-landscape|archivedate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once derided as corporate raiders, shareholder activists are now the recipients of admiration for sparking change in corporate boardrooms, leading to corporate boards developing best practices for responding to shareholder activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golden|first1=Peter|last2=Richter|first2=Philip|last3=Schwenkel|first3=Robert|last4=Shine|first4=David|last5=Sorkin|first5=John|last6=Weinstein|first6=Gail|title=Shareholder Activism in M&amp;A|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/shareholder-activism-ma|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109205147/https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/shareholder-activism-ma|archivedate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists increasingly are transitioning from outside agitators to influential insiders.

The practice of [[shareholder activism]] has its roots in the 17th-century [[Dutch Republic]], with pioneering activist shareholders like [[Isaac Le Maire]], a sizeable [[shareholder]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).&lt;ref&gt;Frentrop, Paul (2009).

== Notable investors ==
During the 1980s, notable activist investors such as Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens gained international notoriety and were often perceived as "corporate raiders" for acquiring an equity stake in publicly owned companies, like Icahn's investment in B.F. Goodrich, and then forcing companies to take action to improve value or rid themselves of rebel intruders like Icahn by buying back the raider's investment at a fat premium, often at the expense of the other shareholders.

In an Opalesque TV interview with notable activist investor [[Phillip Goldstein (investor)|Phillip Goldstein]] of Bulldog Investors, Goldstein describes the role of an activist investor as that of a catalyst unlocking value in an underlying security. He goes on to say that the public perception of activist investors has changed, and this image of "corporate raiders" has dissipated.&lt;ref name="opalesque"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opalesque.tv/youtube/Phil_Goldstein/1|title=Phil Goldstein: The Bulldog's passion for value investing|website=Opalesque TV|date=21 Jan 2011|accessdate=15 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable scholarship ==
New research published at [[The University of Oxford]] revisits the assumption that all shareholder activism is the same, characterizing [[Bill Ackman]]'s activities with [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] as paradigmatic of "engaged activism" – which is longer term in nature with correlated benefits to the real economy, as distinct from shorter term "financial activism".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rojas |first1=Claudio |title=Eclipse of the Public Corporation Revisited: Concentrated Equity Ownership Theory |url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership |website=The University of Oxford |accessdate=June 27, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728175011/https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/06/eclipse-public-corporation-revisited-concentrated-equity-ownership |archivedate=July 28, 2017}} ("A common misconception, that all shareholder activists are focused on short-term returns, is rooted in an antiquated phase in US capital markets history – particularly, the highly opportunistic transactions of 1980’s ‘corporate raiders’.

== Performance ==

Taking an activist approach to public investing may produce returns in excess of those likely to be achieved passively. A 2012 study by [http://www.activistinsight.com Activist Insight] showed that the mean annual net return of over 40 activist-focused [[hedge fund]]s had consistently outperformed the MSCI world index in the years following the global financial crisis in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Activist Insight: "New Shareholder Activist Index Reveals Rewards of Activist Investing" {{cite web |url=http://www.activistinsight.com/press/Activist%20Insight%20Press%20Release%20-%20Activism%20Outperforms%20-%20Nov%202012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623015933/http://www.activistinsight.com/press/Activist%20Insight%20Press%20Release%20-%20Activism%20Outperforms%20-%20Nov%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-23}}.

'''Antoine Rostand''' (born 1962 in Paris) is a French businessman.

==Education==
Rostand is a graduate of French engineering school [[École Polytechnique]] and holds an MBA from [[INSEAD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.executives.com.fr/direct/executives_cv_et_bio_paiement01gg.asp?lettre=594 |title=Executive Nominations |accessdate=20 July 2010 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720213326/http://www.executives.com.fr/direct/executives_cv_et_bio_paiement01gg.asp?lettre=594 |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Military service===
In 1982, Rostand became one of the first graduates of Ecole Polytechnique to join the French [[Commandos Marine]], where he served as a lieutenant for one year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===In the oil and gas industry===
Rostand started his career with [[Schlumberger]] in 1986 as a wireline field engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/12/08/schlumberger-consulting-oil-business-energy-rostand.html|title=Forbes Magazine|date=8 December 2009| first=Christopher|last=Helman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then went to [[INSEAD]] for one year, earning an MBA in 1989. He was the global managing director of Schlumberger Business Consulting (SBC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gettyimages.fr/detail/photo-d%27actualit%C3%A9/antoine-rostand-global-managing-director-of-photo-dactualit%C3%A9/94661643|title=Bloomberg|date=18 September 2006|first=John|last=Cobb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and led SBC since its formation in 2004.

===In the consulting industry===
In 1990, Rostand joined ICME, a Switzerland-based strategy consulting firm with operations in Germany and France, where he advised companies such as [[Total S.A.|Total]], [[France Telecom]], [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], Thomson and insurer CNP on their post-merger integration. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
In 1996, he joined management consulting firm [[AT Kearney]], which at the time belonged to [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS). As an AT Kearney Partner, he advised EDS France as it refocused its strategy in a context of increasing computerization of French companies. This role subsequently led to his appointment as CEO of EDS France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journaldunet.com/solutions/itws/it_rostand.shtml|title=Journal du Net|date=13 January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the technology industry ===
From 1999 to 2002, Rostand was President and Chief Executive Officer of [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) France, which is now known as [[HP Enterprise Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.lesechos.fr/archives/2004/LesEchos/19174-54-ECH.htm?xtor=AL-4001 |title=Les Echos |date=8 June 2004 |language=fr }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His role notably included helping clients to address the [[Year 2000 problem|Year 2000 Problem]], and supporting the growth of the Internet and mobile markets in France. Despite a period of lower IT investments, Rostand succeeded in doubling the revenue of EDS France between 1999 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.01net.com/editorial/176793/eds-france-elargit-son-expertise-a-lintegration-de-systemes |title=01 Net |date=8 February 2002 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427193554/http://www.01net.com/editorial/176793/eds-france-elargit-son-expertise-a-lintegration-de-systemes/ |archivedate=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in making strategic acquisitions, such as Answare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1008953517540186000|title=01 Net|date=21 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Back in the energy industry ===
Rostand returned to [[Schlumberger]] in 2002 to oversee the integration of Schlumberger’s acquisition of IT services company SEMA Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2863934/Schlumberger-to-take-3bn-Sema-hit.html|title=The Telegraph|date=23 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded Schlumberger Business Consulting in 2004 as a dedicated consulting division within Schlumberger, with the idea that energy clients’ specific needs could be better met through an approach combining management consulting with the understanding of engineering and technical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lesechos.fr/25/01/2010/LesEchos/20600-095-ECH_schlumberger-s-attaque-aux-grands-du-conseil-en-management.htm|title=Les Echos|date=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Antoine Rostand, Jean-Michel Lasry, Alexandre d’Aspremont, Laurent El Ghaoui, and Antoine Halff founded [[Kayrros]], a [[Paris]] based energy research start-up that provides predictive data analytics for energy markets to allow accurate assessments and forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/unfinished-business-why-oil-output-may-surprise-1505813404|title=Unfinished Business: Why Oil Output May Surprise|last=Jakab|first=Spencer|date=2017-09-19|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rostand serves as the president of Kayrros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/07/25/bottlenecks-holding-back-second-shale-boom/|title=Bottlenecks Are Holding Back a Second Shale Boom|date=2017-07-25|work=The American Interest|access-date=2018-07-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought leadership and engagement==
Rostand is a former member of think tanks such as the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] or the [[Institut Montaigne]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2004, he contributed to the book, “CEO: Chief European Officer — Business Leadership in Europe,” edited by Robert Gogel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-mbook13_ed3_.html|title=New York Times|date=13 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Rostand led the launch of the SBC Energy Institute, now known as AT Kearney Energy Transition Institute, a research group to generate and promote understanding of the technologies needed to provide a safe, secure and reliable energy mix in the transition from [[fossil fuel]] to [[renewable energy]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy-transition-institute.com/press-release.html|title=Press Release, ETI|website=www.energy-transition-institute.com|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[nonprofit organization]] based in the Netherlands, the Energy Transition Institute provides academia, investors, regulators, media, customers, employees, and the general public with facts and data, to promote understanding of technology maturity, development priorities and deployment rationales. Rostand is one of eight board members of the Institute; [[Claude Mandil]] and [[Adnan Shihab-Eldin]] are among the board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldoil.com/news/2011/6/21/energy-advisors-adnan-shihab-eldin-and-claude-mandil-join-sbc-energy-institute|title=World Oil|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.energy-transition-institute.com/About.html|title=About Us, ETI|website=www.energy-transition-institute.com|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostand regularly presents at international conferences, including those hosted by the OECD, OPEC, International Energy Agency, Harvard University and London Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://college.harvard.edu/college-events/harvard-african-development-conference-0|title=Harvard African Development Conference|date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also speaks on the topics of technology and oil and gas at industry events, including the 2014 Oxford Energy Seminar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordenergyseminar.org/speakers14.shtml|title=Oxford Energy Seminar 2015|website=www.oxfordenergyseminar.org|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Energy Summit 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/the_energy_summit_2015_brochure.pdf|title=The Energy Summit 2015 - Speaker|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil and Money Conference 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Energy Intelligence|title=Oil &amp; Money {{!}} Antoine Rostand|date=2017-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKNoYCrqX8U|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2018 Credit Suisse Energy Summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.credit-suisse.com/microsites/events/23rd-annual-energy-summit/home.html|title=23rd Annual Energy Summit|website=www.credit-suisse.com|language=home|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18039">An '''application for employment''' is a standard business document which is prepared with questions deemed relevant by an [[employer]] in order for the employer to determine the best [[candidate]] to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the work needs of the company.  Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the [[form (document)|form]] and returning it to the employer at will for consideration.  The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicants availability and desire to be employed and their [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] and background so a determination can be made as to which candidate should be hired.

[[File:Southmayd letter 1 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A job application letter dated January 1, 1913]]
[[File:Southmayd letter 2 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rejection letter dated January 16, 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruminski|first1=Clayton|title=Manuscripts and Archives: Early Twentieth Century Job Applications - A Personal Affair|website=Hagley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Definition==
From the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as "each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment".&lt;ref name=DA111&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant [[skill]]s, [[education]], and [[experience]] (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's [[literacy]], [[penmanship]], and [[communication skills]] - a careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application.

The application may also require the applicant to disclose any [[criminal record]], and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate [[background check]]. For a business that employs workers on a [[part-time]] basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's specific times and days of availability, and preferences in this regard. It is important to note, however, that an employer may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=DA111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Weiss, ''Fair, Square &amp; Legal: Safe Hiring, Managing &amp; Firing Practices to Keep You and Your Company Out of Court'' (2004), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a [[cover letter]] and a [[résumé]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Bunting, ''The Interviewer's Handbook: Successful Interviewing Techniques for the Workplace'' (2005), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even employers who accept a cover letter and résumé will frequently also require the applicant to complete a form application, as the other documents may neglect to mention details of importance to the employers.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Kennedy, ''The Small Business Owner's Manual'' (2005), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade "walk-in" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a [[job interview]] with the person with the authority to hire.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, and do not have to be submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.&lt;ref&gt;A C "Buddy" Krizan, Patricia Merrier, Joyce P. Logan, ''Business Communication'' (2010), p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Application blanks are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tarun|title=Role of Application Blank in the Selection Process|url=http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process|publisher=GradsUp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307052125/http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process/|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies will occasionally use two types of application blanks, short and long.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They both help companies with initial screening and the longer form can be used for other purposes as well. The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can become an interview question for that applicant at a future date.

==Standardization and Regulation==
The employment application is not a standardized form so every company may create its own as long as [[regulations]] set by the government are adhered.  &lt;!-- in the US, this would be EEOD --&gt;

==Document Elements==
Applications usually ask the applicant at the minimum for their name, phone number, and address.  In addition, applications also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have.

The three categories application fields are very useful for discovering are; physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors.

===Physical characteristics===
If the company has a [[bona fide occupational qualification]] (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} for example:
:The job requires a lot of physical labor. Do you have any physical problems that may interfere with this job?

===Experience===
Experience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application, work experience and educational background.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Educational background is important to companies because by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like as well as their intelligence. Work experience is important to companies because it will inform the company if the applicant meets their requirements. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.

===Socio-environmental qualifications===
Companies are interested in the applicant's [[social environment]] because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} If they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination and so on.

===Photograph===
Customs vary internationally when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a [[photograph]] of the applicant. In the English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229025658/http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |archivedate=2013-12-29 |df= }}, accessed 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, for instance Germany, the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it.

==In other non-English speaking European countries==

===France===
In [[France]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Equal Opportunities Act (France)|fr|3=Loi pour l'égalité des chances|lt=2006 Equal Opportunities Act}} requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application (''{{lang|fr|CV anonyme}}'').

===Germany===
The job application is called ''Bewerbung'' in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the ''Anschreiben'', the ''Lebenslauf'' and the ''Zeugnisse''. ''Anschreiben'' is the German word for [[Cover Letter]] and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a [[job interview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |title=Applying in Germany,  Bewerbung: Anschreiben and Lebenslauf |publisher=T. Tauber (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329023800/http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |archivedate=2015-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to work with the paper size [[DIN A4]] and to stay with a length of one single page. The ''Anschreiben'' must be signed by hand and accompanied by a ''Lebenslauf'', the [[Curriculum Vitae]], and ''Zeugnisse'' as copies of relevant reference documents. The ''Lebenslauf'' is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and [[professional training]] as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the ''Lebenslauf'' – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called ''Bewerbungsfoto''. Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the [[photograph]] to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the ''Lebenslauf''. In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (''Bewerbungsmappe'') or online (''Onlinebewerbung''). According to a study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |title=Internet überholt die Bewerbungsmappe auf Papier |publisher=BITKOM (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122506/http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Onlinebewerbung'' was more favored in Germany than the ''Bewerbungsmappe'' by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist..

===Italy===
The CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas:

in chronological order
* Details of the person (Informazioni personali)
* School and education (Studi e Formazione)

in anti-chronological order
* additional capabilities (Altre conoscenze) 
* Experience (Esperienze professionali). As graduate this section is omitted. Brief information on the application motivations may be mentioned here.

The application letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) will be taken relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates shall be presented only at the interview.

===Spain===
In Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (''Carta de Candidatura'') and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should contain information on the motivation and drafted shortly. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews in the same company are common.

==Usage by hackers==
Job applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open [[Email attachment|attachments]] or links or connect [[USB_flash_drive_security#Malware_infections|USB sticks]] with [[malware]]. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals they are often a target of [[cyberextortion]] − so called [[ransomware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindner|first1=Martin|title=Computerkriminalität: Hacker im Spital|url=https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209002241/https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|archivedate=9 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning: Malware is showing up in job applicants’ files|url=http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081457/http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ransomware such as "Petya"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Email scam Petya locks down PCs until a ransom is paid|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=25 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081954/http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angebliches Bewerbungsschreiben: Ransomware Petya verschlüsselt Master File Table|url=http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de-DE|date=29 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080450/http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "GoldenEye"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye ransomware disguised as job application|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|publisher=IT PRO|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081426/http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmer|first1=Danny|title=This ransomware targets HR departments with fake job applications|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080335/http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye Ransomware analysiert|url=http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080937/http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziemann|first1=Frank|title=Goldeneye: Bewerbungs-Mails mit Erpresser-Malware|url=http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|publisher=PC-WELT|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080641/http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were found to make use of job applications.

'''Arch Wilkinson Shaw''' (August 4, 1876 – March 9, 1962)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100459975 "Arch Wilkinson Shaw (1876—1962)]" at oxfordreference.com.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[entrepreneur]], [[publisher]], [[editor]] and [[management theorist]] who applied the ideas of [[scientific management]] in the areas of offices and the tertiary sector.

During the First World War, Shaw served as Secretary of Commercial Economy Board, and later served as member of the board of directors of the [[Harvard Business School]].

== Biography ==
=== Youth, education and early career ===
Shaw was born in 1876 in [[Jackson, Michigan]], son of James Franklin Shaw and Estelle Jane (Fenn) Shaw. After attending public school, he quit his studies at [[Olivet College]]. He would eventually obtained his AM degree from Olivet College in 1914, and would obtain his doctor of laws from [[Northwestern University]] in 1927.

Shaw broke off his studies at the Olivet College before graduating in 1899, at the age of 23, and founded, with Louis C. Walker, the Shaw-Walker Company in Muskegon Michigan,&lt;ref name="GLS 1952"&gt;G. Lynn Sumner. "System - Magazine sensation of its time," in: ''How I Learned the Secrets of Success in Advertising.'' North Audley Media, 1952. p. 24-26&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in office supplies and plugs and files.

=== Further career ===
Four years later, in 1903, while still in the board of directors of the firm, he founded the Shaw Company, which published the reviews ''System'', ''The Magazine of Business'', specializing in the service and offices (typing, office furniture, etc.), and ''Factory''.&lt;ref name="MTC 1958"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Copeland |first=Melvin T. |title=Arch W. Shaw | author-link= Melvin T. Copeland|journal= Journal of Marketing  |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=313–315 |jstor=1247125
|date=January 1958 |registration=yes  |doi=10.2307/1247125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also published books on [[management]]. Shaw sold it in 1928 to the [[McGraw-Hill Company]].

Shaw took a sabbatical in 1910, when his business was flourishing, to study the [[economy]] at Harvard University in Cambridge, where he especially appreciated the courses by [[Frank William Taussig]], which demonstrated its influence later on in his writings. He also befriended the Professor of economic history [[Edwin Francis Gay]], first dean of [[Harvard Business School]]. In 1911, Shaw became lecturer, inaugurating the first course in Business Policy, and became a member of the board of the Harvard Business School. He wrote the article'' Some Problems in Distribution Market,'' published in August 1912 in the ''Quarterly Journal of Economics,'' which became a seminal article in marketing studies. With E. Gay, he then helped found the Harvard Bureau of Business Research, which he helped to fund. He was also a shareholder and member of the board of the [[Kellogg Company]].

Shaw argued in his books and ''System'' journal, that the federal government should be involved in the collection and data processing for business. In 1917, when the United States were about to enter war, he persuaded the [[Council of National Defense]] to create the Commercial Economy Board, of which he became the secretary. This council then became the conservation division of the [[War Industries Board]] under his responsibility.&lt;ref name="MTC 1958"/&gt;

He died in [[Winnetka, Illinois]] on March 9, 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Arch Shaw Dies, Ex-Publisher, 85.

== Work ==

=== ''System, Magazine of business'' 1900-1927 ===
[[File:System, first number of first volume, December 1900.jpg|thumb|System, first number of first volume, December 1900]]
The journal ''System'' was first published in December 1900 by the Shaw-Walker Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/100006275 System, Magazine of business], catalog record at hathitrust.org, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the second volume in December 1901 it went with the subtitle "The magazine of business." In the very first article, entitled ''The Cost of Production.'' one of the initial aims of the magazine was described as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In our next few issues we hope to present to our readers a cost system, which, while not applied in the sense of a balance ledger system, with all of its intricate problems, will furnish facts, sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes and one which will largely aid the progressive manager to establish his own costs in a satisfactory manner as well as point out to his superintendent any weaknesses existing in the factory, thereby profiting by a speedy remedy of excessive costs, etc.&lt;ref&gt;A.W. Shaw. "The cost of production," ''System,'' Volume 1, issue 1, (Dec. 1900) p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1903 A.W. Shaw Company was founded and the ''System'' magazine became their flagship publication&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshan. ''A Delicate Experiment: The Harvard Business School, 1908-1945.'' 1987, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; and a sensation of its time.&lt;ref name="GLS 1952"/&gt; Jeffrey L. Cruikshan (1987) recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under Shaw's direction, ''System'' attempted to take a practical approach to business. It was a successful magazine, and it grew steadily in size and influence during Shaw's tenure as editor. (In 1927, ''System'' was purchased by McGraw-Hill. and renamed ''[[Business Week]].''). But ''System,'' as Shaw saw it. faced a difficult question: how to uncover the principles that must underlie the evolving practice of business. It was a question that Shaw himself had faced in 1906, when he had helped Northwestern University design an undergraduate business curriculum.&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few years late at Harvard Business School Shaw and Edwin Francis Gay were faced with a similar challenge when they were designing the curriculum for the business graduate studies.&lt;ref name="JLC 1987"/&gt;

The '''Army-Navy "E" Award''' was an honor presented to companies during [[World War II]] whose production facilities achieved "Excellence in Production" ("E") of war equipment. The award was also known as the Army-Navy Production Award.  The award was created to encourage industrial [[mobilization]] and production of war time materials.  By war's end, the award had been earned by only 5% of the more than 85,000 companies involved in producing materials for the U.S. military's war effort.

== History ==
[[File:"For Excellence in producton, Army Navy "E" - NARA - 514282.jpg|thumb|For Excellence in production, Army Navy "E", Let's Keep It Flying!]]
[[File:Army-Navy Production Award to Stanley Works, presentation program, January 20, 1943 - New Britain Industrial Museum - DSC09905.JPG|thumb|Army-Navy Production Award to [[Stanley Black &amp; Decker|Stanley Works]], presentation program, January 20, 1943]]

An earlier award, the Navy "E" Award, had been created in 1906 during [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s administration.&lt;ref name=Previous&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#award |title=Letter from The Secretary of the Navy to The American Brass Company |work=[[United States Secretary of the Navy]] |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1942-04-07 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;Fuller, George Newman. ''Michigan History.'' Michigan Historical Commission, Lewis Beeson, Michigan State Historical Society, page 22 {{Volume needed|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of World War I, the Navy "E" Award had been joined by the Army "A" Award and the Army-Navy Munitions Board "Star".

These three separate awards continued until seven months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] had pulled the United States into [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=EndDetail&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#press |title=Army-Navy “E” Award Termination Sees Award Granted to 5% of Eligible Plants |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] Bureau of Public Relations |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1945-12-05 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1942, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] proclaimed that the new Army-Navy "E" Award would merge the Navy "E", Army "A" and Army-Navy Munitions Board "Star" into a single, service-wide award.&lt;ref name=NewAward&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/army-navy-e-award.html#circ |title=Circular No. 228, 1942: Army-Navy Production Award |work=[[United States Department of War|The War Department]] |publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]] (archivist) |date=1942-07-08 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
All factories engaged in war production were eligible to receive the award. Government as well as privately owned plants were eligible, as were contractors.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

Although the award was granted to industry, one academic institution and one individual received it. Iowa State College (now [[Iowa State University]]) received the award for its contribution to the production of uranium for the [[Manhattan Project]]. Dr. [[Harley A. Wilhelm]] received the award for inventing the [[Ames process]] for the extraction, purification and mass production of uranium for the Manhattan Project, which occurred at Iowa State College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ameslab.gov/about/our-history |title=Our History |publisher=[[Ames Laboratory]] |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some factors which were considered in selecting recipients were:&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

* Quality and quantity of production
* Overcoming of production obstacles
* Avoidance of work stoppages
* Maintaining of [[Fair Labor Standards Act|fair labor standards]]
* Training of additional labor forces
* Good record keeping in relation to health and safety

District procurement officers, chiefs of the supply services, agencies concerned with production and the Commanding Officers for the Matériel Commands would recommend plants, complete with the reasons for such recommendations.  An Award Board would review the recommended plants and decide on granting of the awards.&lt;ref name=NewAward/&gt;

== Design ==
The award consisted of a [[Pennon|pennant]] for the production plant and emblems for all employees in the plant at the time the award was made. The pennant was a [[Swallowtail (flag)#Triangular swallowtail|triangular swallowtail]] with a white border, with a capital E within a yellow wreath of oak and laurel leaves on a vertical divided blue and red background. ARMY is on the red background and NAVY on the blue background. 

[[File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star - NARA - 534377.jpg|thumb|File:Army &amp; Navy. Bridgeport Brass Ordnance Employees Are Working For the Star]]
Plants that maintained an outstanding record of performance for six months after receiving their original Army-Navy E-Award were granted a star award, with a white star added to their pennant.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;  As with only a small percentage of all war production companies earning an Army-Navy "E" Award, only a small number of these earned stars, with a very small number of plants earning six stars by the end of the war. 

== Ceremony ==
Usually an Army officer and a Navy officer would be present at a ceremony, where the company would assemble all the employees involved in production. After the award of the pennant to the plant (to be flown), the employees present would receive individual pins.

The '''Averch–Johnson effect''' is the tendency of [[Monopoly#Government-granted_monopoly|regulated companies]] to engage in excessive amounts of [[capital accumulation]] in order to expand the volume of their profits. If companies' profits to [[Financial capital|capital]] ratio is regulated at a certain percentage then there is a strong incentive for companies to over-invest in order to increase profits overall. This investment goes beyond any optimal efficiency point for capital that the company may have calculated as higher profit is almost always desired over and above efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Averch |first=Harvey |last2=Johnson |first2=Leland L. |year=1962 |title=Behavior of the Firm Under Regulatory Constraint |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1052–1069 |doi= |jstor=1812181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Excessive capital accumulation under rate of return regulation is informally known as ''''gold plating''''.&lt;ref name="Gold plating"&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Michael|title='Gold plating' rife, assets in for a hiding|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/gold-plating-rife-assets-in-for-a-hiding-20130131-2dmjg.html|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=The Age|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Banca Popolare di Verona''' was an Italian bank which became part of the [[Banco Popolare]] Group, based in [[Verona]], North [[Italy]]. Currently it is a brand of [[Banco Popolare]].

==History==
The original name of "Banca Popolare di Verona" was '''Banca Mutua Popolare di Verona''', founded on 21 June 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpv.it/la-mia-banca/la-storia/ Official history (in Italian)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819022208/http://www.bpv.it/la-mia-banca/la-storia/ |date=August 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was the seventh Italian "People's" bank to be founded. (The meaning of "people's" is that every shareholder who has more than 150 shares can vote during the shareholders' meeting.)

===BPV–SGSP===
It was the first Italian bank that acquired another Italian bank ([[Banco S.Geminiano e S.Prospero]] di Modena) by a public [[takeover]] in 1993 and the name of the bank changed to '''Banca Popolare di Verona – Banco S. Geminiano e S. Prospero S.c.r.l.''' ({{ISIN|IT0001065215}}).

In 1997 the bank has acquired [[Credito Bergamasco]].

As at 31 December 2001, BPV–SGSP had a total assets of €30,588,789,000 in consolidated basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpv.it/dwn/investor_relations/bilancio4_2001.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020701002601/http://www.bpv.it/dwn/investor_relations/bilancio4_2001.PDF|archivedate=1 July 2002|title=2001 Bilancio consolidato|date=10 May 2002|publisher=Banca Popolare di Verona – Banco S. Geminiano e S. Prospero (BPV–SGSP)|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; (€22,196,829,805 in separate basis)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpv.it/dwn/investor_relations/bilancio2_2001.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020701002003/http://www.bpv.it/dwn/investor_relations/bilancio2_2001.PDF|archivedate=1 July 2002|date=10 May 2002|title=2001 Bilancio Individuale|publisher=BPV–SGSP|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 the bank was ranked the 13th by deposits (€20,394,760,000), comparing to the 18th by Banca Popolare di Novara (€14,743,042,000), according to [[Mediobanca]].&lt;ref&gt;page 270, {{cite web|url=http://www.archiviostoricomediobanca.it/documenti/Le_principali_societa_italiane_2002.pdf|title=Le principali societa 2002|date=2002|access-date=14 April 2016|publisher=Mediobanca|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BPVN===
On 1 June 2002 Banca Popolare di Verona – SGSP merged with [[Banca Popolare di Novara]] S.c.r.l. to form [[Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara]]. ({{ISIN|IT0003262513}} / BPVN) A new subsidiary Banca Popolare di Novara S.p.A. was also formed. However, the former business belongs to BPV was only became divisions of BPVN. (expect insurance company [[Popolare Vita|BPV Vita]] and investment holding company [[Holding di Partecipazioni Finanziarie Banca Popolare di Verona – S. Geminiano e S. Prospero]] were retained as subsidiaries)

As at 31 December 2006, BPVN Group had a total assets of €68,694,935,000 and a shareholders' equity of €4,872,018,000 in consolidated balance sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gruppobancopopolare.it/media/2006-bilancio.zip|title=2006 Bilancio Consolidato|date=26 April 2007|access-date=14 April 2016|publisher=Banco Popolare di Verona e Novara|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Elsener Sr.''' (also known as Charles Elsener, born 6 July 1922 in Ibach, † 1 June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/carl-elsener |title=Carl Elsener obituary |date=2 July 2013 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Schwyz]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]].

== Life ==
Carl Elsener was the grandson of [[Karl Elsener (inventor)|Karl Elsener]] (1860-1918) and the son of Carl Elsener (1886-1950). Karl Elsener had opened a factory in [[Ibach SZ|Ibach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10139841/Carl-Elsener.html |title=Carl Elsener |date=24 June 2013 |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the production of knives and surgical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-swiss-army-knife-is-headed-for-the-u-s-army/ |title=The Swiss Army Knife is Headed For the U.S. Army |date=11 July 2017 |publisher=Warfare History |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the knife factory [[Victorinox]] developed.

Carl Elsener led the company initially with his father and his brother Eduard Elsener (b. 1926). After the death of his father in 1950, he took over the management.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beautyinc.world/fashion-style/die-geschichte-von-victorinox |title=Mit Pioniergeist zur Weltmarke – Die Geschichte von Victorinox |publisher=Beautyinc |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Army Knife]] is considered to be one of his works.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/nachrichten/zentralschweiz/schwyz/Carl-Elsener-sen-gestorben;art96,265884 |title=Carl Elsener sen. gestorben |date=3 June 2013 |publisher=Luzerner Zeitung |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Carl Elsener Sr., the Messerfabrik became the largest company in the canton of Schwyz. In 1938, Elsener joined the company, which at the time had employed 80 people. At the time of his death, there was well over a thousand employees. Elsener is described as a boss who was able to operate almost all the machines himself, who was traveling in the "[[Cardigan (sweater)|Lismerli]]" or in the [[Smock-frock|blue work coat]] and who cycled to the factory. He never owned a car. A few years before his death, he felt healthy enough to put in an 80-hour week.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

In October 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moneyhouse.ch/de/company/victorinox-stiftung-20917758151 |title=Victorinox-Stiftung |publisher=Moneyhouse |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsner founded together with his brother Eduard Elsener and his son Carl Elsener Jr. as a successor solution, the Victorinox Foundation&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; to ensure the continued existence and further prosperity of the company. The Foundation holds 75 percent of the shares of Victorinox AG, another 15 percent belong to the non-profit Carl u. Elise Elsener-Gut Foundation. The Elsener family owns 10 percent of the shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2011_50/artikel/wir-haben-auf-unser-erbe-verzichtet-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-502011.html |title=Wir haben auf unser Erbe verzichtet |date=14 December 2011 |publisher=Die Weltwoche |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Carl Elsener Sr. passed away, his son [[Carl Elsener Jr.]] (* 1958) has been managing the company since 2007.

'''Downtown San Jose''' is the [[central business district]] of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], in [[Silicon Valley]]. It is the largest urban center of Silicon Valley. Downtown is one of the largest tech [[Business cluster|clusters]] in Silicon Valley, as well as the cultural and political center of San Jose.

==History==
[[File:Multi-Unit (3029294372) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Art Deco]] Medico-Dental Building was built in 1928.]]
The town was first settled in 1777. The area that now makes up downtown was first settled twenty years later, when the town of San Jose moved somewhat inland from its original location on the banks of the Guadalupe River. In 1850, San Jose incorporated to become California's first city and the location of California's first state capitol.
 
Despite widespread destruction caused by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], a number of neighborhoods around Downtown San Jose still retain their original, pre-1906 housing stock. These neighborhoods include the South University, [[Naglee Park]], Hensley Historic District, Reed Historic District and Vendome neighborhoods. 

===Contemporary era===
The downtown area was typical of a small, agriculture-based city of under 100,000 residents until city manager [[A. P. Hamann]] spearheaded aggressive expansion during the 1950s and '60s. As the city rapidly expanded into outlying areas, the downtown area entered a period of decline. In the 1980s, mayor [[Tom McEnery]], whose family owned several buildings in downtown, initiated significant [[gentrification]] in the area. 

The San Jose Redevelopment Agency, the largest such group in the state, would eventually become a key player in revitalizing the downtown area and, to a lesser extent, surrounding neighborhoods. In some cases, historic downtown buildings were bulldozed in order to make room for new hotels, office space, condominiums, museums, theaters and parks; to widen or re-align streets, and to build parking lots and garages.

As part of its apparent effort to stimulate economic growth and increase tax revenue within the downtown community, the San Jose Redevelopment Agency began encouraging builders to construct high-rise residential towers, and the agency offered subsidies and lifted the requirement to provide affordable units that were characteristic of other redevelopment projects throughout the city.&lt;ref name="Flannery, Colleen 2008"&gt;[Flannery, Colleen. (2008, January 14) High Hopes for San Jose Residential Towers. California Real Estate Journal.]&lt;/ref&gt; The agency’s master plan has incorporated high-rise condominiums since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[Prodis Sulek, Julia. (2008, June 15) Condo buyers’ ‘sexy views’. San Jose Mercury News, p. 1A, p. 17A.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the city’s first high-rise project began selling units.&lt;ref name="Flannery, Colleen 2008"/&gt; Construction or planning has begun on at least seven additional high-rise projects.&lt;ref name="Flannery, Colleen 2008"/&gt; The agency states the high-rises will contribute to the creation of a more vibrant and well-to-do downtown culture.&lt;ref name="Flannery, Colleen 2008"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:The_Tech_Museum_of_Innovation_in_Downtown_San_Jose.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] is dedicated to the history and industry of [[Silicon Valley]].]]
Many of the 19th century buildings in central downtown appear on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], in particular the area surrounding St. James Park, such as [[Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (San Jose, California)|Trinity Episcopal Cathedral]]. 

Downtown San Jose's early 20th century housing is diverse and includes many smaller [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] homes along with a few fairly large gingerbread or Italianate-style Victorians, [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]], [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission]] and [[California Bungalow]] architecture in the neighborhoods surrounding the downtown core.&lt;ref&gt;''https://www.sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6120'', City of San Jose Web Site PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown is home to many of the city's landmarks, including the [[San Jose Museum of Art]], the [[Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose]], [[the Tech Museum of Innovation]], the [[San Jose Museum of Quilts &amp; Textiles]], the [[San Jose Repertory Theatre]], the San Jose Stage Company, the historic [[De Anza Hotel]], the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont Hotel]], the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph (San José)|Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph]], the campus of [[San Jose State University]] and the [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library]].  The [[SAP Center]], just west of Guadalupe Parkway, is also normally considered to be part of the downtown community.

==Economy==
Downtown is a major [[business cluster|tech cluster]] in [[Silicon Valley]]. It is home to [[Adobe World Headquarters]], [[BEA Systems]] HQ, and numerous facilities and offices of major tech companies, including [[Amazon Lab126]] and [[Google]]. The [[Bay Area]]'s largest news organization, the [[Mercury News]] is headquartered on St. James Park. Downtown San Jose has a large concentration of hotels and hospitality services in San Jose, including [[The Westin San Jose]], the [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton]] San Jose, [[Marriott Hotels|Marriott]] San Jose, [[Sheraton Hotels|Sheraton]] San Jose, largely concentrated near the [[San Jose Convention Center]].

In February 2018, San Jose's city council approved a stage of a sale of downtown property to Google for $67 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.foxnews.com/tech/greedy-google-community-activists-slam-tech-giant-over-planned-san-jose-mega-campus |title=‘Greedy’ Google: Community activists slam tech giant over planned San Jose mega-campus |author=Christopher Carbone |date=October 5, 2018 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown also is home to several important [[network service provider]]s and [[Internet service providers]], many of them located in [[Market Post Tower]]. Although the cost of office and technical space is relatively high downtown, this is offset by the low cost of [[peering]] and [[internetworking]], an effect of proximity to other networking companies.

Many of the public areas of downtown San Jose are covered by a public, free, [[Wi-Fi]] network, including the areas surrounding [[Plaza de Cesar Chavez|Plaza de César Chávez]] and [[San Pedro Square]]. Downtown is also the hub of the [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|VTA]]'s [[light rail]] system, and the home of the main campus of [[San Jose State University]].

==Demographics==
The downtown residential area primarily consisted of [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] residents through the mid-twentieth century. A notable exception was the Northside Neighborhood, where ethnic minority groups were invited to establish their homes and live their lives freely. With a vibrant African-American community and a Chinatown that grew into today's [[Japantown, San Jose, California|Japantown]], San Jose's Northside welcomed everyone and helped to form the inclusive, diverse and vibrant downtown San Jose community of today.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==Education==
[[Image:San_Jose_State_and_beyond.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Jose State University]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]'s oldest [[public university]].]]

Downtown San Jose is home to the campus of [[San Jose State University]]. SJSU is the founding campus of the [[California State University]] system and the oldest public university on the west coast of the United States. SJSU enrolls approximately 31,000 students.

The [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library]], shared by the city of San Jose and San Jose State University, is located on the campus of San Jose State University in downtown San Jose. The King Library represents the first collaboration of its kind between a university and a major U.S. city, and has won numerous awards including the [[Library Journal|Library Journal's]] prestigious 2004 Library of the Year award, the publication’s highest honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Library Journal Library of the Year 2004: San Jose Public Library and San Jose State University Library|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA423793.html | publisher = Library Journal | author= John N.

'''Event to knowledge''' ('''E2K''') is an [[accounting]] [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] that measures the time from when an event occurs to when the responsible person knows about it.  The shorter the average E2K time, the more timely an organization’s financial information will be.

== Importance of E2K ==

Timeliness is one of the most important characteristics of financial information.  The more timely information is, the more relevant it is to the reader.  E2K helps organizations focus and improve their internal accounting processes.

E2K measures a number of events.  Firstly, it considers the time for a sub-ledger or supporting system to record an event.  If a sub-ledger performs no reporting on its own and it posts to the [[general ledger]] on a [[:wikt:batch|batch]] basis (nightly, weekly, monthly, etc.); then this will elongate the E2K time.

The faster the general ledger can report the impact of an event, the smaller the E2K value.  Waiting for all accounting journals to be posted, balancing, [[bank reconciliation|reconciliation]] and producing paper reports adds to the E2K time.

There are two key E2K measures, the maximum and average E2K values.  The maximum value is the time from when the first [[Financial transaction|transaction]] is entered in a system during a new fiscal period to when it is reported.  An average E2K time may be for an entire system or a sub-component.  For example, E2K can be reported by each sub-ledger (accounts payable, payroll, manufacturing, etc.) or for the entire system.

== Best E2K practice ==

Organizations can reduce their E2K time through a number of strategies: 
1. Implementing and upgrading systems to take advantage of faster close cycles 
2. Use of [[workflow]] technologies to communicate exceptions and critical events to those responsible
3. Reporting Marts and the like away from the [[OLTP]] system for internal reporting
4. Adjust accounting cycles to natural business cycles. 
5. [[Benchmarking|Benchmark]] and set targets to improve current practice.

      <comment>Article mentions Washington heights High School as being in The Bronx. The author sighted the reference correctly but the reference is wrong. Washinton Heights, the neighborhood is in Manhattan and so was the high school named for it. The campus is used by four high schools now on the high school's cmpus but it may be closed within a year or so.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">'''Fred Sherman''' (January 7, 1924 – September 12, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[economist]], [[businessman]] and business [[Pundit (expert)|commentator]] based in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Sherman broadcast as a business commentator on [[KYW News Radio]] for more than 25 years until his retirement in January 2009 due to budget cuts at the station.&lt;ref name=pbj&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff|last=Blumenthal |title=Business commentator Fred Sherman dies at 85 |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/09/14/daily5.html |work=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]]|publisher= |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; He was known to radio and television audiences for his trademark [[sign-off]], "I'm Fred Sherrrrrman."&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt;

Sherman was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], to parents, Nathan and Eva ([[née]] Josephthal) Sherman.&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt; His father owned a candy store, while his mother was a [[teacher]].&lt;ref name=pi&gt;{{cite news |first=Carolyn|last=Davis|title=Fred Sherman, 85, business commentator |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/obituaries/20090913_Fred_Sherman__85__business_commentator.html|work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher= |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2009-09-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Washington Heights High School in the [[Manhattan]]&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt; and took courses at [[New York University]], but did not earn a degree from NYU.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; He would later enroll at [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt;

Sherman enlisted in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], and served in the 82d Airborne Army Rangers.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; Sherman flew missions over [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]] before and after the 1944 [[D-Day Invasion]].&lt;ref name=pi/&gt;

Sherman considered becoming a [[journalist]] following World War II,&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; but began working at his [[father-in-law]]'s furniture business instead.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; He left the furniture business when he was 60 years old and obtained his [[stockbroker]]'s license the same year.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; He eventually became the [[chief economist]] for both [[Sovereign Bank]] and [[Royal Bank America]], which is based in [[Narberth, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=pbj/&gt;

Sherman became involved with radio as a business commentator during the 1980s. Sherman contacted [[Don Lancer]], the business and [[financial]] [[editing|editor]] of [[KYW (AM)|KYW 1060]] radio, noting that the station's coverage of [[financial news]] was dull.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; Sherman told Lancer that he could make KYW's coverage more lively and entertaining.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; Sherman was hired by Lancer after an audition. He used humor, irreverence and wit to reach his audiences.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt;

Sherman was known for his trademark, elongated sign-off, "I'm Fred Sherrrrrman", at the end of his commentaries.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; He began saying his name that way after hearing another reporter use the same speaking style.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; The sign-off, which earned Sherman both praise and criticism, made Sherman into a local celebrity in the Philadelphia region.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt;

Sherman remained as a business commentator at KYW for twenty-five years, until KYW cut his commentaries in January 2009, citing financial constraints.&lt;ref name=pi/&gt; Sherman also appeared on ''The Money Show'' on [[WKDN (AM)|WPEN]] and contributed weekly television business segments to the Sunday morning news on [[WCAU|WCAU NBC 10]].&lt;ref name=pi/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">'''Heinrich Voelter''' (January 1, 1817 in [[Heidenheim an der Brenz|Heidenheim]] &amp;ndash; September 13, 1887 in Heidenheim) was a German inventor and paper manufacturer.

Heinrich Voelter grew up in Heidenheim and attended elementary school there, where he was taught by his grandfather. At age 14, he began an [[apprenticeship]] at a Heidenheim [[Weaving|weaver]] shop. In addition, he learned from his father, who operated a local [[paper mill]], the art of paper production. After the apprenticeship Voelter went to [[Bautzen]] to continue and complete his studies of paper manufacturing. While in [[Saxony]], he met [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] (1816–1895), from whom he took over an 1846 [[patent]] for manufacturing paper from wood fiber mash. He further developed the method such that mass production of paper from wood became possible - until then, paper had been produced from rags. He returned to his hometown after his father's death in 1848, where he benefited from the help of [[Voith#Johann_Matth.C3.A4us_Voith|Johan Matthäus Voith]] (1803–1874), who in 1852 constructed two grindstones for the Voelter paper mill. 

Voelter and Voith sold grindstones to paper manufacturers in the whole world, including the Kübler und Niethammer paper factory in [[Kriebstein]] in Saxony. After the Voelter paper mill burnt down in 1864, paper production in Heidenheim ceased for good (paper had been manufactured there since 1530). [[Voith|Voith AG]], founded by Voith, still develops and produces paper machines for international customers.

Heinrich Voelter served in the Parliament in Stuttgart from 1856 to 1861.

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was elected [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Mayor of Johannesburg]] by the first sitting of council following countrywide local government elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/live-city-of-johannesburg-inaugural-council-meeting-20160822|title=LIVE: Mayor Mashaba - Corruption is public enemy number 1|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and career==
Mashaba was brought up in near-poverty in GaRamotse in [[Hammanskraal]], Gauteng, by his sisters while his absent domestic-worker mother worked to provide for the family.

His older brother dropped out of school at 15, going from one unsubstantial job to another. Mashaba realised that an education would be crucial for him to break out of the cycle of poverty. He graduated from high school, but did not complete his tertiary education.

From a young age he was a strategic thinker - he bought a car without having a license and drove out of the dealership without ever having learned to drive. He drove himself from one selling job to another, in the process confirming for himself that he was a natural salesman with an unswerving instinct for business. He started selling "SuperKurl" African hair-care products and became their number-one earner.  He soon realised that these products excited him and that he wasn't content to be just an employee. (Reference: Book titled "South Africa's Greatest Entrepreneurs", compiled by Moky Makura, article written by Isabella Morris)

His company, "Black Like Me", was launched on Valentine’s Day in 1985 with a {{currency|amount=30000|code=ZAR}} loan from his friend, businessman Walter Dube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/the-star/story-of-black-like-me-and-the-man-behind-it-1297341#.VYsMfflVikp|title=Story of Black Like Me, and the man behind it {{!}} The Star|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;



Mashaba is also a music lover. After five years of secret lessons, he revealed himself as a pianist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://city-press.news24.com/News/on-the-streets-with-herman-mashaba-20160313|title=On the streets with Herman Mashaba|work=CityPress|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
From 2012 until May 2014, Mashaba served as chairman of the [[Free Market Foundation]] (FMF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/news/economy/anc-policies-keeping-black-people-poor-says-herman-mashaba/|title=ANC policies keeping black people poor, says Herman Mashaba|last=Ziady|first=Hanna|date=2016-02-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down from his position when he joined the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] as an "ordinary card-carrying member", citing the need for the Foundation to remain politically impartial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/herman-mashaba-to-join-the-da/|title=FMF chairman steps down to join the DA|date=2014-05-28|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mashaba announced in December 2015 that he would accept a nomination to stand as a [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] mayoral candidate for the [[City of Johannesburg]] in the 2016 local government elections. The other possible DA candidate was [[Rabelani Dagada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/herman-mashaba-announced-as-das-joburg-mayoral-candidate-20160116|title=Herman Mashaba announced as DA's Joburg mayoral candidate|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mayor of Johannesburg ===
In the municipal election on August 3, 2016, the ruling party, The [[African National Congress]], lost their majority in Johannesburg, taking only 44.12% of the vote with the Democratic alliance taking 38.33%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.org.za/content/LGEPublicReports/402/Detailed%20Results/GP/JHB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Alliance entered into conversations with the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] to form a coalition. Whilst the EFF declined the offer, they agreed that they would vote for Mashaba as the Mayor for Johannesburg, despite misgivings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/elections/news/eff-will-vote-for-mashaba-says-malema-20160818|title=EFF will vote for Mashaba, says Malema|work=News24|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 22, 2016, Mashaba was sworn in as a Johannesburg City Councillor. Later that day, he was sworn in as the Mayor of Johannesburg, the first non-ANC Johannesburg mayor since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/08/22/Victory-for-DA-as-Herman-Mashaba-is-elected-Mayor-of-Johannesburg|title=Victory for DA as Herman Mashaba is elected Mayor of Johannesburg|last=Manyathela|first=Clement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labour ===
Mashaba has characterised the ANC's post-Apartheid labour laws as "draconian".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He led a Constitutional Court challenge by the FMF, arguing that Section 32 of the Labour Relations Act is unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The FMF argued that the bargaining council process reduces competition, as smaller businesses may not be able to afford the higher wages agreed on between larger businesses and unions, contributing further to South Africa's unemployment rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moneyweb.co.za/archive/collusion-in-labour-legislation-decisionmaking/|title=Collusion in labour legislation decision-making|last=Radebe|first=Kentse|date=2013-03-05|work=Moneyweb|access-date=2017-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyderabad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|ər|ə|b|a:|d|audio=Hyderabad.ogg}} {{respell|HY|dər|ə|baad}}) is the capital of the [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Telangana]] and ''[[de jure]]'' capital of [[Andhra Pradesh]].{{refn|According to the [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014]] part 2 Section 5:(1) On and from the appointed day, Hyderabad in the existing State of [[Andhra Pradesh]], shall be the common capital of the State of [[Telangana]] and the State of Andhra Pradesh for such period not exceeding ten years.&lt;br /&gt;(2) After expiry of the period referred to in sub-section (1), Hyderabad shall be the capital of the State of Telangana and there shall be a new capital for the State of Andhra Pradesh.&lt;br /&gt;The common capital is defined as the existing area notified as the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation under the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. Though Andhra Pradesh uses facilities in Hyderabad during the transition period, Telangana state is responsible for day-to-day administration of the city. City MLAs are members of the [[Legislature of Telangana]] (§&amp;nbsp;3 and 18(1) of the Act).|group=upper-alpha}} Occupying {{convert|650|km2|sqmi}} along the banks of the [[Musi River (India)|Musi River]], it has a population of about {{nowrap|6.9 million}} and a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] population of about {{nowrap|7.75 million}}, making it the [[List of most populous cities in India|fourth most populous city]] and [[List of million-plus urban agglomerations in India|sixth most populous urban agglomeration]] in India. At an average altitude of {{convert|542|m|ft}}, much of Hyderabad is situated on hilly terrain around artificial lakes, including [[Hussain Sagar]]—predating the city's founding—north of the city centre.

Established in 1591 by [[Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah]], Hyderabad remained under the rule of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] for nearly a century before the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Asif Jah I]] declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizams of Hyderabad]]. The [[Hyderabad State|Nizam's dominions]] became a [[princely state]] during the [[British Raj]], and remained so for {{nowrap|150 years}}, with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of [[Hyderabad State (1948–56)|Hyderabad State]] after it was brought into the [[Indian Union]] in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]. Since 1956, [[Rashtrapati Nilayam]] in the city has been the winter office of the [[President of India]]. In 2014, the newly formed state of Telangana [[Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014|split from Andhra Pradesh]] and the city became the joint capital of the two states, a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025.

Relics of Qutb Shahi and Nizam rule remain visible today; the [[Charminar]]—commissioned by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah—has come to symbolise Hyderabad. [[Golconda]] fort is another major landmark. The influence of [[Indo-Persian culture|Mughlai culture]] is also evident in the region's [[Hyderabadi cuisine|distinctive cuisine]], which includes [[Hyderabadi biryani]] and [[Hyderabadi haleem]]. The Qutb Shahis and Nizams established Hyderabad as a cultural hub, attracting men of letters from different parts of the world. Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire in the mid-19th century, with artists migrating to the city from the rest of the Indian subcontinent. The [[Telugu film industry]] based in the city is the country's second-largest producer of motion pictures. It is also said that the name of the city will be changed from Hyderabad to Bhagyanagar which it was called earlier before the Mughals capturing Hyderabad.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre, and it continues to be known as the "City of Pearls". Many of the city's traditional [[bazaar]]s remain open, including [[Laad Bazaar]], [[Begum Bazaar]] and [[Sultan Bazaar]]. Industrialisation throughout the {{nowrap|20th century}} attracted major Indian research, manufacturing and financial institutions, including [[Defence Research and Development Organization]], [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, the [[National Geophysical Research Institute]] and the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]]. [[Special economic zone]]s dedicated to [[information technology]] have encouraged companies from India and around the world to set up operations in Hyderabad. The emergence of [[pharmaceutical]] and [[biotechnology]] industries in the 1990s led to the area's naming as India's "[[Genome Valley]]". With an output of {{US$}}74&amp;nbsp;billion, Hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to India's overall [[gross domestic product]].

According to [[John Everett-Heath]], the author of ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names'', ''Hyderabad'' means "Haydar's city" or "lion city", from ''[[haydar]]'' (lion) and ''[[-abad|ābād]]'' (city), and was named to honour the [[Caliph]] [[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]], who was also known as Haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles.&lt;ref name="Everett-Heath2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise dictionary of world place names|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=223|isbn=978-0-19-860537-9|last=Everett-Heath|first=John|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Petersen, a scholar of Islamic architecture, says the city was originally called ''Baghnagar'' (city of gardens).&lt;ref name="AnPet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Islamic architecture|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=112|isbn=978-0-415-06084-4|last=Petersen|first=Andrew|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; One popular theory suggests that the founder of the city, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the [[Golconda Sultanate]], named it after [[Bhagmati]], a local ''[[nautch]]'' (dancing) girl with whom he had fallen in love.

According to German traveller [[Heinrich von Poser]], whose travelogue of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] was translated by Gita Dharampal-Frick of [[Heidelberg University]], there were two names for the city: "On 3 December 1622, we reached the city of Bagneger or Hederabat, the seat of the king Sultan Mehemet Culi Cuttub Shah and the capital of the kingdom".&lt;ref name="TH-Hyd name"&gt;{{cite news|title=The city of love: Hyderabad|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/the-city-of-love-hyderabad/article9198014.ece|last=Nanisetti|first=Serish|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; French traveller [[Jean de Thévenot]] visited the Deccan region in 1666–1667 refers to the city in his book ''Travels in India'' as "Bagnagar and Aiderabad".&lt;ref name="TH-Hyd name" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Asia in the Making of Europe|volume=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YPPiumz4vx0C|publisher=[[University Of Chicago Press]]|page=?|isbn=978-0-226-46768-9|last1=Lach|first1=Donald F|last2=Kley|first2=Edwin J.

The Kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the [[Khalji dynasty]] in 1310 after its defeat by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].

The Hyderabad area was under the control of the [[Musunuri Nayaks]] at this time, who, however, were forced to cede it to the Bahmani Sultanate in 1364.

===Literature===
In the past, Qutb Shahi rulers and Nizams attracted artists, architects and men of letters from different parts of the world through patronage.

=== Music and films ===
[[South Indian music]] and dances such as the [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Bharatanatyam]] styles are popular in the Deccan region. As a result of their culture policies, [[North Indian music]] and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams,&lt;ref name="Nigam&amp;Bhatnagar"&gt;{{cite book|title=Romance of Hyderabad culture|page=44|last1=Nigam|first1=Mohan Lal|last2=Bhatnagar|first2=Anupama|publisher=Deva Publication|year=1997|oclc=644231278}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with [[tawaif]] (courtesans).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''José Zanier''' ([[Udine]], [[Italy]], September 18, 1905 – [[Mar del Plata]], [[Argentina]] January 30, 1973) was an [[Italy|Italian]] engineer and pioneer in the construction of thermo-electric power stations supplied by [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] motors. He also worked on projects involving the Italian interconnecting 230 and 150 kV electricity lines, as well as making other contributions to the development of the electro-technical field.

== Biography ==
In 1932 he planned and supervised the construction of the [[post office]] and [[telecommunication]]s building in [[Vicenza]], [[Italy]]. Soon thereafter, he focused his attention on the building of the scholastic Noventa Vicentina monument in [[Vicenza]].

In 1936, as director of the technical office of UMET in [[Rome]], part of the Superior Council for Public Works, he developed plans for the Italian 230 and 150 kV interconnection lines with 400 MW of transferable [[electric power]], with their respective transformation and regulation substations.

Just before the outbreak of [[World War II]], he installed the first 20,000 kVA steam-turbo generators, with automatic boilers, in Rome's [[thermal power station]] - the first of their kind.

As chief engineer for energy distribution at AGEA, the Italian state electricity and water company, in 1933 he planned the construction and usage of high- and low-tension electricity lines in central and southern Italy, designed to supply electricity to the so-called "Agro Romano".

Immediately after the war he was hired by the Argentine government to construct the modern thermal "Dean Funes" power station in [[Córdoba, Argentina]], which had two 2,500 kW steam-turbo generators.

In 1950, as chief engineer, he planned and built the "9 July" thermal power station in [[Mar del Plata]], the only one of its kind with a power capacity of 20,000 kW. A pipeline connecting to the [[YPF]] and subterranean water refrigeration tunnels connected to the sea complete the generator which continues to supply this seaside town today.

'''Liquidity regulations''' are [[financial regulation]]s designed to ensure that financial institutions (e.g. banks) have the necessary assets on hand in order to prevent liquidity disruptions due to changing market conditions.  This is often related to [[reserve requirement]] and [[capital requirement]] but focuses on the specific [[liquidity risk]] of assets that are held.

These regulations were imposed to negate liquidity risks of banks that played a prominent role in financial crises. Financial banks profit from providing liquidity and [[maturity transformation]], which is the practice by financial institutions of borrowing money on shorter timeframes than they lend money out. In other words, using shorter-term deposits to fund longer-term loans. This can lead to bank runs during which depositors demand repayment of their demandable and maturing deposits, before the borrowers are required to repay the loans.&lt;ref name=wall &gt;Wall, L. D. (2015). Liquidity Regulation and Financial Stability.&lt;/ref&gt; The result could be a [[liquidity crisis]], which refers to an acute shortage (or "drying up") of liquidity.

==History==
In response to liquidity risks, bank regulators agreed global standards to reduce banks' ability to engage in liquidity and maturity transformation, thereby reducing banks' exposure to [[bank run|runs]]. Traditionally, the response to this risk was a combination of [[deposit insurance]] and [[discount window]] access. The former assures depositors not to worry about insolvency, which presumably keeps depositors who thought they might lose their funds entirely, out of the withdrawal line. The latter assures banks have access to short-term liquidity in order to meet the demands of depositors who have an immediate need for cash. These previous regulations were mainly to guard against moral hazard that both programs could create. Over the decades, after the implementation of these regulations, relatively few liquidity problems occurred in the deposit-funded commercial banking system.&lt;ref name=tarullo &gt;Tarullo, D. K. (2014). Liquidity Regulation. Federal Reserve System&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 financial crisis===
Over time there was a vast increase in the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which were supposedly safe, short-term, and liquid, but eventually resulted in poorly underwritten subprime mortgages - a classic adverse feedback loop ensued.&lt;ref name=tarullo /&gt; This led to the fall of the housing market and the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. In response to this failure of liquidity regulations, there has been recent progress in developing new measures to further reinforce the core role of liquidity regulation.

In 2010, the UK [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) introduced a new liquidity regulation known as the Individual Liquidity Guidance (ILG). In 2013, the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] agreed on a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is similar in design to the ILG but plays a role in an international playing field. The purpose of ILG is to make the banking system more resilient to liquidity shocks by requiring banks to hold a minimum quantity of high quality liquid assets (HQLA). These HQLA consist of cash, central bank reserves and government bonds to cover net outflows of liabilities under two specific stress scenarios, lasting 14 days and 3 months respectively. This way it is assumed that banks that are more heavily dependent on short-term wholesale funding, especially from foreign counterparts, would experience greater funding outflows and therefore need to hold a higher ratio of HQLA to total assets, to ensure immediate survival in stressed funding conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, R. N., &amp; Mio, H. (2014). The Effects of Liquidity Regulation on Banks, (470), 385–411.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. banking agencies have worked with other regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to develop the [[Net Stable Funding Ratio]] (NSFR), which is the available amount of stable funding, relative to the required amount of stable funding. It is assumed that this ratio should be at least 100% on an on-going basis. The ratio can be calculated with the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{Available  amount   of  stable  funding}{Required  amount  of  stable  funding}&lt;/math&gt; ≥ 100%

In this case, the ‘''available stable funding''’ is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The amount of such ‘''stable funding required''’ of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution, and those of its off-balance sheet exposures.&lt;ref name= basel&gt;Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. (2014). Basel III: The Net Stable Funding Ratio. Working Paper, Bank for International Settlemens, (April), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the NSFR will require banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities.&lt;ref name=basel /&gt; Together, the LCR and NSFR are designed to mitigate the risks associated with banks' reliance on unstable funding structures and to encourage them to embrace more resilient funding models.&lt;ref name=tarullo /&gt; The difference between the two is that the LCR is specifically designed to improve the short-term resilience of banks against liquidity shocks and the NSFR, on the other hand, is designed to limit the risks emanating from excessive maturity mismatches over the medium to long term &lt;ref&gt;ECB. (2013). Liquidity regulation and monetary policy implementation. Monthly Bulletin, (April), 73–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
There is some debate on the impact of the LCR and NSFR, since they can at most constrain maturity mismatches within the banking system. The underlying economic core reasons why money suppliers want liquid funds and borrowers want longer-term loans are not changed by these regulations. It is therefore a matter of time until alternative methods of liquidity and maturity transformation will be developed that may result in the next financial crisis. Whether the outcome of these liquidity regulations is a net positive for financial stability is debatable.&lt;ref name=wall /&gt; For further reading on the debatable effects of these liquidity regulations see;&lt;ref name=wall /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolò, G. De. (2016). Liquidity Regulation: Rationales, Benefits and Costs. National Institute Economic Review, (235), 18–26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duijma, P., &amp; Wiertsa, P. (2016). The Effects of Liquidity Regulation on Bank Assets and Liabilities, (ii), 385–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Logori was born in 1871 in [[Korçë]], back then still part of the [[Vilayet of Monastir]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Like many other people from his region, he had to emigrate at a young age. Logori settled in [[Egypt]] at the age of 13. There he received his education; Logori graduated from the [[Lycée Français d'Alexandrie|French Lyceum of Alexandria]]. He was actively involved in the Albanian patriotic circles there.&lt;ref name="Blumi3"&gt;{{citation| page=117| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NatgAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT236&amp;lpg=PT236&amp;dq=Milo+Du%C3%87i&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4ys-6mi7lr&amp;sig=-rWEw932Lb3zaJSW5HFdI1RJ3JA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCGoVChMI_erVvKPcyAIVg1s-Ch2NsQSJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Milo%20Du%C3%87i&amp;f=false| title=Reinstating the Ottomans: Alternative Balkan Modernities, 1800-1912| author=Isa Blumi|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York| year=2011|isbn=9780230110182 |oclc=669751242}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained contacts with members of the Albanian ''[[émigré]]'' community in [[Bucharest]], [[Istanbul]], [[Italy]], and [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Blumi1"/&gt; In 1909, he represented the colony of Egypt in the [[Congress of Elbasan]], where the foundations of the [[Education in Albania|Albanian education]] were set.
&lt;br&gt;He lived in Egypt for most of hist life (58 years). In 1929, he came to [[Albania]] with an invitation from the Albanian government of the time. He positively responded to the invitation, left Egypt and settled in [[Durres]]. Unfortunately he died the same year.&lt;ref name="Asllani"&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.albeu.com/opinion/shqiptaret-e-egjiptit-dhe-veprimtaria-atdhetare-e-tyre/1538/| language=Albanian|title=Shqiptarët e egjiptit dhe veprimtaria atdhetare e tyre|trans-title=Albanians of Egypt and their patriotic activity|author=Uran Asllani|publisher=Gazeta Metropol| date=2006-06-05| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As an entrepreneur===
Logori was a successful businessman in Egypt.  By that time Egypt experienced a massive economic development and prosperity, French and British investments (i.e. the [[Suez Canal]]), modernization, and opportunity for entrepreneurship. Together with his nephew [[Milo Duçi]], he emerged as an important player in the economic development of Egypt's Delta region directed by [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]]'s office. By 1901, he started working with his well-connected uncle Loni Logori on projects that explicitly tied the commercial interest of the [[UK|British]] administration and the local landowners.&lt;ref name="Blumi2"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nTKaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=Milo+Duci&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Z6T6SDOmoO&amp;sig=M6Y15wY22E6svlDJUk0uCcvsIIw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwBGoVChMIyNfVzYPcyAIViz8-Ch1vMgId#v=onepage&amp;q=Milo%20Duci&amp;f=false|page=84| author=Isa Blumi|title=Ottoman Refugees, 1878-1939: Migration in a Post-Imperial World|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic| year=2013 | location=London | isbn=9781472515360|oclc=830369887 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Logori built much of the canal network in the Minah District.&lt;ref name="Blumi1"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2-sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=loni+logori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f22jR7BP_q&amp;sig=GBkmOmT5gXCg0nlne62JTn4idtY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIr-yK0oHcyAIVg2w-Ch3VMQMc#v=onepage&amp;q=loni%20logori&amp;f=false| pages=131–132| author=Isa Blumi|title=Foundations of Modernity: Human Agency and the Imperial State|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2012|series= 	Routledge studies in modern history|number=9|isbn=9780415884648 |oclc=607983304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a poet===
Logori is the author of many lyrical poetry and songs in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], as ''"Drenovarja"'' (The girl from Drenova),&lt;ref name="VOAL"&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.voal.ch/drenovarja-poezi-nga-loni-logori/| publisher=VOAL| language=Albanian| title=Drenovarja, poezi nga Loni Logori|trans-title=Drenovarja, poetry from Loni Logori| date=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Vemi o vemi"'' (Let's go, let's go), "Celu çelu" (Open up). He also covered alternated thematic as the national heroes (songs for [[Papa Kristo Negovani]], Spiro Kosturi, etc.). As a translator, he translated from [[French language|French]] the  ''[[Le Cid]]'' of [[Pierre Corneille]].&lt;ref name="Asllani"/&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Logori also attempted several times in writing a national anthem for Albania. In fact, one of its first attempts was called "Royal Anthem" (Alb: ''Hymni Mbretnor'') and was found in the catalogs of [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor Records]]. It was recorded on 28 March 1918, in [[New York City]], interpreted by the [[tenor]] Giuseppe Mauro, while the performing orchestra was directed by [[Nathaniel Shilkret]], and the lyrics by Logori.&lt;ref name="GVatra"&gt;{{citation| url=http://gazetavatra.com/himni-i-flamurit/| publisher=Gazeta Vatra| language=Albanian| date=2014-10-14|author=Paolo Muner| title=Jo vetëm "Hymni i Flamurit" - Disa kuriozitete mbi "himnet e tjera kombëtare" shqiptare, në ag' të Pavarësisë / Non solo "Inno della Bandiera"- Qualche curiosità su altri "inni nazionali" albanesi, agli albori dell'indipendenza, in italian and albanian (traduzione albanese di Albana Nexhipi)  BOTIME JOZEF, DURAZZO, 2014, 156 pagg., 22 illustrazioni, ISBN 978-9928-189-16-5;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1524">In employment law, a '''Loudermill letter''' is a letter that public-sector employers may send to employees giving notice of their intent to suspend, demote, or terminate.

According to [[Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill]], the process that is due a public employee includes a pre-termination hearing that provides "oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story."  The Loudermill letter fulfills the requirement of (written) notice, and should include an explanation of the employer's evidence ("to act as a check for mistaken accusations"). To fulfill the remaining [[Due Process]] requirements, a Loudermill letter will also have to inform the employee of his opportunity for a [[Loudermill hearing]].

==Content of the letter==

The formal letter advising the employee that discipline is being considered, and offering the opportunity for the employee to discuss or present his or her version and mitigating evidence, may be the first time the employee is even aware that certain allegations have arisen or that an investigation has been concluded.

The letter usually states that the employee may contact his union representative. The governing contract language may also state that the union representative will receive a copy of the letter

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7792">A '''methodological advisor''' or [[consultant]] provides methodological and statistical advice and guidance to clients interested in making decisions regarding the design of studies, the collection and analysis of data, and the presentation and dissemination of research findings.&lt;ref name="amh"&gt;[[Adèr, H.J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh, G.J.]], &amp; Hand, D.J. (2008). ''Advising on research methods: A consultant’s companion''. Johannes van Kessel Publishing: Huizen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; Trained in both methods and statistics and communication skills, advisors may work in academia, industry, or the public sector.

==Education and employment==

Methodological advisors generally have post-graduate training in statistics, as well as relevant practical experience. In addition, advisors may also have significant education and experience in the particular field they work in. Some universities offer specific graduate programmes in fields such as [[biostatistics]], psychological methods, or methodology and statistics for the medical, behavioural, and social sciences.

Methodological consultants primarily find work in academia and industry. In the private sector, consultants may be part of an organisation, employed by a consultancy firm, or self-employed. Many universities offer [[List of university statistical consulting centers|in-house methodological advice for researchers]], as well as, in some cases, services for outside clients. The advisors may also be researchers of their own right and be deeply involved with particular projects. Project statisticians, in particular, are embedded with research groups and often developed a deep understanding not just of statistics, but also of the research topics themselves.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; In contrast, independent advisors are often only consulted on specific questions, and may be less involved with the project as a whole.

Disciplines in which methodological advice is sought stretch the entire width of the quantitative sciences, but may in particular include the [[medicine|medical sciences]], [[biology]], [[psychology|psychological research]], and [[business studies]]. Advisors are also consulted in public administration, where they may be involved at all levels of governance. In the legal system, consultants may be called upon as expert witnesses, in particular in cases that involve statistical considerations.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

==Range of tasks==

The role of a methodological advisors varies from project to project, but can include any point in the research cycle. While ''cross-sectional consulting'' may only occur at one point during a project, ''longitudinal consulting'' may mean that the advisor stays with the project from beginning to end.&lt;ref name="gvb"&gt;Van Belle, G. (2008). ''Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.)''. New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, advice is not limited to statistical questions.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; Broadly speaking, questions may concern the design of studies, choice or construction of measurement instruments, analysis of data, and presentation of results.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt; In particular, common questions include:&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

* [[design of experiments]] and research studies
* plotting data
* measurement instruments (choosing, constructing &amp; analysing)
* determination of adequate [[sample size]] to detect a hypothesised effect
* determination of an adequate [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] procedure for a study, [[statistical survey|survey]] or [[experiment]]
* supervision of [[data]] collection to ensure elements of the [[population (statistics)|population]] are being sampled correctly
* statistical analyses (e.g., [[analysis of variance]], [[Regression analysis|regression]], etc.) of data to address research hypotheses
* the write-up of statistical results for grant proposals, manuscripts, professional conferences, or other presentations.

Giving methodological advice can mean answering specific questions or performing mundane data analyses, but may often go beyond that. In particular when clients have little understanding of research methods and statistics, consultants may have to clarify substantive questions and to translate them into methodological and statistical procedures. In private companies, the form of consultancy does not necessarily depend on the understanding of the client. Different companies may offer different forms of consulting, ranging from providing a quick fix for specific problems, provide extensive explanations to the client or even running the whole analyses.

In some cases, this may also entail profound ethical considerations.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gvb" /&gt; The client's occupation may form a constraint for the form in which consultancy can be offered.  For example, running data-analyses for companies may not be a problem, where doing this for a bachelors or masters student can be considered fraud.

==Skill set==

Although statisticians were traditionally trained largely on a technical skill set, recent times have brought a realisation that advisors need to be proficient in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills just as well as in methodological questions.&lt;ref name="jd"&gt;Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In H. J. Adèr &amp; G. J. Mellenbergh (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods'' (pp. 11-20).&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they have to be able to elicit explanations from clients and to give clear explanations of methods and statistics themselves. Because in some cases the implications of methodological advice may be profound (e.g., it may not be possible to conduct certain experiments, or to gain certain insights from data already collected), consultants also have to be able to communicate such ramifications.&lt;ref name="amh" /&gt;

'''Nepal Financial Reporting Standards''' ('NFRS') are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable within Nepal. The rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant as per the users internal or external.

NFRS was issued by [[Nepal Accounting Standard Board]] in 2013. Earlier it has issued Nepal Accounting Standards. NFRS is prepared in line with on IFRS.

==Objective of financial statements==

Financial statements are a structured representation of the financial positions and financial performance of an entity. The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.

To meet this objective, financial statements provide information about an entity's:
*     assets;
*     liabilities;
*     equity;
*     income and expenses, including gains and losses;
*     contributions by and distributions to owners in their capacity as owners; and
*     cash flows.
This information, along with other information in the notes, assists users of financial statements in predicting the entity's future cash flows and, in particular, their timing and certainty.

The following are the general features in NFRS:
* Fair presentation and compliance with NFRS:
Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of the transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the Framework of NFRS.
* Going concern: 
Financial statements are present on a going concern basis unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
* Accrual basis of accounting: 
An entity shall recognise items as assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses when they satisfy the definition and recognition criteria for those elements in the Framework of NFRS.
* Materiality and aggregation: 
Every material class of similar items has to be presented separately. Items that are of a dissimilar nature or function shall be presented separately unless they are immaterial.
* Offsetting
Offsetting is generally forbidden in NFRS.
* Frequency of reporting: 
NFRS requires that at least annually a complete set of financial statements is presented.
* Comparative information: 
NFRS requires entities to present comparative information in respect of the preceding period for all amounts reported in the current period's financial statements. In addition comparative information shall also be provided for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period's financial statements.
* Consistency of presentation: 
NFRS requires that the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements is retained from one period to the next unless: 
(a)     it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the entity's operations or a review of its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies.
(b)     an NFRS standard requires a change in presentation.

'''''Punch Club''''' (originally titled '''''VHS Story''''') is a [[Sports game#Management|sporting management simulation]] developed by Lazy Bear Games and published by [[tinyBuild]]. In the game, the player manages an upcoming [[boxing|boxer]] in training and preparation for a series of boxing matches at a local club, while searching for clues of who killed their father. The game was developed as a humorous take on action films of the 1980s and 1990s. The game was released in January 2016 for [[Microsoft Windows]],  [[OS X]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], following a [[Twitch Plays Pokémon|Twitch Plays ''Pokémon'']]-style event on [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]]. A [[Nintendo 3DS]] port of the game was announced in a September 2016 Nintendo Direct for release in January 2017 after some delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nintendaan|title=Punch Club Will Be Arriving On North American 3DS eShop Next Week|url=http://gonintendo.com/stories/271653-punch-club-will-be-arriving-on-north-american-3ds-eshop-next-week|website=Go Nintendo|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ports for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] were released on March 31, 2017. A [[Nintendo Switch]] version was released on May 24, 2018.

==Gameplay==
The player controls an unnamed boxer whose father, who helped to train him, was murdered. The boxer aims to continue his training and become the best boxer at a local league, while following clues to lead him to who killed his father. The player manages the boxer around the clock through various locations in a city, including his home, the boxing gym, stores, and his work place. Time progresses when the player is involved in any activity, including moving between these locations.

The boxer character has three primary attributes that contribute towards his skill in boxing and how other boxers are compared: strength, agility, and stamina. These attributes start at one but can be increased by performing various activities, such as exercising or going to work. However, performing these activities will wear away at other attributes, including hunger, alertness, and happiness, and if these attributes are too low, some activities may not be available. These lesser attributes can be regained through eating, sleeping, and other events, though the main boxing attributes will slowly degrade with game time. The boxer will gain friends or other associates over the course of the game which will help also lead the character towards resolving the mystery of his father's murder, perform new activities to help raise the primary attributes, or aid in boosting the lesser attributes. Further, many activities require in-game money, which the player earns through performing work or by winning boxing matches. Thus, the player must determine how to balance the character's activities with the limited in-game time to maintain sufficiently high boxing attributes as to advance up in the boxing ranks. The game has a quest system, but many quests are optional.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt; The game has several possible endings, depending on choices players make.

When the player opts to send the character into a fight, or when the character is forced to fight, the game then allows the player to equip the boxer with a limited number of boxing skills that they have learned to that point including punches, kicks, and blocks; these skills can be swapped out between boxing rounds. Opponents will also have a similar set of skills, which the player can examine between rounds. Some skills require the player to have a high enough primary attribute to be used, while the effect of others is based on the value of these attributes. Once the player has selected these skills, the round is executed automatically by the computer during the next round. The moves for each fighter during the round are randomly drawn from those selected. The goal is to reduce the health of the opponent to zero before the boxer's is reduced, or before twenty rounds are completed, in which a decision is made by the game as to who won the match. New skills are gained as the player completes more of the game, making them a more adept fighter.

The game itself is written with numerous references to 80s and 90s fighting movies, including references to the ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' films, ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', and other works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://toucharcade.com/2016/01/22/punch-club-review/ | title = 'Punch Club' Review - A Gut Punch of Nostalgia | first = Andrew | last =  Koziara | date = January 22, 2016 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 | work = Touch Arcade }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
During the boxer's childhood, his father was murdered by an unidentified gunman wearing a trench coat in an alley.  The orphaned boxer is adopted by a police officer named Frank until the boxer hits adulthood.  While attempting to look for work, the boxer gets beaten in a street fight. Witnessing the boxer's potential, an [[Rocky (film)|old man named Mick]] approaches him and guides the boxer into training at a local gym owned by Silver.  The boxer undergoes training and participates in a minor boxing league as well as an underground fight club.  While participating in the matches, the man in the trench coat, identified as "the man in black" was briefly seen by the boxer.  The owner of the underground fight club explains to the boxer that the man in black is looking for the best fighters to compete in a tournament on a remote island.  Depending on the player's actions, the boxer can follow one of the two paths:  One is to participate in a boxing championship tournament to gain a professional fighting card, or to fully complete the underground fighting circuit in order to curry favor for [[The Godfather (film)|a local crime boss named Don]].

The story diverges based on the player's choices.  If the boxer completed the championship, the boxer sustains an injury, prompting fellow competitor [[Bloodsport (film)|Roy Jackson]] to fight in the boxer's place.  However, Roy is killed while fighting a [[Zangief|Russian fighter]], prompting the boxer to fight in Russia after recovering.  If the boxer completed the underground ring, he is incarcerated after a failed black market deal, and fights for his release after participating in prison fights.  Regardless of the path taken, the player learns from a friend of Mick's that the boxer's father was in possession of a [[Double Dragon (film)|medallion]], and that the father had split it into two halves with disastrous consequences.  During the night of the father's murder, one of the father's friends is accused of committing the murder and imprisoned despite coming across the father's dead body.

Shortly after completing the fight in Russia or the prison, the boxer builds up his reputation as a fighter by either working under [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Din Kong]] as a professional boxer, or as an enforcer for Don's criminal organization.  Shortly after beating the champions of the respective path, the boxer is invited to the man in black's island, with the final fighter determined by the boxer's chosen path.  If the professional fighter route is taken, the boxer fights the underground fight club owner, revealed to be the boxer's brother.  If working under Don's wing was taken, the boxer fights a blue-colored ninja (as a reference to [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]). Shortly after beating the final fighter, the man in black reveals himself to be the boxer's father as the game ends.

==Development==
''Punch Club'' was initially developed by the Russia-based, three-person Lazy Bear Studios under the name ''VHS Story'', which stood for ''Video Hero Super Story''.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2015/02/06/interview-trading-blows-remembering-the-80s90s-with-the-vhs-story-creators/ | title = Interview: Trading Blows, Remembering The 80s/90s With The VHS Story Creators | first = Chris | last = Priestman | date = February 6, 2015 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 | work = [[Siliconera]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sviatoslav Cherkasov, one of the developers, said that their whole team, in 2015, were around thirty years old, and had grown up around [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] titles, cartoons like ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', and action movies of the 80s and 90s distributed at that time on [[VHS tapes]] from stars like [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt; As fans of strategy games, they sought to combine these features, coming up with what they considered to be a ''[[Street Fighter]]'' manager, inspired by the story of the ''Rocky'' movies.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt;

For the fighting portion of the game, the studio found that having the player lack direct control of their boxer fit well with their tycoon game. The selection of moves made it similar to the strategy required for [[collectible card game]]s, giving the player ways to adjust their strategy based on how well their boxer matched with a competitor even during the course of a fight.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt; Further, as the player lacked interaction during the boxing rounds, the player will be able to watch the fight, which they believed was more entertaining.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt; For the larger game, they did not want to have a story-driven title, and made most of the quests optional.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt;

The game entered its alpha release in December 2014, with original plans to release on [[Microsoft Windows]], but with the potential for other platforms due to the cross-platform [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] engine.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.siliconera.com/2014/12/06/manage-streetfighter-nostalgic-vhs-story/ | title = Manage Your Own Streetfighter In The Nostalgic VHS Story | first = Chris | last = Priestman | date = December 6, 2014 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 | work = [[Siliconera]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; To help fund the game, the developers looked to spur pre-release sales in addition to other funding sources, and used [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s Greenlight feature to gauge interest in the game.&lt;ref name="siliconera interview"/&gt; The Greenlight process in January 2015 successfully approved the game for release on Steam within five days, one of the fastest Greenlit games on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SvyatoslavCherkasov/20150130/235409/How_to_get_greenlit_in_5_days.php | title = How to get greenlit in 5 days | first=  Sviatoslav | last = Cherkasov | date = January 30, 2015 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]], [[tinyBuild]] announced that they would be helping to publish the game, now titled ''Punch Club'', for Windows and mobile platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/246740/Punch_Club_the_90s_boxing_tycoon_E3_Demo_is_righthere.php | title = Punch Club, the 90s boxing tycoon E3 Demo is right here | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = June 22, 2015 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To release the game, tinyBuild created an event similar to the [[Twitch Plays Pokémon|Twitch Plays ''Pokémon'']] social gaming events, in which the viewers on their [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]] channel can enter commands to control the game's character, with the mass numbers of viewers often giving conflicting commands to make for humorous events in game. The "Twitch Plays ''Punch Club''" event was started on January 7, 2016, promising viewers that once they completed the game, they would release the title, or otherwise release the title on January 25, 2016 regardless. The viewers of the event successfully completed the game in 36 hours, and as promised, the game was officially released on January 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/09/punch-club-released-twitch/ | title = Twitch Played Punch Club And Got A Girlfriend | first = Hayden | last = Dingman | date = January 9, 2016 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Lazy Bear and tinyBuild announced the game had sold over 250,000 copies across all platforms, with over $2 million in revenue. As a result, they announced plans to release in March 2016 a free expansion, "The Dark Fist", along with improvements to the game, including integration with Twitch to allow players to bet virtual currency on fights which can unlock additional in-game content, and saves that work cross-platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/266455/Punch_Club_crosses_2m_in_sales_is_getting_free_DLC_in_TheDark_Fist_expansion.php | title = Punch Club crosses $2m in sales, is getting "free DLC" in The Dark Fist expansion | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = February 23, 2016 | accessdate = February 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

tinyBuild's Netherlands studio helped to port the game to the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], which were released on March 31, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-28-steam-hit-punch-club-hits-consoles-this-friday | title = Steam hit Punch Club launches on consoles this Friday | first = Wesley | last= Yin-Poole | date = March 28, 2017 | accessdate = March 28, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also ported to the [[Nintendo Switch]] which was released on May 24, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/boxing_simulator_punch_club_aims_for_a_knockout_on_switch_next_week|title=Boxing Simulator Punch Club Aims For A Knockout On Switch Next Week|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|last=Craddock|first=Ryan|date=May 16, 2018|accessdate=May 20, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Punch Club'' currently has a [[Metacritic]] aggregate score of 73/100 from 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/punch-club | title = Punch Club (pc) | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = February 23, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2016, Alex Nichiporchik of tinyBuild who published ''Punch Club'', reported that the game has sold more than 300,000 copies, but also have reported piracy of the title exceeding 1.6 million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/268608/Punch_Club_surpasses_300k_copies_sold__and_16_million_pirated.php | title = Punch Club surpasses 300k copies sold -- and 1.6 million pirated | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date = March 21, 2016 | accessdate = March 21, 2016 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Punch Club'' was one of the disputed titles in the controversy on the legitimacy of key-reselling by the online store [[G2A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-23-g2a-and-tinybuilds-row-over-pc-game-key-reselling-is-getting-ugly | title = G2A and tinyBuild's row over PC game key reselling gets ugly | first= Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date=  June 23, 2016 | accessdate = March 28, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It measures the extent to which citizens of the nations of the Arab League are able to make their own economic decisions without limitations imposed by the government or by crony elites. The report provides sound empirical measurement of economic policy that can distinguish between phony reform that leaves economic and political power in the hands of crony elites, and real reform that creates new prosperity, entrepreneurship, and jobs, by opening business and work opportunities for everyone no matter whom they know.

Arab and Islamic societies have a rich trading tradition, one that celebrates markets open even to the humblest members of society. Economic freedom is consistent with that proud history and provides a path to a more prosperous and freer tomorrow. Economic freedom is simply the ability of individuals and families to take charge of their fate and make their own economic decisions—to sell or buy in the marketplace without discrimination, to open or close a business, to work for whom they wish or hire whom they wish, to receive investment or invest in others.

Dr Salem ben Nasser Al Ismaily was awarded the “Man of the Year”  in year 2015 at the Arab Liberty Festival, which was held in [[Marrakesh|Marrakesh, Morocco]].

=== The Omani back channel ===
[[File:Al-Ismaily with John Kerry.png|thumb|Al-Ismaily with [[John Kerry]]]]
Al-Isamily was the colorful fixture of the Omani “back channel” to Iran that opened in 2009, the contact of the Ismaily began on May 2009 right after 4 months [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] taken the office. He surprised the Americans with “an offer by Iran to negotiate” about the nuclear program, Al-Ismaily assured he could bring the Iranians to the table, and he made his promise. [[John Kerry]] and Salem Al-Ismaily knew each other during the hikers negotiations and Kerry made several visits to [[Oman]] in 2011 and early 2012. “In his zeal to jump-start the negotiations, [[John Kerry|Kerry]] passed several messages to the Iranians through Ismaily,” according to [[Mark Landler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-omani-back-channel-to-iran-and-the-secrecy-surrounding-the-nuclear-deal/2016/06/07/0b9e27d4-2ce1-11e6-b5db-e9bc84a2c8e4_story.html|title=The Omani ‘back channel’ to Iran and the secrecy surrounding the nuclear deal|last=Ignatius|first=David|date=2016-06-07|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Within the first five minutes of meeting Salem,” recalls the Secretary of State John Kerry “I realized that his objective extended beyond the hikers. We spoke of the importance of getting Josh and Shane home swiftly but he turned quickly to the potential for progress on other fronts as well. At the top of the list was Iran’s current path to a nuclear weapon.”

“Salem made clear to me during that first meeting that Sultan Qaboos felt he could be helpful in advancing a mutually agreeable solution. It was also clear that the Omanis were not acting only out of goodwill; they knew that a nuclear-armed Iran would fundamentally undermine the stability of the region’ stated Mr. Kerry. 

“And they were concerned, as we were, that Tehran was getting closer and closer to a weapon. Shane and Josh were finally released in September 2011, thanks in large part to Oman’s efforts. In my view, and in the view of many in the Obama administration, including President Obama himself, Sultan Qaboos had proven his seriousness and his sway with the Iranians” He added.

“Having proven their bona fides, I believed it was appropriate to see if they could help bridge the communications divide with the Iranians. We needed greater insight into their thinking. We needed to better assess the possibilities. Salem and I began to talk regularly, both on the phone and, from time to time, in person. We were careful about prying ears and microphones. Knowing there were people in the United States and overseas who advocated military action as the only solution to Iran’s nuclear progress, we wanted to be careful not to make a diplomatic solution impossible even before our nations had a chance to sit down and talk.”  He continued.

“I shared my discussions only with the smallest number of authorized people in the administration, dealing most of the time with Tom Donilon. There was general agreement that, given the success of the hikers’ release, it was worth at least exploring the potential for progress on the nuclear front. With President Obama’s approval, I began planning for a trip to Muscat to meet with Sultan Qaboos in hopes of gaining better insight as to what was really possible. I suggested to President Obama that there was one more person we needed to bring into the circle: Senate majority leader Harry Reid.” Mr. Kerry revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=narrator.|first=Kerry, John, 1943- author,|title=Every day is extra|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1048361946|isbn=9781508266846|oclc=1048361946|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T.K. Bellis Turtle Co. advertising.jpg|thumbnail|right|T.K. Bellis Turtle Co. advertising, 1905]]
'''Thomas Kerrison Bellis''' (5 February 1841 &amp;ndash; 24 April 1929)&lt;ref name="probate"&gt;''England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995''&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[merchant]] and importer of [[turtle]]s. Known as "The Turtle King",&lt;ref name =Sketch&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Turtle_King_in_The_Sketch,_23_February_1898,_p._213..jpg "The Turtle King"] in ''[[The Sketch]]'', 23 February 1898, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sporting/&gt; he established a thriving business in London at the end of the 19th century, producing turtle products that promised health benefits and were a staple of Victorian fine dining and civic banquets.

==Career==
Bellis was born in [[Liverpool]],&lt;ref&gt;''1881 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; and educated there at [[Liverpool College]].&lt;ref name=Sketch/&gt; He travelled to London to work in a West India house (West Indies merchants) as a young man.&lt;ref name=sporting&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP18980628.2.42 "The Turtle King"] in ''Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News'', 28 June 1898, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably there that he learned about the turtle trade. He started his own business in the trade in 1874&lt;ref name =Sketch/&gt; and in 1882 won a silver medal for turtle products at the [[International Fishery Congress|International Fisheries Exhibition]].&lt;ref&gt;"The International Fisheries Exhibition" in ''[[The Times]]'', 18 April 1882, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He created a niche for himself, so that by the end of the nineteenth century he had almost monopolised the trade in turtle products in Britain. His firm produced [[turtle soup]] and pate, turtle herbs, turtle oil soap, sun-dried turtle and various kinds of preserved turtle, and supplied Queen Victoria.&lt;ref name=Anglo&gt;Advertising in Wills, Walter H. and R.J. Barrett (Eds.) (1905) ''The Anglo-African Who's Who and Biographical Sketch-Book''. London: [[Routledge|George Routledge]], p. i&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importing turtles==
The turtles, which were only of the ''[[chelonia mydas]]'' species, were caught in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and transported by [[schooner]] to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica, from where they were shipped to Britain by Royal Mail steamer. In 1898 approximately one hundred turtles were imported every two weeks, and they were kept alive if possible using [[salt-water]] hose and tanks on ship. However, many died during the journey, 105 out of 120 on one occasion. The cold was a particular problem. Each weighed over 100 pounds and up to 140 but heavier ones were not required as the meat was less tender. Originally, Bellis kept the survivors alive in his cellars until required, but later took to slaughtering them on arrival and processing the meat straight away.&lt;ref name =Sketch/&gt;

In 1905, it was reported that there was not a single live turtle available anywhere in London, not even for a guinea an ounce (a great deal of money then). A quarrel had broken out between fishermen from Kingston and the Nicaraguan authorities, off whose coast the fishermen were accustomed to work. Kingston vessels had been seized, the men imprisoned by the Nicaraguans, and their catch set loose. Bellis, the "chief importer of turtles in Britain" advised that other boats would not venture out, however, a British gunboat would soon be going along to protect them, so there was hope that turtle would be available for the [[Lord Mayor's Banquet]] the following month, and that [[mock turtle soup]] would not have to be served.&lt;ref name=Trove&gt;{{cite web|title=Dearth of Turtles - Banqueters in Deep Alarm|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article68712004|work=West Gippsland Gazette|date=10 January 1905|page=6|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider/videos/10155277616754071/ interview] with [[Business Insider]], he blamed "intellectual smugness" and "closed-mindedness masquerading as opened-mindedness" for the move.

Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the {{convert|165|lb|kg|abbr=on}} weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national [[Sanshou]] (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring  and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several [[Weight class (boxing)|classes]] below his actual weight – a practice known as [[weight cutting]].&lt;ref name="commandments"&gt;[http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/08/08/the-7-commandments-of-blogosphere-and-life-self-defense/ "The 7 Commandments of Blogosphere (and Life) Self-Defense"], Ferriss' blog, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="commandments"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Victoria: An Empire Under the Sun''''' is a [[Grand strategy wargame|grand strategy]] game by [[Paradox Entertainment]] (now known as [[Paradox Interactive]]), released in 2003. It covers primarily its namesake the [[Victorian period]] (1837-1901) and beyond, specifically 1836-1920 for the main game, and extended until 1936 if the expansion is installed. The game runs on a modified version of the ''[[Europa Universalis]]'' engine, and the lead [[game programmer]] was [[Johan Andersson (game programmer)|Johan Andersson]]. It was later ported to Macintosh by Virtual Programming.

Unlike previous Paradox Games, which either focused on diplomacy or war, ''Victoria'' focuses on internal management, covering the industrialization and social/political changes in a country. The game itself gives a lot of importance to the economy of a country, having a complex market system which is described as being one of the best economic simulators ever made. Fans of Paradox's games have noted this one for being the deepest game Paradox had yet made, making it quite popular with the Paradox fanbase. However, ''Victoria'' received largely indifferent reviews on release, averaging only 60.4% on [[GameRankings]]. Critics cited reasons such as the game's steep learning curve and its relatively dated graphics. A sequel, ''[[Victoria II]]'' was released in August 2010.

==Gameplay==
The economic system in ''Victoria'' attempts to simulate the flow of resources in a world market. Every province in the game produces a resource. Some [[Resource (economics)|resources]], such as wheat, are demanded principally by POPs (population units), and can be sold directly. Other materials, such as [[timber]], are consumed mostly by industry - but can nonetheless be sold directly for less [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. The player possesses a wide range of options with which to build their economy, provided they have access to the proper raw materials. All resources can be collected or produced by industry. They can also be acquired on the world market. Access to the world market is granted based on a country's prestige rating.

''Victoria'' has 47 separate resources, produced by collection or production (or in one case both). The game focuses on industrialization in a country, which is driven by technological research. The acquisition of machine parts is crucial to industrialization, as they are needed to build factories.

[[Diplomacy]] is managed bilaterally; nations can engage in diplomacy using a variable yearly supply of diplomats, offering various treaties and entreaties to other states. Players can use money to improve relations with the other powers; offer to [[negotiate]] for technology, territory, colonial claims, and money; sign pacts of unilateral or mutual defense or full alliances; demand the cessation of colonization of certain areas; and, if all other efforts fail, declare [[war]].

Warfare in ''Victoria'' is a special circumstance of diplomacy wherein two players attempt to invade one another's (national or colonial, depending on the war) territory. It is abstract, and consists of divisions marching to hostile territory and fighting a hands-off battle that the player has no control over save by sending reinforcements or withdrawing.
Combat efficiency, however, can be influenced decisively by the player. Appointing generals or admirals influences the morale and organization of the troops, as do technological improvements. An advanced railroad system in a province grants the province's owner bonuses in combat, as well as increased mobility. Provinces can also be fortified and troops will entrench when left alone long
enough, both giving enormous combat benefits.

The ultimate objectives in warfare is dramatically different from those of other strategy games: it is generally very difficult to do severe damage to an enemy's economy in a single war, occupied territory is only temporarily in the hands of the occupier, and post-war territorial gains are generally modest and difficult to subdue. However, there are other conditions to peace such as War Indemnities and Humiliation.

Declaring war or seizing provinces from [[civilized]] countries without pre-existing claims makes diplomacy more difficult and can eventually lead to [[preemptive war]] from other powers. Warmongers tend to discover themselves radically isolated from the rest of the world and forced to engage in warfare almost continuously, which can lead to neglect of industry and prestige.

Military units in ''Victoria'' are divided into two types: land and naval. Land units fight against enemy land units, and can occupy enemy provinces. They are the key to military supremacy. Naval units provide a more supportive role; bombarding enemy land units and fighting sea battles. Some naval units can also transport land units.

''Victoria'' got mostly mixed reviews from critics.  GameSpot commented on its "wonderful depth" and "great alternate-history ambiance."  However, GameSpot commented that the game was "more work than play," citing its steep learning curve and overall scope of options.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  IGN commented that the game had unique potential, but was crushed by its "bugginess" and lack of tutorial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/09/victoria-review?page=4&lt;/ref&gt;  Barry Brenesal ended his IGN review, explaining, "There's an excellent game struggling to surface in Victoria, and I look forward to playing it just as soon as the requisite patches appear. Now would some kindly soul please create an accurate, intelligent manual for the game?"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
