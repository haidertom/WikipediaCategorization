[[File:Glass Salon by Paul Ruaud and Eileen Gray.jpg|thumb|Glass Salon designed by Paul Ruaud with furniture by [[Eileen Gray]], for Madame Mathieu-Levy (Juliette Lévy) milliner of the boutique J. Suzanne Talbot, 9, rue de Lota, Paris, 1922]]
The '''"Dragons" armchair''' ([[French language|French]]: "Fauteuil aux Dragons") is a piece of furniture designed by the Irish architect and designer [[Eileen Gray]] between 1917 and 1919. "Dragons" armchair sold for €21,905,000 in 2009, establishing a new record for a piece of 20th century decorative art.

==Design==
The chair is a wooden upholstered [[armchair (furniture)|armchair]] featuring two stylized [[lacquer]]ed [[dragon]]s. It measures 61 by 91&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name='Christies'&gt;{{cite web|title=Fauteuil Aux Dragons, Vers 1917-1919|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/furniture-lighting/eileen-gray-fauteuil-aux-dragons-vers-1917-1919-5171305-details.aspx#top|publisher=Christie's|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The chair was described by auctioneers [[Christie's]] as being:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the form of unfurling petals, upholstered in brown leather, the frame in sculpted wood, lacquered brownish orange and silver and modelled as the serpentine, intertwined bodies of two dragons, their eyes in black lacquer on a white ground, their bodies decorated in low relief with stylised clouds."&lt;ref name='Christies'/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Christie's additionally felt that the chair "...distills all that was so personal and so magical in the first, intimately expressive phase of Miss Gray's career — surprising, imaginative, subtly sculpted and crafted, it is a masterpiece of invention and execution."&lt;ref name='Christies'/&gt; [[Jennifer Goff]], the curator of the [[National Museum of Ireland]]'s permanent exhibition of Gray's work, felt that the chair was the "perfect example of the designer who created it – completely unique [and] rather eccentric".&lt;ref name=SMHSep15&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/are-you-sitting-down-how-a-43m-chair-brought-to-light-a-forgotten-designer-20150921-gjrfh7.html|title=Are you sitting down? How a $43m chair brought to light a forgotten designer|author=Ray Edgar|date=25 September 2015|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dragon imagery and clouds depicted on the chair have been likened to those found in the iconography of traditional [[Chinese art]],&lt;ref name='Christies'/&gt; and the flowing nature of the ornately carved armrests have been compared to a "sea monster" and given the chair its "Dragons" moniker.&lt;ref name="Flint2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Flint|title=Modern Man: The Life of Le Corbusier, Architect of Tomorrow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUjCBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-544-26222-5|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelegApr16&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/4805374/Small-brown-armchair-sells-for-19-million.html|title=Small brown armchair sells for £19 million|date=25 February 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray worked on the chair between 1917 and 1919, lacquering the piece by hand and letting the lacquer set in her humid bathroom before spending days polishing the piece.&lt;ref name=DepartMay11&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.departures.com/lifestyle/home-front/eileen-grays-modern-masterpieces|title=Eileen Gray's Modern Masterpieces|author=Mark Van De Walle|date=5 May 2011|work=[[Departures (magazine)|Departures]]|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The chair's first owner was Gray's patron, [[Suzanne Talbot]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/stageNews/idUKTRE51J5QU20090225|work=Reuters|title=Record-breaking YSL auction shrugs off crisis|date=25 February 2009|accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YSLseat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?YSLs_seat_sell_for_%A319million&amp;in_article_id=557756|title=YSL's seat sells for £19million|work=Metro.co.uk|date=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by Parisian art dealer Cheska Vallois in 1971 for $2,700 and then sold by Vallois to the French fashion designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=TelegApr16/&gt; The chair was put up for sale as part of the Yves Saint Laurent and [[Pierre Bergé]] collection in February 2009 at [[Christie's]] auction house in Paris. It sold for [[Euro|€]]21,905,000 against a pre-sale estimate of €2-3 million, establishing a new record for a piece of 20th century decorative art. The price beat the previous record by $22 million.&lt;ref name='Christies'/&gt; The 2009 buyer of the chair was once again Cheska Vallois who later said that the cost of acquiring it was "the price of desire".&lt;ref name=SMHSep15/&gt; The chair was bought by Vallois for an unknown third party erroneously reported to be [[Henry Kravis|Henry]] and [[Marie-Josée Kravis]] in March 2009.&lt;ref name=EconMar09&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/13272159|title=Correction: Yves Saint Laurent|date=12 March 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[China]] set an all-time biggest global one-month record in February with RMB 10.14 billion ($1.6 billion), calculating revenues from both local and foreign films.

The previous global monthly box office record was set in July 2011 in North America with $1.395 billion and the previous highest-grossing month in China was August 2017 with RMB 7.38 billion ($1.17 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://deadline.com/2018/03/china-box-office-global-monthly-record-february-2018-1202312183/amp/|title= China Sets One-Month Box Office Record With $1.6B February|author=Nancy Tartaglione|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 6, 2018|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest-grossing films in China during the month were the local [[Chinese films]] ''[[Operation Red Sea]]'', ''[[Monster Hunt 2]]'', and ''[[Detective Chinatown 2]]'', and the foreign [[Indian film]] ''[[Secret Superstar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How Aamir Khan's Secret Superstar contributed to China's global, record-breaking box-office collections|url=http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/how-aamir-khans-secret-superstar-contributed-to-chinas-global-record-breaking-box-office-collections-4379827.html|accessdate=March 7, 2018|work=[[Firstpost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Human billboards Stockholm 2008-07-16 cropped.jpg|thumb|Advertising refers to any paid form of communication designed to create interest in or stimulate sales of products or services. Companies are constantly searching for novel media, such as these human billboards, to get their message out to potential consumers]]

'''Advertising management''' is a planned managerial process designed to oversee and control the various advertising activities involved in a program to communicate with a firm's target market and which is ultimately designed to influence the consumer's purchase decisions. Advertising is just one element in a company's [[promotional mix]] and as such, must be integrated with the overall marketing communications program. Advertising is, however, the most expensive of all the promotional elements and therefore must be managed with care and accountability.

[[Marketing|Marketers]] use different types of advertising. Brand advertising is defined as a non-personal communication message placed in a paid, mass medium designed to persuade target consumers of a product or service benefits in an effort to induce them to make a purchase. Corporate advertising refers to paid messages designed to that communicate the corporation's values in an effort to influence public opinion. Yet other types of  advertising such as not-for-profit advertising and political advertising present special challenges that require different strategies and approaches.
   
Advertising management is a complex process that involves making many layered decisions including the developing advertising strategies, setting an advertising budget, setting advertising objectives, determining the [[target market]], [[media strategy]] (which involves [[media planning]]), developing the message strategy and evaluating the overall effectiveness of the advertising effort.) Advertising management may also involve [[media buying]].

Advertising management is a complex process. However, at its simplest level, advertising management can be reduced to four key decision areas:

::'''Target audience definition''': Who do we want to talk to?

::'''Message (or creative) strategy''': What do we want to say to them?

::'''Media strategy''': How will we reach them?

::'''Measuring advertising effectiveness''': How do we know our messages were received in the form intended and with the desired outcomes?

== Advertising and advertising management: definitions==

Consumers tend to think that all forms of commercial promotion constitute advertising. However, in marketing and advertising, the term "advertising" has a very special meaning that reflects its status as a distinct type of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Richards,J.I. and Curran, C.M., "Oracles on 'Advertising': Searching for a Definition," ''Journal of Advertising'', vol. 31. no. 2, 2002, pp 63-77, Online:http://120.114.52.240/~T093000279/repository/fetch/advertisig%20English%20-%20class%20material%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2009 newsstand Boston Massachusetts USA 3776403818.jpg|thumb|A key characteristic of advertising is that it utilises mass media channels such as newspapers, magazines, radio or TV to reach potential customers]]

The marketing and advertising literature has many different definitions of advertising, but it is possible to identify common elements or themes within most of these definitions. The [[American Marketing Association]] (AMA) defines advertising as "the placement of announcements and persuasive messages in time or space purchased in any of the mass media by business firms, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, and individuals who seek to inform and/ or persuade members of a particular target market or audience about their products, services, organizations, or ideas".&lt;ref&gt;American Marketing Association (AMA), Online: https://www.ama.org/resources/Pages/Dictionary.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ''American Heritage Dictionary'' defines advertising as "the activity of attracting public attention to a product or business, as by paid announcements in the print, broadcast, or electronic media".&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary, 5th ed., 2015, Online: https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=advertising&lt;/ref&gt; Selected marketing scholars have defined advertising in the following terms: "any non-personal communication that is paid for by an identified sponsor, and involves either mass communication viz newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and other media (e.g., billboards, bus stop signage) or direct to-consumer communication via direct mail".&lt;ref&gt;Czinkota, M.R. et al. (2000), ''Marketing: Best Practices'', Orlando, FL: The Dryden Press&lt;/ref&gt; and "the element of the marketing communications mix that is non-personal, paid for by an identified sponsor, and disseminated through mass channels of communication to promote the adoption of goods, services, persons, or ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Bearden, W. O., Ingram, T.N. and LaForge, R.W., ''Marketing: Principles &amp; Perspectives'', 2d ed. New York: Irwin McGraw-Hill, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; One of the shortest definitions is that advertising is "a paid, mass-mediated attempt to persuade".&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T. C., Allen, C.T. and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising'', 2d ed., Cincinnati, Ohio, South-Western College Publishing, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Several common themes emerge in the various definitions of advertising:&lt;ref&gt;Tyagi,C.L. and Kumar, A.M, ''Advertising Management'', New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
:: * Firstly, advertising is a  ''paid '' form of communication and is therefore commercial in nature. 
:: * Secondly, advertising employs  ''non-personal channels '' (i.e. commercial mass media) which implies that it is directed at a mass audience rather than at an individual consumer and is a one-way communication mode where the sponsor sends messages, but recipients cannot respond or ask questions about the message content. 
:: * Thirdly, advertising has an  ''identified sponsor ''. 
In summary, given that advertising is paid, it is one of the many controllable elements in the marketing program. Advertising  is qualitatively different from publicity where the message sponsor is either not identified or ambiguously defined, and different to personal selling which occurs in real-time and involves some face-to-face contact between message sponsor and recipient allowing for two-way dialogue.
 
While [[advertising]] refers to the advertising message, per se, advertising management refers to the process of planning and executing an advertising campaign or campaigns; that is, it is a series of planned decisions that begins with [[market research]] continues through to setting advertising budgets, developing advertising objectives, executing the creative messages and follows up with efforts to measure the extent to which objectives were achieved and evaluate the cost-benefit of the overall advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Definitions, http://marketinginformationcentre.ca/marketing_definitions_%28a-b%29.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising and organisational responsibilities==

[[File:CalvinKleinFairviewMall.JPG|thumb|Calvin Klein is one of a growing number of companies that uses an in-house agency for its advertising and promotion]]

In commercial organisations, advertising, along with other marketing communications activities, is the ultimate responsibility of the marketing department. Some companies outsource part or all of the work to specialists such as advertising agencies, creative design teams, web designers, media buyers, events management specialists or other relevant service providers. Another option is for a company to carry out most or all of the advertising functions within the marketing department in what is known as an ''in-house agency''.  By definition, an in-house agency is a "an advertising organization that is owned and operated by the corporation it serves".&lt;ref&gt;Silk, A.J. and Stiglin, M.M., "Build It, Buy It Or Both? Rethinking the Sourcing of Advertising Services," Working Paper no. 15-093, Harvard Business School&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to provide advertising services in support of its parent company’s business and marketing objectives. Well-known brands that currently use in-house agencies include Google,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, W., "In-House Agencies Have An In," ''Forbes'', 30 March 2013, Online: https://www.forbes.com/sites/willburns/2013/03/30/in-house-agencies-have-an-in/#7379e02267eb&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin Klein,&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, S., "The Media Business: Advertising-Leaving Calvin Klein For a Job at Limited," ''New York Times'',29 July 1998, Online: https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-leaving-calvin-klein-for-a-job-at-limited.html&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe, Dell, IBM, Kraft, Marriott and Wendy's.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, B., "In-House Agencies Grow in Importance',  30 August, Association of National Advertisers, 2013 Online: https://www.ana.net/blogs/show/id/26944&lt;/ref&gt;

Both in-house agencies and outsourcing models have their own advantages and disadvantages. Outsourcing to an external agency allows marketers to obtain highly specialised strategic, research and planning skills, access to top creative talent and provides an independent perspective on marketing or advertising problems.&lt;ref&gt;Parekh, R., "Thinking of Pulling a CareerBuilder? Pros and Cons of Bringing an Account In-house", ''AdAge'', 18 May 2009.http://adage.com/article/agency-news/pros-cons-house-careerbuilder/136701/&lt;/ref&gt; In-house agencies deliver cost advantages, time efficiencies and afford marketers greater control over the advertising effort.&lt;ref&gt;Gianatasioh, D., "What house agency boom means to SMOs and Outside Shops," ''AdWeek,'' 3 December 2015, Online:  http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-house-agency-boom-means-cmos-and-outside-shops-168593&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, personnel who work within an in-house agency gain considerable creative experience which stays within the company. Recent trends suggest that the number of in-house agencies is rising.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson-Taylor, A., "The Rise Of The In-House Agency", ''CMO'', 17 April 2015, Online: http://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/4/17/the-rise-of-the-inhouse-agency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The BOSS Group, Cella Consulting, In-House Creative Services Industry Report,LLC and InSource, April 2015, Online: http://www.creativeindustryreport.com/2015-IHCSIR-Report-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a company chooses to outsource advertising functions to an external agency or carry them out within the marketing department, marketers need a rich understanding of advertising principles in order to prepare effective advertising plans,  brief relevant agencies about their needs and expectations or develop their own creative solutions to marketing problems.

==Advertising's role in the promotional mix==
[[File:Customer journey with touchpoints English.png|thumb|Customers rely on different types of marketing communications at different stages of their purchase decision]]
The [[promotional mix]] refers to the specific combination of promotional methods used for a brand, product or family of products.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/promotion-mix.html&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is best treated as a ''multiplier'' that can leverage other elements of the promotional mix and marketing program.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''How Advertising Works: The Role of Research, Thousand Oaks, CA,1998, pp 25-30&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, advertising must be considered as part of a broader marketing and promotional program.

The promotional mix includes a variety of tools such as:

[[File:Sales promotion 3x1 Tigros.JPG|thumb|Sales promotion includes a variety of activities such as special price offers designed to stimulate sales]]

[[File:VogueThomso02.jpg|thumb|The Vogue Fashion Show is a special event designed to promote top designers' seasonal collections]]

Advertising is just one of many elements that comprise the promotional mix. When marketers communicate with target markets across a broad range of different promotional types and media, the potential for contradictory or mixed messages is very real.  Accordingly, it is important that advertising is treated as part of a total marketing communications program and that steps are taken to ensure that it is integrated with all other marketing communications, so that all communications messages speak with a 'single voice'. The process of ensuring message consistency across the entire marketing communications program is known as ''[[integrated marketing communications]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated Marketing communications perspective,'' 6th ed., New York, McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2004. Note that Belch and Belch's definition is based on that provided by the Association of National Advertisers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 HKTDC Food Expo.jpg|thumb|Mounting a display at a trade-fair or exhibition, such as the Hong Kong Food Show, is part of a company's total promotional mix]]

Marketers need to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the elements in the promotional mix in order to select the right blend for a given situation. For instance, public relations allows for high credibility message delivery with relatively low costs, while advertising permits message repetition. Advertising is especially useful for creating awareness, but personal channels come into play for the actual purchase. The "right" promotional mix should consider both message impact and message consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Thorson,E. and Moore, J., ''Integrated Communication: Synergy of Persuasive Voices,'' New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, decision-makers need to recognise that consumers rely on different information sources at different stages of the purchase decision process. Therefore, advertising and other elements of the promotional campaign must be integrated to ensure that consumers receive the right messages via the right channels at the right time, depending on the consumer's readiness to buy.

In terms of integrated communications, the literature identifies different types of integration: (1) ''Image integration'' refers to messages that have a consistent look and feel, regardless of the medium; (2) ''Functional integration'' refers to capacity of different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message; (3) ''Coordinated integration'' refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants) coordinate to provide a consistent message; (4) ''Stakeholder integration'' refers to the way that all stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers and others cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company's key messages and values and (5) ''Relationship integration'' refers to the way that communications professionals contribute to the company's overall corporate goals and quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Mudzanani, T., "A review and analysis of the role of integrated marketing communication message typology in the development of communication strategies," African Journal of Marketing Management, Vol. 7, no 8, 2015, pp. 90-97&lt;/ref&gt;

On the surface, integrated marketing communications appear to be simple common sense. Yet, a survey of brand advertisers carried out by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) revealed that while 67 per cent of marketers engage in integrated marketing communications, just one third are satisfied with their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Association of National Advertisers (US), "ANA Survey Reveals Most Integrated Marketing Communications Programs Need Improvement,"  14 June 2006 Online: http://www.ana.net/content/show/id/402&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, integrating communications messages across a broad range of promotional formats and media channels is very difficult to achieve.

== Theories of advertising effects==

[[File:Piccadilly Circus, London - at night - Lyca Mobile and Hyundai (6438384381).jpg|thumb|Advertising messages are all around us, yet the mechanism which leads from exposure to brand advertising through to sales is not entirely clear]]

Studies have repeatedly demonstrated a clear association between advertising and sales response.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising'', Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the exact process that leads from the consumer of being exposed to an advertising message through to a purchase or behavioral response is not entirely clear. Noting the difficulties in explaining how advertising works, one theorist wrote, "Only the brave or ignorant...can say exactly what advertising does in the market place."&lt;ref&gt;Corkindale, D., "Setting objectives for advertising ", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 10, No. 3, 1976 pp.109–126&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising and marketing literature suggests a variety of different models to explain how advertising works. These models are not competing theories, but rather explanations of how advertising persuades or influences different types of consumers in different purchase contexts. In a seminal paper, Vankratsas and Ambler surveyed more than 250 papers to develop a typology of advertising models. They identified four broad classes of model: ''cognitive information models'', ''pure affect models'', ''hierarchy of effect models'', ''integrative models'' and ''hierarchy-free models''.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratsas, D. and Ambler, T., "How advertising works: What do we really know?" ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 63 no. 1; 1999, pp 26 -47 Online: http://fabriken.akestamholst.se/akestamholst/files/how_advertising_works&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive information models ===

[[File:Auckland Yellow pages.jpg|thumb|A directory such as ''Yellow Pages'' can eliminate the need for extensive store visits and the need to recall brand names]]
Advertising researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding both the degree and type of cognitive elaboration that occurs when consumers are exposed to persuasive messages.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), pp 7-20, Stable URL: 
https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive information models assume that consumers are rational decision-makers and that advertising provides consumers with information [[utility]] by reducing the need to search for other information about a brand.  For example, an advertisement in the ''Yellow Pages'' or an online directory means that the consumer does not have to travel from store to store in search of a product or service. Consumers process this information at a cognitive level before forming an attitude to the brand and purchase intent. A cognition is any thought that surfaces during the elaboration of the information. Cognitive information models are also known as the ''central route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T. and Petty, R.E., "The Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion", in ''Advances in Consumer Research'', Volume 11, eds. Thomas C. Kinnear (ed), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, pp 673-675, http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6329/volumes/v11/NA-11&lt;/ref&gt;

A common theme in cognitive information models is that the net favourability of cognitive responses has a direct influence on attitude strength.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, K.S. and Punj, G.N., "Understanding the Role of Idiosyncratic Thinking in Brand Attitude Formation: The Dual Interference Model," ''Journal of Advertising,''Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 2007), p. 7, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20460766&lt;/ref&gt; In the cognitive information models, the general path to persuasion is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, S.B. and Lutz, R.J., "An Empirical Examination of the Structural Antecedents of Attitude toward the Ad in an Advertising Pretesting Context," ''Journal of Marketing'' Vol. 53, No. 2, 1989, pp. 48-65&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Ad cognition→ [[Attitude-toward-the-ad models|Attitude to ad]] (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) → Brand cognition → Attitude to brand(A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) →Purchase Intention (PI)

Theoretical works, combined with empirical studies, suggest that advertising information is more useful for experience goods (experiential services) than for search goods (tangible products).&lt;ref&gt;Bharadwaj, S.G., Varadarajan, P.R. and Fahy,J., "Sustainable competitive advantage in service industries: a conceptual model and research propositions," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 57, no. 3, 1993, pp 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; Research studies also suggest that consumers who are involved in the purchase decision are more likely to actively seek out product information and actively process advertising messages while low-involvement consumers are more likely to respond at an emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R. E, Cacioppo, J. T., and Schumann, D., "Central and Peripheral Routes to Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Role of Involvement," ''Journal of Consumer Research'', vol 10, 1983, 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pure affect models ===

Pure affect models suggest that consumers shape their preferences to a brand based on the feelings and attitudes elicited by exposure to an advertising message. When consumers view an advertisement, they not only develop attitudes towards the advertisement and the advertiser, but also develop feelings and beliefs about the brand being advertised.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C.E., ''The Handbook of Communication and Corporate Reputation'', Chichester, Sussex, Wiley, 2013, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure affect models help to explain the consumer's emotional responses to advertising and brands. These models suggest that simple exposure is to a brand is sufficient to generate purchase intention. Exposure in the form of advertising messages leads to an attitude to the advertisement (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) which transfers to the attitude to the brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;)without any further cognitive processing. Exposure it not restricted to physical contact; rather it can refer to any brand-related contact such as advertising, promotion or virtual brands on websites.&lt;ref&gt;Walser, M., ''Brand Strength: Building and Testing Models Based on Experiential Information,'' Springer, 2004, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

In pure affect models, the path to communication effectiveness is represented by the following:

::::Attitude to Ad (A&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;) →   Attitude to Brand (A&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) → Purchase Intention (PI).&lt;ref&gt;Morris, J.F., Woo, C.M., Geason, J.A. and Kim, J.Y., "The Power of Affect: Predicting Intention," ''Journal of Advertising'', May–June, 2002, pp 7-17&lt;/ref&gt;

This path is also known as the ''peripheral route to persuasion''.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., Petty, R.E., Chuan-Feng, K. and Rodriguez, R. "Central and peripheral routes to persuasion: An individual difference perspective," ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', Vol 51, No. 5, 1986, pp 1032-1043. https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.1032&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research in the pure affect sphere suggests that advertising messages do not need to be informative to be effective, however consumers must like the advertising execution for the message to be effective. In addition, ad liking and advertiser credibility, may be especially important for corporate image advertising (compared to product-related advertising).&lt;ref&gt;I. López, S. Ruiz, "Explaining website effectiveness: The hedonic–utilitarian dual-mediation hypothesis," ''Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,'' vol. 10, 2011, pp 49–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchy of effects models===

{{see also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|AIDA (marketing)|l2=AIDA}}
[[File:Generalised hierarcy of effects sequence.jpg|thumb|Generalised hierarchy of effects sequence (after Lavidge)]]
Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages culminating in the purchase decision. The common theme among these models is that advertising operates as a stimulus and the purchase decision is a response. A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including Lavidge's hierarchy of effects, [[DAGMAR marketing|DAGMAR]] and [[AIDA (marketing)|AIDA]] and other variants. Some authors have argued that, for advertising purposes, the hierarchical models have dominated advertising theory,&lt;ref&gt;O’Shaughnessy, J.,  ''Explaining Buyer Behavior'', Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and that, of these models, the AIDA model is one of the most widely applied.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., "The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad," in ''Branding and Advertising'', Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIDA model proposes that advertising messages need to accomplish a number of tasks designed to move the consumer through a series of sequential steps from [[brand awareness]] through to action (purchase and consumption).
 
:: '''Awareness''' –  The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising)
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Interest'''  –  The consumer becomes interested by considering the brand's fit with the consumer's lifestyle
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Desire'''     –  The consumer develops a favorable (or unfavorable) disposition towards the brand
:::::::::::↓
:: '''Action''' –  The consumer forms a purchase intention or actually makes a purchase
                                                                                                        
As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects they pass through both a cognitive processing stage and an affective processing stage before any action occurs. Thus the hierarchy of effects models all include Cognition (C)- Affect (A)- Behaviour (B) as the core steps in the underlying behavioral sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J.A. ''Marketing Management,'' Homewood, Ill. 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying behavioral sequence for all hierarchy models is as follows:

: Cognition (Awareness/learning) → Affect (Feeling/ interest/ desire)→ Behavior (Action e.g. purchase/ consumption/ usage/ sharing information)&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. A. in: P. E. Earl and S. Kemp (eds.), ''The Elgar Companion to Consumer Research and Economic Psychology,'' Cheltenham 1999, pp 310-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

The literature offers numerous variations on the basic path to persuasion. The basic AIDA model is one of the longest serving models. Contemporary hierarchical models often modify or expand the basic AIDA model, resulting in additional steps, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition- Affect- Behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, T.E., "The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective," '' Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising'' vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251–295&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these newer models have been adapted to accommodate consumer's digital media habits. 
Selected hierarchical models follow:

[[File:The Purchase Funnel.jpg|thumb|The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase]]

All hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude, brand preference or brand purchase intention. The process of moving consumers from purchase intention to actual sales is known as ''conversion.'' While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness, brand attitude and purchase intent, it usually requires support from other elements in the promotion mix and the marketing program to convert purchase intent into an actual sale.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., ''Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,''pp 363-364&lt;/ref&gt; Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms, guarantees or a strong call-to-action as part of the advertising message.

In order to penetrate markets, it is essential that high levels of awareness are created as early as possible in a [[Product life-cycle management (marketing)|product or brand life-cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitty, W., Baker, N. and Shimp, T.A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications'', Pacific Rim ed., Thomson, 2005, pp 13-17&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market as quickly as practical. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the promotional effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a [[Purchase funnel|funnel]]. Early in the campaign, the marketers should attempt to reach as many potential buyers as possible with high impact messages. Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotional activities such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments more likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.

===Integrative models===

Integrative models assume that consumers process advertising information via two paths – both cognitive (thinking) and affective (feeling) simultaneously. These models seek to combine the type of purchase with the consumer's dominant mode of processing.&lt;ref&gt;Yoon,K., Laczniak, R.N., Muehling, D.D. and Reece, B.B., "A Revised Model of Advertising Processing: Extending the Dual Mediation Hypothesis," ''Journal of Current Issues &amp; Research in Advertising,'' Vol. 17, no. 2, 1995, pp 53-67&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative models are based on research findings indicating that congruence between personality and the way a persuasive message is framed. That is, aligning the message framing with the recipient's personality profile may play an important role in ensuring the success of that message. In a recent experiment, five advertisements (each designed to target one of the five personality traits) were constructed for a single product. Findings suggest that advertisements were evaluated more positively when they aligned with participants' motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirsh | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Kang | first2 = S. K. | last3 = Bodenhausen | first3 = G. V. | year = 2012 | title = Personalized persuasion: Tailoring persuasive appeals to recipient personality traits | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 578–581 | doi=10.1177/0956797611436349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tailoring persuasive messages to the personality traits of the targeted audience can be an effective way of enhancing the message's impact.

There are many integrative frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Maclnnis, D.J. and Jaworski, B.J. "Information Processing from Advertisements: Toward an integrative framework," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 53, October, 1989 pp 1 -23&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the more widely used models are the grids developed by Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) (see below) and another devised by Rossiter and Percy, and which is an extension of the FCB approach.&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T. and Vakratsas, D., "The Pursuit of Advertising Theory," ''Business Strategy Review'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J.,  "A Better Advertising Planning Grid," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21&lt;/ref&gt; These planning grids are very popular with advertising practitioners because of their ease of application.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, K. E.; Roy, D. P.; and L. B. Hershey (2002), "A Comparison of the Incidence of Advertising Strategies in Business-related Magazines: Service Versus Goods," ''Service Marketing Quarterly,'' Vol. 23, No. 4, 65-80; Wang L. and Praet C., "Message Strategy Typologies: A Review, Integration, and Empirical Validation in China," In: Verlegh P., Voorveld H., Eisend M. (eds), ''Advances in Advertising Research,'' Vol. VI, European Advertising Academy. Springer Gabler, Wiesbaden, 2016,, pp 201-213&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foote, Cone, Belding (FCB) planning grid====

The FCB planning grid was developed by Richard Vaughan, who was the Senior Vice President at advertising agency, Foote, Cone and Belding, in the 1980s. The planning grid has two dimensions, involvement and information processing. Each dimension has two values, representing extremes of a continuum, specifically involvement (high/low) and information processing (thinking/feeling). These form a 2 X 2 matrix with four cells representing the different types of advertising effects.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: a Planning Model," ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 20 no. 5, pp 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCB planning grid gives rise to a number of implications for advertising and media strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn, R., "How Advertising Works: A Planning Model Revisited," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', 26 (January/February), 1986, pp 27-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Coupé Jaguar XKR (X150) ventral.jpg|thumb|An expensive car is a high-involvement/ rational purchase (i.e., FCB Quadarant 1)]]

''Quadrant 1: ''High-involvement/ rational purchases: In the first quadrant consumers learn about a product through advertising after which they develop a favourable (or unfavourable) disposition to the product which may or may not culminate in a purchase. This approach is considered optimal for advertising high ticket items such as cars and household furniture. When this is the dominant approach to purchasing, advertising messages should be information-rich and media strategy should be weighted towards media such as magazines and newspapers capable of delivering long-copy advertising.

''Quadrant 2'': High-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the second quadrant, audiences exhibit an emotional response to advertisements which transfers to products. This approach is used for products such as jewellery, expensive perfumes and designer fashion where consumers are emotionally involved in the purchase. When this mode of purchasing is evident, advertising should be designed to create a strong brand image and media should be selected to support the relevant image. For example, magazines such as ''Vogue'' can help to create an up-market image.

[[File:Butterfly on cupcake at the 2009 Yelp Cupcake Crawl.jpg|thumb|Impulse purchases are low-involvement/ emotional purchase items that make consumers feel good (i.e., FCB Quadrant 4)]]

''Quadrant 3'': Low-involvement/ rational purchases: The third quadrant represents routine low-involvement purchases evident for many packaged goods such as detergents, tissues and other consumable household items. Consumers make habitual purchases, and after consumption the benefit of using the brand is reinforced which ideally results in long-term brand loyalty (re-purchase). Given that this is a rational purchase, consumers need to be informed or reminded of the product's benefits. Advertising messages should encourage repeat purchasing and brand loyalty while media strategy should be weighted towards media that can deliver high frequency required for reminder campaigns such as TV, radio and sales promotion.

''Quadrant 4'': Low-involvement/ emotional purchases: In the final quadrant, consumers make low-involvement, relatively inexpensive purchases that make them feel good. Impulse purchases and convenience goods fall into this category. The purchase leads to feelings of satisfaction which, in turn, reinforces the purchase behavior. When this approach is the dominant purchase mode, advertising messages should "congratulate" customers on their purchase choice and the media strategy should be weighted towards options that reach customers when they are close to the point-of-purchase such as billboards, sales promotion and point-of-sale displays. Examples of this approach include "McDonald's – You Deserve a Break Today" and "L'Oreal- Because You're Worth It".

===Hierarchy-free models===

Many authors have treated reason (rational processes) and emotion (affective processes) as entirely independent.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, A., ''Emotion and Reason in Consumer Behavior,'' Oxon, Routledge, 2011, pp 26-38&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, other researchers have argued that both reason and emotion can be employed simultaneously, to process advertising information. Hierarchy-free models draw on evidence from psychology and [[consumer neuroscience]] which suggest that consumers process information via different pathways rather than in any linear/ sequential manner. Thus, hierarchy-free models do not employ any fixed processing sequence. These models treat advertising as part of the brand totality.  Some hierarchy-free models treat brands as 'myth' and advertising as 'myth-making' while other models seek to tap into the consumer's memories of pleasant consumption experiences (e.g. the MAC- Memory-Affect-Cognition model).&lt;ref&gt;Ambler, T., ''Intermediate Advertising Effects: The MAC Model'', Working Paper No 96-906, Centre for Marketing, London Business School, May 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Hierarchy-free models are of increasing interest to academics and practitioners because they are more customer-centric and allow for the possibility of consumer co-creation of value.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "What Can A Service Logic Offer Marketing Theory?" in Lusch, R.F. and Vargo, S.L., ''The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialogue, Debate and Directions'', New York, M E Sharpe, 2006, pp 354-364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising planning ==

Advertising planning does not occur in a vacuum. Advertising objectives are derived from marketing objectives.  Therefore, the first step in any advertising planning is to review to the objectives as set out in the marketing plan. This is designed to ensure that all promotional efforts, including advertising, are working towards achieving both short-term and long-term corporate  and marketing goals and align with the company's values and vision.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, L., Elliott, R.H. and Rosenbaum-Elliott, R., ''Strategic Advertising Management'', 5th ed., Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Review the marketing plan ===

A review of the marketing plan can be a relatively simple process or it can involve a formal review, known as an ''audit''. The review or audit might consider such issues as prior marketing communications activity, an evaluation of what has been effective in the past, whether new market research studies are warranted, an outline of competitive advertising activity and a review of budgetary considerations.

The marketing plan can be expected to provide information about the company's long and short-term goals, competitive rivalry, a description of the target market, product(s) offered, positioning strategy, pricing strategy, distribution strategy and other promotional programs.  All of this information has potential implications for developing the advertising program. The advertiser must study the marketing plan carefully and determine how to translate the marketing objectives into an advertising program. Each [[advertising campaign]] is unique, so that the review requires a great deal of analysis as well as judgement.

====Overall communications objectives ====

Communications objectives are derived from marketing objectives. However, communications objectives must be framed in terms of communications effects. For example, a company's short-term marketing objective might be to increase sales response for a given brand. However, this objective would require that a large number of consumers are aware of the brand and are favourably disposed towards it. Furthermore, consumers' purchase intentions may be dependent on other marketing activities such as access, price, the ability to  trial the brand prior to final purchase and other marketing activities. It is unfair to hold marketing communications accountable for all sales when it is only one element in the total marketing effort.&lt;ref&gt;O'Guinn, T., Allen,C., and Semenik, R.J., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion,'' Mason, Ohio, South-Western Cengage, 2009, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and interest in a brand, it is less effective at turning that awareness and interest into actual sales. To convert interest into sales, different promotional tools such as personal selling or sales promotion may be more useful. Many authors caution against using sales or market share objectives for marketing communications or advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Shanklin, John K. Ryans ''Essentials of Marketing High Technology,'' Lexington Books, 1987 p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications objectives might include such things as to:
* increase purchase
* encourage trial
* encourage loyalty 
* position or re-position a brand 
* educate customers

These will need to be translated into advertising objectives.

==== Target market and target audience ====

[[File:Target Audience and Target market.jpg|thumb|Relationship between target market and target audience]]

The review should take note of the overall target market. However, this does not necessarily mean that the advertising campaign will be directed at the total target market. Marketers and advertisers make a distinction between the ''target audience'' for an advertising message and the ''target market'' for a product or brand.&lt;ref&gt;Copulsky, J.R. and  Wolf,M.J. "Relationship Marketing: Positioning for the Future", ''Journal of Business Strategy'', Vol. 11 no. 4, 1990, pp 16 – 20&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, the target audience is  the intended audience for a given advertisement or message in a publication or broadcast medium, while the target market consists of all existing and potential consumers of a product, service or brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing: An Introduction|last=Kotler|first=Philip|last2=Armstrong|first2=Gary|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Jersey|pages=-}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies often develop different advertising messages and media strategies to reach different target audiences. For example, McDonald's Restaurants uses the anthropomorphic brand characters, Ronald McDonald and Hamburgler, in its advertising directed at children who are important brand-choice influencers. However, for adult target audience members, McDonald's uses messages that emphasise convenience and quality. Thus the target audience for a given advertising message may comprise only a subset of the total market as defined in the marketing plan. Careful perusal of the marketing plan will assist marketers in the process of defining the optimal target audiences for specific advertising objectives.

====Push vs pull strategy ====

The communications objectives will, at least in part, depend on whether the marketer is using a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer advertises intensively with retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer advertises directly to consumers hoping that they will put pressure on retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer-oriented advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Varey,E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devising advertising objectives ===
{{See also|DAGMAR marketing|l1=DAGMAR|SMART criteria}}

Setting advertising objectives provides the framework for the entire advertising plan.  Therefore, it is important to specify precisely what is to be achieved and outline how advertising will be evaluated. Advertising objectives should be '''S'''pecific, '''M'''easurable, '''A'''chievable and '''T'''ime-dependent (SMART).&lt;ref&gt;Koekemoer,L. and Bird, S.,''Marketing Communications,'' Lansdowne, South Africa, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Any statement of advertising objectives must include measurement benchmarks – that is the norms against which advertising effectiveness will be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Mohan, M., ''Advertising Management: Concepts and Cases'', New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first approaches to setting communications-oriented objectives was the DAGMAR approach ('''D'''efining '''A'''dvertising '''G'''oals for '''M'''easured '''A'''dvertising '''R'''esults) developed in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, R.H., ''Defining Advertising Goals,'' New York, American Association of National Advertisers (AANA), 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J., ''Marketing Communications,'' London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; While memorable, the DAGMAR approach fails to provide concrete guidance on how to link advertising objectives with communications effects.&lt;ref&gt;Batra, R., Myers, J.G and Aaker, D.A., ''Advertising Management,'' 5th ed., India, Kindersley, pp 144-146&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to set realistic and achievable advertising objectives, most advertisers try to link advertising or communications objectives with the communications effects. Rossiter and Bellman have argued that, for advertising purposes, five communications effects should be considered, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., ''Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications'', Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 103-120&lt;/ref&gt;
: '''1. Category Need:''' The consumer's acceptance that the category (the product or service) is necessary to satisfy some need
: '''2. Brand awareness (brand recognition and brand recall):'''  The consumer's ability to recognise a brand or to recall a brand name from memory
: '''3. Brand preference (or brand attitude):'''  The extent to which a consumer will choose one brand over other competing brands in the category
: '''4. Brand action intention (purchase intent):'''  The consumer's self instruction to purchase a given brand
: '''5. Purchase facilitation:'''  The extent to which the consumer knows how and where to purchase the brand

|}

For many purchases, category need and purchase facilitation will be present in the customer's mind and can be omitted from the advertising objectives. However, for some purchases, the customer may not be aware of the product category or may not know how to access it, in which case these objectives will need to be addressed in the communications objectives. Brand awareness, brand preference and purchase intention are almost always included as advertising objectives.

===Setting advertising budgets ===

A firm's advertising budget is a sub-set of its overall budget. For many firms, the cost of advertising is one of the largest expenses, second only to wages and salaries.  Advertising expenditure varies enormously according to firm size, market coverage, managerial expectations and even managerial style. Procter and Gamble, the top US advertiser, spent US$4.3 billion in 2015 on national media&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B., "How Nation's Top 200 Marketers Are Honing Digital Strategies," Adage, 27 June 2016, &lt;Online:http://adage.com/article/advertising/top-200-u-s-advertisers-spend-smarter/304625&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (exclusive of agency fees and production costs) while a small local advertiser might spend just a few thousand dollars in the same period.

The size of the budget has implications for the promotional mix, the media mix and market coverage. As a generalisation, very large budgets are required to sustain national television campaigns. Advertisers with tight budgets may forced to use less effective media alternatives. However, even advertisers with small budgets may be able to incorporate expensive main media, by focusing on narrow geographic markets, buying spots in non-peak time periods and carefully managing advertising schedules.&lt;ref&gt;George, L. J., ''The Blessings of Paid Advertising: DISCOVER The Industry Expert Tips For Maximizing ROI On A Tight Advertising Budget,'' Lasgeorges Books, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of different methods are used to develop the advertising (and/or marketing communications) budget. The most commonly used methods are: percentage-of-sales, objective and task, competitive parity method, market share method, unit sales method, all available funds method and the affordable method.&lt;ref&gt;Shim, J.K. and Siegel, J.G. ''Marketing: Budgeting for Sales, Advertising, and Distribution,'' Wiley, 2015, DOI: 10.1002/9781118106754.ch1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Percentage-of-sales method====

Using the percentage-of-sales method, the advertiser allocates a fixed percentage (say 5% or 10%) of forecast sales value to  the advertising budget. This method is predicated on the assumption that advertising causes future sales volume.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary Online, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/percentage-of-sales-method.html&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of sales method is the easiest method to use and for this reason remains one of the most widely used methods for setting budgets.

A major problem with the %-of-sales method is that there is no consensus about the percentage value to apply. Some companies use industry averages as a guide to set their marcomms budget. The following table, based on industry averages, shows that the % value can vary from around 20% of sales to less than 1 percent.

====Objective and task method====

The objective and task method is the most rational and defensible of all budgeting methods. In this method, the advertiser determines the advertising objectives and then defines specific, measurable communication tasks that will need to be undertaken to achieve the desired objectives. Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Shimp, T., ''Advertising, Promotion, and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications'', 7th ed., Mason, OH, Thomson South-Western, 2007 pp 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; This method is time-consuming and complex, and as a consequence has  been less widely used in practice, however, recent research suggests that more marketers are taking up this approach.&lt;ref&gt;West, D. and Prendergast, G.P., "Advertising and promotions budgeting and the role of risk", ''European Journal of Marketing'', Vol. 43, no. 11/12, 2009, pp.1457 – 1476&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competitive parity method====

The competitive parity method allocates the advertising or promotional budget based on competitive spending for comparable activities. This approach is a defensive strategy used to protect a brand market position.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Dictionary'', Online: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/competitive-parity.html&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that rival firms have similar objectives and is widely used in highly competitive markets.  The main criticism of this method is that it assumes competitors know what they are doing in relation to advertising expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;Parente, D. and Strausbaugh-Hutchinson, K., ''Advertising Campaign Strategy: A Guide to Marketing Communication Plans,'' 5th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2015
p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several approaches to using the competitive parity method:&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Tyagi, Arun Kumar ''Advertising Management'' New Delhi, Atlantic Publishers, 2004, pp 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;

: a) Allocate the same budget on advertising as a key rival;
: b) Allocate the budget based on the industry average expenditure levels;
: c) Allocate a similar percentage-of-sales as a key competitor;
: d) Allocate the same percentage-of-sales on advertising as the industry average;
: e) Use competitive activity as a benchmark to which sums are added or subtracted based on managerial judgement.

Competitive parity requires a detailed understanding of competitor's expenditure in key areas. Market intelligence used to inform this approach can be obtained by consulting company annual reports and also from commercial research service providers such as Nielsen's AdEx.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Advertising Expenditure, Online: http://www.nielsen.com/my/en/solutions/measurement/advertising-expenditure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods used to set advertising and promotional budgets include the ''market share method'', ''unit sales method'', ''all available funds method'', ''affordable method'', ''marginal analysis'' and others. Contemporary budgeting rarely relies on a single method, but instead uses a combination of methods to guide the marketer in determining the optimal expenditure levels.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, P.W. and West, D.C., "A Fresh View of the Advertising Budget Process," Chapter 20 in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J. Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), Sage, 2007, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781848607897.n20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Devising the creative strategy===

The creative strategy is also known as the ''message strategy.'' The creative strategy explains how the advertising campaign will address the advertising objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/creative-strategy.html&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the creative strategy typically begins by identifying the big idea (also known as the ''creative concept'' that will establish the intended product position in the minds of the customer. Another way of thinking about the creative concept is that it refers to the one thing that will make consumers respond. The creative concept should show how the product benefit meets the customer's needs or expectations in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;du Plessis, D.F., ''Introduction to Public Relations and Advertising,'' p.134&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey et al. developed a typology of nine creative strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, K.S., "From Producers to Consumers: Engagement through User-generated Advertising Contests", ''Handbook of Research on Digital Media and Advertising: User Generated Consumption,'' Easton, M. S., Daugherty, T. and Burns, N.M., (eds), IGI Global, Information Science Reference, pp 631- 649&lt;/ref&gt; Initially  devised for television, this typology has been widely adopted for other media including print media&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A., "Creative Strategy and Magazine Advertising Readership: A Pilot Study, " in ''Developments in Marketing Science,'' 2014, pp 236-237 Date: 08 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and social media.&lt;ref&gt;Coursaris, C, van Osch, and Brooks, B., "Social Media Marketing on Twitter: An Investigation of the Involvement-Messaging Engagement Link," in ''HCI in Business: First International Conference'', Fui-Hoon Nah, F. (ed), Springer, 2014, pp 155-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskey, Day and Crask's typology first identifies two broad classes of creative strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Laskey, H. A., Day, E. and Crask, M.R., "Typology of Main Message Strategies," ''Journal of Advertising,'' vol. 18, no. 1, 1989, pp 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

: * Informational: rational appeals that typically provide information about the brand's benefits
: * Transformational: emotional appeals that assist consumers to imagine an aspirational lifestyle

Informational appeals typically involve factual claims that list the product's benefits in a straightforward manner and are more likely to be used with high involvement goods. Transformational appeals play on emotions and are designed to transform the consumer's perceptions of themselves or of the product. Transformational appeals are more likely to be indicated for low-involvement goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Chernev, A., ''Strategic Brand Management,'' USA, Cerebellum Press, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional appeals are often known as a ''soft-sell'' approach. Because they bypass rational cognitive processing, transformational appeals are less likely to result in counter-arguing in the consumer's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Copley, P. ''Marketing Communications Management: Analysis, Planning, Implementation,'' Sage, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| Generic|| Focus on product class with emotional appeal|| Use for new categories, new products or repositioning
|}

In addition to determining the overall creative strategy, the advertiser also needs to consider the creative execution – which refers to the way that the message is presented.  Examples of creative execution include: problem-solution formats, fear appeals, sex appeals, humour, parody, slogans or jingles, mnemonics, slice-of-life, guarantee, celebrity endorsement, testimonial, news style, scientific appeals, dramatisation and product demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson, R, and Pickton, D,. ''Marketing: An Introduction'' Thousand Oaks, California, McGraw-Hill, 2010 pp 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media planning===
{{see also|Mass media|New media}}

[[File:Imaginative advertising on Brockenhurst Station - geograph.org.uk - 170785.jpg|thumb|Integrating the creative and the media can result in imaginative and powerful messages that grab attention and are noticed]]

Strategic media planning consists of four key decision areas:&lt;ref&gt;Dutka, S., ''Defining Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising Results,'' 2nd ed, NTC Business Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

: 1) Setting media objectives (with reference to both marketing and advertising objectives);

: 2) Developing a media channel strategy for implementing media objectives – the broad vision of when and how to reach target audiences;

: 3) Designing media tactics – specific instructions about media vehicles, placement, preferred position;

: 4) Devising procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the media plan.

The traditional approach to media strategy was primarily concerned with setting objectives for message reach, weight and frequency. The contemporary approach, however, often treats the media strategy as an extension of the creative strategy.&lt;ref&gt;O’Guinn, T.C., ''Advertising and Integrated Brand Management,'' 4th ed., 2006, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, L'Oreal Men's Expert promoted its skincare range on dry-cleaner hangers. When customers picked up their shirt, they found a $2 coupon and a message, "Your shirt doesn't come with wrinkles, why should your face?" This novel execution shows how media and creative can be integrated to generate powerful advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Drewniany, B.L. and Jewler, A.J., ''Creative Strategy in Advertising'' 10th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, 2011, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Setting media objectives ====

{{see also|Reach (advertising)|Media planning|Effective frequency}}

In terms of setting media objectives, the planner needs to address several key decisions:

* Who do we want to talk to? [Target market/ audience definition]
* How often does an audience member need to hear our message before it is noticed or achieves the desired consumer response? [Effective frequency]
* When do audiences cease to notice the ad, or become tired of seeing the ad? [Advertising wear-out]

A number of key definitions are essential for media planning purposes:&lt;ref&gt;Robert William Hall, ''Media Math,'' NTC Business Books, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Reach'' is defined as the number of households (or people) exposed to an advertising message in a given time period. 
: ''Frequency'' is defined as the average number of times a household (or person) is exposed to an advertising message in a given time period.
: ''Effective frequency'' refers to the minimum number of media exposures in order to achieve a specified communication goal
: ''Effective reach'' refers to the reach (% of households or people) at the effective frequency level.
: ''Gross Ratings Points (GRPs)''  is defined as reach multiplied by frequency and is a measure of overall campaign weight or intensity

With respect to reach objectives, planners must decide what proportion of the target market need to be exposed to the advertising message. It is not always be necessary to reach 100% of the target market. For new brands or brands with very low levels of awareness, it may be desirable to reach every member of the target market. However, for reminder type campaigns lower levels of reach may be all that is required.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, B., "The Expanded ARF Model: Bridge to the Advertising Accountability Future," ''Journal of Advertising Research'', March/April, 1997, 11-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Reach objectives are normally framed in terms of a percentage of market. For example, a reach objective might read; ''To reach 50% of women aged 18-25 years.''

With respect to frequency objectives, the planner must determine the optimal level of frequency in order to achieve the desired communications objective.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. P., "What Does Effective Frequency Mean in 1997?" (Part 1 of 2), ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' vol. 37, no. 4, 1997, pp 14-17&lt;/ref&gt; Media planners often work with rules of thumb for setting frequency objectives that are based on an extensive body of evidence drawn from research findings. For example, empirical evidence suggests that the average consumer needs to be exposed to a message at least three times before they become aware of the brand information.&lt;ref&gt;Naples, M.J., ''Effective Frequency: The relationship between Frequency and Advertising Awareness,'' Association of National Advertisers, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes known as the ''3+ Rule''. To this basic benchmark of three exposures, media planners recognise that to achieve higher-level communication goals, such as persuasion and lead generation, higher levels of frequency are required. To achieve simple brand awareness, three exposures may be sufficient, but for consumers to act on that awareness, higher levels of exposure may be required. Some theorists have developed sophisticated decision models to assist with planning optimal frequency levels.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrow, J.W., "Setting Frequency Levels: An Art or a Science?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', Vol. 24, no. 4, 1984, I-9 to I-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Planners also need to consider the combined effects of reach and frequency (GRPs).  In an intensive campaign, the schedule will utilise both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). The overall campaign weight has implications for budgets and for media selection. In an intensive campaign (heavy weight campaign), the media strategy is normally skewed towards main media, which remains the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create stable brand awareness levels.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., ''Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why,'' Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media channel strategy====

{{see also|Advertising media selection|Media buying}}

The first channel decision that needs to be made is whether to use a ''concentrated'' channel strategy or a ''dispersion'' channel strategy:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J.P., ''What's in a Brand?: Building Brand Equity Through Advertising,'' McGraw-Hill, 2008, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

; Concentrated channel strategy
: In a concentrated approach the planner invests most of the media expenditure in a single medium or a narrow range or media. 
; Dispersion channel strategy
: In a dispersion approach, the planner spends across a broad range of [[advertising media]].  The main advantage of a concentrated channel strategy is that the advertiser has the opportunity to achieve a high share-of- voice and can become the dominant advertiser in the selected channels. A dispersion approach allows the advertiser to reach a broader cross-section of the defined target market.

With reach and frequency objectives firmly in place, the planner turns to determining the media mix and selecting appropriate media vehicles to carry the message.  The media planner must determine the way that the advertising budget is to be allocated across the relevant media options (e.g. 50% TV; 30% Mags; 15% Digital and 5% Out-of-home).  To make these decisions, the planner requires a detailed understanding of the target market and its media usage habits. Accordingly, the design of the media channel strategy requires a rich understanding of the media options and what each type of media can accomplish in terms of audience reach and engagement.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media audience research====

{{See also|Audience measurement|List of magazines by circulation|l2=Magazine circulation|Newspaper circulation|Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen Audio|National Readership Survey}}

Media audience research is a central feature of media planning. The  main purpose  of media research  is  "to  eliminate  waste  in  advertising by objectively  analysing the  media available for  promoting products  and  services".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Identifying and profiling the audience for print media, broadcast media, cinema and online media magazine or newspaper is a specialized form of market research, often conducted on behalf of media owners. In most nations, the advertising industry, via its peak industry associations, endorses a single media research company as the official provider of audience measurement for main media. The methodology used by the official provider then becomes known as the ''industry currency'' in audience measurement. Industry members fund the audience research and share the findings.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, pp 119-120&lt;/ref&gt; In a few countries, where the industry is more fragmented or where there is no clear peak industry association, two or more competing organisations may provide audience measurement services. In such countries, there is said to be no industry currency.

Research companies employ different methodologies depending on where  and  when  media is  used  and  the cost of data collection. All these methods involve [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] – that is taking a representative sample of the population and recording their media usage which is then extrapolated to the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners typically share research findings with prospective advertisers, while selected findings are available to the general public via the media research company or an entity, such as a broadcast commission, established to administer the audience research process.

Media research acts as form of industry regulation and the legitimacy of research methodologies and provision of audience metrics.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Media owners rely on metrics of both audience size and audience quality to set advertising rates.

Measures of media audience that are of especial interest to advertisers include:&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen Media Research, &lt;Online: www.nielsenmedia.co.nz/en/pdf/mri/28/mediaterms.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print Media'''
:* ''Circulation:'' the number of copies of an issue sold (independently assessed via a circulation audit)

:* ''Readership:'' the total number of people who have seen or looked into a current edition of the a publication (independently measured via survey)
 
:* ''Readership profiles:'' Demographic/ psychographic and behavioural analysis of readership (sourced from Readership surveys)

'''Broadcast Media'''
: * ''Average audience:'' The average number of people who tuned into the given time or given program, expressed in thousands or as a percentage. Also known as a ''Rating'' or T.A.R.P  (Total Audience Rating Point).

: * ''Audience share:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) for a given channel over a given time period, expressed as a percentage of the total audience potential for the total market. (The audience share is normally calculated by dividing a given channel’s average audience by the average audience of all channels).

: * '' Audience potential:'' The total number of people in a given geographical area who conform to a specific definition, such as the number of people with a television (or radio) set or the total number of people aged 6–12 years. Population potentials are normally derived from the census figures and are used to estimate the potential market reach.

: * ''Audience movement by session:'' The number of listeners (or viewers) who switch channels during a given time period.

: * ''Audience profile:'' Analysis of audience by selected demographic, psychographic or behavioural variables.

: * ''Cumulative audience (CUME):'' The number of ''different'' listeners (or viewers) in a given time period; also known as ''reach''.

: * ''People Using Television (PUT)'': The number of people (or households) tuned to any channel during a given time period.

'''Out-of-home media'''

: * ''Opportunities to see (OTS)'' – a crude measure of the number of people who were exposed to the medium, For example, the number of cars that drive past an outdoor billboard in a given time period

'''Internet and digital media'''&lt;ref&gt;Bermejo, F., ''The Internet Audience: Constitution &amp; Measurement,'' New York, Peter Lang, 2007, pp 75-101&lt;/ref&gt;

: * ''Site traffic'':  The number of visitors to a website within a given time period (e.g. a month)

: * ''Unique visitors'': The number of ''different'' visitors to a website within a given time period

: * ''Site stickiness'': The average length of time a person remains on a page (a measure of audience engagement)

: * ''Average page views per visit'': The number of different pages generated by a visitor to a site (a measure of engagement)

: * ''Click through rate (CTR)'': The number of people who clicked on an advertisement or advertising link

: * ''Cost per click'' (CPS):  The average cost of generating one click through

: * ''Rate of return visitors'': The number of unique visitors who return to a site

: * ''Bounce rate'': Number of site visitors who leave the site within a predetermined time (seconds)

Although much of the audience research data is only available to subscribers and prospective advertisers, basic information is published for the general public, often as topline survey findings. The type and depth of freely available information varies across geographic markets.  The following table provides principal sources of information for main media audience research in English speaking markets.

==== Media buying====
{{main article|Media buying}}

While it is certainly possible for advertisers to purchase advertising spots by dealing directly with media owners (e.g. newspapers, magazines or broadcast networks), in practice most media buying is purchased as part of broader negotiations. Prices depend on the advertiser's prior relationship with the network, the volume of inventory being purchased, the timing of the booking and whether the advertiser is using cross-media promotions such as product placements. Advertising spots purchased closer to air-time tend to be more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, B., "Sunday Night Football' Remains Costliest TV Show: Prices Overall See Decline," ''AdAge,'' 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advertisers opt to centralise their media buying through large media agencies such as Zenith or Optimedia. These large media agencies are able to exert market power through volume purchasing by buying up space for an entire year. Media agencies benefit advertisers by providing advertising units at lower rates and also through the provision of added value services such as media planning services.&lt;ref&gt;Brierly, S., ''The Advertising Handbook,'' London, Routledge, 1995, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Buying advertising spots on national TV is very expensive. Given that most media outlets use dynamic pricing, rates vary from day to day, creating difficulties locating indicative rates. However, from time to time, trade magazines publish adrates which may be used as a general guide. The following table provides indicative advertising rates for selected popular programs on American national television networks, broadcast during prime time viewing hours.

====Pulling it all together: Media tactics and the media schedule====

[[File:Sample Media Schedule.jpg|thumb|The media schedule includes specific detail such as dates, media, position, placement]]

A media schedule is a program or plan that "identifies the media channels used in an advertising campaign, and specifies insertion or broadcast dates, positions, and duration of the messages".&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media-schedule.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are four basic approaches to scheduling:&lt;ref&gt;Pickton, D. and Broderick, A., ''Integrated Marketing Communications,'' Prentice-Hall,2001. p. 671&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broad Approaches to Scheduling-1.jpg|thumb|Blitzing,continuity, flighting and pulsing are the main schedule patterns]]

: ''Blitzing'': one concentrated burst of intense levels of advertising, normally during the initial period of the planning horizon
: ''Continuity'': a pattern of relatively constant levels throughout a given time period or campaign (i.e. a relatively expensive spending pattern)
: ''Flighting'': an intermittent pattern of bursts of advertising followed by no advertising (i.e. a moderate spending pattern)
: ''Pulsing'':  a combination of both continuity and pulsing; low levels of continuous advertising followed by bursts of more intense levels of advertising; (i.e. alternates between a high spending pattern and a low spending pattern)

Empirical support for the effectiveness of pulsing is relatively weak. However, research suggests that continuous schedules and flighted schedules generally result in strong levels of consumer recall.&lt;ref&gt;Vakratas, D. and Naik, P. "Essentials of Media Planning Schedules", in ''The SAGE Handbook of Advertising,'' Gerard J Tellis and Tim Ambler (eds), London, Sage, 2007, pp 333-348&lt;/ref&gt; With flighted schedules, the second and subsequent flights tend to build on the first flight, resulting in awareness levels similar to a continuous schedule, but often with reduced costs.&lt;ref&gt;Longman, K. A. "If not effective frequency, then what?" ''Journal of Advertising Research'', July-Aug. 1997, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

A major consideration in constructing media schedules is timing. The advertiser's main is to place the advertisement as close as practical to the point where consumers make their purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;Rossiter, J.R and Danaher, P.J., ''Advanced Media Planning'', Volume 1, Kluwer Academic, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an advertiser who knows that a grocery buyer does a main shop on Saturday afternoons and a top-up shop on Wednesday nights, may consider TV to achieve general brand awareness, supplemented with radio spots to reach the shopper while he or she is driving to the supermarket or regular place of purchase on the days when the majority of consumers carry out their shopping.

==Measuring advertising effectiveness==

{{see also|Advertising research}}

Advertising is a major expense for most firms. Improved advertising effectiveness can deliver strategic and tactical advantages as well as helping to manage costs. Advertising managers are expected to be accountable for advertising budgets. Hence, most campaigns invest in a number of measures to evaluate whether advertising budgets are being well-spent and to assess whether the campaign requires improvement and, if necessary, to fine-tune campaigns in order to achieve the desired advertising effects.  The main aim of effectiveness testing is to improve consumer response rates.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, G. R., ''Marketing Calculator: Measuring and Managing Return on Marketing Investment,'' Hoboken, NJ, Wiley, 2008, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, there are two classes of effectiveness testing:&lt;ref&gt;Australian Graduate School of Management, ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness: Copy Testing (pre-testing) Ads and Tracking (post-testing) the Campaign,'' [Working Paper Series], Vol. 92, Issue 20, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, M.A., Haley, E.E., Sheehan, K.B. and Taylor, R.E., ''Using Qualitative Research in Advertising: Strategies, Techniques, and Applications,'' 2nd ed., Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking refers to a combination of both pre-testing and post-testing in order to provide continuous monitoring of advertising effects.

:* ''Pre-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken prior to running an advertisement with a view to gauging audience response and eliminating potential weaknesses

:* ''Post-testing'': qualitative and quantitative measures taken during or after the target audience has been exposed to the message or advertising campaign and used to track the extent to which advertising is achieving the desired communications objectives.

=== Pre-testing ===
Sound pre-testing exhibits the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Pechmann, C. and Andrews, C., "Copy Test Methods to Pretest Advertisements," in ''Wiley International Encyclopedia of Marketing'', Jagdish N. Sheth and Naresh K. Malhotra, (eds), Part 4, Advertising and Integrated Communication, Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

:(i) relevant to the communications objectives;
: (ii) agree on how results are to be used;
: (iii) use multiple measures;
: (iv) be theoretically grounded – i.e. based on a model of human response (e.g. hierarchy of effects); 
: (v) consider multiple exposures;
: (vi) test comparably finished executions;
: (vii) control the exposure context; 
: (viii) define the relevant sample; 
: (ix) demonstrate reliability and validity; 
: (x) take baseline (i.e., pre-exposure) measurements and/or use control groups

Specific types of pre-testing include copy tests, projective techniques and increasingly, a diverse range of physiological and/or biometric testing methods.

====Copy testing====

[[Copy testing]] is testing that evaluates advertising copy and creative executions.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-copy-testing&lt;/ref&gt; In this section, the principal methods of copy testing are briefly discussed.

=====Mock-ups=====
{{see also|Storyboard}}

[[File:Storyboard template example.svg|thumb|right|upright|A template used for storyboards]]

Researchers often use mock-ups of the final creative with varying degrees of finished artwork. Some mock-ups are only intended to be seen by the advertising agency and client during the advertising concept development stage. However, mock-ups are useful for gauging audience response to the proposed advertising copy. Mock-ups can be used in face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests. A sample of respondents is invited to look at the mock-ups and subsequently asked a series of questions designed to capture advertising effects that are of interest for the given campaign. 

Types of advertising mock-ups that are used in copy testing, both print and broadcast advertising, include:&lt;ref&gt;Shah,K. and D'Souza, A.,''Advertising and Promotion: An IMC Perspective,'' New Delhi, McGraw-Hill, 2009, p. 873&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auditorio Fundacion.JPG|thumb|To pre-test advertisements, researchers might use face-to-face interviews, small focus groups or theatre tests for larger audiences]]

: ''Rough art'':  very rough drawings of the creative concept

: ''Comps'': (abbreviation of "composition art") refers to rough art included along with copy, slogans and campaign strategy

: ''Rip-o-matics'': very rough versions of a TV commercial that include stock images and film footage designed to emulate the look and feel of the final creative execution; ripomatics are often called "mood" or "concept" videos.&lt;ref&gt;Siltanenm R., "The Real Story Behind Apple's 'Think Different' Campaign," ''Forbes,'' 14 December 2011, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2011/12/14/the-real-story-behind-apples-think-different-campaign/4/#52c1daf57eac Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Photo-matics'': include photographs along with the intended audio

: ''Storyboards'': a sequence of drawings or photographs accompanied by relevant copy and designed to resemble the final creative execution of a film or digital TV commercial.

: ''Animatics'': a more elaborate version of a storyboard that includes dialogue, sound tracks and voice overs that are intended to represent a more polished version of the final creative execution.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, ''Encyclopedia'', https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-storyboard&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Projective techniques=====
{{see also|Projective test|l1=Projective techniques}}

In projective techniques, the respondent is invited to project themselves into the advertisement. There are many projective techniques including word association, sentence completion and story completion. These techniques assume that when exposed to incomplete stimuli,  respondents use underlying attitudes or motivations to complete the storyline, thereby revealing their fears and aspirations that may not surface under more direct questioning.&lt;ref&gt;Soley, L., "Projective Techniques for Advertising and Consumer Research," ''American Academy of Advertising Newsletter,'' Vol, 6, No. 2, 2010, pp 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;
Projective techniques have been found to be very useful for evaluating concepts and generating new concepts.

====Physiological measures====

For decades, researchers have been using physiological measures to study such responses to advertising. These measures include such things as pupil response, electrode mal response (GSR) and heart rate. These measures have been shown to be effective measures of attention and the strength of emotional response.&lt;ref&gt;Belch, M. A., Holgerson, B.E., Belch, G.E&gt; and Koppman, J., "Psychophysiological and Cognitive Responses to Sex in Advertising", in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Volume 09, Andrew Mitchell (ed.), Ann Abor, MI: Association for Consumer Research, pp 424-427.&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of consumer neuroscience, researchers have begun to use a much wider range of measures to investigate cognitive responses as well as emotional responses.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M.R., Cornell, L.D. and Nizan, A., ''Launch! Advertising and Promotion in Real Time,'' NY, Flat World Knowledge, n.d., p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the techniques used to measure consumer responses to advertising stimuli include:

=====Pupil dilation=====
The amount of pupil dilation (also known as ''pupillometry'') is believed to provide a relatively precise measure of the amount of mental effort associated with a task. Pupil dilation tests became a staple of advertising copy testing during the 1970s as a way to test consumers' responses to television commercials.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, J., "The Meaning of Pupil Dilation," ''The Scientist,'' 6 December 2012 &lt;Online: http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/33563/title/The-Meaning-of-Pupil-Dilation/&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilation suggests a stronger interest in the stimuli and can be associated with arousal and action. Pupil dilation is not only used to study advertising, but also used to investigate product and package design.&lt;ref&gt;Wedel,M. and Pieters, R., ''Eye Tracking for Visual Marketing,'' [Foundations and Trends in Marketing Series], Hanover, MA, Now Publishers, 2010,  p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye tracking=====

{{see also|Eye tracking|AttentionTracking}}

While viewing an advertisement, a sensor aims a beam of infrared light at the eye and follows the movement to show the spot on which the viewer is focusing. This shows the length of time the viewer focuses on each element of the image and the general sequence used to interpret the image. Eye tracking is often used to fine tune advertising executions.  Research studies suggest that eye tracking is associated with brand recognition, but less useful for brand recall.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, W.D., ''Measuring Advertising Effectiveness,'' Psychology Press, 2014, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Galvanic skin response (GSR)=====
{{see also|Electrodermal activity|l1=Galvanic skin response}}

Galvanic skin response uses a device, called a galvanometer, which is very similar to a lie detector, designed to measure minute amounts of skin perspiration and electrical activity in the skin. Changes in skin response are associated with arousal and are an indicator of the advertisement's ability to capture attention.&lt;ref&gt;Govoni, N.A., ''Dictionary of Marketing Communications,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage,
p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Electroencephelograph (EEG)=====

[[File:EEG recording.jpg|thumb|EEG testing is more invasive]]

An [[Electroencephalography|electroencephelograph]] (EEG) is a device that measures changes in brain-wave activity. EEG testing can detect emotional arousal which is difficult to detect using alternative testing methods. Arousal is an indicator of the advertisement's ability to grab attention and engage the consumer in the message. EEG testing is a cumbersome and invasive testing method which militates against routine use in advertising testing.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrzyniak,A and Wąsikowska, B., "The Study of Advertising Content with Application of EEG," [Chapter 21] in ''Selected Issues in Experimental Economics'' [Springer Proceedings in Business and Economics], Kesra Nermend, Małgorzata Łatuszyńska (eds), 2016, pp 333-353, {{ISBN|978-3-319-28419-4}} (Online)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FmRI)=====
{{see also|Functional magnetic resonance imaging}}

FmRI is a technique that enables researchers to monitor activity in specific areas of the brain. This technique has been used to identify specific brain networks associated with pleasure and arousal associated with advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Bolls, P.D., Wise, K. and Bradley, S.D., "Embodied Motivation Cognition: A Theoretical Framework for Understanding Cognitive Processes Underlying Advertising Exposure," in ''Advertising Theory,'' Shelly Rodgers and Esther Thorson (eds), NY, Routledge, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-testing===

The aim of post-testing is to provide indicators of how well a given campaign is achieving the desired communications objectives, so that corrective action and fine-tuning can occur during the campaign as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of advertising expenditure in order to provide benchmarks for future advertising programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wardle, J., ''Developing Advertising with Qualitative Market Research,'' London, Sage, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques used in post-testing depend on the media employed, and may include such tests as Starch scores, day-after recall tests (DAR), campaign tracking, advertising ROI and other measures.

====Starch scores====

Starch scores were developed by [[Daniel Starch]] in the 1920s to evaluate the copy effectiveness of print advertisements, and are still in use today. A consumer is shown a magazine page by page and subsequently asked whether they had noticed any part an advertisement. If they answer, 'Yes', the interviewer asks the respondent to indicate which parts of the ad were noticed. For each advertisement, three scores are calculated:&lt;ref&gt;''AdAge'', Encyclopedia, http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/testing-methods/98903/&lt;/ref&gt;
: (1) ''Noted'' – the percentage of readers who recognize the advertisement as one they previously saw in the magazine issue (designed to capture the advertisement's ability to grab attention)
: (2) ''Associated'' – the percentage of readers who saw or read any part of the advertisement that clearly indicated the brand advertised (designed to indicate the level of brand processing)
: (3) ''Read most'' – the percentage of readers who read half or more of the ad's written material (an indicator of reader involvement or engagement)

====Day-after-recall tests (DARs)====

Day-after-recall (DAR) tests were developed by George Gallup in the 1940s and are still used. DAR tests provide a measure of the percentage of the people who recall something specific about an ad (e.g., sales message or a visual) the day following exposure. Interviewers ask questions designed to elicit:&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, S.J. and Bird, R., "The Day-after Recall Test of Advertising Effectiveness: A Discussion of the Issues",  ''Current Issues and Research in Advertising,'' volume 5, no. 1, 1982, pp 59-68 Published online: 18 May 2012, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01633392.1982.10505321&lt;/ref&gt;

: (a) ''Unaided recall'' – when respondents remember any commercials for the product category in question
: (b) ''Aided recall'' – when respondents remember seeing a commercial for Brand X 
: (c) ''Copy points'' – when respondents can recall what the brand showed, looked like and the main points of the commercial

====Tracking====
{{see also|Ad tracking}}

Ad tracking or campaign tracking refers to techniques used to monitor the "in-market performance" of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Ipsos, Encyclopedia,https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-encyclopedia-advertising-tracking-research&lt;/ref&gt; Ad tracking uses a combination of pre-testing and post-testing. Pre-testing is used to establish benchmarks against which the actual performance of a campaign can be measured during and after the campaign has run. A particular area of concern during an advertising campaign is the problem of advertising ''wear-out''. When audiences are repeatedly exposed to the same message, the level of attention begins to plateau and eventually decays. Any further repetitions may cease to be noticed or may alienate target audiences. When wear-out occurs, additional advertising expenditure is simply wasted. One way that advertisers avoid wear-out is to use ''repetition with variation'' – that is, the use of different executions of the same message. Campaign tracking can assist advertisers to determine when to introduce a new execution of the same advertising message or to fine-tune the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. and Bushman, B., ''Social Psychology and Human Nature'', Belmont, CA, Thomson, 2008, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising return on investment (ROI)====

Advertising return on investment (advertising ROI) is designed to ensure that the right advertising tactics were employed. Good measures of advertising ROI should consider both short term and long term measures. Online campaigns and co-operative advertising are useful for building sales, while television and PR are essential to long-term brand building and customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, "Maximize the Return on your Advertising Spend," 1 December 2009, &lt;Online: http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2009/maximize-the-return-on-your-advertising-spend.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Careers ==

Advertising management is a career path in the [[advertising]] or marketing industries. Advertising and promotions managers may work for an agency, a [[public relations]] firm, a media outlet, or may be hired directly by a company to work in their in-house agency where they would take responsibility for communications designed to develop the company's brands or group of brands. In the agency environment, advertising managers are often known as ''account managers'' and their role involves working closely with client firms.&lt;ref&gt;Moriarty,S., Mitchell, N.D., Wells, W.D., Crawford, R., Brennan,l. and Spence-Stone, R., ''Advertising: Principles and Practice,'' Melbourne, Australia, Pearson, 2012. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; In a marketing department, the advertising manager's position can include supervising employees, acting as a liaison between multiple agencies working on a project, or creating and implementing promotional campaigns.

The '''Animals in War Memorial''' (officially '''Animals in War''' and '''Les animaux en temps de guerre''') is a memorial sculpture located at [[Confederation Park]] in [[Ottawa]]. It commemorates animals used by the Canadian military ([[Canadian Army]]) in conflicts since the [[Second Boer War]] (this excludes the use of animals by [[British Army]] and [[French Army]] before [[Canada]] existed as a country).

== Sculptures ==

The memorial consists of three plaques mounted on a stone and sculpture of a dog with foot prints locate next to the [[South African War Memorial, Ottawa]] and near the [[National Aboriginal Veterans Monument]].
The plaques consists of:

* Dedication to animals at war
* Dedication to [[Mule]]s
* Dedication to [[Horse]]s
* Dedication to [[Dog]]s

Inscriptions on the plaques are in English and French.

The plaques and sculpture are created by Ottawa-based artist [[David Clendining]]&lt;ref&gt;http://aiwdedication.ca/aiw-dedication/david-clendining/&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Laureen Harper]] as honorary patron of the project.

== Construction ==

The memorial was inspired by [[Lloyd Swick]], a [[World War II]] and [[Korean War]] veteran, who remembered a painting of a horse at war at his high school in 1939. Swick and supporters presented the idea for a memorial to the National Capital Commission Committee in 2010. The memorial became reality and was unveiled on November 3, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://aiwdedication.ca/project-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1912 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  It was the first time that art competitions were part of the Olympic program.  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

[[File:Arts Council England Logo.svg|thumb|200px|right|Arts Council of England logo]]
'''Arts Council England''' is a [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]]. It was formed in 1994 when the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] was divided into three separate bodies for [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The [[arts funding]] system in England underwent considerable reorganisation in 2002 when all of the [[regional arts board]]s were subsumed into Arts Council England and became regional offices of the national organisation.

Arts Council England is a government-funded body dedicated to promoting the performing, visual and literary arts in [[England]]. Since 1994, Arts Council England has been responsible for distributing lottery funding. This investment has helped to transform the building stock of arts organisations and to create lots of additional high quality arts activity.

Since October 2011, Arts Council England has been responsible for supporting and developing museums, a function it inherited from the now defunct [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]].

==History==
The Arts Council of England was created in 1946 as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], which was later divided to form the Arts Council of England, the [[Scottish Arts Council]], and the [[Arts Council of Wales]] in 1994. At the same time, the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] was established and the Arts Council of England became one of the distribution bodies. This increased responsibility saw the Arts Council of England grow back in size to the point where it was larger than before the 1987 restructure.

In 2001 Chairman [[Gerry Robinson]] announced a further restructuring in which the Arts Council of England would be merged with the ten [[regional arts board]]s to form a single organisation: Arts Council England.

==Governance and administration==
Arts Council England has a national council of 15 members, including the Chair. The national council meets ten times a year and is made up of representatives of the arts community with five of the members also representing the area councils. Each area council has a board of 15 members made up of representatives of their arts community and local government. There are five area councils:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* North
* Midlands 
* London
* South East 
* South West 
{{col-end}}
The appointment of the Arts Council England [[Chief Executive]] is made by the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]], a position held by [[Alan Davey (civil servant)|Alan Davey]] between 2008 and 2014 when he was succeeded by [[Darren Henley]]. Each area council has an [[Executive Director]] and each art form has a specialist advisor. The Arts Council England divides its funding into the following headings:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
* Combined Art (Festivals)
* Dance
* Education
{{col-break}}
* Literature
* Music
* Research
{{col-break}}
* Theatre

==Arts Capital Lottery==
Arts Council England is a distributor of National Lottery funding. From 1994 it oversaw a national capital fund with grants for new buildings, public art and the renovation of existing arts buildings. The story of the Capital programme is told by Prue Skene who chaired the Lottery Panel, in '''Capital Gains: how the national lottery transformed England's arts'''. &lt;ref&gt;Skene, P (2017), Capital Gains: how the national lottery transformed England's arts. London: Franchise Press {{ISBN|9780995589605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
Arts Council England supports a limited number of museums  as '''Major Partnership Museums'''. 16 single museums or consortia were supported 2012-2015, and a further five were added for 2015-2018 bringing the total to 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Major partner museums, 2015-18|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/our-investment-2015-18/major-partner-museums-15-18/|publisher=Arts Council England|accessdate=16 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712213521/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/our-investment-2015-18/major-partner-museums-15-18/|archivedate=12 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Council attracted criticism from the Parliamentary select committee responsible for its oversight for supporting a lottery-funded programme to subsidise UK film production that resulted in a series of films that failed to find distribution. There was also a series of costly capital projects such as the [[Royal Opera House]] and the [[Lowry Centre]] that required additional funding. In the case of the Royal Opera House the select committee found the Arts Council had broken its own procedures. In 2005 it was announced that the Arts Council England's budget was capped resulting in an effective £30m reduction in its budget.

The Arts Council of England funds a controversial cultural festival, the [[Festival of Muslim Cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/awards/honorary-doctorate-for-peter-tatchell.htm|title=Peter Tatchell - Human Rights, Democracy, Global Justice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=petertatchell.net|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, the Arts Council announced a review of its National Office that would "enhance efficiency and delivery while continuing to provide respected and focused arts leadership and drive", whilst proposing to lose 42 posts, mainly arts specialists, so that the organisation will no longer have dedicated national leads for areas including contemporary music, interdisciplinary art, moving image, architecture, broadcasting, opera, social inclusion, and disability.

Arts Council England's music policy was controversial within the [[jazz]] world. Chris Hodgkins, in his 1998 paper ''Jazz in the UK'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwjazzworks.org/reports/8Jazz_in_the_UK,_C_Hodgkins.doc {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425232359/http://www.nwjazzworks.org/reports/8Jazz_in_the_UK%2C_C_Hodgkins.doc |date=25 April 2012 }} [[NWJazzworks]]&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that more than 90% of its music budget went on [[opera]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} while jazz, with an equivalent audience size,{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion|date=May 2009}} received less than 1%.{{Citation needed|reason=might need more than a paper from 1998 in 11 years later.|date=May 2009}} The funding landscape has improved since with funding for [[NWJazzworks]] and [[Manchester Jazz Festival]] 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwjazzworks.org/funding_intro.php |title=Grants and funding opportunities available for jazz musicians, promoters and projects |publisher=NWJazzworks |accessdate=1 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506022332/http://www.nwjazzworks.org/funding_intro.php |archivedate=6 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwjazzworks.org/about.php |title=About NWJazzworks |accessdate=1 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715024355/http://www.nwjazzworks.org/about.php |archivedate=15 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other areas funding has diversified into youth music such as [[National Youth Choirs of Great Britain]], National Youth Jazz Collective and South Asian Music Youth Orchestra (SAMYO) etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/past-funding-programmes/national-youth-music-organisations/ |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20121217030812/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/past-funding-programmes/national-youth-music-organisations/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 December 2012 |title=National youth music organisations |publisher=ACE |accessdate=1 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it was raised in the [[House of Lords]] by [[Anthony Hamilton-Smith, 3rd Baron Colwyn|Lord Colwyn]] on 11 May 2006 as documented in the Lords [[Hansard]] Columns (1058 to 1060).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60511-06.htm|title=Page cannot be found|author=|date=|website=UK Parliament|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404042909/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60511-06.htm|archivedate=4 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, funding by Arts Council England of ''[[The Siege (Play)|The Siege]]'', a Palestinian play about how armed fighters hid out in Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity for 39 days in 2002 had angered the British Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.K. funding of Palestinian play angered the British Jewish community |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/1.654750 |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=3 May 2015 |accessdate=29 November 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019031111/http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/1.654750 |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bible translations]] in the [[Middle Ages]] discussions are rare in contrast to [[Late Antiquity]], when the Bibles available to most Christians were in the local [[vernacular]]. In a process seen in many other religions, as languages changed, and in Western Europe languages with no tradition of being written down became dominant, the prevailing vernacular translations remained in place, despite gradually becoming [[sacred language]]s, incomprehensible to the majority of the population in many places.  In Western Europe, the Latin [[Vulgate]], itself originally a translation into the vernacular, was the standard text of the Bible, and full or partial translations into a vernacular language were uncommon until the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern Period]].

==Classical and Late Antique translations==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
===Greek texts and versions===
The books of the Bible were not originally written in [[Latin]]. The [[Old Testament]] was written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (with some parts in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]&lt;ref&gt;Parts of the [[Book of Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra]]&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[New Testament]] in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. The [[Septuagint]], still used in the [[Greek Orthodox church]], is a Jewish translation of the Old Testament into [[Koine Greek]] completed in the 1st century BC in [[Alexandria]] for Jews who spoke Greek as their primary language.

The whole Christian Bible was therefore available in Koine Greek by about 100 AD; so were numerous [[apocryphal Gospel]]s. Deciding which books should be included in the [[Biblical canon]] took about another two centuries; some differences remain between churches to the present day.  The Septuagint also included some books that are not in the [[Hebrew Bible]], which the church accepted due to their use at the time of Christ and because Christ quoted directly from and/or referenced these books in the Gospels of the New Testament.

===Other early versions===
The Bible was translated into various languages in [[late antiquity]]; the most important of these translations are those in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] dialect of Aramaic (including the [[Peshitta]] and the [[Diatessaron]] gospel harmony), the [[Ge'ez language]] of Ethiopia, and, in Western Europe, Latin. The earliest Latin translations are collectively known as  the [[Vetus Latina]], but in the late fourth century, [[Jerome]] re-translated the Hebrew and Greek texts into the normal vernacular Latin of his day, in a version known as the Vulgate (''Biblia vulgata'') (meaning "common version", in the sense of "popular"). Jerome's translation gradually replaced most of the older Latin texts, and also gradually ceased to be a vernacular version as the Latin language developed and divided. The earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Latin Bible is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], produced in eighth century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]]. By the end of late antiquity the Bible was therefore available and used in all the major written languages then spoken by Christians.

===Vetus Latina, or the Old Latin===
Usage of the Vetus Latina as the backbone of the church and liturgy continued well into the Twelfth Century. Perhaps the most complete, and certainly the largest surviving example is Codex Gigas, which can be seen in its entirety online.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3042/&lt;/ref&gt; Housed in the National Library of Sweden, the massive Bible opens with the Five Books of Moses and ends with Third Book of Kings.

===Latin Vulgate, or Jerome's Revision of the Vetus Latina===
When Jerome's revision, or update of the Vetus Latina, was read aloud in the churches in North Africa, riots and protests erupted since the new readings differed - the turn of the phrase - from the more familiar reading in the Vetus Latina. Jerome's Latin Vulgate did not take complete traction among the churches in the West until the time of Charlemagne, when he sought to standardize script, texts, and rites within Western Christendom.

==Early medieval vernacular translations==

C'est le propheme de cellui qui mist cest livre de latin en francois. ~~ Pource que le Deable qui chascun jour destourbe et enordut le coeur des hommes par oyseuse (ie: "paresse") et par mille lacs (i.e.: "lacets, cordes") qu'il a tendus...''"(''Here begins the ''Bible historiale'' or the ''Historia Scholastica.''~~ Because the devil, who every day troubles and soils men's hearts with sloth and by a thousand traps...'')]]

During the [[Migration Period]] Christianity spread to various peoples who had not been part of the old Roman Empire, and whose languages had as yet no written form, or only a very simple one, like [[rune]]s.  Typically the Church itself was the first to attempt to capture these languages in written form, and Bible translations are often the oldest surviving texts in these newly written-down languages.  Meanwhile, Latin was evolving into new distinct regional forms, the early versions of the [[Romance languages]], for which new translations eventually became necessary.  However, the [[Vulgate]] remained the authoritative text, used universally in the West for scholarship and the [[liturgy]] since the early development of the [[Romance languages]] had not come to full fruition, matching its continued use for other purposes such as religious literature and most secular books and documents.  In the early Middle Ages, anyone who could read at all could often read Latin, even in [[Anglo-Saxon]] England, where writing in the vernacular ([[Old English]]) was more common than elsewhere. A number of pre-reformation [[Old English Bible translations]] survive, as do many instances of glosses in the vernacular, especially in the Gospels and the Psalms.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, see Roberts, Jane (2011). “Some Psalter Glosses in Their Immediate Context”, in ''Palimpsests and the Literary Imagination of Medieval England'', eds. Leo Carruthers, Raeleen Chai-Elsholz, Tatjana Silec. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 61-79, which looks at three Anglo-Saxon glossed psalters and how layers of gloss and text, language and layout, speak to the meditative reader, or Marsden, Richard (2011), "The Bible in English in the Middle Ages", in The Practice of the Bible in the Middle Ages: Production, Reception and Performance in Western Christianity (New York: Columbia University Press, 2011), pp. 272-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, biblical translations and adaptations were produced both within and outside the church, some as personal copies for religious or lay nobility, others for liturgical or pedagogical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Deanesly, Margaret (1920) ''The Lollard Bible and Other Medieval Biblical Versions''. Cambridge University Press, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innocent III, "heretical" movements and "translation controversies"==

Church attitudes toward written translations and the use of the vernacular in Mass varied by the translation, the date and location. For example, whereas the acts of Saint-Gall contain a reference to the use of a vernacular interpreter in Mass as early as the seventh century, and the 813 Council of Tours acknowledge the need for translation and encouraged such,&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Masson (1866), pp. 81-83.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1079, Duke [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia]] asked [[Pope Gregory VII]] for permission to use Old Church Slavonic translations of the liturgy, to which Gregory did not consent.&lt;ref&gt;Deanesly (1920), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, demand for vernacular translations came from groups outside the Roman Catholic Church such as the [[Waldensians]], [[Paterines]], and [[Cathars]]. This was probably related to the increased urbanization of the twelfth-century, as well as increased literacy among educated urban populations.&lt;ref&gt;Kienzle, Beverly Mayne (1998) "Holiness and obedience"; pp. 259-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biller (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known group of letters from [[Pope Innocent III]] to the [[diocese of Metz]], where the Waldensians were active, is sometimes taken by post-reformation scholars as evidence that Bible translations were forbidden by the church, especially since Innocent's first letter was later incorporated into [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;Deanesly (1920), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Deanesly's study of this matter in 1920 was influential in maintaining this notion for many years, but later scholars have challenged its conclusions. [[Leonard Boyle]] has argued that, on the contrary, Innocent was not particularly concerned with the translations, but rather with their use by unauthorized and uneducated preachers.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, Leonard E. (1985) "Innocent III and vernacular versions of Scripture"; p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is not in fact the slightest hint that Innocent ever spoke in any way, hypothetically or not, of suppressing the translations at all."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteenth-century chronicler [[Alberic of Trois Fontaines]] does say that translations were burned in Metz in 1200, and Deanesly understood this to mean it was ordered by Innocent in his letters from the previous year, but Boyle pointed out that nowhere in the letters did Innocent actually prohibit the translations.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle (1985), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; While the documents are inconclusive about the fate of the specific translations in question and their users, Innocent’s general remarks suggest a rather permissive attitude toward translations and vernacular commentaries provided that they are produced and used within the scope of Christian teachings or with church oversight.

There is no evidence of any official decision to universally disallow translations following the incident at [[Metz]] until the [[Council of Trent]], at which time the [[Reformation]] threatened the [[Catholic Church]], and the rediscovery of the [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]] presented new problems for translators. However, some specific translations were condemned, and regional bans were imposed during the [[Albigensian Crusade]]: [[Toulouse]] in 1229, [[Taragona]] in 1234 and [[Beziers]] in 1246.&lt;ref&gt;McGerr (1983), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://regensburgforum.com/2017/06/05/vernacular-scripture-in-the-reformation-era-re-examining-the-narrative/.|title=Vernacular Scripture in the Reformation Era: Re-examining the Narrative|last=Anderson|first=Trevor|date=|website=The Regensburg Forum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Gregory IX]] incorporated Innocent III’s letter into his [[Decretal]]s and instituted these bans presumably with the [[Cathars]] in mind as well as the [[Waldensians]], who continued to preach using their own translations, spreading into [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], as well as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Production of [[Wyclif’s Bible|Wycliffite Bibles]] would later be officially banned in England at the [[Thomas Arundel|Oxford Synod]] in the face of [[Lollardy|Lollard]] anticlerical sentiment, but the ban was not strictly enforced and since owning earlier copies was not illegal, books made after the ban are often simply inscribed with a date prior to 1409 to avoid seizure.

As Rosemarie Potz McGerr has argued, as a general pattern, bans on translation responded to the threat of strong heretical movements; in the absence of viable [[heresy|heresies]], a variety of translations and vernacular adaptations flourished between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries with no documented institutional opposition at all.&lt;ref&gt;McGerr (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;
Still, translations came late in the history of the European vernaculars and were relatively rare in many areas. According to the ''Cambridge History of the Bible'', this was mainly because "the vernacular appeared simply and totally inadequate. Its use, it would seem, could end only in a complete enfeeblement of meaning and a general abasement of values. Not until a vernacular is seen to possess relevance and resources, and, above all, has acquired a significant cultural prestige, can we look for acceptable and successful translation."&lt;ref&gt;Lampe, G. W. H. (ed.) (1975) ''The Cambridge History of the Bible, vol. 2: The West from the Fathers to the Reformation'', p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of commissioning translations and producing such a large work in manuscript was also a factor; the three copies of the Vulgate produced in 7th century [[Northumbria]], of which the [[Codex Amiatinus]] is the only survivor, are estimated to have required the skins of 1,600 calves.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Grocock has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves. 1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscript copies of the ''[[Historical Bible|Bible historiale]]'' and, even more so, the usually lushly illuminated ''[[Bible moralisée]]'' were large, deluxe manuscripts, which only the wealthiest nobility (such as the French royal family) could afford. 

==Notable medieval vernacular Bibles by language, region and type==
[[File:Wycliffe John Gospel.jpg|thumb|left|Typical Gothic pen flourishes in an unillustrated working copy of the Gospel of John in English (starts at initial), translated by [[John Wycliffe]], late 14th century. This copy contained selections only.]]

===English===
There are a number of partial [[Old English Bible translations]] (from the Latin) surviving, including the [[Old English Hexateuch]], [[Wessex Gospels]] and the [[Book of Psalms]], partly in prose and partly in a different verse version.  Others, now missing, are referred to in other texts, notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which he is said to have completed shortly before his death around the year 735. [[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular about 900, and in about 970 an inter-linear translation was added in red to the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/lindisfarne.html Lindisfarne Gospels] [[British Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[West Saxon dialect]]; these are called the Wessex Gospels. According to the historian Victoria Thompson, "although the Church reserved Latin for the most sacred liturgical moments almost every other religious text was available in English by the eleventh century".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2004), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman Conquest]], the [[Ormulum]], produced by the Augustinian monk Orm of Lincolnshire around 1150, includes partial translations of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles from Latin into the dialect of East Midland. The manuscript is written in the poetic meter iambic septenarius.

[[Richard Rolle]] of Hampole (or de Hampole) was an Oxford-educated hermit and writer of religious texts. In the early 14th century, he produced English glosses of Latin Bible text, including the Psalms. Rolle translated the Psalms into a Northern English dialect, but later copies were written in Southern English dialects. Around the same time, an anonymous author in the West Midlands region produced another gloss of the Psalms — the West Midland Psalms.

In the early years of the 14th century, a French copy of the Book of Revelation was anonymously translated into English, and there were English versions of various French paraphrases and moralized versions.

In the late 14th century, [[John Wycliffe]] and perhaps [[Nicholas Hereford]] produced the first complete English language Bible. Wycliffe's Bible was revised in the last years of the 14th century, resulting in two major editions, the second more numerous than the first, both circulating widely despite their official prohibition at the Oxford Synod.

===Western Continental Europe===
The first [[Bible translations (French)|French translation]] dates from the thirteenth century, as does the first [[Bible translations (Catalan)|Catalan Bible]], and the Spanish ''Biblia Alfonsina''. The most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the [[Thomas Arundel|Oxford Synod]] of 1407-08, and was associated with the movement of the [[Lollards]], often accused of [[heresy]]. The Malermi Bible was an Italian translation printed in 1471. In 1478, there was a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]]. The [[Welsh Bible]] and the [[Alba Bible]], a [[Jew]]ish translation into [[Old Spanish|Castilian]], date from the 15th century.

===French===
Translations of individual [[books of the Bible]] and verse adaptations survive from the twelfth century, but the first prose Bible collections date from the mid thirteenth. These include the Acre Bible, an [[Old Testament]] produced in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], likely for King [[Louis IX of France]],&lt;ref&gt;Nobel (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; the Anglo-Norman Bible and a glossed, complete translation of the [[Paris Bible]] known simply as the “Thirteenth-Century Bible” or “Old French Bible,” often referred to by the French title “Bible du XIIIe siècle” first coined by Samuel Berger.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1884)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Robson, “Vernacular Scriputres in France” in Lampe, ‘’Cambridge History of the Bible’’  (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Completed with prologues in 1297 by [[Guyart des Moulins]], the ''[[Historical Bible|Bible historiale]]'' was by far the predominant medieval translation of the Bible into French throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  It translates from the Latin [[Vulgate]] significant portions from the Bible accompanied by selections from the ''[[Historia Scholastica]]'' by [[Peter Comestor]] (d. ca. 1178), a literal-historical commentary that summarizes and interprets episodes from the historical books of the Bible and situates them chronologically with respect to events from pagan history and mythology. In many copies, Guyart’s translation has been supplemented with some individual biblical books from the ‘’Bible du XIIIe siècle’’.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1884), pp. 109-220&lt;/ref&gt;

===German===
[[File:Bible vaclav.jpg|thumb|German [[Wenceslas Bible]] made for King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia]] in the 1390s]]
An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748.  In the late Middle Ages, Deanesly thought that Bible translations were easier to produce in Germany, where the decentralized nature of the Empire allowed for greater religious freedom. However, these translations were seized and burned by [[Inquisition|inquisitors]] whenever they were found.&lt;ref&gt;Deanesly (1920), pp. 54-61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Altogether there are 13 medieval German translations before the [[Luther Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Walther &amp; Wolf, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; In 1466, [[Johannes Mentelin]] published the first printed [[Bible]] in the [[German language]], the Mentelin Bible, one of the first printed books in the German language and also the first printed vernacular Bible. The Mentelin Bible was reprinted in the southern German region a further thirteen times by various printers up until the [[Luther Bible]]. About 1475 [[Günther Zainer]] of Augsburg printed an illustrated German edition of the Bible, with a second edition in 1477.

===Czech===
All medieval translations of the Bible into Czech were based on the Latin Vulgate. The Psalms were translated into Czech before 1300 and the gospels followed in the first half of the 14th century. The first translation of the whole Bible into Czech was done around 1360. Until the end of the 15th century this translation was revisioned and edited three times. After 1476 the first printed Czech New Testament was published in [[Plzeň|Pilsen]]. In 1488 the [[Prague Bible]] was published as the oldest Czech printed Bible, thus the Czech language became the fifth language in which the entire Bible was printed (after Latin, German, Italian and Catalan).

===Eastern Europe===
Some fragments of the Bible were probably translated into Lithuanian when that country was converted to Christianity in the 14th century. A Hungarian [[Hussite Bible]] appeared in the mid 15th century, of which only fragments remain.

===Other Germanic and Slavonic languages===
The earliest translation into a vernacular European language other than Latin or Greek was the [[Gothic Bible]], by [[Ulfilas]], an [[Arian]] who translated from the Greek in the 4th century in Italy.

The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] by [[Cyril and Methodius]] dates to the late 9th century though whether Cyril had to invent the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for the purpose remains controversial.  Versions of [[Church Slavonic language]] remain the [[liturgical language]]s of the Slavic [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, though subject to some modernization.

===Arabic===
In the 10th century, [[Saadia Gaon]] translated the [[Old Testament]] in [[Arabic]]. Ishaq ibn Balask of Cordoba translated the gospels into Arabic in 946.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Christians in Al-Andalus'', 2002, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Hafs ibn Albar made a translation of the Psalms in 889.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Christys, ''Christians in Al-Andalus'', 2002, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetic and pictorial works===
Throughout the Middle Ages, Bible stories were always known in the vernacular through prose and poetic adaptations, usually greatly shortened and freely reworked, especially to include [[typology (theology)|typological]] comparisons between Old and New Testaments. Some parts of the Bible stories were paraphrased in verse by Anglo-Saxon poets, e.g. Genesis and Exodus, and in French by Hermann de Valenciennes, Macé de la Charité, Jehan Malkaraume and others. Among the most popular compilations were the many varying versions of the [[Bible moralisée]], [[Biblia pauperum]] and [[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]. These were increasingly in the vernacular, and often illustrated. 15th century [[blockbook]] versions could be relatively cheap, and appear in the prosperous Netherlands to have included among their target market parish priests who would use them for instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson &amp; Wilson, especially pp. 26-30, 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical works===
Historians also used the Bible as a source and some of their works were later translated into a vernacular language: for example [[Peter Comestor]]'s popular commentaries were incorporated into [[Guyart des Moulins]] French translation, the  ''[[Historical Bible|Bible historiale]]'' and the Middle English Genesis and Exodus, and were an important source for a vast array of biblically-themed poems and histories in a variety of languages. It was the convention of many if not most historical chronicles to begin at Creation and include a few biblical events as well as secular ones from Roman and local history before reaching their real subject; the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' follows this convention.

'''Canute Caliste''' (April 16, 1914 – November 20, 2005) was a [[outsider art|naive painter]] from [[Grenada]].

Born Emmanuel Caliste on 16 April 1914 in L'Esterre, [[Carriacou]]. Caliste was also known as Mr Caliste, "Papa C.C."  he was also a fisherman, sea cook, boat builder and master [[Quadrille]] violin player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FiVBbyEC9u4C&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Canute+Caliste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC2sies7zZAhXsAsAKHaTcAjMQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Canute%20Caliste&amp;f=false|title=Carriacou String Band Serenade: Performing Identity in the Eastern Caribbean|last=Miller|first=Rebecca S.|date=2007|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819568588|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caliste began painting as a child, painting onto boards and any surfaces he could find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gbowblf1QP8C&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Canute+Caliste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZsPyws7zZAhULM8AKHWoKD5oQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Canute%20Caliste&amp;f=false|title=Caribbean Folklore: A Handbook|last=Hill|first=Donald R.|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313336058|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caliste was known as something of an eccentric.  He claimed to have been inspired by a vision of a mermaid at the age of nine, and to have begun painting soon after.  Caliste's work can now be find in numerous large collections worldwide. He is buried in the Joseph cemetery in L'Esterre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/nov/25/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries|title=Obituary: Canute Caliste|last=Mason|first=Peter|date=2005-11-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese Culture Center''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 旧金山中华文化中心; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 舊金山中華文化中心; [[pinyin]]: ''Jiùjīnshān Zhōnghuá Wénhuà Zhōngxīn''; [[Jyutping]]: ''Gau&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;gam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;saan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Zung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;waa&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Man&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;faa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Zung&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;sam&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'') of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, is a major community-based, [[non-profit]] organization established in 1965 as the operations center of the Chinese Culture Foundation.

While the CCC’s activities have shifted focus throughout its existence, the center is currently known{{Cn|date=September 2018}} for its [[contemporary art]] exhibitions and interventions, under the vestige of the CCC Visual Arts Center, as well as its radical, [[social justice]] education initiatives, under the vestige of the Him Mark Lai Learning Center.

The Center is located inside the [[Hilton San Francisco Financial District]], at 750 Kearny Street, #3, San Francisco, CA, 94108.

==Overview==
The facilities of the Center, totaling 20,000 square feet (1,900 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), include a 299-seat auditorium, a 2,935-square-foot (272.7 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) gallery, a gallery shop, [[classroom]], and [[office]]s. Centrally located between [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] and the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]], the Center attracts a broad spectrum of contemporary arts and activist audiences from the Chinatown community, the city at large, the greater Bay Area, nationwide, as well as across the world due to its global art connections. CCC has a reach of more than 165,000 individuals yearly.

The current{{When|date=September 2018}} Executive Director is Mabel Teng, former member of the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] and former City Accessor-Recorder.

==History==

=== Founding and building ===
The Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco is one of the earliest Chinese community cultural organizations founded in the United States in the post-World War II era.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

The city government put up city-owned land that formerly housed the Hall of Justice for sale. As a compromise, founder J.K. Choy struck a deal with the developer for a 20,000 square foot facility dedicated to community cultural activities.

[[File:Bridge To Chinese Culture Center - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Bridge to Chinese Culture Center]]

The Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco incorporated on October 15, 1965. Another compromise led to the modification of the planned Portsmouth Square Pedestrian Bridge to accommodate the future activities. Holiday Inn was completed in January 1971, while the bridge was completed in August 1971. After some political tensions between CCF and the heavily Nationalist majority faction in Chinatown, work began on the Chinese Culture Center facilities on January 27, 1973.

===Beginning operations===
Early activities were marked by a desire to be non-controversial and non-political because of tense Taiwanese-PRC relations and factions within Chinatown.

The Center began hosting workshops and classes on Mandarin language, folklore, martial arts, music, painting and calligraphy, crafts, drama, dance, and shadow play. It also held celebrations of the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]] and [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] and was instrumental in presenting outstanding Chinese artists and talent to new, American audiences. Docent-guided tours of Chinatown began in 1974.

From the very beginning, CCC began to achieve national prominence for its highly popular arts programs, historical and modern, some coordinated with local major museums, such as the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]].

==='80s and '90s===

1989, CCC received a grant to implement the annual program, ''In Search of Roots''. Each year, ten American-born Chinese youth interns who wished to trace their ancestries to the [[Pearl River Delta]], under CCC guidance, researched their family histories, visited their ancestral villages, and contributed findings to an annual CCC exhibit.

Following relaxation of US-PRC relations, CCC began sponsoring well-received public lectures on Chinese arts and culture by renowned scholars. After the [[Chinese economic reform]] and [[History of the Republic of China|democracy in the Republic of China on Taiwan]], the [[Two Chinas]] became less hostile, so older Chinatown organizations began to cooperate with the Chinese Culture Center in the 1990s.&lt;sup&gt;[[Chinese Culture Center#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Present Era ===
With the hire of Abby Chen as Program Director in 2008, the Chinese Culture Center began to focus solely on contemporary art, an initiative rebranded as the CCC Visual Arts Center, to widespread, international acclaim. The Center began publishing catalogues of its exhibitions for sale and archival purposes for renowned archives such as [[Asia Art Archive]].

The hire of Mabel Teng in 2009 fashioned strong ties between CCC and local Chinatown community and citywide governmental entities.

CCC’s education initiative was dedicated as the Him Mark Lai Learning Center in 2013.

Focusing on community-based, socially-engaged art interventions, in 2013, CCC opened '''41 Ross''', a pop-up art gallery space in historic Ross Alley that promotes dialogue amongst artists and local residents. 41 Ross is operated in partnership with the Chinatown Community Development Center.

CCC’s public artwork, ''Sky Bridge,'' was honored as the "Best Public Art" of 2015 by KQED.

In 2016, the Portsmouth Square Pedestrian Bridge was dedicated as the Rolland Lowe Bridge in honor of the Lowe family's patronage and strong support of CCC.

==Current arts programs==

=== Exhibitions ===
In the '''CCC Visual Arts Center''', CCC has produced over 100 quarterly, rotating gallery exhibitions of various styles, media, and modalities.

These exhibitions are centered on the '''''XianRui'' 鮮銳 Artist Excellence Series''' (also known as "Fresharp") curated by Abby Chen. ''XianRui鮮銳'' is an award-based solo exhibition that rewards innovative, mid-career, contemporary Chinese and Chinese-American artists.

''XianRui鮮銳'' has notably included: 
* '''Beili Liu’s ''Lure''''' (2008): A series of installations of thousands of hand-coiled disks of red thread suspended from the ceiling, borrowing from the ancient Chinese legend of The Red Thread. 
* '''Stella Zhang’s ''0 Viewpoint''''' (2010): Sculptural, monochromatic installations and sculptures exploring femininity, sexuality, and nationality. 
* '''Zheng Chongbin’s ''White Ink''''' (2011): Fifteen new and site-specific large scale abstract ink paintings and video projections, innovating traditional Chinese ink painting.
* '''Summer Mei Ling Lee’s ''Into the Nearness of Distance''''' (2014): Experimental installation exploring and transcending complications of inter- and counter-relationships.  
Especially notable is '''''WOMEN我們''''', an exhibition curated by Abby Chen that examines feminist, queer, and gender-expansive arts-activism in contemporary China. A traveling exhibition, ''WOMEN我們'' opened in Shanghai in 2011, came to the CCC Visual Arts Center in 2012, and was exhibited in Miami in 2013.

CCC’s other exhibitions series include '''''Episode'',''' which invites guest curators and artists to expand CCC’s programmatic rhetoric, as well as '''''Present Tense''''', which gives platform to young, emerging artists.

=== Site-based art ===
CCC’s recent initiatives focus on community-based arts in the form of public artworks as well as arts-based interventions. Much of this site-based art is rooted in '''41 Ross,''' CCC's pop-up, collaborative art space that opened in 2013.

Notable public arts include:
* '''Central Subway Public Art Project''' (2013): A collection of murals by Justin Hoover in Wentworth Alley.
* '''Sky Bridge''' (2015): A temporary public artwork by Beili Liu consisting of 50,000 pieces of reflective mylar epoxied to the Lowe Pedestrian Bridge to reflect the sky.  
* '''St. Mary’s Square''' (TBD): An application-based, community-juried art installation in St. Mary’s Square. 
Notable arts-based interventions include:
* '''Occupy Shanghai Subway''' (2012): A public intervention in which feminist activists donned artworks from WOMEN我們 and held signs in the subway to protest sexual harassment. 
* '''San Francisco Chinatown Keywords School''' (2013): A socially-engaged art project and relational aesthetics work by internationally renowned artist, Xu Tan. Public space is transformed into a workshop for youth to collect, explore, and create "key words" via artistic analysis and creation.
* '''Sunrise''' (2016): A space-based intervention that transforms the Rolland Lowe Pedestrian Bridge into a park with landscape design and a mosaic by Mik Gaspay.

==Current education and engagement programs==

CCC’s education initiative was dedicated as the '''Him Mark Lai Learning Center''' in 2013, serving as the hub for its tours, both Chinatown Walking Tours and Roots Excursions, as well as lectures, rebranded as Thought Leader Seminars.

===Tours===
Docent-led '''Chinatown Walking Tours''' are aimed towards tourists, activists, as well as school groups, locally and nationally. Current tours include:
* '''From Dynasty to Democracy Walk''': Social justice-oriented tour that reconciles Chinatown activism history beginning in the 1800s with civil rights movements at large. 
* '''Art Walk:''' Highlights both historical and contemporary community-based arts and culture in Chinatown.
'''California Roots Excursions''', reimagining the original program, ''In Search of Roots'', explores Chinese American migration history. Current excursions include:
* '''Roots Excursion to Locke''': Tour of [[Locke, California|Locke]], one of the few remaining Chinese communities out of hundreds that existed. 
* '''Roots Excursion to Monterey''': Tour of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] where Chinese families landed in the 1850s to create the abalone and squid industry.

===Thought Leader Seminars ===
CCC’s '''Thought Leader Seminars''' invite scholars, artists, and activists for public lectures that expound upon the organization's educational and artistic programs. Recent seminar leaders include [[Timmy Yip]], [[Gordon H. Chang]], Yu Xinqiao, and Elizabeth Sinn.

===Festivals===
CCC has also continued to put on festivals for citywide audiences and Chinatown residents, activating Chinatown with political and artistic consciousness by inviting local artists to intervene in local spaces. These include the '''Chinatown Music Festival''' in late summer, the '''Spring Festival''' in the spring, and '''Dancing on Waverly''' in early fall.

'''Contemporary architecture''' is the architecture of the 21st century. No single style is dominant; contemporary architects are working in a dozen different styles, from [[postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] and [[high-tech architecture]] to highly conceptual and expressive styles, resembling sculpture on an enormous scale. The different styles and approaches have in common the use of very advanced technology and modern building materials, such as [[Tube (structure)|Tube structure]] which allows construction of the buildings that are taller, lighter and stronger than those in the 20th century, and the use of new techniques of [[computer-aided design]], which allow buildings to be designed and modeled on computers in three dimensions, and constructed with more precision and speed.

Contemporary buildings are designed to be noticed and to astonish. Some feature concrete structures wrapped in glass or aluminum screens, very asymmetric facades, and cantilevered sections which hang over the street. Skyscrapers twist, or break into crystal-like facets. Facades are designed to shimmer or change color at different times of day.

Whereas the major monuments of [[modern architecture]] in the 20th century were mostly concentrated in the United States and western Europe, contemporary architecture is global; important new buildings have been built in China, Russia, Latin America, and particularly in the Gulf States of the Middle East; the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]] was the tallest building in the world in 2016, and the [[Shanghai Tower]] in China was the second-tallest.

Most of the landmarks of contemporary architecture are the works of a small group of architects who work on an international scale. Many were designed by architects already famous in the late 20th century, including Mario Botta, [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Norman Foster]], [[Ieoh Ming Pei]] and [[Renzo Piano]], while others are the work of a new generation born during or after World War II, including [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Jacques Herzog]], [[Pierre de Meuron]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], and [[Shigeru Ban]]. Other projects are the work of collectives of several architects, such as [[UNStudio]] and [[SANAA]], or giant multinational agencies such as [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]], with thirty associate architects and large teams of engineers and designers, and [[Gensler]], with 5,000 employees in 16 countries.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Some of the most striking and innovative works of contemporary architecture are art museums, which are often examples of sculptural architecture, and are the signature works of major architects. The Quadracci Pavilion of the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin was designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]]. Its structure includes a movable, wing-like ''[[brise soleil]]'' that opens up for a wingspan of {{convert|217|ft}} during the day, folding over the tall, arched structure at night or during bad weather.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|pages=108–111}}

The [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis (2005), was designed by the Swiss architects [[Herzog and de Meuron]], who designed the [[Tate Modern]] museum in London, and who won the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]], the most prestigious award in architecture, in 2001.  It updates and provides a contrast to the austere earlier [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] structure designed by [[Edward Larrabee Barnes]] by adding a five-story tower clad in panels of delicately sculpted gray aluminum, which change color with the changing light, connecting by a wide glass gallery leading to the older building. It also harmonizes with two stone churches opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/arts/design/an-expansion-gives-new-life-to-an-old-box.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|title=An Expansion gives new life to an old box|accessdate=December 23, 2016|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish-born American architect [[Daniel Libeskind]] (born 1946) is one of the most prolific of contemporary museum architects, He was an academic before he began designing buildings, and was one of the early proponents of the architectural theory of [[Deconstructivism (architecture)|Deconstructivism]]. The exterior of his [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Manchester, England]] (2002), has an exterior which resembles, depending upon the light and time of day, huge and broken pieces of earth or armor plates, and is said to symbolize the destruction of war. In 2006 Libeskind finished the Hamilton Building of the [[Denver Art Museum]] in Denver Colorado, composed of twenty sloping planes, none of them parallel or perpendicular, covered with 230,000 square feet of [[titanium]] panels. Inside, the walls of the galleries are all different, sloping and asymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.structuremag.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/D-Spotlight-Nov071.pdf|title=Spotlight: Denver Art Museum|work=Structure Magazine|date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libeskind completed another striking museum, the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada (2007), also known as "The Crystal", a building whose form, resembles a shattered crystal.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|page=392}} Libeskind's museums have been both admired and attacked by critics. While admiring many features of the Denver Art Museum, ''The New York Times''{{'}} architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote that "In a building of canted walls and asymmetrical rooms—tortured geometries generated purely by formal considerations — it is virtually impossible to enjoy the art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/12/arts/design/12libe.html|work=The New York Times|title=A Razor-Sharp Profile Cuts Into a Mile-High Cityscape|accessdate=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[De Young Museum]] in San Francisco was designed by the Swiss architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]]. It opened in 2005, replacing an older structure that was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1989. The new museum was designed to blend with the natural landscape of the park, and to resist strong earthquakes. The building can move up to three feet (91 centimeters) on [[ball-bearing]] sliding plates and viscous fluid dampers that absorb [[kinetic energy]].

The [[Zentrum Paul Klee]] by [[Renzo Piano]] is an art museum near Berne Switzerland located next to an autoroute in the Swiss countryside. The museum blends into the landscape by taking the form of three rolling hills, made of steel and glass. One building houses the gallery (which is almost entirely underground, to preserve the fragile drawings of Klee from the effects of sunlight) while the other two "hills" contain an education center and administrative offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zpk.org/en/service-navigation/about-us_0/architecture-107.html|title=Site of Zentrum Paul Klee (English)|accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centre Pompidou-Metz]], in [[Metz]], France, (2010), a branch of the [[Centre Pompidou]] museum of modern art in Paris, was designed by [[Shigeru Ban]], a Japanese architect who won the [[Pritzker Prize for Architecture]] in 2014. The roof is the most dramatic feature of the building; it is a {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}} wide hexagon with a surface area of {{convert|8,000|m2|abbr=on}}, composed of sixteen kilometres of [[glued laminated timber]], that intersect to form hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a Chinese hat. The roof's geometry is irregular, featuring curves and counter-curves over the entire building, and in particular the three exhibition galleries. The entire wooden structure is covered with a white fibreglass membrane and a coating of [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], which protects from direct sunlight, but allows light to pass through.

The [[Louis Vuitton Foundation]] by [[Frank Gehry]] (2014) is gallery of contemporary art located adjacent to the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris was opened in October 2014. Gehry described his architecture as inspired by the glass [[Grand Palais]] of the 1900 Paris Exposition and by the enormous glass greenhouses of the [[Jardin des Serres d'Auteuil]] near the park, built by [[Jean-Camille Formigé]] in 1894–95.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Moore (October 19, 2014), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/19/-sp-louis-vuitton-foundation-creation-paris-review-frank-gehry Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris review – everything and the bling from Frank Gehry] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Gehry had to work within strict height and volume restrictions, which required any part of the building over two stories to be made of glass. Because of the height limits, the building is low, sited in an artificial lake with water cascading beneath the building. The interior gallery structures are covered in a white fiber-reinforced concrete called Ductal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Goldberger]] (September 2014), [http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/09/frank-gehry-foundation-louis-vuitton-paris Gehry's Paris Coup] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar in concept to Gehry's [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], the building is wrapped in curving glass panels resembling sails inflated by the wind.

The new [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York City by [[Renzo Piano]] (2015) took a very different approach from the sculptural museums of Frank Gehry. The Whitney has an industrial-looking facade, and blends into the neighborhood.  Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the building a "mishmash of styles" but noted its similarity to Piano's [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris, in the way that it mixed with the public spaces around it. "Unlike so much big-name architecture," Kimmelman wrote, "it's not some weirdly shaped trophy building into which all the practical stuff of a working museum must be fitted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/19/arts/artsspecial/new-whitney-museum.html|title=A New Whitney|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] is actually two buildings by different architects fit together; an earlier (1995) five-story postmodernist structure by the Swiss architect [[Mario Botta]], to which has been joined a much larger ten-story white gallery by the Norwegian-based firm of [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]] (2016). The expanded building includes a green [[Green wall|living wall]] of native plants in San Francisco; a free ground-floor gallery with {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tall glass walls that will place art on view to passersby, and glass skylights that flood the upper floors of offices (though not the galleries) with light. The facades clad are with lightweight panels made of [[Fibre-Reinforced Plastic]]. The critical reaction to the building was mixed. Roberta Smith of ''The New York Times'' said the building set a new standard for museums, and wrote: "The new building’s rippling, sloping facade, rife with subtle curves and bulges, establishes a brilliant alternative to the straight-edged boxes of traditional modernism and the rebellion against them initiated by Frank Gehry, with his computer-inspired acrobatics."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta, "SFMoMA’s Expansion Sets a New Standard for Museums", ''The New York Times'', May 13, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the critic of ''The Guardian'' of London compared the facade of the building to "a gigantic meringue with a hint of Ikea."&lt;ref&gt;"SFMOMA's new extension – a gigantic meringue with a hint of Ikea", ''The Guardian'', April 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Santiago Calatrava]] designed the [[Auditorio de Tenerife]] he concert hall of [[Tenerife]], the major city of the Canary Islands. with a shell-like wing of reinforced concrete.
The shell touches the ground at only two points.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|pages=108–111}}

The [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in Los Angeles (2003) is one of the major works by California architect [[Frank Gehry]]  The exterior is stainless steel, formed like the sails of sailboats. The interior is in the [[Vineyard style]], with the audience surrounding the stage.  Gehry designed the dramatic array of pipes of the organ to complement the exterior style of the building.

The [[Casa da Musica]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, by the Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]] (2005) is unique among concert halls in having two walls made entirely of glass. Nicolai Ouroussoff, architecture critic from ''The New York Times'', wrote  "The building's chiseled concrete form, resting on a carpet of polished stone, suggests a bomb about to explode.  He declared that in its originality it was one of the most important concert halls built in the last 100 years". ranking with the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], in Los Angeles, and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]].&lt;ref&gt;

The interior of the [[Copenhagen Opera House]] by [[Henning Larsen]] (2005) has an oak floor and maple walls to enhance hat acoustics.  The royal box of the Queen, usually placed in the back, is next to stage.

The [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in Nashville, Tennessee, by [[David M. Schwarz]] &amp; Earl Swensson (2006), is an example of Neo-Classical architecture, borrowed literally from Roman and Greek models.  It complements another Nashville landmark, a full-scale replica of the [[Parthenon]].

The [[Philharmonie de Paris]] by French architect [[Jean Nouvel]] opened in 2015. The concert hall is at [[Parc de la Villette|La Villette]], in a park at the edge of Paris devoted to museums, a music school and other cultural institutions, where its unusual shape blends with the late 20th-century [[modern architecture]]. The exterior of the building takes the form of glittering irregular cliff cut by horizontal fins which reveal ar amp leading upwards The exterior is clad in thousands of small pieces of aluminum in three different colors, from white to gray to black.  A path leads up the ramp to the top of building to a terrace with a dramatic view of the peripheric highway around the city.  view of the neighborhood.  The hall, like the Disney Hall in Los Angeles, has Vineyard style seating, with the audience surrounding the main stage.  The seating can be re-arranged in different styles depending upon the type of music performed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/arts/international/philharmonie-de-paris-prepares-to-open-amid-controversy.html?_r=0 France's New Music Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; When it opened, the architectural critic of the London [[The Guardian|Guardian]] compared it to a space ship that had crash-landed on the outskirts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/15/philharmonie-de-paris-jean-nouvels-390m-spaceship-crash-lands-in-france|title=Philharmonie de Paris - Jean Nouvel's spaceship crashes in France|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elbphilharmonie]] concert hall in [[Hamburg]], Germany, by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], which was inaugurated in January, 2017,  is the tallest inhabited building in the city, with a height of 110 meters (360&amp;nbsp;ft). The glass concert hall, which has 2100 seats in Vineyard style, is perched atop a former warehouse. One side of the concert hall building contains a hotel, while the structure on the other side above the concert hall contains forty five apartments.  The concert hall in the middle is isolated from the sound of the other parts of the building by an "eggshell" of plaster and paper panels and insulation resembling feather pillows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finally, a Debut for the Elbphilharmonie Hall in Hamburg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/arts/music/elbphilharmonie-an-architectural-gift-to-gritty-hamburg-germany.html?_r=0 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new construction technology, the [[tube (structure)|framed tube structure]], was first developed in the United States in 1963 by structural engineer [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]] of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill|Skimore, Owings and Merrill]], which permitted the construction of super-tall buildings, which needed fewer interior walls, had more window space, and could better resist lateral forces, such as strong winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Advances in tall buildings |last1=Beedle |first1=Lynn S. |last2=Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat |year=1986 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Company |location= |isbn=978-0-442-21599-6 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary structure is reinforced concrete. Burj Khalifa was designed by [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], then of [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] (SOM). He also was lead architect on the [[Jin Mao Tower]], [[Pearl River Tower]], and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower]]

[[Adrian Smith]] and his own firm are the architects for the building which, in 2020, will replace the Burj-Khalifa as the tallest building in the world. The [[Jeddah Tower]] in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, is planned to be 1,008 meters, or (3,307&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, which will make it the tallest building in the world, and the first building to be more than one kilometer in height. Construction began in 2013, and the project is scheduled to be completed in 2020.&lt;ref name="constructionweekaugust13crown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-13537-crown-of-the-kingdom/|title=Crown of the Kingdom|author=Roberts, Ben|date=13 August 2011|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]], a new trade center was designed, with the main tower designed by [[David Childs]] of SOM. [[One World Trade Center]], opened in 2015, is 1,776 feet (541 m). tall, making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere.

In London, one of the most notable contemporary landmarks is [[30 St Mary Axe]], popularly known as "The Gherkin", designed by [[Norman Foster]] (2004). It replaced the [[London Millennium Tower]] a much taller project that Foster earlier had proposed for the same site, which would have been the tallest building in Europe, but was so tall that it interfered with the flight pattern for [[Heathrow Airport]]. The steel framework of the Gherkin is integrated into the glass facade, giving it the colorful appearance of an elongated Russian easter egg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3616020/Glory-of-the-Gherkin.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Giles |last=Worsley |title=Glory of the Gherkin |date=28 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tallest building in Moscow is the [[Mercury City Tower]] in [[Moscow]], designed by the American architect [[Frank Williams (architect)|Frank Williams]] with Mikhail Posokhin and Gennadiy Sirota. Completed in 2012, with a height 338 meters, it surpassed [[The Shard]] in London when it was built as the tallest building in Europe.

The tallest building in China as of 2015 is the [[Shanghai Tower]] by the U.S. architectural and design firm of [[Gensler]]. It is 632-meters (2,073&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, with 127 floors, making it in 2016 the second-tallest building in the world. It also features the fastest elevators, which reach a speed of 20.5 meters (40 feet) per second or 74 kilometers an hour.&lt;ref name="Inhabitat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/the-worlds-fastest-elevator-is-quicker-than-track-legend-usain-bolt/|title=The world's fastest elevator}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNElevators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/asia/worlds-fastest-tower/|title=China unveils world's fastest elevator|publisher=CNN|date=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most skyscrapers are designed to express modernity; the most notable exception is the [[Abraj Al Bait]], a complex of seven skyscraper hotels build by the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] to house pilgrims coming the holy shrine of [[Mecca]]. The centerpiece of the group is the Makkah Palace Clock Tower Hotel, with a gothic revival tower; it was the fourth-tallest building in the world in 2016, 581.1 meters (1,906 feet) high.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A tendency in contemporary residential architecture, particularly in the rebuilding of older neighborhoods in large cities, is the luxury condominium tower, with very expensive apartments for sale designed by "starchitects", that is, internationally famous architects. These buildings frequently have little relationship with the architecture of their neighborhood, but stand like signature works of their architects.

[[Daniel Libeskind]] (born 1946), was born in Poland and studied, taught and practiced architecture in the United States. In 2016 he was professor of architecture at [[UCLA]] in Los Angeles, He is known as much for his writings as his architecture; he was a founder of the movement called [[Deconstructivism (architecture)|Deconstructivism]]. Best known for his museums, he also constructed a notable complex of residential apartment buildings in [[Singapore]] (2011) and [[The Ascent at Roebling's Bridge]] a 22-story apartment building in [[Covington, Kentucky]] (2008). The name of the latter is taken from the [[Roebling Suspension Bridge]] nearby on the [[Ohio River]], but the structure of the building of luxury condominiums is extremely contemporary, sloping upward like the bridge cables to a peak, with a sharp edge and leaning slightly outward as the building rises.

One cheerful feature of contemporary residential architecture is color; [[Bernard Tschumi]] uses colored ceramic tiles on facades as well as unusual forms to make his buildings stand out. One example is the [[Blue Condominium]] in [[New York City]] (2007).{{Sfn|De Bure|2015|page=208}}

Another contemporary tendency is the conversion of industrial buildings into mixed residential communities. An example is the [[Gasometer, Vienna|Gasometer]] in Vienna, a group of four massive brick gas production towers constructed at the end of the 19th century. They have been transformed into a mixed residential, office and commercial complex, completed between 1999 and 2001. Some residences are located inside the towers, and others are in new buildings attached to them. The upper floors are devoted to housing units the middle floors to offices, and the ground floors to entertainment and shopping malls. with sky bridges connecting the shopping mall levels. Each tower was built by a prominent architect the participants were [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], Manfred Wehldorn and [[Wilhelm Holzbauer]]. The historic exterior walls of the towers were preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiener-gasometer.at/en/gasometer |title=The Architecture of the Gasometers |website=Wiener-gasometer.at |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Isbjerget]], Danish for "iceberg", in [[Aarhus]], Denmark (2013), is a group of four buildings with 210 apartments, both rented and owned, for residents with a range of incomes, located on the waterfront of a former industrial port in Denmark. The complex was designed by the Danish firms [[CEBRA]] and [[JDS Architects]], French architect Louis Paillard and the Dutch firm SeARCH, and was financed by the Danish pension fund. The buildings are designed so that all the units, even those in the back, have a view of sea. The design and color of the buildings is inspired by [[icebergs]]. The buildings are clad in white [[terrazzo]] and have balconies made of blue glass.

Surprisingly few contemporary churches were built between 2000 and 2017.  Church architects, with a few exceptions,  rarely showed the same freedom of expression as architects of museums, concert halls and other large buildings. The new cathedral for the City of [[Los Angeles]] California, was designed in a postmodern style by the Spanish architect [[Rafael Moneo]].  The previous cathedral had been serious damaged by an earthquake in 1995;  The new building was specially designed to resist similar shocks.

The [[Northern Lights Cathedral]], by the Denmark-based international firm of [[schmidt hammer lassen|Schmidt, Hammer and Lassen]], is located in [[Alta, Norway]], one of northernmost cities in the world.  Their other important works include the [[National Library of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]].

The [[Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir]] is a [[Hindu Temple]] in Vrindivan, in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state in India, which was under construction at the end of 2016. The architects are InGenious Studio Pvt. Ltd. of [[Gurgaon]] and Quintessence Design Studio of [[Noida]], in India,  The entrance is in the traditional Nagara style of Indian architecture, while the tower is contemporary, with a glass facade up to the 70th floor.  It is scheduled for completion in 2019. When completed, at 700 feet (213 meters or 70 floors) it will be the tallest religious structure in the world.

One of the most unusual contemporary churches is [[St. Jude's Cathedral (Iqaluit)|St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral]] in [[Iqaluit]], the capital of [[Nunavut]], the northernmost and least populous region of Canada.  The church is built in the shape of an [[igloo]], and serves the [[Inuktitut]]-speaking population of the region.

Anothet unusual contemporary church is the [[Cardboard Cathedral]] in [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]] designed by Japanese architect [[Shigeru Ban]].  It replaced the city's main cathedral, damaged by the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].  The cathedral, which seats seven hundred persons, rises {{convert|21|m}} above the [[altar]].

The Swiss architects [[Jacques Herzog]] and [[Pierre de Meuron]] designed the [[Allianz Arena]] in Munich, Germany, completed in 2005. It seats 75,000 spectators. The structure is wrapped in 2,874 [[ETFE]]-foil air panels that are kept inflated with dry air; each panel can be independently illuminated red, white, or blue. When illuminated, the stadium is visible from the Austrian Alps, fifty miles (80 kilometers) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allianz-arena.de/en/fakten/detaillierte-zahlen/ |title=Nuts and bolts |publisher=allianz-arena.de |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most prestigious projects and best-known projects in contemporary architecture are the stadiums for the [[Olympic Games]], whose architects are chosen by highly publicized international competitions. The [[Beijing National Stadium]], built for the 2008 Games and popularly known as the Bird's Nest because of its intricate exterior framework, was designed by the Swiss firm of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], with Chinese architect [[Li Xinggang]]. It was designed to seat 91,000 spectators, and when constructed had a retractable roof, since removed. Like many contemporary buildings, it is actually two structures; a concrete bowl in which the spectators sit, surrounded at distance of fifty feet by a glass and steel steel framework. The exterior "Bird's nest" design was inspired by the pattern of Chinese ceramics. The stadium when completed was the largest enclosed space in the world, and was also the largest steel structure, with 26 kilometers of unwrapped steel.&lt;ref&gt;Filler, Martin, ''Makers of Modern Architecture'', Volume 1, New York: The New York Review of Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-59017-227-8}}, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designbuild-network.com/projects/national_stadium/|title=designbuild network - Beijing National Stadium|accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Stadium (Kaohsiung)|National Stadium]] in [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]] by Japanese architect [[Toyo Ito]] (2009), is the form of a dragon. Its other distinctive feature is the array of solar panels that cover almost all of the exterior, providing most of the energy needed by the complex.

Government buildings, once almost universally serious and sober looking, usually in variations of the school of [[neoclassical architecture]], began to appear in more sculptural and even whimsical forms.  One of the most dramatic examples was the [[London City Hall]] by [[Norman Foster]] (2002), the headquarters of the [[Greater London Authority]]. The unusual egg-like building design was intended to reduce the amount of exposed wall and to save energy, though the results have not entirely met expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/oct/02/energyefficiency.carbonemissions?intcmp=239#/?picture=338198107&amp;index=5|title=Public building CO2 footprints revealed|author=Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images|work=the Guardian|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unusual feature is a helical stairway that spirals from the lobby up to the top of the building.

Some new government buildings, such as the [[Parliament House (Malta)|Parliament House]], Valletta, Malta by [[Renzo Piano]] (2015) created controversy because of the contrast between their style and the historic architecture around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title=Maltese anger at plans to rebuild Valletta|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/malta/7697046/Maltese-anger-at-plans-to-rebuild-Valletta.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=8 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150831182115/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/malta/7697046/Maltese-anger-at-plans-to-rebuild-Valletta.html|archivedate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness; an exception is the Port Authority (''Havenhuis'') in [[Antwerp, Belgium]] by [[Zaha Hadid]] (2016), where a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The faceted glass structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp's role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It was one of the last works of Hadid, who died in 2016.

The [[Dr Chau Chak Wing Building]] is a Business School building of the University of Technology Sydney in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, designed by [[Frank Gehry]] and completed in 2015.  It is the first building in Australia designed by Gehry. The building's façade, made of 320,000 custom designed bricks, was described by one critic as the "squashed brown paper bag". Frank Gehry responded, "Maybe it's a brown paper bag, but it's flexible on the inside, there's a lot of room for changes or movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11386370/Frank-Gehry-unveils-squashed-brown-paper-bag-building-in-Sydney.html|title=Frank Gehry unveils 'squashed brown paper bag' building in Sydney|author=Jonathan Pearlman|accessdate=19 May 2015|date=3 February 2015 |work=The Telegraph  |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Siamese Twins Towers" at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] in [[Santiago, Chile]] are by the Chilean architect [[Alejandro Aravena]] (born 1967), completed in 2013.  Aravena was the winner of the 2016 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] in Alexandria, Egypt, by the Norwegian firm of [[Snøhetta (company)|Snøhetta]]  (2002), attempts to recreate, in modern form, the famous Alexandria Library of antiquity. The building, by the edge of the Mediterranean, has shelf space for eight million books,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/mediterranean-coast/alexandria/sights/museums-galleries/bibliotheca-alexandrina|title=Bibliotheca Alexandrina - Lonely Planet|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=Lonely Planet|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a main reading room covering {{convert|20000|m2}} on eleven cascading levels. plus galleries for expositions and a planetarium. The main reading room is covered by a 32-meter-high [[glass]]-panelled [[roof]], tilted out toward the sea like a [[sundial]], and measuring some 160 m in diameter. The walls are of gray [[Aswan]] [[granite]], carved with [[grapheme|character]]s from 120 different human [[writing system|script]]s.

The [[Seattle Central Library]] by Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]] (2006) features a glass and steel wrapping around a stack of platforms.  One unusual feature is a ramp with continuous bookshelves spiraling upward four floors.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The shopping malls are the elephants of commercial architecture, massive structures which combine retail stores, food outlets, and entertainment under a single roof. The largest in area (though not in retail space, since much of the mall is devoted to entertainment and public space) and perhaps most extravagant is the [[Dubai Mall]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], designed by [[DP Architects]] of Singapore and opened in  (2008),   which features, in addition to shops and restaurants, a gigantic walk-through aquarium and underwater zoo, plus a huge ice skating rink, and, just outside, the highest fountain and tallest building in the world.

In competition with shopping malls are downtown department stores and shops of individual designer brands.  These buildings are traditionally designed to attract attention and to express the modernity of the products they sell.  A notable example is the [[Selfridges Building, Birmingham|Selfridge's Department Store]]  in Birmingham, England, a department store designed by the firm of [[Future Systems]], founded in 1979 by [[Jan Kaplicky]] (1937–2009).  The department store exterior is composed of undulating concrete in convex and concave forms, entirely covered with gleaming blue and white ceramic tiles.{{Sfn|Taschen|2016|pages=210–211}}

Designer brand shops try make their logo visible and to set themselves apart from department stores.  One notable example is the [[Louis Vuitton]] store in the [[Ginza]] district of Tokyo,  with a new facade designed by Japanese studio of Jun Aoki and Associates with a patterned and perforated shell based on the brand's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/555735/louis-vuitton-matsuya-ginza-facade-renewal-jun-aoki-and-associates|title=Louis Vuitton Matsuya Ginza Facade Renewal by Jun Aoki and Associates, ''ArchDaily'', October 14, 2014|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Beijing Capital International Airport]] has been one of the fast-growing airports in the world. The new Terminal Three was designed by [[Norman Foster]] to handle the increased number of passengers coming for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The terminal is the second largest in the world, after the Dulles Airport terminal near Washington, DC, and in 2008 was the sixth largest building in the world. The flat-roofed building looks like part of the runway from above.

The [[World Trade Center Transportation Hub]] is a station constructed beneath fountain and plaza honoring the victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks in 2001 in New York City, It was designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]] and opened in 2016. The above-ground structure, called the Oculus, has been compared to a bird about to take flight, and leads passengers down to the train station below the plaza. Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of ''The New York Times'' praised the soaring upward view inside the Oculus, but condemned what he called the buildings cost (the most expensive railroad station ever built) "scale, monotony of materials and color, preening formalism and disregard for the gritty urban fabric."&lt;ref&gt;"Santiago Calatrava's Transit Hub Is a Soaring Symbol of a Boondoggle", review by Michael Kimmelman, ''The New York Times'', March 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the most prominent contemporary architects, including [[Norman Foster]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Zaha Hadid]], have turned their attention to designing bridges. One of the most remarkable examples of contemporary architecture and engineering is the [[Millau Viaduct]] in southern France, designed by architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] and structural engineer [[Michel Virlogeux]]. The Millau Viaduct crosses the valley of the [[River Tarn]] and is part of the A75-A71 autoroute axis from [[Paris]] to [[Béziers]] and [[Montpellier]]. It was formally inaugurated on 14 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leviaducdemillau.com/en_index.php#/construction-du-Viaduc/ |title=Millau Viaduct – official website – Home |publisher=Leviaducdemillau.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[List of tallest bridges in the world|tallest bridge in the world]] with one mast's summit at {{convert|343.0|m|0}} above the base of the structure.&lt;ref name=pressrel&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/world/high-suspense-mexico-lands-bridge-record-20120106-1pog5.html Bridge claims record], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/0,1518,807525,00.html Spiegel Online (In German)] 'Es ist noch nicht fertig'&lt;/ref&gt;

The British-Iraqi architect [[Zaha Hadid]] constructed the [[Bridge Pavilion]] in [[Zaragoza]]. Spain for an international exposition there in 2008. The bridge, which also served as an exposition hall, is constructed of concrete reinforced with an external layer of [[fiberglass]] in different shades of gray. Since the event closed, the bridge has been used to host expositions and shows.

Some smaller new bridges also offer simple but very innovative designs. The [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England, (2004) designed by [[Michel Virlogeux]], to enable pedestrians and cyclists to cross the [[Tyne River]], tilts to one side to permit boats to pass beneath.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
A growing tendency in the 21st century is [[eco-architecture]], also termed [[sustainable architecture]];  buildings with features which conserve heat and energy, and sometimes produce their own energy through solar cells and windmills, and use solar heat to generate [[solar hot water]].  They also may be built with their own [[wastewater]] treatment and sometimes [[rainwater harvesting]]  Some buildings integrate gardens [[green walls]] and [[green roofs]] into their structures.  Other features of eco-architecture include the use of wood and recycled materials.  There are several [[green building]] certification programs, the best-known of which is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]], or LEED rating, which measure the environmental impact of buildings.

Many urban skyscrapers such as [[30 Saint Mary Axe]] in London use a double skin of glass to conserve energy. The double skin and curved shape of the building creates differences in air pressure which help keep the building cooler in summer and warmer in winter, reducing the need for air conditioning.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=210}}

[[BedZED]], designed by British architect [[Bill Dunster]], is an entire community of eighty-two homes in [[Hackbridge]], near London, built according to eco-architecture principles.  Houses face south to take advantage of sunlight and have triple-glazed windows for insulation,  a significant portion of energy is comes from solar panels, rainwater is collected and reused, and automobiles are discouraged. BedZED successfully reduced electricity usage by 45 percent and hot water usage by 81 percent of the borough average in 2010, though a successful system for producing heat by burning wood chips proved elusive and difficult.&lt;ref name="BDR revisit 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kucharek|first=Jan-Carlos|title=Bedding in nicely: BedZed was the ultimate sustainability trailblazer. Nearly a decade on, it may be thriving but it remains an anomaly|work=BD Reviews: Sustainability (supplement to Building Design)|date=23 July 2010|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CaixaForum Madrid]] is a museum and cultural center in Paseo del Prado 36, Madrid, by the Swiss architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], built between 2001 and 2007, is an example of both green architecture and recycling.  The main structure is an abandoned brick electric power station, with new floors constructed on top.  The new floors are encased in oxidized cast iron, which has a rusty red color as the brick of the old power station below it. The building next to it features a [[green wall]] designed by French botanist [[Patrick Blanc]]. The red of the top floors contrasts with the plants on the wall, while the green wall harmonizes with the botanical garden next door to the cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/features/herzog--de-meuron/caixa-forum/|title=Review of CaixaForum Madrid by Herzog and de Meuron in ArcSpace.com, March 31, 2008|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual materials are sometimes recycled for use in eco-architecture; they include denim from old blue jeans for insulation, and panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, [[flax]], [[sisal]], or [[coconut]], and particularly fast-growing [[bamboo]]. Lumber and stone from demolished buildings are often reclaimed and reused for flooring, while hardware, windows and other details from older buildings are reused.

The '''''Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae''''' ([[Latin]]: ''[[text corpus|Corpus]] of Byzantine history writers''), frequently referred to as the '''CSHB''' or '''Bonn Corpus''', is a monumental fifty-volume series of [[primary sources]] for the study of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] history (c. 330–1453), published in the German city of [[Bonn]] between 1828 and 1897. Each volume contains a [[text criticism|critical edition]] of a [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] historical text, accompanied by a parallel Latin translation. The project, conceived by the historian [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]], sought to revise and expand the original twenty-four volume ''Corpus Byzantinae Historiae'' (sometimes called the ''Byzantine du Louvre''), &lt;ref name&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lifelettersofbar00nieb ''The Life and Letters of Barthold George Niebuhr''], ed. K. J. Bunsen, with J. Brandis and J. W. Lorbell (New York: Harper, 1854) p. 483, and letter 364 (pp. 501-502), addressed to [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny|Savigny]], dated 29 April 1827: "You will have heard of the edition of the Byzantine historians, which I am superintending. It is a great delight to me to be able thus to infuse some life into our literary doings; to give employment to young philologists; to give extension, activity, and perfection to typography; to contribute my mite [''sic''] to the increase of general prosperity...."&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Paris]] between 1648 and 1711 under the initial direction of the [[Jesuit]] scholar [[Philippe Labbe]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Omont, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nyEMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=philippe+labbe+byzance+du+louvre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5siRwr5HuN&amp;sig=jisLllTg1AhrOZbx_tffsIENaNg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W3CnVNKJF8_qgwTkt4HgCQ&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "La collection byzantine de Labbe et le projet de J. M. Suarès"], ''Revue des études grecques'' 17 (1904), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The series was first based at the [[University of Bonn]]; after Niebuhr's death in 1831, however, oversight of the project passed to his collaborator [[August Immanuel Bekker|Immanuel Bekker]] at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Reinsch [https://books.google.com/books?id=M-SrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA435&amp;lpg=PA435&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The History of Editing Byzantine Historiographical Texts"], in ''The Byzantine World'', ed. P. Stephenson (New York: Routledge, 2010), p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

While the first volume of the series was praised for its "minute care and attention" to textual details,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QGYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA574&amp;lpg=PA574&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Niebuhr's Edition of the Byzantine Historians"] ''The Foreign Review'' 1 (1828), p. 575. However, the anonymous reviewer does criticize Niebuhr for standardizing of Byzantine orthography along Classical lines&lt;/ref&gt; later volumes produced under Bekker became infamous for their frequent misprints, careless execution, and general unreliability.&lt;ref&gt;Reinsch, ''op. cit.'', reports that [[August Heisenberg]], professor of Byzantine literature at Munich, once said of Bekker that he "must have revised the texts 'lying on the sofa with the cigar in his mouth.'" J. B. Bury was even harsher in his assessment, calling the CSHB "the most lamentably feeble production ever given to the world by German scholars of great reputation." See: ''idem'' [https://archive.org/details/historyofdecl01gibb "Introduction"], to [[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', vol. 1, ed. J. B. Bury (London: Meuthen, 1897), p. xlix.&lt;/ref&gt; Given these shortcomings, the [[International Association of Byzantine Studies]] established in 1966 the ''[[Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae]]'' to re-edit many of the texts included in the Bonn edition of the CSHB.

'''''Deconstructing Harry''''' is a 1997 [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Woody Allen]]. This film tells the story of a successful writer named Harry Block, played by Allen, who draws inspiration from people he knows in real life, and from events that happened to him, sometimes causing these people to become alienated from him as a result.

The central plot features Block driving to a university from which he was once thrown out, in order to receive an honorary degree. Three passengers accompany him on the journey: a prostitute, a friend, and his son, whom he has kidnapped from his ex-wife. However, there are many [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, segments taken from Block's writing, and interactions with his own fictional characters. ''Deconstructing Harry'' received moderately positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
One night, Lucy ([[Judy Davis]]) gets a taxi to the home of author Harry Block ([[Woody Allen]]). She has just read Harry's latest novel. In the novel, the character Leslie ([[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]]) is having an affair with her sister's husband Ken ([[Richard Benjamin]]). Lucy is angry because the novel is patently based on her and Harry's own affair; as a result, everyone knows about it. Lucy pulls a gun out of her purse, saying she will kill herself. She then turns the gun on Harry and begins firing. She chases him out onto the roof. Harry insists that he has already been punished: his latest girlfriend Fay ([[Elisabeth Shue]]) has left him for his best friend Larry ([[Billy Crystal]]). To distract Lucy, Harry tells her a story he is currently writing: a semi-autobiographical story of a sex-obsessed young man named Harvey ([[Tobey Maguire]]) who is mistakenly claimed by Death.

In therapy, Harry realizes he has not changed since he was a sex-obsessed youth. Harry discusses the honoring ceremony at his old university, taking place the next day; he is particularly unhappy that he has nobody with whom to share the occasion. After the session, Harry asks his ex-wife Joan ([[Kirstie Alley]]) if he can take their son Hilliard ([[Eric Lloyd]]) to the ceremony. She refuses, stating that Harry is a bad influence on Hilliard. She is also furious at Harry for the novel he wrote. In it, the character Epstein ([[Stanley Tucci]]) marries Helen ([[Demi Moore]]), but the marriage begins to crumble after the birth of their son.

Harry runs into an acquaintance, Richard ([[Bob Balaban]]), who is worried about his health. After accompanying Richard to the hospital, Harry asks him to come to the university ceremony. Richard appears uninterested.  Harry then goes to meet his ex-girlfriend Fay, who reveals that she is now engaged. Harry begs Fay to get back together with him. He asks Fay to accompany him to his ceremony, but it clashes with Fay's wedding, scheduled the following day.

That night, Harry sleeps with a prostitute, Cookie ([[Hazelle Goodman]]). Harry then asks Cookie to accompany him to his ceremony.

In the morning, Richard unexpectedly arrives to join Harry and Cookie on the journey. On a whim, Harry decides to "kidnap" his son Hilliard. Along the way, they stop at a carnival, then at Harry's half-sister Doris's ([[Caroline Aaron]]). Doris, a devoted [[Jew]], is upset by Harry's portrayals of Judaism in his stories, as is her husband ([[Eric Bogosian]]). During the journey, Harry also encounters his fictional creations Ken and Helen, who force him to confront some painful truths about his life. Just before arriving at the university, Richard dies peacefully in the car.

Distressed, Harry literally slides out of focus, becoming blurred like one of his own fictional characters. Cookie helps him restore focus. The university's staffers gush over Harry, asking what he plans to write next. He describes a story about a man (based on himself) who journeys down to Hell to reclaim his true love (based on Fay) from [[the Devil]] (based on Larry - both being played by Billy Crystal).  Harry and the Devil engage in a verbal duel as to who is truly the more evil of the two.  Harry gets as far as arguing that he is a kidnapper before the story is interrupted by the arrival of the police.  Harry is arrested for kidnapping Hilliard, for possessing a gun (it was Lucy's), and for having drugs in the car (belonging to Cookie).

Larry and Fay come from their wedding to bail Harry out of jail. Harry reluctantly gives them his blessings. Back at his apartment, a miserable Harry fantasizes that the university's ceremony is taking place. Harry realizes that he can only function in art, not in life. The film ends with Harry returning to his writing.

==Reception==
''Deconstructing Harry'' garnered 71% approval on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deconstructing_harry/|title=Deconstructing Harry (1997)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 61 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deconstructing-harry|title=Deconstructing Harry Reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and nominations==
[[Woody Allen]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for ''Deconstructing Harry''. The film was also nominated for a [[Satellite Awards|Golden Satellite Award]] for Best Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical.

==Influences==
The film is a general reworking of his earlier 1980 film ''[[Stardust Memories]]'', which also had an artist go to a ceremony in his honor, while reminiscing over past relationships and trying to fix and stabilize current ones.&lt;ref name="desser"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Jewish Filmmakers|page=105|author1-last=Desser|author1-first=David|author2-last=Friedman|author2-first=Lester D.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=2003|edition=2|isbn=978-0-252-07153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen is  an admirer of several European directors whose primary body of work was completed sometimes decades before his first script, and his films in particular often draw upon the works of [[Ingmar Bergman]] and [[Federico Fellini]].  The rough outline of the plot of ''Deconstructing Harry'', that of an academic on a long drive to receive an honorary award from his old university while reflecting upon his life's experiences, essentially mirrors that of Bergman's ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]''.&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971224/REVIEWS/712240301/1023 |title=Deconstructing Harry :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 1997-12-24|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the film is similar to Fellini's ''[[8½]]'', in that it is about an artist struggling with his current relationships and remembering his old ones, interspersed with dream sequences, as well as his work being based on events from his life.

It is acknowledged by some critics that Allen based the name of Harry Block on Antonius Block ([[Max von Sydow]]), the protagonist from Bergman's ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''.&lt;ref name="desser"/&gt; Some critics, including [[Roger Ebert]], have suggested that the character of Harry Block is based on real-life author [[Philip Roth]] and not on Allen himself.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;

'''floorless''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] art collective based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[London]], who united in the year 2000 and are working in the boundaries between [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]] and [[Graphic design|design]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigeon Magazine no. 2, Toilet Papir Publications 2, Copenhagen 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Besides exhibiting and curating they have [[Self-publishing|self-published]] different magazines, most notably ''T6'' and ''In The Red #1'' &amp; ''#2'' which have contributions from a host of other artists, writers and musicians as well as floorless. They have exhibited in Copenhagen, [[Aarhus]], [[Odense]], [[Lemvig]], London and [[Barcelona]] since 2003, but are currently on some sort of hiatus. Most of the artwork produced by floorless has been [[Guerrilla communication|interventionist]] or radical in a non-dogmatic [[Left communism|leftist]] political sense and has had connections to [[youth subculture]] as well as the [[avant-garde]] art-scene. In graphic design, writings, [[Installation art|installation]] and curatorial initiatives their artistic expression shows a [[DIY ethic]] closer to contemporary [[street art]] than to more conventional gallery art.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Breakdown - Sound art in Copenhagen, AUX, Mediefabrikken, Copenhagen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''In The Red #3'' is expected any time between [[Present (time)|now]] and the [[future]].

'''George Catlin''' (July 26, 1796 – December 23, 1872) was an American painter, author, and traveler, who specialized in portraits of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in the [[Old West]]. Travelling to the [[Western United States|American West]] five times during the 1830s, Catlin was the first white man to depict [[Plains Indians]] in their native territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catlin Virtual Exhibition|url=http://americanart.si.edu/catlin/highlights.html|publisher=Smithsonian American Art Museum|accessdate=28 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925200850/http://americanart.si.edu/catlin/highlights.html|archivedate=25 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

===Early years===
[[File:BuffaloHarborFromTheVillage.jpg|thumb|upright|right|George Catlin lithograph of Buffalo Harbor, 1825]]

George Catlin was born in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]]. As a child growing up in Pennsylvania, Catlin had spent many hours hunting, fishing, and looking for American Indian artifacts. His fascination with Native Americans was kindled by his mother, who told him stories of the western frontier and how she was captured by a tribe when she was a young girl. Years later, a group of Native Americans came through [[Philadelphia]] dressed in their colorful outfits and made quite an impression on Catlin.

==Career==
[[File:Self-portrait by George Catlin. Age 28.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait by George Catlin. Age 28]]
His early work included engravings, drawn from nature, of sites along the route of the [[Erie Canal]] in New York State. Several of his renderings were published in one of the first printed books to use lithography, [[Cadwallader D. Colden]]'s ''Memoir, Prepared at the Request of a Committee of the Common Council of the City of New York, and Presented to the Mayor of the City, at the Celebration of the Completion of the New York Canals'', published in 1825, with early images of the [[Buffalo, New York|City of Buffalo]].

Following a brief career as an attorney, Catlin produced two major collections of paintings of American Indians and published a series of books chronicling his travels among the native peoples of North, Central, and South America. Spurred by relics brought back by the famous [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804&amp;ndash;1806 owned by his friend, [[Charles Willson Peale]], and claiming his interest in America’s 'vanishing race', sparked by a visiting American Indian delegation in Philadelphia, he set out to record the appearance and customs of America’s native peoples.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===William Clark===
[[File:George Catlin's travels in North America, 1830-1855.jpg|thumb|George Catlin's travels in North America, 1830–1855]]
[[File:George Catlin - Buffalo Bulls Back Fat - Smithsonian.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of Stu-mick-o-súcks ([[Buffalo Bull's Back Fat]]), a Blood chief, considered to be Catlin's finest work]]

Catlin began his journey in 1830 when he accompanied General [[William Clark]] on a diplomatic mission up the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] territory. [[St. Louis]] became Catlin’s base of operations for five trips he took between 1830 and 1836, eventually visiting fifty tribes. Two years later he ascended the [[Missouri River]] more than 3000&amp;nbsp;km to [[Fort Union (North Dakota)|Fort Union]] Trading Post, near what is now the North Dakota-Montana border, where he spent several weeks among indigenous people who were still relatively untouched by European culture. He visited eighteen tribes, including the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], and [[Ponca]] in the south and the [[Mandan]], [[Hidatsa]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Assiniboine]], and [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]] to the north. There he produced the most vivid and penetrating portraits of his career. During later trips along the [[Arkansas]], [[Red River of the South|Red]], and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers, as well as visits to [[Florida]] and the [[Great Lakes]], he produced more than 500 paintings and gathered a substantial collection of artifacts.

===Indian Gallery===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:George Catlin - Sha-có-pay, The Six, Chief of the Plains Ojibwa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Sha-có-pay]]'', a Plains [[Ojibwe]] chief. Painted at [[Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site|Fort Union]], 1832]]

When Catlin returned east in 1838, he assembled the paintings and numerous artifacts into his Indian Gallery, and began delivering public lectures that drew on his personal recollections of life among the American Indians. Catlin traveled with his Indian Gallery to major cities such as [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cincinnati]], and New York. He hung his paintings "salon style"—side by side and one above another. Visitors identified each painting by the number on the frame, as listed in Catlin's catalogue. Soon afterward, he began a lifelong effort to sell his collection to the U.S. government. The touring Indian Gallery did not attract the paying public Catlin needed to stay financially sound, and the [[United States Congress]] rejected his initial petition to purchase the works.

In 1839 Catlin took his collection across the Atlantic for a tour of European capitals. As a showman and [[entrepreneur]], he initially attracted crowds to his Indian Gallery in London, Brussels, and Paris. The French critic [[Charles Baudelaire]] remarked on Catlin’s paintings, "He has brought back alive the proud and free characters of these chiefs, both their nobility and manliness."&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, ''The Red Man's Bones'', p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Catlin wanted to sell his Indian Gallery to the U.S. government to have his life’s work preserved intact. His continued attempts to persuade various officials in Washington, D.C. to buy the collection failed. In 1852 he was forced to sell the original Indian Gallery, now 607 paintings, due to personal debts. The industrialist Joseph Harrison acquired the paintings and artifacts, which he stored in a factory in Philadelphia, as security.

Catlin spent the last 20 years of his life trying to re-create his collection, and recreated more than 400 paintings.&lt;ref name = "smithsonianamericanartmuseum"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This second collection of paintings is known as the "Cartoon Collection," since the works are based on the outlines he drew of the works from the 1830s.

In 1841 Catlin published ''Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American Indians'', in two volumes, with approximately 300 engravings. Three years later he published 25 plates, entitled ''Catlin’s North American Indian Portfolio,'' and, in 1848, ''Eight Years' Travels and Residence in Europe''. From 1852 to 1857 he traveled through South and Central America and later returned for further exploration in the Far West. The record of these later years is contained in ''Last Rambles amongst the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes'' (1868) and ''My Life among the Indians'' (ed. by N. G. Humphreys, 1909). Paintings of his Spanish American Indians are published.&lt;ref&gt;''South American Indian paintings by George Catlin''. Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, Catlin traveled to Washington, D.C. at the invitation of [[Joseph Henry]], the first secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]. Until his death later that year in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], Catlin worked in a studio in the Smithsonian "Castle." In 1879 Harrison’s widow donated the original Indian Gallery, more than 500 works, along with related artifacts, to the Smithsonian.

The nearly complete surviving set of Catlin's first Indian Gallery, painted in the 1830s, is now part of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]'s collection. The associated Catlin artifacts are in the collections of the Department of Anthropology, [[National Museum of Natural History]], [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]. Some 700 sketches are held by the [[American Museum of Natural History]], New York City. Some artifacts from Catlin are in the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] collections. The [[Huntington Library]] in San Marino, California also holds 239 of Catlin's illustrations of both North and South American Indians, as well as other illustrative and manuscript material by Catlin.

The accuracy of some of Catlin's observations has been questioned. He claimed to be the first white man to see the [[Pipestone National Monument|Minnesota pipestone quarries]], and pipestone was named [[catlinite]]. Catlin exaggerated various features of the site, and his boastful account of his visit aroused his critics, who disputed his claim of being the first white man to investigate the quarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/catlin/catlin_highlights2.cfm?StartRow=24|title=SAAM: George Catlin and His Indian Gallery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous recorded white visitors include the [[Médard des Groseilliers|Groselliers]] and [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]], Father [[Louis Hennepin]], Baron LaHonton, and others. [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] noted the pipestone quarry in their journals in 1805. The fur trader [[Philander Prescott]] had written another account of the area in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/pipestone/history.htm|title=Pipestone County History -- National Register of Historic Places Pipestone, Minnesota Travel Itinerary|website=www.nps.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===

Catlin appears to have written an eccentric book, which was in an eighth edition by 1882, entitled ''Shut Your Mouth''. This is a serious essay suggesting that all manner of ills arise in people who were slack jawed, people who do not routinely keep their mouths closed. The title page of the eighth edition says "by George Catlin, author of 'Notes of Travels Amongst the North-American Indians' Etc., Etc." A facsimile of a signature appears on the book's last page.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In it, the author claims that even too much talking is harmful because of the mouth being open for the purpose. "There is no person in society but who will find... improvement in health and enjoyment..." from keeping his or her mouth shut.&lt;ref&gt;p. 86, Catlin, George: ''Keep Your Mouth Shut'', eighth edition, 1882, Trubner &amp; Co., London&lt;/ref&gt; The work runs to 102 pages. He signs a note at the end of the eighth edition "The Author, Rio Grande, Brazil, 1860".

==Family==
[[File:Clara Bartlett Gregory Catlin, by George Linen (1802-1888).jpg|thumb|George Linen, ''Clara Bartlett Gregory Catlin,'' ca. 1840]]
George Catlin met Clara Bartlett Gregory in 1828 in her hometown of [[Albany, New York]]. After their marriage, she accompanied him on one of his journeys west. They eventually had four children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceviews.com/historical/georgecatlin.html ScienceViews] George Catlin: A Biography.

Many historians and descendants believe George Catlin had two families; his acknowledged family on the east coast of the United States, but also a family farther west, started with a Native American woman.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==In fiction==
[[Larry McMurtry]] includes Catlin as a character in his ''The Berrybender Narratives'' series of novels. 
In the historical novel ''The Children of First Man'', [[James Alexander Thom]] recreates the time Catlin spent with the Mandan people. The 1970 film ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' cites Catlin's work as one of the sources for its depiction of [[Lakota Sioux]] culture.
Catlin and his work figure repeatedly in the 2010 novel ''Shadow Tag'' by [[Louise Erdrich]], where he is the subject of the unfinished doctoral dissertation of character Irene America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-02-07/books/17847885_1_louise-erdrich-gil-american-indians|title='Shadow Tag,' by Louise Erdrich|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hogarth Club''' was an exhibition society of artists, based at 84 Charlotte Street, [[Fitzrovia]], London, UK, which existed between 1858 and 1861. It was founded by former members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] after the original PRB had been dissolved. It was envisaged that the club would provide an alternative meeting space and exhibition venue to overcome prejudice against the Pre-Raphaelites at the [[Royal Academy]]. Unlike the PRB, the Hogarth Club was established on a professional basis, with two classes of members, artistic and non-artistic, and a distinction between London-based "resident" and provincial "non-resident" members. 

[[Ford Madox Brown]] suggested that the club be named after [[William Hogarth]] since Hogarth was "a painter whom he deeply reverenced as the originator of moral invention and drama in modern art".&lt;ref&gt;Rossetti, W. M., ''Some Reminiscences'', London, 1906, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] had worked on some previous independent exhibitions, but became determined to form a permanent exhibition space after the rejection of Pre-Raphaelite work by the Academy in 1857. In response they created their own exhibition, later founding the Hogarth Club in tandem with other sympathetic artists, most notably [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]].&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, D., [https://www.jstor.org/pss/879933 The Hogarth Club: 1858-1861], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 122, No. 925 (April 1980), pp. 236–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial success, the Hogarth Club failed to maintain its momentum, and was finally closed in 1861 after failing to adequately build up its membership in the face of hostility from the Royal Academy. Even the former leading Pre-Raphaelite [[John Everett Millais]] refused to join, as did otherwise sympathetic Royal Academicians such as [[Augustus Egg]].

A '''hologram trademark''' is a [[non-conventional trademark|non-conventional]] [[trademark]] where a [[hologram]] is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services.

In recent times holograms have been increasingly used as trade marks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect holograms as trademarks through registration, as a hologram was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]{{ref|TRIPs}}, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to holograms trademarks in most countries in other fields of the art, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

==Registration of hologram marks in different jurisdictions==
===Canada===
In Canada, hologram trademarks are generally not acceptable if they cannot be represented graphically or if they are regarded as more than one mark, see first external link.

===European Union===
In the European Union, Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community Trade Mark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In Sieckmann v German Patent Office  (case C-273/00) [http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf] the EcJ states that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

This definition generally encompasses only very simply structured holograms, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use [[one photograph or some views]] to graphically represent their trade mark, see first external link.

===United States===
In the United States, the trademark manual for examination requires under 1202.14 that a hologram used in varying forms does not function as a mark in the absence of evidence that consumers would perceive it as a trademark.  See In re Upper Deck Co., 59 USPQ2d 1688 ([[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board|TTAB]] 2001), where the Board held that a hologram used on trading cards in varying shapes, sizes, and positions did not function as a mark, because the record showed that other companies used holograms on trading cards and other products as anti-counterfeiting devices, and there was no evidence that the public would perceive applicant's hologram as an indicator of source.  The Board noted that "the common use of holograms for non-trademark purposes means that consumers would be less likely to perceive applicant's uses of holograms as trademarks."  59 USPQ2d at 1693.  
Therefore, in the absence of evidence of consumer recognition as a mark, the examining attorney should refuse registration on the ground that the hologram does not function as a mark, under §§1, 2 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051, 1052 and 1127. Generally, if a hologram has two or more views, the examining attorney should also refuse registration under §§1 and 45 of the Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. §§1051 and 1127, on the ground that the application seeks registration of more than one mark.  In re Upper Deck, supra.  See [[Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure|TMEP]] §807.01.  
Provided the applicant can demonstrate that the use of a hologram or moving image both serves as a mark and is not functional, an application for such a mark may be made to either register. That being said, Examining Attorneys are instructed to refuse an application for registration of a hologram if the applicant does not provide evidence of consumer recognition of the hologram as a mark. the applicant seeking registration of a hologram must submit a drawing of the mark that captures the dimensions thereof. Further, Examiners are instructed to refuse registration of any holograms that show two different images on the grounds that the application is seeking protection for two separate marks. Further, the application must include detailed written description of the mark.  During publication the drawing pages for these marks are published and thereafter the drawing page is incorporated into the registration certificate which is made available at the USPTO as well as the USPTO website, see first external link.

'''Limerick School of Art and Design''' or '''LSAD''' is an [[art college]] in [[Limerick]] city in Ireland. The school is one of the five constituent schools of [[Limerick Institute of Technology]] and operates on two of LIT's campuses in Limerick city, located on Clare Street and George's Quay; both are about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the main LIT campus at Moylish Park. Since 2012, the school also offers degree programmes at the Clonmel campus of LIT. The School can trace its origins back to 1852 and has had a number of guises and locations before consolidating into its current format and campuses in the 1980s and 1990s. LSAD offers courses at Level 8 (Honours Degree) and Level 9 (Master's Degree) across a range of art and design disciplines.

==History==

On 3 July 1852, a public notice appeared in the [[Limerick Leader|Limerick Chronicle]] announcing the opening of the School of Ornamental Art at the Leamy Institute on Hartstonge Street. The school offered instruction to the general public in drawing and modelling. The first prospectus stated the school's objective of "providing instruction in all those branches of art which are applicable to manufactures and decoration".&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 3 July 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened on 2 November 1852 with 28 male and seven female pupils.

Although the school thrived in its first year, changes in government departments led to a withdrawal of funding and the school was forced to close in January 1855. Following public pressure, the school reopened in December 1855 under the auspices of the [[Limerick Athenaeum]], a centre of learning that would be open to all, irrespective of class, creed or cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 3 December 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; This had opened in February 1855 at No. 2 Upper Cecil Street. The school continued to operate successfully over the coming decades. The trustees of the Athenaeum handed the building over to the Corporation in 1896 in order to administer the property for the advancement of technical education in Limerick. However, by the turn of the century, the building was no longer large enough to cater for the range of courses offered by the Limerick Technical Instruction Committee, and the school began to move sections to new premises, mainly on George's Street (now [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 5 May 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

The departments were eventually rehoused on one site with the opening of the Municipal Technical Institute on O' Connell Avenue in December 1911. This building has since been known in Limerick as the 'Red Tech'. The work of the Institute was taking place against the background of intense political change in Ireland and was forced to close from 1919 to 1923. Troops of the Warwickshire Regiment occupied the Institute during the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1921 and considerable damage was caused to the building and its contents. Limerick MTI eventually re-opened in October 1923 and such was the impact of the closure that it was effectively a new start-up.&lt;ref&gt;''Limerick Chronicle'', 22 September 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vocational Education Committee was established in July 1930 and took over the running of the MTI, with its main focus on providing full-time education to students between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;Limerick Chronicle, 25 March 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; This continued in much the same format until 1967, when the Limerick VEC was suspended for three years over irregularities in appointing staff.&lt;ref&gt;From Small Beginnings - The Story of the Limerick School of Art and Design, 1852-2002, J.J. Hogan, Limerick Institute of Technology, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Art had relocated to the former County Infirmary and Nurses' Home in Mulgrave Street in 1962, now Limerick College of Further Education.

Limerick missed out on a new technical college in 1966 with the establishment of the Regional Technical Colleges, as the Department of Education decided to establish a National Institute for Higher Education instead (later to become the [[University of Limerick]]). The reconvened Limerick City VEC planned to build Limerick Technical College and acquired land at Moylish Park to do this. The college was opened in 1975 and has since developed into the main campus of Limerick Institute of Technology.

The School of Art continued to grow at its Mulgrave Street location and by the mid 1970s the lack of space was becoming a serious issue. 1980 saw the school finally taking shape as what is now the Limerick School of Art and Design under the reconstituted LTC, which had become the College of Art, Commerce and Technology (CoACT), and this coincided with a move to a VEC property on George’s Quay, formerly St. Anne’s Vocational School, which had been opened in 1939 but vacated in 1978. However, the move to George’s Quay proved to be a short-term solution as the school quickly outgrew this site also. CoACT rented rooms in Bruce House on Rutland Street and in the Granary on Michael Street to accommodate the extra courses and students but this quickly got out of control with the school renting a further five properties during this period.

When CoACT finally achieved RTC status in 1992, work began on finding a suitable location for the school. The Good Shepherd Convent on Clare Street was purchased from the [[Good Shepherd Sisters]] in October 1994 and some emergency refurbishment allowed occupancy as early as January 1995. Further refurbishment and development work took place and its final stage was completed in September 2008.

==Clare Street Campus==
[[File:LSAD Clare Street Campus 1.jpg|thumb|right|New build alongside 19th century convent]]
Clare Street originally backed onto the walls of the Irishtown and derives its name from [[John Fitzgibbon, 1st Earl of Clare|John Fitzgibbon]], the 1st Earl of Clare who was [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] from 1789 to 1802. James O'Sullivan, a tobacco merchant, constructed the street on swampy land known as ''Múin na Muice'', the moor or common of the pigs, and dedicated it to Fitzgibbon.&lt;ref name=Spellissey&gt;Spellissy, S., ''The History of Limerick City'', 1998, pp.100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clare Street Campus is located on the site of an old [[Joseph Lancaster|Lancastrian School]], developed by [[Joseph Lancaster]] for the education of the poor in the early 19th century. Lancaster was a Quaker, born in London in 1788, who had devoted himself to the education of the poor. His system was to employ the more advanced boys as monitors, or assistant teachers, to enable a few masters to teach a large number of boys. Spelling and reading were taught from charts hung on the walls, thereby dispensing with the need for books for the poor and slates were used to write on, to save paper. His first school was founded in London in 1801 and his school in Limerick was probably founded around 1806. The entrance to the school was on Old Clare Street and this street became known locally as ''The Long Can'', after the Lancastrian School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,4007,en.pdf Ahern, Richard, ''The History Of The Christian Brothers In Limerick - Part I'', p.13.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendance figures dropped at the school and it gradually fell into disrepair. In November 1821, [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|The Christian Brothers]] purchased the school for £200. In 1858, they let part of the garden to Madame De Beligond, superioress of the Good Shepherd Convent at an annual rent of £10. When the Christian Brothers left the building in 1888, they sold it to the nuns for £200.&lt;ref&gt;Spellissy, S. &amp; O' Brien, J., ''Limerick - The Rich Land'', 1989, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; They established a girls' reformatory on the site of the old Thomond Brewery, adjacent to the convent, which was one of three breweries still in operation in Limerick city in the 1870s. It was sold to the nuns in 1879 and demolished to construct the reformatory to house young women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. They also established a [[Magdalene laundry]] on another adjacent site which had been a public execution ground in the 16th and 17th centuries, known as the Farrancroghy execution site.&lt;ref name=Spellissey/&gt; They continued to operate the reformatory and the laundry at the site until it was sold to the Regional Technical College in 1994.

Major refurbishment and construction works have been carried out at the site, in two phases. The first saw the refurbishment of much of the main building and chapel in the late 1990s. The second phase was completed in August 2008 and consisted of construction of additional space, further refurbishment and considerable ground works, including a new entrance onto Clare Street.

==Education==

Pakenham-Walsh trained as an artist at [[Lancaster and Morecambe College|Lancaster and Morecambe College of Arts and Crafts]] (1954–58) and [[Wimbledon College of Art]] (1958-59).&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary" /&gt; The writer and artist [[Mervyn Peake]] was an early mentor.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;

==Career==

From the beginning of her career, Pakenham-Walsh created drawings, paintings, and sculptures made almost exclusively from mundane and salvaged materials;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary"/&gt; this unique strategy was borne of necessity as Pakenham-Walsh encountered "social barriers associated with being a female artist in the mid twentieth century, which made it difficult for her [...] to acquire raw materials for her art."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh's first published artwork was in the early 1960s when her [[Ballpoint pen|biro]] drawings appeared in the literary journal ''[[Transatlantic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 41512113| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 11, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41514022| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 12, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, she was employed as a designer at [[Pinewood Studios]], where she created set-pieces for major motion-pictures, including [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|''Cleopatra'']]; she also worked as a sculptor at [[Shepperton Studios]].&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News Biographical article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?coll_id=848&amp;inst_id=1&amp;term=Artists%20%7C%20Wales%20%7C%20Archives |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh Papers |publisher=The National Library of Wales |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Clive |title=Woodcarving in Coalshed Brings Fame |date=1 January 1982 |access-date=13 August 2016 |url=https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/utilities/action/act_download.cfm?mediaid=28070&amp;langtoken=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1982, she exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition|Summer Exhibitions]] of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1905—1970 Vol. 5 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=EP Publishing Limited |year=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1971—1989 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=Hilmarton Manor Press |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, select London artists rejected abstraction and conceptualism to pursue "the depiction of the human figure and everyday landscape";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/london/inner.html |title=London Calling |last1=Brooks |first1=Julian |last2=Potts |first2=Timothy |website=getty.edu |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2016 |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakenham-Walsh also sought to depict ordinary daily life, creating art that was both "playful and profound [to] invoke the [[Flow (psychology)|deep time]] of human nature."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh "exhibited widely in her lifetime in many art galleries and museums" worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt; Her work has been shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and is held in numerous public and private collections, including: the [[National Library of Wales]], the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Aberystwyth University]], and the [[UK Craft Council]]; the actor and art historian [[Vincent Price]] and the photographer [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]] also admired and collected her work.&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good Reads article"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/5690320-ten-to-one-author-interview---yasmin-ali |title=Ten To One author interview - Yasmin Ali |publisher=Good Reads |access-date= 11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.aber.ac.uk/person/782 |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh |publisher=Aberystwyth University |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.craftscouncil.org.uk/results?mi_search_type=adv&amp;mi_adv_search=yes&amp;sort=1&amp;maker_id=AUTH982 |title=Crafts Council Collections |publisher=Crafts Council |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mihai Dumitru Ralea''' (also known as '''Mihail Ralea''', '''Michel Raléa''', or '''Mihai Rale''';&lt;ref name="mstr586"&gt;Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a [[Romania]]n social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of [[Poporanism]], the left-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] movement, which he infused with influences from [[corporatism]] and [[Marxism]]. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic "peasant state". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to [[political sociology]], the [[sociology of culture]], and [[Social psychology|social]] and [[national psychology]]. He was a professor at the [[University of Iași]] and, from 1938, the [[University of Bucharest]].

By 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the [[National Peasants' Party]], managing ''[[Viața Românească]]'' review and ''[[Dreptatea]]'' daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Labor Minister]] of the dictatorial [[National Renaissance Front]], representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a "[[fellow traveler]]" of the underground [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]].

Ralea willingly cooperated with the communists and the [[Ploughmen's Front]] before and after their arrival to power, serving as [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]], [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]], and vice president of the [[Great National Assembly]]. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and, as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]], his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.

Ralea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the [[UNESCO]]. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.

==Biography==

===Early life and Poporanist beginnings===
A native of [[Huși]], [[Fălciu County]] (currently in [[Vaslui County]]), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea.&lt;ref name="gc912"&gt;Călinescu, p. 912&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]], while his mother was [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196–197. See also Moldovan, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the [[Senate of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 125; (2010), p. 385; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of [[Iași]], where he enlisted at [[boarding school]] (''Liceul Internat'').&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 912; Vianu, p. 143; Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199&lt;/ref&gt; He was colleagues with another future sociologist, [[D. I. Suchianu]]. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–198, 199, 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea went on to attend the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's ''Revista de Filozofie'',&lt;ref name="tv144"&gt;Vianu, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and with ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' articles that he usually signed with the initials ''M. R.'' (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career).&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 406, 586&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Nicolae Bagdasar]], with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 283. See also Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies were interrupted by the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign of World War I]], during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the [[University of Iași]], in 1918.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; His professors included the culture critic [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who became Ralea's mentor.&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was "my life's greatest intellectual event".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by Vianu as a "young luminary" with "new and original ideas", "always surrounded by a sizable pack of students",&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar [[Greater Romania]]. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review ''Însemnări Literare'', which stood in for the temporarily disestablished ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 114; Nicolescu, p. 131. See also Desa ''et al.'' (1987), pp. 508–509&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was managed by the novelist [[Mihail Sadoveanu]] and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar [[Poporanism]], a leftist current which promoted [[agrarianism]], "national specificity", and art with a social mission. The ''Însemnări Literare'' group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]] and [[universal male suffrage]]. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, "settled a debt" with the peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Poporanism was generally pro-[[Westernization]], with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 353–354; Verdery, pp. 50–51, 53, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, [[Andrei Oțetea]], earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 190–192, 250, 284&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea entered the [[École Normale Supérieure]] as a disciple of [[Lucien Herr]],&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] [[Célestin Bouglé]], then under [[Paul Fauconnet]] and [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], and later, at the [[Collège de France]], under [[Pierre Janet]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 191–192, 293&lt;/ref&gt; As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the [[French Left]], a reader of [[Jean Jaurès]], and a guest of [[Léon Blum]]'s.&lt;ref name="istnm28"&gt;Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He defined himself as a [[Rationalism|rationalist]], heir to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; and was ostensibly an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]], which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to [[freethought]] and religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker [[Aristide Blank]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, [[Gheorghe Brătianu]], and [[Alexandru Rosetti]], who remained close friends over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 284, 293, 345–347&lt;/ref&gt; Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.&lt;ref name="ln(10)129"/&gt;

===Debut as theoretician===
With funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea,&lt;ref&gt;Ilie Th. Riga, Gheorghe Călin, ''Dr. Fr. I. Rainer'', [[Editura Științifică]], Bucharest, 1966, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viața Românească'' was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]],&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/COROIUoct12.htm "Proust și romanul românesc modern"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt;

In 1922, Ralea took his ''[[Habilitation|Docteur d'État]]'' degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it)&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; with ''L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes'' ("The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines"). Under the [[Francization|Francized]] name ''Michel Raléa'', he published it at Rivière company in 1923. ''L'idée de la révolution...'' theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a "social body", an "ideal", and a "transfer of power"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, "organic", "programmatic", or "means-based".&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of his attention was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of "class solidarity" and [[nonviolent revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; The work earned Ralea the [[Institut de France]]'s [[Prix Osiris]]&lt;ref name="tv144"/&gt; and a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree in 1923.&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; He spent another several months frequenting [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] lectures.&lt;ref name="ln(09)192"/&gt; It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician [[Ion Barbu]]. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a "clown" with "aristocratic manias".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as ''Fapta'', ''[[Ideea Europeană]]'', and ''[[Gândirea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 76; Desa ''et al.'' (1987), p. 469; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with [[Dimitrie Gusti]] and [[Virgil Madgearu]]'s Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its ''Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială''. In 1923, it hosted his essay on "The Issue of Societal Classification" and his critical review of German sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt; While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, [[Garabet Aslan]], ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to [[Ion Petrovici]], while also employed as lecturer in [[social pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 344–345, 347, 483&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea's own words, this was a "ridiculous" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the ''Viața Românească'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 150, 200–201, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract ''Formația ideii de personalitate'' ("How the Notion of Personality Is Formed"), noted as a pioneering introduction to [[behavioural genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 345–346, 347, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea soon became one of ''Viața Românească''{{'}}s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, ''Miscellanea'' (alongside Suchianu and, initially, [[George Topîrceanu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily ''[[Adevărul]]'', and its cultural supplement, ''[[Adevărul Literar și Artistic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt; His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including ''[[Kalende]]'' of [[Pitești]] and ''Minerva'' of Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 557, 619–620&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, when Ralea published his ''Contribuțiuni la știința societății'' ("Contributions to Social Science") and ''Introducere în sociologie'' ("Companion to Sociology"),&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Herseni, p. 542&lt;/ref&gt; Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on "Social Education".&lt;ref&gt;Gusti, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; At around that time, with Gusti as president of the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Broadcasting Company]], Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

In his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's "national specificity" against criticism from the new-wave [[Literary modernism|modernists]] at ''[[Sburătorul]]''. [[Eugen Lovinescu]], the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century [[classical liberalism]], rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and [[Socialization (economics)|socializing]] phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as [[reactionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 39, 128, 133; E. Lovinescu, pp. 116–119&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for "originality"; as he put it, "national specificity" had become inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by ''Sburătorul'' to the more radical [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] of ''[[Contimporanul]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 123–124, 128, 133–135, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague [[Octav Botez]], he was an "integrally modern man" in tastes and behavior, "one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; The same was also noted by ''Contimporanul'' writer [[Sergiu Dan]], who proposed that Ralea denied himself "all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment".&lt;ref name="sdan184"&gt;Dan, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by [[Thomas Hardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 911; Vianu, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; More famous was his reading of Proust through [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Matter and Memory|classification of memory]].&lt;ref name="ccproust"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc911"&gt;Călinescu, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], and hailed [[Tudor Arghezi]], the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 227; Crohmălniceanu, p. 140. See also M. Lovinescu, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for [[social realism]] in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by ''Sburătorul''{{'}}s [[Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 180, 253, 397, 406, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ralea vs. ''Gândirea''===
With the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at ''Viața Românească'' and ''Sburătorul'', a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian [[Nichifor Crainic]], this group took over at ''Gândirea'', turning the magazine against its former ''Viața Românească'' allies.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 76–77, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's "remarkable" program.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; He did not object to Crainic's [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and "national specificity"), but mainly to his [[national conservatism]], which worshiped the historical past.&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 123–128&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted [[left-wing nationalism]], arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: "[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic."&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bochmann, "Conceptul de patriotism în cultura română", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 124; Ornea (1995), pp. 65, 351&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the core ideas of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]], according to which [[National awakening of Romania|Romanian national awareness]] was an afterthought of [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]: "We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: "Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected."&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, ''Gândirea'' hosted the inflammatory "White Lily" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a "new generation" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, [[Petre Pandrea]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for [[aestheticism]] and [[mysticism]], a critique of "that famed social justice" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the ''Sburătorul'' group as "dry", "barren", all too critical.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without "prophets" with "fun and interesting biases", but not without "liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day [[Rasputin]]s, prone to fanatical vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

From that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that "all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, ''Gândirists'' produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, "[[historical materialism]]", and [[Francophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 97, 102&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, [[obscurantism]], [[Neoplatonism]], and [[Byzantinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 124, 127, 130–132&lt;/ref&gt; He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror [[Kemalism]].&lt;ref name="gc973"&gt;Călinescu, p. 973&lt;/ref&gt;

His comments also challenged the grounding of ''Gândirist'' theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included [[Slavs]], whereas many Romanians were [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]]. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 127–128; Ornea (1995), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern "trifle", that owed inspiration to [[Hermann Graf Keyserling|Keyserling]]'s [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[Jean Cocteau|Cocteau]]'s Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132; Ornea (1995), pp. 81–83&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were "superstitious, but atheistic", not respectful "of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts." No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to [[Romanian profanity|profanities]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: ''Comentarii și sugestii'' ("Comments and Suggestions"), ''Interpretări'' ("Interpretations"), ''Perspective'' ("Perspectives").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188, 586, 598, 616&lt;/ref&gt; He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as ''Problema inconștientului'' ("The Problem of the Unconscious Mind") and ''Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului'' ("Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science").&lt;ref name="gc1025"&gt;Călinescu, p. 1025&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the [[Restoration (Spain)|Kingdom of Spain]], and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, ''Memorial din Spania'', depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of "somber priests" and "festooned soldiers".&lt;ref name="sdan184"/&gt; Another ''Memorial'', serialized by ''Adevărul Literar și Artistic'', detailed his trips through [[Germanic-speaking Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 912, 1025&lt;/ref&gt;

===PNȚ deputy and ''Viața Românească'' editor===
Shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1928|election of December 1928]], Ralea was attracted into the [[National Peasants' Party]] (PNȚ), speaking out against the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] political class as "an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Octavian Tăslăuanu]], "Ce scriu tinerii despre România", in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 28/1928, pp. 898–899&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully contested a seat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]], and was [[Romanian general election, 1931|reelected in 1933]]; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter.&lt;ref name="zavr189"&gt;Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, [[Constantin Balmuș]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Petre Andrei]], [[Traian Bratu]], and [[Traian Ionașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 100, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, [[Constantin Stere]], but did not follow Stere's "[[Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere|Democratic Peasantist]]" dissidence of 1930.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/glose_la_petre_pandrea_ii "Glose la Petre Pandrea (II)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 25/2004&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ ''Acțiunea Țărănistă'' and to [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște|Teodorescu-Braniște]]'s ''Revista Politică''.&lt;ref&gt;Desa ''et al.'' (2003), pp. 16, 822&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic [[George Călinescu]] as editors of ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 146; Piru, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126. See also Ornea (1995), pp. 119, 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a "peasant state", accepting socialist [[reformism]], but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of [[Dictatorship of the proletarian|proletarian primacy]]. Criticized by the communist left as "outstanding shortsightedness",&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] meetings, including the 1933 conference in the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic of Spain]], but insisted on the benefits of [[statism]] and a [[planned economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5448104j/ ''Compte rendu de la XXIXe conférence tenue à Madrid du 4 au 10 octobre 1933''], Éditions Payot, Lausanne, 1934, pp. 582–588&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be "absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics."&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of [[hyperactivity]], seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions.&lt;ref name="ln(09)483"/&gt; He became infamous as one of the "traveling professors",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 475–476; Piru, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 201, 391&lt;/ref&gt; Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 266–267&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague [[Ioan Hudiță]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 250, 403, 406&lt;/ref&gt; He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist [[Giorge Pascu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 302–303&lt;/ref&gt; Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their [[Romanian Baccalaureate|baccalaureate examination]].&lt;ref name="ln(10)266-267"/&gt; Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1934 to March 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Diego Ciobotaru, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-au-vazut-taranistii-restauratia-lui-carol-al-ii-lea "Cum au văzut țărăniștii restaurația lui Carol al II-lea"], in ''Historia'', February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also editor of the main PNȚ newspaper, ''[[Dreptatea]]''. He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a "peasant state".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dreptatea'', addressing ''[[Universul]]'' editor [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], Ralea dismissed suspicions that the "peasant state" signified a "simplistic domination" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied "a juster distribution of the national income", and the "collective" but peaceful "redemption of an entire class."&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 204–206&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the Iron Guard===
Ralea's time at ''Dreptatea'' overlapped with the emergence of [[fascism]], whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the [[Iron Guard]]. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]], [[Ion Mihalache]]. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion Society]]''. One of the sessions, focusing on [[André Gide]], was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under [[Mihai Stelescu]], who assaulted ''Criterion'' activists and created a bustle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Irina Manea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/criterion-o-istorie "Criterion – o istorie"], in ''Historia'', May 2014; Ornea (1995), pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the ''Criterion'' cell, which had since adopted "new generation" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, [[Nae Ionescu]], as a "trickster" and a "barber".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion G. Duca]]. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as "insane and degenerate" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Dreptatea'', protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual [[Alexandru Graur]], Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an "[[The Island of Doctor Moreau|island of Doctor Moreau]]", an experiment in the growth of "blind and absurd mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Niculae ''et al.'', pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at [[Editura Fundațiilor Regale]] as ''Valori'' ("Values"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and [[Collectivism|collectivist]], whose great merit was the elimination of careerism.&lt;ref&gt;Dan, pp. 184–186&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on "The Right's Doctrine", taken up by ''Dreptatea'' and ''Viața Românească''. These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 119; Ornea (1995), pp. 64–65, 350–352&lt;/ref&gt; His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual [[Toma Vlădescu]], in the newspaper ''[[Porunca Vremii]]''. According to Vlădescu, the "right-wing ideology" existed as an expression of the "human equilibrium", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSDR). In 1936, at ''Dreptatea'', he condemned the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|German march into Rhineland]] as a bad omen and an attack on world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Prisăcaru, "Rhineland Crisis: The First 'Milestone' to the Second World War. Romanian Authorities and Media Reactions", in ''Romanian Military Thinking'', Nr. 4/2013, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Cecil]]'s International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, pp. 444–445&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, with an obituary piece to the "martyr" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of "[[Bolshevik]]" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 74, 396&lt;/ref&gt; However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126, 133, 137, 143–144; Tismăneanu, pp. 99, 299, 312&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as [[Ștefan Voicu]] and [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]] to publish essays in ''Viața Românească'', and hosted news about social life and culture in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 118–119. See also Zavarache, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with "fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 119–120&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Ralea spoke of the "peasant state" as a "[[neo-nationalist]]" application of [[democratic socialism]], opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable [[totalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Conferințele tineretului național-țărănist la Cluj", in ''Țara de Mâine'', Nr. 1–2/1937, pp. 58, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt; During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 78–80; Ornea (1995), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' hosted a piece by [[Horia Stamatu]], which referred to Ralea's contribution as "unhinged", and to Ralea personally as "kike-turned", "at odds with the new man".&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Săndulescu, "Convertiri și reconvertiri: elite academice și culturale și schimbare politică în România anilor 1930–1960", in Cristian Vasile (ed.), ''"Ne trebuie oameni!".

===Becoming Carol's minister===
[[File:Călinescu, Gafencu, Ralea, Constantinescu. Prima ședință a fondatorilor F.R.N..jpg|thumb|370px|Founding session of the [[National Renaissance Front]]. Wearing the Front's gala uniforms, from left: [[Armand Călinescu]], [[Grigore Gafencu]], Ralea, [[Mitiță Constantinescu]]]]
The [[Romanian general election, 1937|December 1937 election]] toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native [[Fălciu County]] alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as "cordial".&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to increase his participation in politics, beyond his [[royal prerogative]]. Identified as one of the PNȚ "turncoats",&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier [[Miron Cristea]] (the [[Patriarch of All Romania|Patriarch of Romania]]), becoming the country's [[Ministry of Labor, Family, and Social Protection (Romania)|Minister of Labor]]. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor [[Socialist Peasants' Party]] (PSȚ).&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162339/http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D. Cocea și Mihail Ralea (1942–1944)"], in ''Caiete Silvane'', Nr. 2/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as "servile",&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; and Ralea himself as Carol's "pocket Socialist"&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; or "intellectual trophy".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable "communist", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's ''[[camarilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iuliu Maniu]], the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had "not a trace of character" to compliment his intellectual gifts.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the [[Romanianization]] laws.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"&gt;Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted [[Wilhelm Filderman]]'s proposal for [[Fifth Aliyah|the mass emigration of Romanian Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Aurel Vainer]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160416040538/https://www.jewishfed.ro/downloads/realitatea/RE442-443.pdf "Contribuția evreimii române la Așezământul Muncii în Ereț Israel"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 442–443, January 2015, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's [[One-party state|single party]], the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 133–134&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of [[Ținutul Prut]], a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the ''[[Meritul Cultural]]'' Order,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume ''Psihologie și vieață'' ("Psychology and Life").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 293, 343, 447; Zavarache, pp. 190, 197&lt;/ref&gt; Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 283–284, 447&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues: "Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing."&lt;ref name="lb141"&gt;Boia, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: "I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class."&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in 1945 by political scientist [[Hugh Seton-Watson]], there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: "however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts."&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Watson, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, ''[[Muncă și Voe Bună]]'', together with a Workers' University,&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"&gt;"Necesitatea universităților muncitorești", in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 4/1939, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (''Casa Scriitorilor'').&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 140–143, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff,&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 182, 225&lt;/ref&gt; by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as [[George Grigorovici]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Petrescu, p. 458, 459&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stavri Cunescu]].&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilarion Țiu, Lavinia Betea, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cum-l-furat-ceausescu-regele-playboy "Cum l-a furat Ceaușescu pe Regele playboy"], in ''Historia'', online edition; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as [[Demostene Botez]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], [[Victor Ion Popa]], [[Gala Galaction]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]], and [[Ion Pas]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 141–143, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, [[Robert Ley]].&lt;ref name="lb141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Manolescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/85_via-a-romaneasca-5-6-2013/80_istorie-i-literatura/1492_scriitori-romani-in-exil-vintila-horia-fata-cu-premiul-goncourt.html "Scriitori români în exil. Vintilă Horia față cu Premiul Goncourt"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 5-6/2013&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Muncă și Voe Bună'' was directly inspired by [[Strength Through Joy]] and the ''[[Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro]]''.&lt;ref name="sdmunivmun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 141; Zavarache, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Ralea celebrated [[May Day]] with a large parade of support for Carol II. This was meant to undermine the leftist [[International Workers' Day|Workers' Day]] while showing the success of the FRN's worker [[guild]]s, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities.&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting "democratic slogans".&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt; In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]]; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 197–200, 201–202&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1939, the premiership had passed to [[Armand Călinescu]], a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of "mythomaniacal" rumors.&lt;ref name="zoambasador"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/nsemnrile_unui_ambasador "Însemnările unui ambasador"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 6/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at [[Miercurea Ciuc]].&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, pp. 313, 314&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian [[P. P. Panaitescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a Guard sympathizer, [[Ion Barbu]] later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 189; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 332, 342&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former ''Dreptatea'' colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt;

On September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an [[Iron Guard death squads|Iron Guard death squad]] took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to [[Constantin Argetoianu]], then to [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Guvern nou", in ''Unirea. Foaie Bisericească'', December 2, 1939, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in [[Ținutul Mării]].&lt;ref&gt;Moldovan, pp. 359, 369–372&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall and harassment===
[[File:Sala de Consiliu -- Primim &amp; mobilizare.jpg|thumb|250px|Ralea's vote on the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet ultimatum]] and mobilization, registered on Romanian government stationary, alongside those of his cabinet colleagues]] 
Meanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the [[Axis Powers]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]. During the [[Battle of France]], the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat [[René de Weck]], Ralea was restating his ''Valori'' ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for "humanistic civilization".&lt;ref name="zoambasador"/&gt; Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 118; Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and [[Belu Zilber]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the [[Prut River|Prut]], in preparation of a future defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/constantin-argetoianu-ultimatum-mi-s-au-taiat-picioarele "Ultimatum... Mi s-au tăiat picioarele..."], in ''Historia'', June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Nazi–Soviet agreement]], led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist [[George Ivașcu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Pavel Țugui]], [http://www.romlit.ro/george_ivacu_cronicar_de_rzboi_la_ziarul_vremea_1941-1944 "George Ivașcu, cronicar de război, la ziarul ''Vremea'' (1941–1944). I"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired [[Second Vienna Award|Vienna arbitration]] stripped her of [[Northern Transylvania]]. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging "[[National Legionary State]]" banned reviews such as ''Viața Românească'',&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist [[Traian Herseni]] and eugenicist [[Iordache Făcăoaru]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 172; Popescu-Cadem, pp. 314, 315&lt;/ref&gt; Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 540–541. See also Boia, pp. 176, 199; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having "zero value".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 176; Popescu-Cadem, p. 315. See also Zavarache, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|racial purity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 447. See also Boia, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the [[Siguranța]], who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 197"/&gt;

In November 1940, the Guard's [[Romanian Police|Police]] chief, [[Ștefan Zăvoianu]], ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military ''[[Conducător]]'', [[Ion Antonescu]], who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign.&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe I. Florescu, "N. Iorga și America", in ''Zargidava. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. XII, 2013, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|clashes of January 1941]], the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a "shame", and declared Ralea to be "indispensable".&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt; In a companion to [[Romanian philosophy]], published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea "a thinker of unquestionable talent", whose sociological work had been "a true revelation."&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, [[Traian Chelariu]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Traian Chelariu]], [[Mircea A. Diaconu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/zilele_i_umbra_mea "Zilele și umbra mea"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 17/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Still present in public life after the Romania's entry into the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|anti-Soviet war]], Ralea returned to publishing with articles in ''Revista Românǎ''&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 243; Straje, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1942 book ''Înțelesuri'' ("Meanings").&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|National Socialist Party]],&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; Ralea was still under ''Siguranța'' watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 200, 237; Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt; His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a "socialist-communist" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/154/art16-arhiva.php "''Arhivele Sfera Politicii'' – Mihail Ralea"], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 154, December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

One ''Siguranța'' record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called ''Graiul Nostru'' and with British funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 199–201&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"&gt;Zavarache, pp. 203–204&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antihitlerite Front===
[[File:Gh.Gheorghiu Dej rostindu-și cuvântarea la Congresul Frontului Plugarilor ținut pe Stadionul A.N.E.F. (Mihai Ralea, Petru Groza).jpg|thumb|340px|Ralea (left) and [[Petru Groza]], flanking [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] as he addresses the [[Ploughmen's Front]] Congress, June 1945]]
Ralea's return from camp coincided roughly with the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency "for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection."&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; Their separation remained "unbridgeable";&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 196, 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician [[Lothar Rădăceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, pp. 116–117, 120; Tismăneanu, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and [[Sinaia]], Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the [[Ploughmen's Front]] of [[Petru Groza]], and the National Liberal inner faction of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]], helping to coordinate actions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, pp. 550, 555&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brașov]], he met with the economist [[Victor Jinga]], whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 558&lt;/ref&gt; Together with party colleague [[Stanciu Stoian]], he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine "Patriotic Antihitlerite Front".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 132; Frunză, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 243, 244; {{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/g.clinescu_i_detractorii_si "G. Călinescu și detractorii săi"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2013&lt;/ref&gt; alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism.&lt;ref name="gc973"/&gt; With the 1943 collection of essays, ''Între două lumi'' ("Between Two Worlds", published at [[Cartea Românească]]),&lt;ref name="gc1025"/&gt; Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the [[German Foreign Ministry]] nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="zavr203–204"/&gt; In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and [[Mircea Florian]], gave him immediate approval for transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 346. See also Zavarache, pp. 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of [[Constantin Noica]], the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had "an absolute and metaphysical mindset", with no "practical reason", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared as a defense witness for [[Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa]], an activist of the underground [[National Popular Party (Romania)|Union of Patriots]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to [[Grigore T. Popa]]'s manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were "cowardly".&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Solomon Marcus]], [http://www.romlit.ro/halucinantul_an_1944 "Halucinantul an 1944"], ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 45/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as "too soft" on Romania.&lt;ref name="smhalucin44"/&gt; Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition,&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p. 120; Zavarache, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt; which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the [[King Michael's Coup|August 23 Coup]] deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;S. Popescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In the PSȚ newspaper, ''Dezrobirea'', Ralea saluted "the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He reissued ''Viața Românească'' with a similar statement about "the present triumph of our credo".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be [[Romanian People's Tribunals|indicted for war crimes]].&lt;ref name="ițlbfurat"/&gt;

Ralea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype "[[fellow traveler]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154, 290; Stanomir, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]] (ARLUS).&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 126, 143&lt;/ref&gt; His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was "a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution";&lt;ref&gt;Undrea, p. 561&lt;/ref&gt; according to historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.&lt;ref name="zavr256"&gt;Zavarache, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was "exceedingly minor", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist "puppet"; "consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle".&lt;ref name="zavr225"&gt;Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General [[Nicolae Rădescu]]. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, [[Andrey Vyshinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 154–155&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the [[Allied Commission]].&lt;ref name="citeroarea"&gt;{{ro icon}} Cicerone Ionițoiu, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/aldine/history/asa-a-inceput-teroarea-92991 "Așa a început teroarea"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', April 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts Minister and ambassador===

Bloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents.&lt;ref name="citeroarea"/&gt; They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]] on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 127, 154; Vasile (2010), pp. 71–72; Zavarache, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced [[Constantin Burducea]] until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).&lt;ref&gt;George Enache, "Strategii de infiltrare și atragere la colaborare a cultelor religioase elaborate de autoritățile procomuniste din România în perioada 1945-1947, cu o privire specială asupra cazului Bisericii Ortodoxe Române", in ''Caietele CNSAS'', Nr. 1/2008, pp. 74, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the [[Romanian general election, 1946|1946 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 273; Cioroianu, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 187–188, 190; Vasile (2010), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; He extended his personal protection to [[Șerban Cioculescu]], who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, ''[[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, pp. 188–190&lt;/ref&gt; He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]], as ''Nord-Sud'' ("North-South").&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 285–291; Vianu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed [[List of Ambassadors from Romania to the United States|Ambassador to the United States]]. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' [[Dumitru Bagdasar]]. The latter had fallen severely ill,&lt;ref name="abasclepios"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandra Bellow]], [http://www.revista22.ro/articol-1115.html "Asclepios versus Hades în România (II)"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 755, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Conference]], and he finally landed on American soil in October.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He supported a détente in [[Romania–United States relations|Romanian–American relations]], after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]] had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the "normal" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127. See also Zavarache, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among [[Romanian American]] exiles.&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28; Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea "a liaison man" of the [[Politburo]], tasked with planting [[Stalinism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Dushnyck, "Stalin's Pan-Slavism in the United States", in ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'', Nr. 30/1948, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing [[Maruca Cantacuzino|Maruca]] and [[George Enescu]], but persuaded [[Dimitrie Gusti]] to return to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist [[Nicolae Malaxa]], but found vocal adversaries in [[Max Auschnitt]] and [[Richard Franasovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

Going against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by [[Cortlandt V.R. Schuyler|General Schuyler]] in famine-stricken [[Western Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="abasclepios"/&gt; However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the [[Soviet famine of 1946–47|Soviet famine]]; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 224–225&lt;/ref&gt; In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: "America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance."&lt;ref&gt;Deaconescu, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_raport_american_despre_romnia_din_1949 "Un raport american despre România din 1949"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 48/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable [[hypochondriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 207, 267&lt;/ref&gt; but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as [[cultural attaché]], but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;Grigorescu &amp; Ștefan, p. 27; Nastasă (2010), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

With the looming threat of Soviet-style [[Collectivization in Romania|collectivization]], Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes]], he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left "behind the [[Iron Curtain]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 127; Deaconescu, p. 29; Zavarache, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; He was still the country's ambassador when King [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a [[Communist Romania|communized people's republic]] was proclaimed. Nevertheless, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Minister]] [[Ana Pauker]] greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, [[Grigore Preoteasa]].&lt;ref name="zavr225"/&gt; In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Florin C. Stan, "Relațiile bilaterale România—Israel (1948–1959). O cronologie", in ''Caiete Diplomatice'', Vol. 2, Issue 2, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist marginalization and recovery===
A scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], having been blacklisted as "communists". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 225–226&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948;&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Ghilezan, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/De-ce-toti-presedintii-Romaniei-s-au-temut-de-Regele-Mihai-I*articleID_26028-articles_details.html "De ce toți președinții României s-au temut de Regele Mihai I?"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 597, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal [[Romanian legislative election, 1948|election of March 1948]], taking a Fălciu seat in the [[Great National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 310–311; Zavarache, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed him to return to a secure position after [[Mihai Magheru]] took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 226, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a "sociologist", as that field of research had been declared "reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt; He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History|Institute of History and Philosophy]], whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by [[Constantin Ionescu Gulian]], with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 237–246&lt;/ref&gt; He also prepared an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tract, ''Explicarea omului'' ("Explaining Man"). Translated into the French by [[Eugène Ionesco]],&lt;ref name="apmorală3"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraș]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PATRASfeb7.html "Pentru o morală a grației (III)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; it was published at [[Presses Universitaires de France]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"&gt;François Evain, "Revue des livres. Mihai Ralea, ''Explication de l'Homme''", in ''Études'', Nr. 6/1950, p. 418&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, he had been accepted into the [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|recently purged]] [[Romanian Academy]], at the same time as Balmuș, [[Raluca Ripan]], [[Grigore Moisil]], [[Ștefan Milcu]], [[Camil Petrescu]], and PCdR historian [[Mihail Roller]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; A contributor to the PCdR daily, ''[[Scînteia]]'', as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (''Studii'', ''[[Contemporanul]]'', etc.),&lt;ref name="mstr586"/&gt; Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, ''Buletin Științific'', alongside Roller, [[David Prodan]], and [[Constantin Moisil]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Berindei]], "''Buletin Științific''", in ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei românești'', [[Editura Științifică și Enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1978, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and [[Leonte Răutu]], the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 242–247&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of [[Vasile Conta]] was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Securitate]] secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other "ignoramuses" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea "opportunistic" and "a danger to our regime."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also [[Covert listening device|bugged]].&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in ''Studii'' a piece addressing the immorality of "[[American imperialism|American imperialists]]".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane'' ("The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology", published 1954).&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 248–249, 251–254&lt;/ref&gt; He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 308–309; Vasile (2010), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; and intervened to save the career of writer [[Costache Olăreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cronicar, [http://www.romlit.ro/act4099 "Actualitatea: Costache Olăreanu par lui-même"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 40/1999&lt;/ref&gt; More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia,&lt;ref name="zavr256"/&gt; and rescued from eviction the conductor [[George Georgescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; Zavarache, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher.&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt; His disciple, [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguist]] [[Tatiana Slama-Cazacu]], was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Al. Niculescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/requiem_pentru_o_savant "Requiem pentru o savantă"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, "the impenitent servant", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to [[Liuba Chișinevschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/extraordinarul_petre_pandrea_i "Extraordinarul Petre Pandrea (I)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 23/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. Brătescu]], ''Ce-a fost să fie. Notații autobiografice'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2003, p. 268.  {{ISBN|973-50-0425-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was "without scruples", always ready for a "cowardly submission", and a "valet" of Workers' Party potentates such as [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]].&lt;ref name="ggglose2"/&gt; As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the [[Order of the Star of the Romanian Socialist Republic|Star of the People's Republic]], Second Class.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt; A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 161; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'', now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a [[National communism in Romania|national communist]] platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;Tismăneanu, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals.&lt;ref&gt;Cristian Vasile, "Propaganda and Culture in Romania at the Beginning of the Communist Regime", in [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]] (ed.), ''Stalinism Revisited: The Establishment of Communist Regimes in East-Central Europe''. [[Central European University|CEU Press]], Budapest, 2009, pp. 378–379.  {{ISBN|978-963-9776-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting "mediocrities" as cultural inspectors,&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman''.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 236, 254–255&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a [[De-Stalinization in Romania|post-Stalinist Romania]].&lt;ref name="tchmdumbra"/&gt;

===Final years===
[[File:Bucuresti, Romania, Cimitirul Bellu Ortodox (Mormantul lui Mihai Ralea).JPG|thumb|300px|Ralea's grave at [[Bellu cemetery]]]]
In 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"&gt;Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, ''Cele două Franțe'' ("The Two Frances"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as ''Les Visages de France'', with a preface by [[Roger Garaudy]].&lt;ref name="adf253"&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Traditions of Invention: Romanian Ethnic and Social Stereotypes in Historical Context'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 2013, p. 253.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-21617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company [[Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă]]. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 ''Scrieri din trecut'' ("Writings from the Past).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/istoria_unei_ediii "Istoria unei ediții"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 8/2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 ''În extremul occident'' ("Into the Far West").&lt;ref name="adf253"/&gt; It had comments on the "iron fisted rule" of the [[United Fruit Company|United Fruit]], and gibes at "the putrefied lazy specimens" of "exploiters" in [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|pre-communist Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 ''Istoria psihologiei'' ("History of Psychology").&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 149; (2010), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a "courageous and noble" stand after the [[Bucharest student movement of 1956|student protest of 1956]]: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic [[Perpessicius]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Zeletin, "Perpessicius, sau Pentru ca fresca să nu se șteargă (1)", in ''Acolada'', Nr. 12/2014, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, [[Dorobanți]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 36, 118, 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported "socialist construction".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_iii "Canonul literar proletcultist (III)"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2008&lt;/ref&gt; Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of [[UNESCO]] (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer [[Virgil Ierunca]], who described their "solemn agitation" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Laszlo Alexandru]], [http://193.226.7.140/~laszlo/eleonardo/n18/Laszlo7.htm "Domnul T."], in ''E-Leonardo'', Nr. 18/2012; retrieved July 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer [[Vintilă Horia]], who had received the [[Prix Goncourt]]. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[Paris-Presse]]'' and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: "Ralea used to [[Roman salute|lift his arm really high]]".&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt; According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p. 312; {{ro icon}} [[Alex.

Adhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Florin Mihai, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/general/articol/cerberul-ceausescu-contra-lui-zaharia-stancu-agentul-sigurantei "Cerberul Ceaușescu contra lui Zaharia Stancu, 'agentul Siguranței'"], in ''Historia'', March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium&lt;ref name="fmhoria"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; and a seat on the republican [[State Council of Romania|Council of State]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 334; S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a [[Geneva]] conference on the [[generation gap]], alongside [[Louis Armand]], [[Claude Autant-Lara]], and [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;C. V., "Bibliographie critique. ''La vie et le temps. Les générations dans le monde actuel. Texte des conférences et entretiens des Rencontres internationales de Genève 1962''", in ''Population'', Nr. 3/1964, p. 604&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, [[Traian Herseni]]. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1995), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they published ''Sociologia succesului'' ("The Sociology of Success"); Herseni used the pseudonym ''Traian Hariton''.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, p. 703; Straje, p. 323; Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7; Zavarache, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet [[Păstorel Teodoreanu]], who nicknamed him the communist "Viceroy", or "Immo-Ralea".&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an "unfulfilled sybarite", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background.&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in [[Otopeni]] hospital showing symptoms of [[facial nerve paralysis]], with [[hypertension]] and fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), pp. 437–438&lt;/ref&gt; Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in [[Copenhagen]]. He died aboard the train, outside [[East Berlin]], on the morning of August 17, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 438. See also S. Popescu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at [[Bellu cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe G. Bezviconi, ''Necropola Capitalei'', [[Nicolae Iorga Institute of History]], Bucharest, 1972, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, ''Introducere în psihologia socială'' ("Companion to Social Psychology"), which only saw print in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Stahl, pp. 702, 703&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology of culture==

===Generic traits===
As seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of "outstanding intelligence" with an "encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 187, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]] remarked of "petulant" Ralea: "Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!"&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] dismissed Ralea as "a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature."&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of "useless erudition" and "failure of logic".&lt;ref&gt;E. Lovinescu, pp. 117, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Completing this verdict, [[Monica Lovinescu]] saw Ralea as "not truly a literary critic", but "a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist".&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 483–484&lt;/ref&gt; More leniently, [[George Călinescu]] noted that Ralea was an "[[Epicureanism|epicurean]]" of "vivid intelligence", who only chronicled "books that he has enjoyed reading". His free associations of concepts were "very often surprising, quite often admirable".&lt;ref name="gc911"/&gt; Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own "little [[Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt;

After his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]]'s corporatism&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118. See also Vianu, p. 146; Zavarache, pp. 187–188&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of "[[class consciousness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In his earliest work, he also referenced [[Ludwig Gumplowicz]]'s ideas about the [[Conflict theories|fundamental inequality]] of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate "class solidarity" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist economics]].&lt;ref&gt;Ghiață, pp. 27, 101–102, 144, 147, 149, 152, 162&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against [[art for art's sake]], Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were "subsidiary to [his] creative originality".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea reduced [[aestheticism]] and [[social determinism]] to the basic units of "aesthetics" and "ethnicity". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality.&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129, 130; E. Lovinescu, pp. 117–119&lt;/ref&gt; An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was "obliged" to address the national society he lived in, "at the present stage in civilization": "If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic [[Petru Comarnescu]]) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;

With this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from [[Henri Bergson]], Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in [[relativism]] and [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the "aesthetic autonomism" of [[Titu Maiorescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 151–152; Ornea (1998), pp. 146–147, 377&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or "unforeseen significances"),&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the [[semiotics]] of [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name="agutopia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alex Goldiș, [http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2011/10/adrian-marino-si-utopia-teoriei-literaturii/ "Adrian Marino și utopia teoriei literaturii"], in ''Cultura'', Nr. 343, October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Între două lumi'', he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.&lt;ref name="pcom193-194"/&gt;

===National psychology===
In his essay ''Fenomenul Românesc'' ("The Romanian Phenomenon"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian [[national psychology]]. He understood this as a natural development of [[Dimitrie Gusti]]'s sociological "science of the nation", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful.&lt;ref&gt;Verdery, pp. 64–66&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: "good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The "Romanian soul" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a [[Levant]]ine [[fatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Comarnescu, p. 195; Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of [[Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence|European Jewish intelligence]]: quoting [[Werner Sombart]], he deduced that the "rationalist", "progressive" and "utilitarian" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrei Oișteanu]], ''Inventing the Jew. Antisemitic Stereotypes in Romanian and Other Central East-European Cultures'', [[University of Nebraska Press]], Lincoln, 2009, pp. 56, 149.  {{ISBN|978-0-8032-2098-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of [[experimental psychology]] at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 188, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt; As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the creator of modern [[Romanian humor]], as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea (1998), p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Călinescu, Ralea "either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety".&lt;ref name="gc912"/&gt; Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: "maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iari_despre_caragiale "Iarăși despre Caragiale"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2006&lt;/ref&gt; During his polemic with ''[[Sburătorul]]'' modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: "Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt; According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of "lassitude" and "cowardice" in urban life is "a severe diagnostic of his own disease."&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

On such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers "have had no deep spiritual experience", lacking "a comprehension of humanity, of life and death."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in ''Perspective'', Ralea asked: "Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a "great moral significance".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, pp. 187–188; Vianu, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral [[Romanian folklore]] and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and ''[[Doina|doine]]'' had naturally mutated into novellas.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, pp. 153, 154&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an "inflation of novels".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Marius Chivu]], [http://dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/carte/articol/granta-romania#"Granta de România"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 502, September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conformist Marxism===
In a 1945 interview with writer [[Ion Biberi]], Ralea explained himself as a [[Marxist humanism|Marxist humanist]], influenced by [[André Malraux]] and by unspecified "recent Russian doctrinaires".&lt;ref name="istnm28"/&gt; Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with "enthusiasm" by the masses: "[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand."&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived of a socialism wherein "man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to political scientist [[Ioan Stanomir]], Ralea's discourse is to be read as a "celebration of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Stanomir, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying [[Marxist aesthetics]] and [[Marxist literary criticism]], advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} G. Pienescu, [http://www.viataromaneasca.eu/arhiva/70_via-a-romaneasca-1-2-2011/49_note-din-launtru/793_sub-vremi.html "...sub vremi"], in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1&amp;ndash;2/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Christian Maner, "Noțiunea de Europa din perspectiva științei istorice românești", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on "class psychology", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were "surprisingly kept to a minimum".&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in his reedited ''Scrieri din trecut'', Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's [[social Darwinism]] with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with [[Lysenkoism|Michurinism]] and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Teodora Dumitru, "«Selecție» și «mutație»: două concepte pentru explicarea fenomenului literar", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. VII, Issue 2, 2011, pp. 44, 48, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaped by political command, ''Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman'' excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated "force", "triviality", and "sexual debauchery"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led "satisfactory" lives.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt; To his peers, Ralea complained that "the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret", and therefore prevented him from "elaborating valuable papers."&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; He "doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion", and tried to persuade [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censors]] not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;Zavarache, pp. 251, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Explicarea omului'', Vianu notes, Ralea brought up "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself ''obstacles'' and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis]."&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the "[[Élan vital|vital impulse]]", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt; Overall, Ralea contended that "[[dialectical materialism]] has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring". That answer was in "[[Base and superstructure|superstructures]]", and the references were Marx, [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], alongside [[Ludwig Klages]] and [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of [[psychological anthropology]], and merely showed "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism."&lt;ref name="feexpl418"/&gt; Contrarily, critic [[Antonio Patraș]] noted the links between ''Explicarea omului'' (a "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.&lt;ref name="apmorală3"/&gt;

''Sociologia succesului'' was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's ''[[The Division of Labour in Society|Division of Labor]]'', with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the [[social fact]] of "success" was created within that setting.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 547–548&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was heavily reliant on [[Marxist sociology]], hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them.&lt;ref&gt;A. Huhnwald, "Bibliographie. Ralea M., Hariton T., ''Sociologia succesului''", in ''Revue Française de Sociologie'', Nr. 2/1964, pp. 219–220&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to "the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was "not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Krau, ''Social and Economic Management in the Competitive Society'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 36–37.  {{ISBN|0-7923-8028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Romania, ''Sociologia succesului'' was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="Zavarache, p. 255"/&gt; It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"&gt;Zamfir ''et al.'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ralea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet [[Geo Dumitrescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Basiliade, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a career in letters, before becoming a [[Radio Romania International]] reporter and [[Romanian Television]] producer.&lt;ref name="acfresh"&gt;Alice Caster, "A Short, Fresh Look At Canadian Life", in ''[[The Ottawa Journal]]'', March 18, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 157; (2010), pp. 307, 517&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, including the first [[Moon landing]].&lt;ref&gt;"Un mare comentator sportiv – Ion Ghiţulescu", in ''Buletin de Istoria Presei'', Issues 8–9/2015, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from [[J. D. Salinger]] (which fed Romania's [[counterculture of the 1960s]])&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Brumaru]], "Crepusculul civil de dimineață. După lungi și dulci discuții...", in ''Suplimentul de Cultură'', Issue 133, June 2007, p. 11; Adina Popescu, "Literatura imaginarului", in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 115, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; With Eugenia Cîncea, she completed a best-selling translation of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which had five editions between 1962 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Andreea-Mihaela Tamba, "Translating vs. Rewriting during the Romanian Communist Period — Prefaces to Translations of ''Vanity Fair'' and ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Vol. IX, Issue 2, 2013, pp. 267, 268, 269&lt;/ref&gt; Against her father's wish,&lt;ref name="acfresh"/&gt; she married in 1958 the actor [[Emanoil Petruț]], who survived her by two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Loreta Popa, [http://jurnalul.ro/cultura/film/amintiri-din-copilarie-534042.html "Amintiri din copilărie"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', January 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]].&lt;ref&gt;Florin Mihăilescu, ''De la proletcultism la postmodernism'', Editura Pontica, Constanța, 2002, pp. 117–118.  {{ISBN|973-9224-63-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as [[Adrian Marino]]&lt;ref name="agutopia"/&gt; and [[Matei Călinescu]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Șerban Axinte]], "Modele ale criticii literare postbelice. E. Lovinescu, G. Ibrăileanu, G. Călinescu", in ''Philologica Jassyensia'', Nr. 2/2011, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by [[Alexandru Ivasiuc]], the novelist and Marxist literary theorist.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lovinescu, pp. 395–398&lt;/ref&gt; From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author [[Nicolae Steinhardt]]. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and [[Paul Zarifopol]] for their "quick wit".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Simion]], "Nicolae Steinhardt", in ''Caiete Critice'', Issues 1–2/2007, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]] and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the [[Diocese of Huși|Orthodox Diocese of Huși]], and came to host a convent.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Lazu, pp. 197, 325&lt;/ref&gt; By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed ''Mihai Ralea Institute''.&lt;ref&gt;"Guvernul României. Hotărârea nr. 503/1998 privind modificarea denumirii unor unități de cercetare din subordinea Academiei Române", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Part I, Nr. 307/1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.vrn.ro/biblioteca-husi-are-acum-intreaga-colectie-a-scrierilor-lui-mihai-ralea "Biblioteca Huși are acum întreaga colecție a scrierilor lui Mihai Ralea!"], in ''Vremea Nouă'', November 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Ralea's early sociological writings were republished, as ''Fenomenul Românesc'', in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Balázs Trencsényi, "Conceptualizarea caracterului național în tradiția intelectuală românească", in Neumann &amp; Heinen, pp. 355, 376&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by [[Constantin Schifirneț]] at [[Editura Albatros]].&lt;ref name="zavr187–188"/&gt; Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher [[Marin Nițescu]], was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism?&lt;ref&gt;Vasile (2010), pp. 21, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that "we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution".&lt;ref name="cz&amp;al7"/&gt;

'''NanoArt''' is a novel [[art]] discipline related to [[science]] and [[technology]]. It depicts natural or synthetic structures with features sized at the [[nanometer]] scale, which are observed by [[electron microscopy|electron]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]] techniques in scientific laboratories. The recorded two or three dimensional images and movies are processed for artistic appeal and presented to the general audience.

One of the aims of NanoArt is to familiarize people with [[nanoscale]] objects and advances in their synthesis and manipulation. NanoArt has been presented at traditional art exhibitions around the world. Besides, online competitions have been launched in the 2000s such as the “NANO” 2003 show at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and “Nanomandala”, the 2004 and 2005 installations in New York and Rome by [[Victoria Vesna]] and [[James Gimzewski]],&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{cite web|title= At the intersection of art and science: NANO|work= Los Angeles County Museum of Art|url=http://www.nisenet.org/catalog/exhibits/nano_-_los_angeles_county_museum_art_exhbition|author1=Vesna, V.  |author2=Gimzewski, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regular "Science as Art" section launched at the 2006 Materials Research Society Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org/science-as-art/ Science as Art]. mrs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomczyk2014"&gt;{{cite book| last=Tomczyk | first=Michael | title=NanoInnovation: What Every Manager Needs to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtGRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|date= 2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32672-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic example of nanoart is ''[[A Boy and His Atom]]'', a one-minute [[stop-motion animation|stop-motion animated]] film created in 2012 by [[IBM Research]] from 242 images sized by 45×25&amp;nbsp;nm, which were recorded with a [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. The movie tells the story of a boy and a wayward atom who meet and become friends. The film was accepted into the Tribeca Online Film Festival and shown at the New York Tech Meet-up and the World Science Festival.

Earlier in 2007 a book ''[[Teeny Ted from Turnip Town]]'' was created at the [[Simon Fraser University]] in Canada using a [[gallium]]-ion beam with a diameter of ~7 nanometers. The book contains 30 [[silicon]]-based pages sized by 0.07×0.10&amp;nbsp;mm; it was published in 100 copies and has an [[ISBN]] number.

In 2015, [[Jonty Hurwitz]] pioneered a new technique for creating nanosculpture using [[multiphoton lithography]] and [[photogrammetry]]. His work ''Trust'' was prepared in collaboration with [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] as the "Smallest Sculpture of a Human Form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.201502382 |author1=Yetisen, A.

'''''Out In South London''''' is a weekly arts and culture LGBT radio show broadcast on [[Resonance 104.4FM]] every Tuesday at 6.30pm. The show was devised and is presented by comedian [[Rosie Wilby]]. 

==History==
Out in South London was started by stand up comedian and musician, [[Rosie Wilby]], as a monthly show on [http://www.southcityradio.org/ South City Radio] in Peckham in December 2008. Rosie was inspired by shows like Out This Week on Radio 5 Live in the 1990s, where she once worked as a trainee reporter. The show transferred to Resonance 104.4FM in late 2009 as a weekly half hour show. The show was guest presented for two weeks in May 2012 by journalist and author [[Paul Burston]] who also appeared in the 2011 Christmas special. It is featured as an [[iTunes]] podcast under the category 'philosophy'. In 2013, the show went to a weekly full hour format, going out live each Tuesday between 6.30pm and 7.30pm. In March 2013 Out in South London was a 'community partner' of the [[London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival]].

'''Patrice Stellest''', (a.k.a. “Stellest”; born May 23, 1953) is a Swiss, [[Painting|painter]], [[sculptor]] and [[filmmaker]].

== Life and career ==
In 1970, with 16, Stellest leaves [[Switzerland]] and moves to the [[United States]], in Katchina, [[Arizona]], where he paints. At this time, he meets [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] Indians whose life [[philosophy]] and approach towards [[nature]] will inspire him for the rest of his career.  After a few years spent in the [[desert]], Patrice Stellest moves to [[California]]. Rapidly, he meets [[Charles LeMaire|Charles Lemaire]], costume designer for [[Marilyn Monroe]]. After seeing young Patrice’s early costume designs, Charles offers to teach him [[fashion]] and [[design]]. Already influenced by the work of [[Max Ernst]], Stellest foresees another path and declines the offer. Some time later, he receives a grant from the State of [[California]] and joins the experimental animation program at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], in Valencia. There, under the Supervision of [[Jules Engel]], chief animator of [[Walt Disney]]’s [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]] who becomes his mentor, he studies the techniques of experimental animation and photo-animation, working on such machines as the Oxberry Master Series. He is also offered the opportunity to produce his first animated work, “The lady bug that wanted to be a flower”, on [[Walt Disney]]’s first personal Oxberry.

Later on, he is accepted at [[Art Center College of Design]], in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[California]], where he studies [[Art]] and [[Cinematography]]. He then directs a series of short films mixing music and experimental art, convinced before his time of the great future of music videos. Following his idea, he is awarded the first prize of Art Center for his short “Portrait 1982”, which defends the place of women in the art world. He also directs a series of short films including “Animas” and “The Kimono”, and shows his work to the director of photography's team on [[Oliver Stone]]’s film “[[The Doors]]”, then in search of visual inspiration. 
In 1983, Stellest puts together a team in order to take part in the “Equinox” project of the Olympic Cultural Program of the city of [[Los Angeles]], with the collaboration of [[scientist]] Claude Michaux, who coordinated [[NASA]]’s [[Voyager program]] in Pasadena.

In 1984, Stellest moves to [[Paris]] with his life partner, Marie-Hélène. Together, they take over the studio of Pop artists Claus Oldenburg and [[James Rosenquist]]. The couple is expecting a happy event, when following the steps of [[Max Ernst]], they leave [[Paris]] for the Touraine region where Stellest learns alone the techniques of welding metal. In 1998, attracted to the [[South]] of [[France]], Stellest moves to Saint-Rémy-de-Provence where he enters a very busy time of his life. In 1992, he illustrates the [[book]] Grosse Beruhigte Körper edited by Druckhaus Galrev, that owed the German poet Ulrich Zieger the first [[poetry]] prize of united [[Germany]]. He also spends some time with French painter René Durbach, who will deeply affect his vision of the movement the French poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] called [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]]. He also paints the emblematic painting of his career as a painter “The Hug”.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/29671663&lt;/ref&gt;
During the same time, he improves his technique of metal sculpting by becoming the assistant of Greek sculptor Costa Coulentianos, and meets and shares his universe with [[César Baldaccini|Cesar]], [[Dora Maar]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Harald Szeemann]] or M. Tate ; who all encourage him to express his new ideas and concepts.

== Trans Nature Art ==
In 1992, Stellest has pioneered the first [[Renewable energy sculpture|renewable energy sculpture 'Solar Head"]] for his movement "Tran Nature Art".

In 1994, Stellest illustrates the novel ‘Schwartzland’ by Ulrich Zieger, published by Qwert Zui Opü, before pulling back to work on his new projects. During this time, he works with the assistant of [[Jean Tinguely]] Martin Bühler, and the artist physicist Bernard Gitton&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/groups/stellest/videos/28461780&lt;/ref&gt; on a new style of artworks carrying the message of protection of nature and the environment. The main sculpture of this movement is ‘The Solar Head”, built in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/groups/stellest/videos/29693301&lt;/ref&gt; Conceived to run on [[solar energy]] at its own [[rhythm]], this sculpture is the first Solar sculpture ever created, and the first of a long series of interactive sculptures allying cutting edge [[technology]] and the artist’s new message. In 1999, Stellest presents his work as part of a new movement, which he names Trans Nature Art when he exhibits at the Palace of the Arts in Marseille, [[France]]. Soon after that, he exhibits his work at the castle of Beatrice de Andia, Head of the Paris Arts Council at an exhibition organized around the theme of nature. Eventually, in 2001, he is the guest of [[Palexpo]], in [[Geneva]], where he officially presents Trans Nature Art (TNA) to the world. With this movement, Patrice Stellest is considered the founding father of the [[Renewable energy sculpture]] field of contemporary art.

In 2011, Stellest comes back on the art scene by producing a 3D animated short film ‘Stellest Genesis’”,&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/28987732&lt;/ref&gt; with dj [[Moby]]’s musical participation. He also illustrates Ulrich Zieger’s latest book ‘First visit to the refuge’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugerup.de/Aufwartungen+im+Geh%C3%A4us_AID3063.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031093651/http://www.rugerup.de/Aufwartungen+im+Geh%C3%A4us_AID3063.html |archivedate=2014-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Rugerup Editions. Later that year, he is invited as the artist in residence”&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/groups/stellest/videos/29694513&lt;/ref&gt;  of the city of Joué-lès-Tours, in France, during May 2011.

'''The ''Racławice Panorama''''' (Polish: ''Panorama racławicka'') is a monumental (15 × 114 meter) [[cyclorama|cycloramic]] [[painting]] depicting the [[Battle of Racławice]], during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]]. It is located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]. The painting is one of only a few preserved relics of a genre of 19th-century mass culture, and the oldest in Poland. The panorama stands in a circular fashion and, with the viewer in the center, presents different scenes at various viewing angles. A special kind of perspective used in the painting and additional effects (lighting, artificial terrain) create a feeling of reality.

== History ==
[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|Former location in [[Lviv]]]]
[[File:RotundaPanoramyRaclawickiej.jpg|thumb|Current location in [[Wrocław]]]]

The idea came from the painter [[Jan Styka]] in [[Lviv]] who invited the renowned battle-painter [[Wojciech Kossak]] to participate in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were assisted by [[Ludwik Boller]], [[Tadeusz Popiel]], [[Zygmunt Rozwadowski]], [[Teodor Axentowicz]], [[Włodzimierz Tetmajer]], [[Wincenty Wodzinowski]] and [[Michał Sozański]].

The project was conceived as a patriotic commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the victorious Battle of Racławice, a famous episode of the Kościuszko Insurrection, a heroic but ultimately failed attempt to defend Polish independence. The battle was fought on 4 April 1794 between the insurrectionist force of regulars and peasant volunteers ([[Kosynierzy|armed with scythes]]) under Kościuszko (1746–1817) himself and the [[Russia]]n army commanded by General [[Alexander Tormasov]]. For the nation which had lost its independence, the memory of this glorious victory was particularly important.

The National Exhibition, organized in Lviv in 1894, offered an excellent opportunity to realize Styka’s idea. Canvas, woven to order, was bought in Brussels, the specially built rotunda’s iron structure (designed by Ludwik Ramułt) in [[Vienna]]. The rotunda, located in Stryjski Park in Lviv, was ready in July 1893. The huge panorama painting was executed within 9 months, between August 1893 and May 1894. The official opening was on 5 June 1894. Since the very beginning, Panorama of the Battle of Racławice attracted enormous attention and brought crowds of tourists to Lviv. On average 75 000 viewers visited it every year.&lt;ref&gt;Romuald Nowak "Panorama racławicka", Muzeum Narodowe we Wrocławiu 1999/2010, {{ISBN|978-83-86766-41-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the painting was brought to Wrocław (formerly Breslau in Germany) along with a part of the collection of the Ossoliński Institution. As under the [[Communist]] regime the subject was considered politically sensitive, the efforts to have the canvas restored and exhibited, undertaken by successive Volunteer Committees, were successful only after August 1980. Reopened on 14 June 1985, the major attraction of the old Lviv has immediately become the main tourist attraction of Wrocław. Here, contemporary viewers have an opportunity to participate in a unique illusionist spectacle.

==Notable visitors==

Among the many guests who have visited the panorama are [[Pope John Paul II]]; [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix, the Queen of the Netherlands]]; [[Czesław Miłosz]], winner of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Racławice panorama 8 September 1894 and said "Imposant. Es hat mich frappirt."&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen]] said about this painting, "This is the most beautiful panorama I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Józef Piątek, Małgorzata Dolistowska, "Panorama racławicka", Wrocław 1988, {{ISBN|83-04-02757-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Ratoncito Pérez''' or '''Ratón Pérez''' (literally translated into English as ''Perez mouse'' or ''Perez the Mouse'') is a figure popular in [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] and [[Hispanic culture|Hispanic American cultures]], similar to the [[tooth fairy]], originating in [[Madrid]] in 1894. As is traditional in some English-speaking countries, when a child loses a tooth it is customary for him or her to place it under the pillow, so that Ratoncito Pérez will exchange it for a gift. The tradition is almost universal in Spanish cultures, but takes different forms in different areas. He is known as "Ratoncito Pérez" in Spanish speaking countries, with the exception of some regions of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru and Chile, where he is called "el Ratón de los Dientes" (The Tooth Mouse), and in Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Colombia, he is known simply as "El Ratón Pérez".

Similarly in the [[Philippines]], some Christian ethnic groups have the same allusion of a rat when they lose the teeth. However, unlike in the hispanic countries, the rat is not named.

The ''Ratoncito Pérez'' has been used in by [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] marketing in Venezuela, stars in the 2006 [[Argentina|Argentine]] movie [[El Ratón Pérez]], and appeared in the tale of [[the Vain Little Mouse]].

[[Image:Ratoncito placa.jpg|thumb|left|A commemorative plaque in Madrid, placed outside the warehouse where Ratoncito Pérez was said to have lived.]]

A mouse named ''Ratón Pérez'' or "ratonpérez" or "ratompérez" first appeared in "Cuentos, oraciones, adivinanzas y refranes populares" (1877), by Fernán Caballero, the pen name of Cecilia Böhl de Faber y Larrea, &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/153695.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in "La hormiguita" as her gentle and timid husband, as well as the husband of "La Ratita Presumida" (The Vain Little Mouse). This character would later inspire [[Luis Coloma]], who would make him part of the Spanish traditional folklore by turning him into a sort of Tooth Fairy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/raton/protagonistas01.htm |title=CVC. Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011|quote=He wrote works that were very well received by his readers: Pequeñeces, Boy, Jeromín... and children's stories, like Pelusa and Ratón Pérez, which were dedicated to his friends and pupils. Luis Coloma appears to be the first author to write a story featuring our famous mouse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Coloma was contracted to write a story for [[Alfonso XIII]], who had just lost his tooth at the age of 8.&lt;ref name=fotomadrid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotomadrid.com/ver/647 |title=Casa del Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011}}&lt;!-- Probably not a reliable source. Remove when we have a better one. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Coloma's story follows ''Ratoncito Pérez'' who lived with his family in a box of cookies in Madrid, but frequently ran away from home through the pipes of the city, and into the bedrooms of children who had lost their teeth. The story details how Ratoncito Pérez cunningly misleads any cats in the vicinity who may be lurking, and includes his interaction with King Buby ([[Maria Christina of Austria|Queen Maria Christina]]'s nickname for Alfonso XIII).

The city council of Madrid paid tribute to Ratoncito Pérez with a commemorative plaque outside the warehouse where the mouse was said to have lived. The plaque reads: "Here lived, in a box of cookies, Ratoncito Pérez, according to the story that the father Coloma wrote for the young King Alfonso XIII." Ratoncito Pérez thus became the first fictional character honored with a plaque by the Madrid City Council. Coloma's original manuscript, with his signature and a dedication to King Alfonso XIII, is now located in the vault of the Royal Palace Library.&lt;ref name=cvc03&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/raton/protagonistas03.htm |title=CVC. Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011|quote=The manuscript of Father Coloma, with his signature and a dedication to King Alfonso XIII, is bound in green leather with a gold brooch and gilt edges. It remains in the vault of the Royal Palace Library.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[File:Raton Perez (Cuento) pg 1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of the original ''Ratón Pérez'' by Luis Coloma, illustrated by [[Mariano Pedrero]]]]

Coloma's original story has been retold and adapted in various formats since it was published in the early 1900s. One such retelling was by [[Lady Moreton]] entitled "[[Perez the Mouse]]", which she published in 1915 and attributed to Coloma.&lt;ref name=cvc03 /&gt;

In 2006, the story was filmed under the title ''[[The Hairy Tooth Fairy|El Ratón Pérez]]'' (or ''Perez, the mouse of your dreams''), directed by [[Juan Pablo Buscarini]].&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0458076/ |title=El Ratón Pérez |accessdate=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ratoncito Pérez'' has been used in Colgate marketing in Venezuela,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |title=Producto.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020074258/http://www.producto.com.ve/productor/gdental.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the character appeared earlier in the tale of the Vain Little Mouse.

Other adaptations include ''[[El ratoncito Pérez]]'' by [[Olga Lecaye]] (1999), ''[[La mágica historia del Ratoncito Pérez]]'' by [[Fidel del Castillo]] (1996), ''[[¡S.O.S., salvad al ratoncito Pérez!]]'' by [[Eduardo Galán]] (1995), and ''[[Ratoncito Pérez, en Vuelo de Cometas]]'' by [[Vicenta Fernández Martín]] (1999).&lt;ref name=cvc03 /&gt;

Raton Perez makes an appearance in [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s film ''[[Rise of the Guardians]]'', when one of the Tooth Fairy's mini fairies finds him at works and tackles him before the Tooth Fairy stops the fight

Handy Manny episode "Julieta's Tooth" makes mention of "Mr. Perez" among other nicknames for the "tooth Mouse" to take her tooth after Manny retrieves it from the sink trap.

'''Ray&lt;!-- Please do not change to Raymond - it is unreferenced and incorrect - confirmed at OTRS 2016100910006885--&gt; Douglas Bradbury''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|æ|d|b|ər|i}}; August 22, 1920{{spaced ndash}}June 5, 2012) was an American [[author]] and [[screenwriter]]. He worked in a variety of genres, including [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[horror fiction|horror]], and [[mystery fiction]].

Widely known for his [[dystopia]]n novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), and his science-fiction and horror-story collections, ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' (1950), ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (1951), and ''[[I Sing the Body Electric (short story collection)|I Sing the Body Electric]]'' (1969), Bradbury was one of the most celebrated 20th- and 21st-century American writers. While most of his best known work is in [[speculative fiction]], he also wrote in other genres, such as the coming-of-age novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'' (1957) and the fictionalized memoir ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'' (1992).

Recipient of numerous awards, including a 2007 [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Citation]], Bradbury also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including ''[[Moby Dick (1956)|Moby Dick]]'' and ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]''. Many of his works were adapted to comic book, television, and film formats.

Upon his death in 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream".&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|title=Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/books/ray-bradbury-popularizer-of-science-fiction-dies-at-91.html|date=June 6, 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|left|Bradbury as a senior in high school, 1938]]

Although he was named after Rae Williams, a cousin on his father's side, Ray Bradbury's birth certificate spells his first name as "Ray".&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the middle name "Douglas" after the actor [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. Bradbury was related to the American [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] scholar Douglas Spaulding&lt;ref&gt;The Spaulding Family Memorial, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; and descended from [[Mary Bradbury]], who was tried at one of the [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jonathan|title=Becoming Ray Bradbury|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2011|page=202|isbn=0252036298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury". Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition" 2001:1–5. EBSCO. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury's works of fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes "Green Town", Illinois.

The Bradbury family lived in [[Tucson, Arizona]], during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14 years old. The family arrived with only US$40, which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week. This meant that they could stay, and Bradbury—who was in love with Hollywood—was ecstatic.&lt;!--TONE!--&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury attended [[Los Angeles High School]] and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative and talented people Bradbury met were special-effects pioneer [[Ray Harryhausen]] and radio star [[George Burns]]. Bradbury's first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the '' [[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2010/08/18/ray-bradbury-has-the-most-amazing-dreams-i-write-screenplays-he-says-with-a-wink-in-the-middle-of-the-night-when-he-wa/ Ray Bradbury's close encounters with W.C.

==Influences==

===Literature===
Throughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton. American Writers Supplement IV. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and knew at a young age that he was "going into one of the arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury| title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203| last=Weller| first=Sam| date=2010-01-01| newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 11 (1931), during the [[Great Depression]] — sometimes writing on the only available paper, butcher paper.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In his youth, he spent much time in the [[List of Carnegie libraries in Illinois|Carnegie library]] in Waukegan, reading such authors as [[H. G. Wells]], [[Jules Verne]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. At 12, Bradbury began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|last=Weller|first=Sam|date=2010-01-01|newspaper=Paris Review| issue=192| issn=0031-2037| access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to comics, he loved [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], creator of ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Authors Online. ''Ray Bradbury''. Detroit: Gale, 2009. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; especially Burroughs' [[John Carter of Mars]] series. ''[[The Warlord of Mars]]'' impressed him so much that at the age of 12, he wrote his own sequel.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Terry. Magill's Survey of American Literature. Revised Edition. Pasadena: Salem Press, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', and every night when the show went off the air, he would sit and write the entire script from memory.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend science-fiction writer [[Bob Olsen]], sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]].&lt;ref&gt;The article linked appears in the source, but this name conflicts with the group's web site.&lt;/ref&gt; Excited to find there were others sharing his interest, Bradbury joined a weekly Thursday-night conclave at age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Big Read| url=http://www.neabigread.org/books/fahrenheit451/fahrenheit451_04.php| publisher=Neabigread.org| accessdate=July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury cited H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as his primary science-fiction influences. Bradbury identified with Verne, saying, "He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury interview – The art of Fiction No. 203] ''The Paris Review''; Spring, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading science-fiction books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included [[Alexander Pope]] and poet [[John Donne]].&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; Bradbury had just graduated from high school when he met Robert Heinlein, then 31 years old. Bradbury recalled, "He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

In young adulthood Bradbury read stories published in ''Astounding Science Fiction'', and read everything by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and the early writings of [[Theodore Sturgeon]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]].

===Hollywood===
The family lived about four blocks from the Uptown Theater on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for [[MGM]] and [[20th Century Fox|Fox]]. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He rollerskated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, "hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious." Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were [[Norma Shearer]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and [[Ronald Colman]]. Sometimes, he spent all day in front of [[Paramount Pictures]] or [[Columbia Pictures]] and then skated to the [[Brown Derby]] to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing [[Cary Grant]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], and [[Mae West]], whom he learned made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_playboy.html |title=About Ray Bradbury Interview|work=Playboy|year= 1996|author=Ken Kelley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury relates the following meeting with [[Sergei Bondarchuk]], director of Soviet epic film series ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]'', at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk's honor:

{{quote|They formed a long queue and as Bondarchuk was walking along it he recognized several people: "Oh Mr. Ford, I like your film." He recognized the director, Greta Garbo, and someone else. I was standing at the very end of the queue and silently watched this. Bondarchuk shouted to me; "Ray Bradbury, is that you?" He rushed up to me, embraced me, dragged me inside, grabbed a bottle of [[Stolichnaya]], sat down at his table where his closest friends were sitting. All the famous Hollywood directors in the queue were bewildered. They stared at me and asked each other "Who is this Bradbury?" And, swearing, they left, leaving me alone with Bondarchuk...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2012/06/06/ray_bradbury_russians_have_an_unparalleled_capacity_for_love_15822.html|title=Ray Bradbury: "Russians have an unparalleled capacity for love"|publisher=Russia Beyond The Headlines |website=www.rbth.ru|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Career==
[[File:Amazing stories 194412.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bradbury's "Undersea Guardians" was the cover story for the December 1944 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]
Bradbury's first published story was "[[Hollerbochen's Dilemma]]", which appeared in the January 1938 number of [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest J. Ackerman's]] [[fanzine]] ''Imagination!''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; In July 1939, Ackerman and his then-girlfriend [[Morojo]] gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the [[1st World Science Fiction Convention|First World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[New York City]], and funded Bradbury's fanzine, titled ''[[Futuria Fantasia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raybradbury.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000825.html Marguerite bradbury – Ray Bradbury Discussion] Ray Bradbury Official website&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each limited to under 100 copies. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to [[Rob Wagner]]'s film magazine, ''Script''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury|title=Ray Bradbury, The Art of Fiction No. 203|work=The Paris Review|date=Spring 2010|author=Sam Weller }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was free to start a career in writing, when owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected admission into the military during [[World War II]]. Having been inspired by science-fiction heroes such as [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Buck Rogers]], Bradbury began to publish science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. Bradbury was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to attend the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]], which at the time met at [[Clifton's Cafeteria]] in downtown Los Angeles. This was where he met the writers [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Emil Petaja]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Leigh Brackett]], and [[Jack Williamson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1939, Bradbury joined [[Laraine Day]]'s Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years, he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, "so incredibly bad" that he gave up playwriting for two decades.&lt;ref name="bradbury1972"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Veldt|publisher=Dramatic Publishing|author=Bradbury, Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury| year=1972| location=Woodstock, Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YP_awFRqToC&amp;pg=PA4| page=4| isbn=1-58342-028-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury's first paid piece, "Pendulum", written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine ''Super Science Stories'' in November 1941, for which he earned $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s9.com/Biography/Bradbury-Raymond-Douglas| title=Biographies: Bradbury, Raymond Douglas|publisher=s9.com|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury sold his first story, "The Lake", for $13.75 at 22, and became a full-time writer by 24.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt; His first collection of short stories, ''[[Dark Carnival (short story collection)|Dark Carnival]]'', was published in 1947 by [[Arkham House]], a small press in [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]], owned by writer [[August Derleth]]. Reviewing ''Dark Carnival'' for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Will Cuppy]] proclaimed Bradbury "suitable for general consumption" and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasy author [[John Collier (fiction writer)|John Collier]].&lt;ref&gt;Cuppy, Will, "Review of Dark Carnival," ''New York Herald Tribune Books'', May 25, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a rejection notice from the pulp ''[[Weird Tales]]'', Bradbury submitted "Homecoming" to ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', which was spotted by a young editorial assistant named [[Truman Capote]]. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. ''Homecoming'' won a place in the [[O. Henry Award]] Stories of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/ray-bradbury-from-truman-capote-to-a-t-m-s/ Ray Bradbury, From Truman Capote to A.T.M.’s], by Dean Robinson – 6th floor; ''The New York Times'', June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[UCLA]]'s [[Powell Library]], in a study room with typewriters for rent, Bradbury wrote his classic story of a [[book burning]] future, ''The Fireman'', which was about 25,000 words long. It was later published at about 50,000 words under the name ''Fahrenheit 451'', for a total cost of $9.80, due to the library's typewriter-rental fees of ten cents per half-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=A Bruin Birthday Tribute To Ray Bradbury Tweet|url=http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|title=First Spark: Ray Bradbury Turns 90; The Universe and UCLA Academy Celebrate|publisher=Spotlight.ucla.edu|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005161805/http://www.spotlight.ucla.edu/ray-bradbury/|archivedate=October 5, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with the British expatriate writer [[Christopher Isherwood]] gave Bradbury the opportunity to put ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood's glowing review&lt;ref name="CI50"&gt;{{Citation| last=Isherwood| first=Christopher| author-link=Christopher Isherwood| title=A Review of ''The Martian Chronicles''| journal=Tomorrow| volume=10| pages=56–58| date=October 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed.

==Writing==
Bradbury attributed two incidents to his lifelong habit of writing every day. The first of these, occurring when he was three years old, was his mother's taking him to see [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s performance in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, Robert J. "Ray Bradbury." Critical Survey of Short Fiction, Second Revised Edition (2001): UFO. November 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The second incident occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, touched the young man on the nose with an electrified sword, made his hair stand on end, and shouted, "Live forever!"&lt;ref name="IHW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/inhiswords02.html|title=In His Words| publisher=RayBradbury.com| accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury remarked, "I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico...[he] gave me a future...I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago."&lt;ref name="IHW"/&gt; At that age, Bradbury first started to do [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], which was his first great love. If he had not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Sanders' film Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have with his favorite poets and writers [[Robert Frost]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. From Steinbeck, he said he learned "how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment". He studied [[Eudora Welty]] for her "remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line". Bradbury's favorite writers growing up included [[Katherine Anne Porter]], who wrote about the American South, [[Edith Wharton]], and [[Jessamyn West (writer)|Jessamyn West]].&lt;ref name="Paris Review"&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury The Art of Fiction No. 203: Ray Bradbury], Interviewed by Sam Weller; ''The Paris Review'', Spring 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was once described as a "[[Midwest]] [[surrealism|surrealist]]" and is often labeled a science-fiction writer, which he described as "the art of the possible." Bradbury resisted that categorization, however:

{{quote|First of all, I don't write science fiction. I've only done one science fiction book and that's ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', based on reality. Science fiction is a depiction of the real. Fantasy is a depiction of the unreal. So ''[[Martian Chronicles]]'' is not science fiction, it's fantasy. It couldn't happen, you see? That's the reason it's going to be around a long time -- because it's a [[Greek myth]], and myths have staying power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Wil Gerken |author2=Nathan Hendler |author3=Doug Floyd |author4=John Banks |url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/09-27-99/alibi_feat1.html |title=Books: Grandfather Time (Weekly Alibi . 09-27-99) |publisher=Weeklywire.com |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at the beach and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmolearning.com/videos/a-conversation-with-ray-bradbury-2001-1131/ A Conversation with Ray Bradbury] Point Loma Nazarene University, Writer's Symposium By The Sea; "The only science fiction I have written is ''Fahrenheit 451''.

I am a fantasy writer. But the label got put on me and stuck." March 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

When later asked about the lyrical power of his prose, Bradbury replied, "From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who’ve said things well." He is quoted, "If you're reluctant to weep, you won't live a full and complete life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/06/personal_lessons_from_futurist.html Personal lessons from futurist Ray Bradbury on crying, escaping, laughing], by Mick Mortlock; Oregon Live, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, Bradbury was active in both the poetry club and the drama club, continuing plans to become an actor, but becoming serious about his writing as his high school years progressed. Bradbury graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh, and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceagecity.com/bradbury/bio.htm Ray Bradbury Biography] Ray Bradbury Online&lt;/ref&gt; The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing,&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton, and Molly Weigel, eds. American Writers (Supp. 4, Pt. 1). New York: Macmillian Library Reference. 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:
{{quote| Libraries raised me. I don't believe in colleges and universities. I believe in libraries because most students don't have any money. When I graduated from high school, it was during the [[Great Depression|Depression]] and we had no money. I couldn't go to college, so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years.&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2009-06-19"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-1988oct01&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-01/local/me-4256_1_central-library "Mayor, Author Launch Library Funding Drive"]. [[Los Angeles Times]], October 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He told ''[[The Paris Review]]'', "You can't learn to write in college. It's a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do – and they don’t."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Ray Bradbury Interview] ''The Paris Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury described his inspiration as, "My stories run up and bite me in the leg -- I respond by writing them down -- everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off".&lt;ref&gt;Garg, Anu, A  Word a Day, 2017.08.22, wordsmith.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Green Town"===
A reinvention of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often juxtaposed as a contrasting backdrop to tales of fantasy or menace. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics ''Dandelion Wine'', ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', and ''Farewell Summer'', as well as in many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury's favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summer Morning, Summer Night by Ray Bradbury|url=https://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|website=Subterranean Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822143044/http://subterraneanpress.com/store/product_detail/summer_morning_summer_night|archivedate=August 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most definitive usage of the pseudonym for his hometown, in ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively about Green Town, Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.&lt;ref&gt;Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where  his grandfather and he gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural contributions==
Bradbury wrote many short essays on the culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that ''Fahrenheit 451'' touches on the alienation of people by media:
{{quote|In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'' I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap opera cries, [[sleep walking]], helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bradbury stated the novel worked as a critique of the later development of [[political correctness]]:
{{quote|How does the story of ''Fahrenheit 451'' stand up in 1994?&lt;br&gt;
R.B.: It works even better because we have political correctness now. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can’t say certain  things. The homosexual groups don’t want you to criticize them. It’s thought control and freedom of speech control.&lt;ref name="Conversations with Ray Bradbury"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gasior |first1=Ann |title=Bradbury Talk Likely to Feature the Unexpected |url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:168044/datastream/PDF/view |website=Florida State University Libraries |publisher=Dayton Daily News |accessdate=2 June 2018 |pages=104–105 |language=English |date=1 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a 1982 essay, he wrote, "People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it". This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/10/19/prevent-the-future/ |title=I Do Not Want to Predict the Future. I Want to Prevent It| publisher=Quote Investigator |accessdate=February 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sometimes attributed it to him.

On May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on television in Hollywood on the popular quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' hosted by [[Groucho Marx]].  During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", his short story published six years earlier in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' under the title "The World the Children Made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBTrUx46b8I|title=You Bet Your Life #55-35 Science fiction author Ray Bradbury (Secret word 'House', May 24, 1956)|date=November 16, 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a consultant for the American Pavilion at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nywf64.com/unista09.shtml|title=The American Journey|first=Ray |last=Bradbury}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the original exhibit housed in [[Epcot]]'s [[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]] geosphere at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]].&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Bradbury|title=In 1982 he created the interior metaphors for the Spaceship Earth display at Epcot Center, Disney World|url= http://www.raybradbury.com/bio.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Bradbury, Spaceship Earth 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_town_talk.html|author=Ray Bradbury|title=The images at Spaceship Earth in DisneyWorld's EPCOT Center in Orlando?

"He also serves as a consultant, having collaborated, for example, in the design of a pavilion in the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World." Referring to Spaceship Earth&amp;nbsp;... [http://www.raybradbury.com/articles_book_mag.html raybradbury.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradbury concentrated on detective fiction in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Litz, A. Walton., and Molly V. Weigel. American Writers: a Collection of Literary Biographies. New York: Scribner, 1996. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he also hosted ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', a televised [[anthology series]] based on his short stories.

Bradbury was a strong supporter of public library systems, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said "libraries raised me", and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/20/us/20ventura.html|title=A Literary Legend Fights for a Local Library|date=June 19, 2009|accessdate=June 7, 2012|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote, "I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, 'Oh my God, I'm so afraid.' I hate people like that – I call them the neo-[[Luddites]]", and "In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too".&lt;ref name="lemley19850108"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwjS--W2mG8C&amp;pg=PA133 | title=Other Voices, Other Futures | work=PC Magazine | date=January 8, 1985 | accessdate=October 28, 2013 | author=Lemley, Brad | page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resisted the conversion of his work into [[e-book]]s, saying in 2010, "We have too many cellphones. We've got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15968500|title=Fahrenheit 451 becomes e-book despite author's feelings|publisher=BBC News |date=November 30, 2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the publishing rights for ''Fahrenheit 451'' came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon &amp; Schuster catalog where this is possible.&lt;ref name="time obit"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| title='Fahrenheit 451' Author Ray Bradbury Dies at 91| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=June 6, 2012|first=Robert|last=Jablon|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608233645/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/06/farenheit-451-author-ray-bradbury-dies-at-91/| archivedate=June 8, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury's stories. Particularly noted among these were [[EC Comics]]' line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury about it led to the company paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury's stories included ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', ''Weird Science'', ''Weird Fantasy'', ''Crime Suspenstories'', and ''Haunt of Fear''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy, as well as literary. Bradbury headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-ray-bradbury-theater-20120606,0,3881510.story Ray Bradbury, 91, leaves a rich theatrical legacy too] by David Ng; Los Angeles Times, June 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s-1960s era: [[Jason V Brock]]'s ''Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone's Magic Man'',&lt;ref&gt;French, Lawrence [http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/03/richard-matheson-remembers-his-good-friend-charles-beaumont/ "Richard Matheson remembers his good friend Charles Beaumont"], March 24, 2010. Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; which details his troubles with [[Rod Serling]], and his friendships with writers [[Charles Beaumont]], [[George Clayton Johnson]], and most especially his dear&lt;!--TONE!--&gt; friend [[William F. Nolan]], as well as Brock's ''The AckerMonster Chronicles!'', which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent, close friend, mega-fan,&lt;!--TONE!--&gt; and ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' editor [[Forrest J Ackerman]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Bradbury's legacy was celebrated by the bookstore [[Fahrenheit 451 Books]] in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. The grand opening of an annex to the store was attended by Bradbury and his favorite illustrator, [[Joseph Mugnaini]], in the mid-1980s. The shop closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop with the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Riegert, ''Hidden Coast of California: The Adventurer's Guide'' (Berkeley, Cal.: Ulysses Press, 1988), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s and 90s, Bradbury served on the advisory board of the [[Los Angeles Student Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=National Student Film Institute/L.A:  The Sixteenth Annual Los Angeles Student Film Festival|date=June 10, 1994|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|pages=10–11|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Editor|title=Los Angeles Student Film Institute: 13th Annual Student Film Festival|date=June 7, 1991|location=The Directors Guild Theatre|page=3|accessdate=6 January 2018|ref=Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Ray Bradbury 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury in December 2009]]
Bradbury was married to Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922&amp;nbsp;– November 24, 2003) from 1947 until her death; they had four daughters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9315001/Ray-Bradbury.html |title=Telegraph obituary |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate= June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan, Ramona, Bettina, and Alexandra.&lt;ref name="BBC dies"/&gt; Bradbury never obtained a [[driver's license]], but relied on public transportation or his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle |first=Warren |url=http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |title=Sci-Fi Author Ray Bradbury Trashes the Web |publisher=Switched |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=December 9, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001142931/http://www.switched.com/2009/06/25/author-ray-bradbury-on-the-web-not-real-its-in-the-air-somew/ |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived at home until he was 27 and married. His wife of 56 years, Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman Bradbury ever dated.&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

He was raised [[Baptist]] by his parents, who were themselves infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury considered himself a "delicatessen religionist" who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was "a God-given thing, and I'm so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is 'At play in the fields of the Lord.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/08/02/Bradbury/index.html| title=Sci-fi legend Ray Bradbury on God, 'monsters and angels'| publisher=CNN| date=August 2, 2010| accessdate=October 14, 2015| first=John| last=Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury was a close friend of [[Charles Addams]], and Addams illustrated the first of Bradbury's stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams' own [[Addams Family]] placed in rural [[Illinois]]. Bradbury's first story about them was "Homecoming", published in the 1946 Halloween issue of ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', with Addams' illustrations. Addams and he planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family's complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray Interview with Ray Bradbury] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203203807/http://www.indiebound.org/author-interviews/bradburyray |date=February 3, 2009 }} in ''IndieBound'', fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, ''[[From the Dust Returned]]'', featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original "Homecoming" illustration.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Ray, ''From The Dust Returned: A Novel''. William Morrow, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another close friend was animator [[Ray Harryhausen]], who was [[best man]] at Bradbury's wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitaker |first=Sheila |title=Ray Harryhausen obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/07/ray-harryhausen-dies |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a [[BAFTA]] 2010 awards tribute in honor of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke of his first meeting Harryhausen at Forrest J Ackerman's house when they were both 18 years old. Their shared love for science fiction, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', and the [[King Vidor]]-directed film ''[[The Fountainhead (film)|The Fountainhead]]'', written by [[Ayn Rand]], was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired the pair to believe in themselves and affirm their career choices. After their first meeting, they kept in touch at least once a month, in a friendship that spanned over 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BAFTA Online|title=Ray Bradbury pays Tribute to Ray Harryhausen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wv3KiAVUOhE&amp;t=2m48s|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite what he described as the "devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends." Among the losses that deeply grieved Bradbury was the death of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], who was an intimate friend for many years. They remained close friends for nearly three decades after Roddenberry asked him to write for ''Star Trek'', which Bradbury never did, objecting that he "never had the ability to adapt other people's ideas into any sensible form."&lt;ref name="playboy"/&gt;

==Bibliography==
[[File:Planet stories 195311.jpg|thumb|upright|Bradbury's "The Golden Apples of the Sun" was published in the November 1953 issue of ''[[Planet Stories]]''.]]
{{Main|Ray Bradbury bibliography|Ray Bradbury short fiction bibliography}}
Bradbury is credited with writing 27 novels and over 600 short stories.&lt;ref name="latimes obit"/&gt; More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120606"/&gt;

===First novel===
In 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, "You could call it ''The Martian Chronicles''." Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became ''The Martian Chronicles.''&lt;ref name="Paris Review"/&gt;

===Intended first novel===
What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pspublishing.co.uk/dandelion-wine-50th-anniversary-ed-signed-2-vol-sc-by-ray-bradbury--stephen-king-out-of-print-1022-p.asp Summer Morning, Summer Night], by Ray Bradbury; PS Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations to other media==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Ray Bradbury 1959.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bradbury in 1959, when some of his short stories were adapted for television shows like ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'']]
From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury's stories were adapted by [[Al Feldstein]] for [[EC Comics]] (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including "Kaleidoscope" and "Rocket Man" being combined as "Home To Stay" - for which Bradbury was retroactively paid - and EC's first version of "The Handler" under the title "A Strange Undertaking") and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, ''[[The Autumn People]]'' (1965) and ''[[Tomorrow Midnight]]'' (1966), both published by [[Ballantine Books]] with cover illustrations by [[Frank Frazetta]].
Also in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury's stories were televised in several anthology shows, including ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Lights Out (radio show)|Lights Out]]'', ''Out There'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[CBS Television Workshop]]'', ''[[Fireside Theater|Jane Wyman's Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Star Tonight]]'', ''Windows'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. "The Merry-Go-Round", a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury's "The Black Ferris", praised by ''Variety'', was shown on ''Starlight Summer Theater'' in 1954 and NBC's ''Sneak Preview'' in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies ''[[Dimension X (radio program)|Dimension X]]'' and its successor ''[[X Minus One]]''.

[[File:Rhedosaurus &amp; the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'', based on Bradbury's ''[[The Fog Horn]]'']]

Producer [[William Alland]] first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'', a [[Harry Essex]] screenplay developed from Bradbury's screen treatment "Atomic Monster". Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié's ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury's "[[The Fog Horn]]", about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury's close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story, "Tyrannosaurus Rex", about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury's stories or screenplays.
Bradbury was hired in 1953 by director [[John Huston]] to work on the screenplay for his film version of [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), which stars [[Gregory Peck]] as Captain Ahab, [[Richard Basehart]] as Ishmael, and [[Orson Welles]] as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury's book ''[[Green Shadows, White Whale]]'', a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury's dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], were filmed.

Bradbury's short story ''I Sing the Body Electric'' (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the [[I Sing the Body Electric (The Twilight Zone)|100th episode of ''The Twilight Zone'']]. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.

In 1965, three of Bradbury's stories were adapted for the stage. These included "The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit", "The Day It Rained Forever", and "Device Out of Time". The last was adapted from his 1957 novel ''Dandelion Wine''. The plays debuted at the Coronet Theater in Hollywood and featured [[Booth Coleman]], [[Joby Baker]], Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, [[Keith Taylor (actor)|Keith Taylor]], [[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull]], Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, [[F. Murray Abraham]], Anne Loos, and [[Len Lesser]]. The director was Charles Rome Smith and the production company was Pandemonium Productions.

[[Oskar Werner]] and [[Julie Christie]] starred in ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury's novel directed by [[François Truffaut]].

In 1966, Bradbury helped [[Lynn Garrison]] create ''AVIAN'', a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem, "Planes That Land on Grass".

In 1969, ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' was brought to the big screen, starring [[Rod Steiger]], [[Claire Bloom]], and [[Robert Drivas]]. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the [[The Illustrated Man (film)|film version]], to compose a [[cantata]] ''[[Christus Apollo]]'' based on Bradbury's text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes |last=Goldsmith |first=Jerry |date=2002 |title=Jerry Goldsmith: Christus Apollo |type=CD |publisher=[[Telarc International Corporation|Telarc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work premiered in late 1969, with the [[California Chamber Symphony]] performing with narrator [[Charlton Heston]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]].

''[[The Martian Chronicles (TV miniseries)|The Martian Chronicles]]'' became a three-part TV [[miniseries]] starring [[Rock Hudson]], which was first broadcast by [[NBC]] in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries "just boring".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York| publisher=HarperCollins| year=2005| pages=301–302| isbn=0-06-054581-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 television movie ''[[The Electric Grandmother]]'' was based on Bradbury's short story "I Sing the Body Electric".

The 1983 horror film ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', starring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]], is based on the Bradbury novel of the [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|same name]].

In 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced "[[Bradbury 13]]", a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of "The Ravine", "Night Call, Collect", "[[The Veldt (short story)|The Veldt]]", "There Was an Old Woman", "Kaleidoscope", "[[Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed]]", "The Screaming Woman", "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", "The Man", "The Wind", "The Fox and the Forest", "[[Here There Be Tygers]]", and "The Happiness Machine". Voiceover actor [[Paul Frees]] provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a [[Peabody Award]] and two Gold Cindy awards, and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] on June 12, 2011.

From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] anthology television series, ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.

Deeply respected in the [[USSR]], Bradbury's fiction has been adapted into five episodes of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] science-fiction TV series ''This Fantastic World'' which adapted the stories film version of "I Sing The Body Electric", ''Fahrenheit 451'', "A Piece of Wood", "To the Chicago Abyss", and "Forever and the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtrf.ru/|title=State fund of Television and Radio Programs|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of [[There Will Come Soft Rains (short story)|There Will Come Soft Rains]] («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] director Nazim Tyuhladziev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|script-title=ru:Будет ласковый дождь|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909130617/http://www.kinomaniac.ru/movie.php?id=1366|archivedate=September 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a film adaptation of [[The Veldt (film)|''The Veldt'' in 1987]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raybradbury.ru/video-stage/video/the_veldt/|script-title=ru:"Вельд", Киностудия "Узбекфильм", 1987|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of "[[Here There Be Tygers]]" («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Мультипликационные фильмы|url=http://mebu.ru/stf/catalog.php?fl=1&amp;letter=%c7|website=Творческое объединение «Экран»|accessdate=14 August 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of ''[[The Halloween Tree (1993 TV film)|The Halloween Tree]]'', based on [[The Halloween Tree|his 1972 novel]].

The 1998 film ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', released by [[Touchstone Pictures]], was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story "The Magic White Suit" originally published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.

In 2002, Bradbury's own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of ''Fahrenheit 451'' at Burbank's Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20050827043730/http://sromagazine.biz/mag/one_hot_stage/index.html Pixel Pups].

In 2005, the film ''[[A Sound of Thunder (film)|A Sound of Thunder]]'' was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'' revolves around the same theory as ''A Sound of Thunder'' and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of ''A Piece of Wood'' and ''[[The Small Assassin]]'' were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] for using the title ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', which is an allusion to Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', for his documentary about the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore's use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated,  though Bradbury was [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative-leaning]] politically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/301992/ray-bradbury-great-conservative-john-fund|title=Ray Bradbury, a Great Conservative|publisher=Nationalreview.com|date=June 6, 2012|author=Fund, John|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film's release to apologize, saying that the film's marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Sam|last=Weller|title=The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2005|pages=330–331|isbn=0-06-054581-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the film ''[[Ray Bradbury's Chrysalis]]'' was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.

In 2010, ''The Martian Chronicles'' was adapted for radio by ''Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air''.

Bradbury's works and approach to writing are documented in [[Terry Sanders]]' film ''Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer'' (1963).

[[File:Godzilla Raids Again (1955) Godzilla vs Anguirus.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'' film franchise, which began in 1954, was rebooted four times (in [[The Return of Godzilla|1984]], [[Godzilla 2000|1999]], [[Godzilla (2014 film)|2014]] and [[Shin Godzilla|2016]]).

==Origin==
The term is thought to originate from the computing term ''[[reboot]]'', meaning to restart a computer system.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt;

==Types==
Reboots cut out non-essential elements associated with a pre-established franchise and start it anew, distilling it down to the core elements that made the source material popular.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norris|first1=Erik|title=Why Franchise Reboots Can Be A Good Thing|url=http://www.mandatory.com/fun/456007-why-franchise-reboots-can-be-a-good-thing|website=Mandatory|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=June 6, 2018|date=March 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For audiences, reboots allow easier entry for newcomers unfamiliar with earlier titles in a series.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

===Comic books===
In comic books, a long-running title may have its continuity erased in order to start over from the beginning, enabling writers to redefine characters and open up new story opportunities, and allowing the title to bring in new readers.&lt;ref name="Willits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lorendiac|title=Lorendiac’s Lists: The DC Reboots Since Crisis on Infinite Earths|url=http://www.cbr.com/lorendiacs-lists-the-dc-reboots-since-crisis-on-infinite-earths|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic books sometimes use an [[Fictional universe|in-universe]] explanation for a reboot, such as merging parallel worlds and timelines together, or destroying a fictional universe and recreating it from the beginning.&lt;ref name="Crisis"&gt;''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #1-12 (April 1985 – March 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flashpoint"&gt;''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' #1-5 (May – September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'' #4-0 (Sept. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
With reboots, filmmakers revamp and reinvigorate a film series in order to attract new fans and stimulate revenue.&lt;ref name="Parfitt"/&gt; A reboot can renew interest in a series that has grown stale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vasquez |first1=Zach |title=Beyond the grave: what's next for the horror reboot? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/halloween-horror-reboots-upcoming-pet-sematary-it |accessdate=October 25, 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots act as a safe project for a studio, as a reboot with an established fanbase is less risky (in terms of expected profit) than an entirely original work, while at the same time allowing the studio to explore new demographics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billington|first1=Alex|title=Sunday Discussion: The Mighty Hollywood Reboot Trend|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/sunday-discussion-the-mighty-hollywood-reboot-trend/|website=FirstShowing.net|accessdate=August 20, 2013|date=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reboots also allow directors and producers to cast a new set of younger actors for the familiar roles of a film series in order to attract a younger audience.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Unlike a remake, however, a reboot often presupposes a working familiarity on the part of the audience with the original work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Television===

'''Robert Blair''' (17 April 1699 – 4 February 1746) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]]. His fame rests upon his poem ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'', which, in a later printing was illustrated by [[William Blake]].

==Biography==
[[File:William Blake - The Skeleton Reanimated.jpg|thumb|'The Skeleton Reanimated', one of [[William Blake]]'s illustrations for ''The Grave'']]
He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Blair, one of the king's chaplains, and was born at [[Edinburgh]]. He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and in the [[Netherlands]], and in 1731 was appointed to the living of Athelstaneford in [[East Lothian]]. In 1738, he married Isabella, daughter of Professor William Law, with whom he had six children. His family's wealth gave him leisure for his favourite pursuits: gardening and the study of English poets.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Blair published only three poems. One was a commemoration of his father-in-law and another was a translation. His reputation rests entirely on his third work, ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'' (1743), which is a poem written in [[blank verse]] on the subject of death and the graveyard. It is much less conventional than its gloomy title might lead one to expect. Its religious subject no doubt contributed to its great popularity, especially in Scotland, where it gave rise to the so-called [[graveyard poets|"graveyard school" of poetry]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The poem extends to 767 lines of various merit, in some passages rising to great sublimity, and in others sinking to commonplace.

The poem is now best known for the illustrations created by [[William Blake]] following a commission from [[Robert Cromek]]. Blake's designs were engraved by [[Luigi Schiavonetti]], and published in 1808.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

See the biographical introduction prefixed to Blair's ''Poetical Works'', by Dr. Robert Anderson, in his ''Poets of Great Britain'', vol. viii. (1794). The only modern edition of ''The Grave'' is that of Professor James A. Means, which was published in 1973 by the Augustan Reprint Society, Los Angeles.

'''Spine shelving''' is a [[book]]-shelving technique. Books are usually shelved upright with the spines facing out; when a book is higher than the shelf, it is usually placed sideways. Putting a book with the spine down is called spine shelving; and the opposite is called [[foredge shelving]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2951">'''''A Toltec Symphony'''''  (also known as '''''Symphony No. 7 "A [[Toltec]] Symphony"''''') is a [[2005 in music|2005]] [[symphony]] by [[Philip Glass]].  The [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned Glass to write it to commemorate the 60th birthday of [[conducting|conductor]] [[Leonard Slatkin]].  Slatkin conducted the debut concert on January 20, 2005 at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], which Philip Glass attended. 

==Composition==
The symphony is scored for [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[E-flat clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]] 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]], [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]], [[wood block]], [[glockenspiel]], [[piano]], [[celesta]], [[harp]], [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass|basses]], [[organ (music)|organ]], and [[choir|chorus]].  

At 30 minutes long, it has three [[movement (music)|movements]]:
# The Corn
# The Hikuri (the Sacred Root)
# The Blue Deer

==Inspiration==
Glass said that he wrote the symphony about [[Mesoamerica]] and the life of [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] centuries before the arrival of European explorers.  The first movement, "The Corn," focuses on the interplay between [[Mother Nature]] and those she provides for.  "The Hikuri (the Sacred Root)" is not a root (it is a cactus) that grows in the northern and central Mexican deserts and is thought to be a gateway to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] world, hikuri.  Finally, the last movement is about "the holder of the Book of Knowledge," whom every truth-seeking person must face.

Glass has integrated three transcendental concepts of ancestral culture (Huichol) : The first is the " corn " which means, desire to return to the innocence before adulthood (the connection with Mother Earth); the second, the hikuri is the sacred vision of corn and Blue Deer, and this represents the third symbolism, from this world to the hereafter can do it, because when get the blue deer, stop being ordinary, and the man will be transformed.

The '''''Symphony in E''''', first performed on March 10, 1866, was the only [[symphony]] composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]]. Since Sullivan's death, it has frequently been called the "Irish" Symphony as it was composed in Ireland, and as a homage to [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|"Scotch Symphony"]].

The piece was generally well-received at its early performances.

==History==
Sullivan began work on his symphony in 1863, when he was 21 years old. From holiday in northern Ireland, he wrote to his mother that "as I was jolting home ... through wind and rain on an open [[Jaunting car|jaunting-car]], the whole first movement of a symphony came into my head with a real Irish flavour about it – besides scraps of the other movements."&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The composer later wrote, "I always meant to call it the 'Irish Symphony', but I modestly refrained, as it was courting comparison with the 'Scotch Symphony'." [i.e. [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|Symphony No 3]].]&lt;ref&gt;Young, note 17 to Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The title did not appear on the published score until after Sullivan's death, in the [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]] edition of 1915. Sullivan wrote in 1899 to his cousin, the music critic B. W. Findon: "Had I known that [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] would name his work an 'Irish Symphony', I think I should have knocked my modesty on the head."&lt;ref&gt;Findon, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the symphony took place at [[The Crystal Palace]] on 10 March 1866, conducted by [[August Manns]], who had previously conducted the London première of Sullivan's [[incidental music]] to [[The Tempest (Sullivan)|''The Tempest'']].&lt;ref name=Jacobs41&gt;Jacobs, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The advertised programme for the concert also included [[Beethoven]]'s ''[[Ah! perfido]]'' sung by [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]'s ''Jubel'' Overture, and his song "The Valley", sung by [[Charles Santley]], Beethoven's Overture to ''[[Fidelio]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Symphony]], and violin solos played by [[Carl Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;"Crystal Palace Concert", ''[[The Morning Post]]'', 10 March 1866, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The symphony had its second performance on 11 April at [[St James's Hall]] at a concert of the Musical Society of London;&lt;ref&gt;"Music – The Musical Society of London", ''The Daily News'', 13 April 1866, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the conductor was [[Alfred Mellon]].&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;Burn, Andrew. (2007). Notes to Naxos CD 8.570351 {{oclc|611357010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866b.html "Concerts"], ''The Times'', April 16, 1866, via The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July, it was given a third performance, at what was billed as "Mr Arthur S. Sullivan's Grand Orchestral Concert".&lt;ref name=standard&gt;"St. James's Hall", ''[[London Evening Standard|The Standard]]'', 12 July 1866, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The programme consisted mainly of Sullivan's works, including the overture to ''[[The Sapphire Necklace]]'' and excerpts from ''[[The Masque at Kenilworth]]'', conducted by the composer. Among the performers was the popular singer, [[Jenny Lind]], who co-sponsored the concert, sang four musical numbers including two Sullivan songs, and attracted a capacity audience.&lt;ref name=standard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866c.html "St. James's-Hall"], ''[[The Times]]'', July 13, 1866, via The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony was well received, though the music critics, both then and later, observed the influence of other composers. The critic in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote, after the first performance, "The symphony [is] the best musical work, if judged only by the largeness of its form and the number of beautiful thoughts it contains, for a long time produced by any English composer. ... Mr Sullivan should abjure Mendelssohn, even [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and above all [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], for a year and a day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsarchive.net/sullivan/symphony/times1866a.html "Concerts"], ''The Times'', 12 March 1866, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1960 study of Sullivan's music Gervase Hughes also detects echoes of Schumann, and of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] as well.&lt;ref name=h11&gt;Hughes, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 analysis, [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] comments that the symphony predates the well known symphonies of Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Dvořák, and concurs with earlier analysts that the principal influences on Sullivan's score were Schubert, Schumann and Mendelssohn. Lamb remarks on the themes for trombones and lower strings in the second movement, which "lend the work an especial solemnity", and finds the general mood of the symphony quite serious. Nonetheless Lamb  finds that work "also displays Sullivan at his lightest, above all in the joyous third movement … with its jaunty theme for oboe and delightful interplay between pizzicato strings and bubbling woodwind."&lt;ref name=lamb&gt;Lamb, Andrew. Notes to Chandos CD 9859 (2000) {{oclc|811240559}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the analyst Andrew Burn commented that the finale displays an early example of one of the composer's favourite devices: a melody, first heard on the oboe, is combined in counterpoint with a rhythmic theme in the first violins: "Such a device was to become a hallmark of the composer in the double choruses of his operettas".&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt;

The symphony was performed regularly during Sullivan's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullorch.htm#symphony "Symphony in E, 'Irish' (1866)"], the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 12 July 2009, accessed 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt; It received few performances in the twentieth century, but it has been heard more frequently in recent decades and was the major work of the opening concert of the first [[English Music Festival]] (broadcast by the [[BBC]]) in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.englishmusicfestival.org.uk/emf2006.html Official website of the English Music Festival] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922153423/http://www.englishmusicfestival.org.uk/emf2006.html |date=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four CD recordings of the piece have been issued, and a new study score edition has been published by a German firm, Musikproduction Jürgen Höflich&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikmph.de/musical_scores/composers_sales/scorelist_eng.htm ''Irish Symphony''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923083926/http://www.musikmph.de/musical_scores/composers_sales/scorelist_eng.htm |date=2006-09-23 }}, Musikproduction Jürgen Höflich, reprinting the Novello &amp; Co edition, with a new introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The symphony has four movements:
*[[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] – Allegro, ma non troppo vivace
*Andante espressivo
*[[Allegretto]]
*[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] vivace e con brio

The playing time is about thirty five minutes (or slightly longer if the exposition repeat is taken in the first movement).&lt;ref&gt;Notes to CPO CD 999 171-2 (1994) {{OCLC| 34029969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The ''Andante'' introduction opens with the alternation in octaves of [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] in dotted rhythm, played by the brass, answered by a '[[Dresden amen|Dresden Amen]]' motif on the strings (a Mendelssohnian touch).&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; The main Allegro part of the first movement has divided critical opinion. In ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|The Gramophone]]'' in 1969, [[Edward Greenfield]] commented, "The first theme in E minor may be very Mendelssohnian in shape, rhythm and key, but it provides the first real sign of Sullivan's genuine vitality of imagination,"&lt;ref name=gramophone&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Sullivan: Symphony in E major, ''Irish'', ''The Gramophone'', February 1968, p. 1167&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hughes considers that though [[sonata form]] is competently handled, the first subject, "a violin cantabile of soaring promise, falls to pieces at the seventh bar."&lt;ref name=h11/&gt;
*The second movement, in B major, is based on what Greenfield calls "a very Mendelssohnian melody" which "survives [[The Salvation Army]] treatment on horns and alto trombone in octaves, only to culminate in an outrageous crib of the second movement of Schubert's [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Unfinished]], a phrase first on oboes and then on violins."&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; Hughes describes the movement as lyrical, but with "a rather jejeune accompaniment".&lt;ref name=h11/&gt;
*The [[scherzo]] third movement, in C major, has attracted the most favourable comments from critics. Hughes notes that it is not in conventional symphonic scherzo form, following instead a pattern ABCA with a short coda based on B&lt;ref name=h11/&gt; in which Greenfield heard an astonishing similarity to the finale of Schubert's [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Great C major Symphony]].&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; The jaunty main theme of the movement is given to the oboe, always one of Sullivan's favoured instruments.
*The finale contains no unconventional features, though Greenfield comments that it brings "one of those [[descant]]s (fast dotted rhythm against a conventionally soaring melody) that became one of the trademarks of the operettas".

Hughes sums the symphony up thus: "In spite of the promising first movement and a modicum of competent thematic development, the symphony cannot be counted as a satisfactory achievement. Too much of the material is machine-made – as yet we find few signs of true spontaneity."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Greenfield concludes that the symphony is "a charming example of Victorian art at its least inhibited."&lt;ref name=gramophone/&gt; Lamb finds that despite the serious tone of much of the work, the symphony has "an all-pervading charm" and demonstrates "a thoroughly proficient handling of the orchestra".&lt;ref name=lamb/&gt;

"'''The Three Army Surgeons'''" (KHM 118, ''Die drei Feldscherer'') is a [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]] about 3 traveling [[army surgeon]]s who perform surgery on themselves to impress an [[innkeeper]]. After removing their own [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s, they will put them back in the morning. One cuts off his [[hand]], one cuts out his [[human heart|heart]] and one removes his own [[human eye|eye]]s. During the night a girl working at the inn has a visit from her lover, a [[soldier]]. She gives him some food from the cupboard that is holding the organs. The [[cat]] comes and takes the organs. After seeing the organs gone, she tells the soldier. He goes to the gallows and cuts the correct hand off a [[thief]] and brings it to her. He then gets the heart of a [[pig]] and eyes of a cat. In the morning the doctors re-attach the missing members using a [[salve]] they carry with them.  After going on the road again one doctor could not see with his reinstalled eyes and had the others guide him. Another doctor started rooting around in the dirt. When they reached another inn the third doctor found he could not help stealing. After traveling back to the original inn they found the girl had fled seeing their approach. They threatened to burn down the inn unless the innkeeper make [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]]s. He paid them enough to retire, though they still wanted their original organs back.

==In modern fiction==
[[List of Fables characters#Doctor Swineheart|Doctor Swineheart]] in the ''[[Fables (comic)|Fables]]'' [[comic book]] is one of the three surgeons. He boasts about being the best [[field surgeon]] in the world. Swineheart also plays a role in the related video game, [[The Wolf Among Us]].

'''Totok Kerot''', '''Thothok Kerot''', or '''Thothokkêrot''' {{IPA-jv|ʈɔʈɔʔ kərɔt}} is a female character in folk tales, spread among people in the surrounding areas of [[Kediri Regency|Kediri]]. There are several different tales concerning her, but the common features are that she has ugly face, with appearance like ''butâ'' (Jav. "giant" or "ogre").

Local tradition connects the character with a statue, commonly called [[Arca Totok Kerot|Rêcâ Thothokkêrot]], found in [[Kediri Regency]]. Some tales connect Thothokkerot to the legend of [[Calon Arang]]. Others have no connection whatsoever to the legend. Some tales about her is related here.

==Thothokkerot and Princess Limaran==
Thotokkerot was an ugly ogress. He longed the love of [[Panji (prince)|Raden Putra]] of Kediri. She loved to make up her face in order to charm the prince. Every day, she came to a pond to use the water's surface as a mirror.

One day, she was astounded to find that the face she looked at the water was extremely beautiful. Unable to believe her own eyes, she took an earthen bucket of water and looked at her reflection in that water. She saw the same familiar face she had already known. Again she looked into the pond, only to find the beautiful face. Feeling mocked, she kicked the bucket into pieces. She looked into the pond once more, and there she saw the beautiful face.

At last, she was convinced that gods had granted her wish to have a beautiful face. Enamoured, she started to dance, expressing his feelings towards Raden Putra, and sang out her love for him. However, her dance was jerky and ridiculuous and her voice was not pleasant to the hear either.

After a little while, she heard a giggle from above her. She looked up, and there she saw the beautiful face she had seen before. A young girl was climbing on a branch of tree above her. Now she was aware that the beautiful face did not belong to her, but to the young girl. Apparently the young girl had observed her for a while. After she danced and sang, the girl could not help laughing seeing her.

Thothokkerot was furious. She rocked the tree exuberantly. Dry leaves and flowers and old twigs and branches were falling apart. Terrified, the young girl climbed down the tree, and sat in front of her. Later it is revealed that her was Limaran, a princess from nearby kingdom. Thothokkerot picked up the fallen flowers and put a handful of them on her head indiscriminately. Then she put a flower on the princess' head.

A young shepherd passed by. Thothokkerot asked him which one of them is more beautiful. He answered spontaneously that the princess was more beautiful even with only a flower on her head, as if a lone bright star.

Afterwards, Thothokkerot exchange the flower arrangement, now she wore only a flower. Again she asked the boy who was more beautiful. This time the shepherd answered that with a pile of flowers on the princess' head she looked like a bright full moon. Hearing his answers, Thothokkerot was angry and she roared to the princess and the shepherd. Frightened, they ran away.

==Thothokkerot as Butå Nyai==
Once upon a time there was an ogress&lt;ref&gt;''butå'' means ogre, ''nyai'' means lady, madam&lt;/ref&gt; who wanted to marry Prabu [[Jayabaya|Jåyåbåyå]]. She then went to the capital of [[Kediri Kingdom|Daha]]. Her arrival caused chaos because citizens of the capital had never seen an ogress before. Before she could utter a word about her intention, people ran riot and beat her to near death. Dying, she managed to tell her name, Nyai, and her homeland, Lodhoyong, in the region of the Southern Sea. She claimed that her intention was to serve the king (a euphemism of marriage). Hearing her words, the soldiers went as fast as possible to report to the king.

King [[Jayabaya]] came and listened to her wish directly, and then said, "It is pity that the gods have not granted your wish yet. However, I am giving you a clue to the solution of your problem. About twenty years from now, you will find a kingdom named Prambana, to the west from here. Its king will be a man whose name is Prawatasari. He will be the one who is destined to be your spouse."

And so the ogress passed away. Touched by this incident, the king gave order to the people. The village south of Mênang (capital of Daha) should be renamed 'Gumuruh' because there was a loud noise when people lynched the ogress. The people made also a giant statue that resembled the appearance of the ogress.

The place where the statue was erected is at present near a district called '[[Kediri Regency|Gurah]]' and the statue is called 'Rêca Nyai', now more commonly known as 'Rêca Totokkerot'.

==Thothokkerot as Princess Surèngrånå==
[[Monarch|Prabu]] Lembuamiluhur, king of Jenggala, had four siblings. The eldest was Princess [[Kilisuci]]. She did not marry and lived as a hermit on Mount Pucangan, and sometimes on Klothok Hill (at Cave Selåmangleng). The others were Lembumerdhadhu, king of Kedhiri, Lembungarang, king of Ngurawan, and Lembumerjaya, king of Pånårågå. Those five siblings were Prabu Sri [[Airlangga|Gentayu]]'s children.

Lembuamiluhur's son, [[Panji (prince)|Panji Yudåwisrenggå]], also known as Panji Jåyåkusumå, was betrothed to Princess Candrakirana, also known as Galuh or Sekartaji, daughter of Lembumerdhadhu. However, the engagement was broken because Panji fell in love with Princess Anggraèni, daughter of the Patih&lt;ref&gt;Patih is the highest official serving the king, somekind of [[Premier]]&lt;/ref&gt; of Jenggala, and then got married. By Lembuamiluhur's order, Panji would have to marry Candrakirana even though he was already married to Anggraèni, but Panji refused to marry a woman he did not love. With a cunning plot, Anggraèni was murdered so Panji's love might be diverted to Candrakirana, but Panji still refused and grieved over his passing wife. His father got furious, and then Panji escaped from the palace.

Panji journeyed to Ngurawan, to his uncle Lembupengarang's court. His uncle accepted his presence with sympathy. For months he stayed there, Panji got close to his cousin, Surèngrånå, Lembupengarang's eldest daughter. Eventually he married her.

Meanwhile, a king from overseas came to Kediri to ask for Candrakirana's hand. His proposal was denied. Feeling insulted, the foreign king wage war against Kediri. Kediri's troops was overwhelmed, but then saved by the arrival of support armies from Jenggala, Ngurawan, and Pånårågå. The foreign king's troops were repelled.

After the war Kilisuci came to Kediri to talk about Candrakirana. She suggested that the root of the war was Candrakirana. He thought so because many foreign kings also asked for her hand. As long as she remained unmarried, the possibility of such previous war still existed. Therefore, she insisted to marry Candrakirana to Panji, even though he was married to another cousin of Candrakirana's. It was even suggested that the marriage would strengthen the unity of the three kingdoms of their family.

Lembumerdhadhu (Panji's father) gave Kilisuci consent to arrange such marriage. Lembupengarang did not have the heart to talk such proposal to his daughter, so he asked Kilisuci to talk to her.

Deep inside her heart, Surèngrånå could not accept such proposal. Although she would still be the first wife, Candrakirana is more senior both in age and familial relationship. She accepted nonetheless, because she was afraid of Kilisuci. She came to hide her real feelings, her hatred and jealousy towards Candrakirana.

It was her jealousy and hatred that later gave her the nickname 'Totok Kerot'. Although she tried to hide her feelings, her face still showed hints of them (Javanese: ''methothok'') and she ground her teeth (Javanese: ''kerot-kerot'') everytime she saw Candrakirana's face.

== Reca Thothokkerot ==
{{main|Arca Totok Kerot}}
Rêcâ Thothokkerot {{IPA-jv|rətʃɔ ʈɔʈɔʔ kərɔt}} is a [[statue]] (Jav. ''rêcâ'' means "statue") located in [[Kediri Regency]], [[Indonesia]] about 2 kilometers north-east of [[Simpang Lima Gumul]]. It is made of andesite stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. It kneels on one knee. The style is of a [[dvarapala]]. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century.

The face and other ornaments suggest that it a representation of a female ''butâ''.

Local traditions connect the statue Thothokkerot to the character in the folk tales, hence also to  [[Calon Arang]], but such connection refuted by Timoer (1982).

In [[mathematics]], '''transformation geometry''' (or '''transformational geometry''') is the name of a mathematical and [[pedagogic]] take on the study of [[geometry]] by focusing on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[geometric transformation]]s, and properties that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under them.  It is opposed to the classical [[synthetic geometry]] approach of [[Euclidean geometry]], that focuses on proving [[theorem]]s.

For example, within transformation geometry, the properties of an isosceles triangle are deduced from the fact that it is mapped to itself by a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about a certain line. This contrasts with the classical proofs by the criteria for [[triangle congruence|congruence of triangles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=68221&amp;set=4F331370_2_173&amp;database=g Georges Glaeser – The crisis of geometry teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic effort to use transformations as the foundation of geometry was made by [[Felix Klein]] in the 19th century, under the name [[Erlangen programme]].  For nearly a century this approach remained confined to mathematics research circles.   In the 20th century efforts were made to exploit it for [[mathematical education]].  [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] included  this approach (together with [[set theory]]) as part of a proposal for geometry teaching reform in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"/&gt;  These efforts culminated in the 1960s with the general reform of mathematics teaching known as the [[New Math]] movement.

== Pedagogy ==
An exploration of transformation geometry often begins with a study of [[reflection symmetry]] as found in daily life. The first real transformation is ''[[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a line'' or ''reflection against an axis''. The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] of two reflections results in a [[rotation]] when the lines intersect, or a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] when they are parallel. Thus through transformations students learn about [[Euclidean plane isometry]]. For instance, consider reflection in a vertical line and a line inclined at 45° to the horizontal. One can observe that one composition yields a counter-clockwise quarter-turn (90°) while the reverse composition yields a clockwise quarter-turn. Such results show that transformation geometry includes [[non-commutative]] processes.

An entertaining application of reflection in a line occurs in a proof of the [[one-seventh area triangle]] found in any triangle.

Another transformation introduced to young students is the [[homothetic transformation|dilation]]. However, the [[inversive geometry#reflection in a circle|reflection in a circle]] transformation seems inappropriate for lower grades. Thus [[inversive geometry]], a larger study than grade school transformation geometry, is usually reserved for college students.

Experiments with concrete [[symmetry group]]s make way for abstract [[group theory]]. Other concrete activities use computations with [[complex number]]s, [[hypercomplex number]]s, or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to express transformation geometry.
Such transformation geometry lessons present an alternate view that contrasts with classical [[synthetic geometry]]. When students then encounter [[analytic geometry]], the ideas of [[coordinate rotations and reflections]] follow easily. All these concepts prepare for [[linear algebra]] where the [[reflection (linear algebra)|reflection concept]] is expanded.

Educators have shown some interest and described projects and experiences with transformation geometry for children from kindergarten to high school. In the case of very young age children, in order to avoid introducing new terminology and to make links with students' everyday experience with concrete objects, it was sometimes recommended to use words they are familiar with, like "flips" for line reflections, "slides" for translations, and "turns" for rotations, although these are not precise mathematical language. In some proposals, students start by performing with concrete objects before they perform the abstract transformations via their definitions of a mapping of each point of the figure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2319962 R.S. Millman – Kleinian transformation geometry, Amer. Math. Monthly 84 (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001365/136586eo.pdf UNESCO - New trends in mathematics teaching, v.3, 1972 / pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4616&amp;context=etd Barbara Zorin – Geometric Transformations in Middle School Mathematics Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001248/124809eo.pdf UNESCO - Studies in mathematics education. Teaching of geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to restructure the courses of geometry in Russia, Kolmogorov suggested presenting it under the point of view of transformations, so the geometry courses were structured based on [[set theory]]. This led to the appearance of the term "congruent" in schools, for figures that were before called "equal": since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, and two triangles that could be overlapped by isometries were said to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwyBPybT4oMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Alexander Karp &amp; Bruce R. Vogeli – Russian Mathematics Education: Programs and Practices, Volume 5], pgs. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

One author expressed the importance of [[group theory]] to transformation geometry as follows:
:I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miles Reid]] &amp; Balázs Szendröi (2005) ''Geometry and Topology'', pg. xvii, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{isbn|0-521-61325-6}}, {{MathSciNet|id=2194744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6976">The success of [[World Book and Copyright Day]], launched in 1996, encouraged [[UNESCO]] to develop the concept of '''World Book Capital''' City, selecting [[Madrid]] as the Capital for 2001. This was again a success, and so UNESCO's General Conference resolved to make the designation of a World Book Capital City an annual event.

UNESCO invited the [[International Publishers Association]], the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] and the [[International Booksellers Federation]] to participate in the nomination process, to ensure the three major branches of the book industry can participate in the decision.

The nomination does not include any financial prize; it rather acknowledges the best programmes dedicated to books and reading.

==Nomination criteria==
The nominating committee welcomes programmes &amp;mdash; presented by or endorsed by the mayor of the city making the application — that promote and foster reading. The programmes are to run from one World Book and Copyright Day and the next. The nomination committee will turn its attention to certain criteria:
* the degree of participation of all levels (from the municipal to the international level)
* the programme's potential impact
* the scope and quality of the activities proposed by the candidates, and the extent to which they involve writers, publishers, booksellers and libraries
* any other projects promoting books and reading
* the extent to which the programme respects the principles of freedom of expression, as stated by the UNESCO Constitution as well as by Articles 19 and 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and by the [[Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials]]

==World Book Capital cities==
The following cities have been designated as World Book Capitals:
