      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2667">{{about|the film movement|the philosophy school|Budapest School (Lukács)}}

The '''Budapest school''', or '''documentarism''', was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] film movement that flourished from roughly 1972 to 1984.  The movement originated from Béla Balázs Studios, a small-budget filmmaking community that aimed to unite the young [[avant-garde]] and [[underground film|underground]] filmmakers of Hungary and give them an opportunity to make experimental works without state censorship.  The Balázs studio gave birth to two main movements in the early 1970s: an experimental, avant-garde group (led by individuals like [[Gábor Bódy]]), and the documentarist group, whose main goal was the portrayal of absolute social-reality on screen. This movement was called "Budapest school" by an Italian film critic on a European film festival. Soon they adopted this name.

The main founders and leaders of the group were [[István Dárday]], [[Györgyi Szalai]], [[Judit Ember]] and [[Pál Schiffer]]. Many young and sometimes amateur artists were invited to the group by fellow filmmakers, especially [[Béla Tarr]], who made his debut film at the age of 22 with financing from the Béla Balázs Studios.

Films of the movement were generally (but not always) shot with amateur equipment, mostly hand-held cameras, and usually by two or more cameras at the same time. Non-professional actors, who most of the time socially resembled their characters, were cast.  These films also avoided pre-written scripts, with only a basic scenario and certain plot elements pre-written, and the cast members' reactions improvised on the set. Most films were shot in a very short period of time with a very limited budget or no budget at all. Their central themes were mostly the lives of working class and poor people in urban Hungary and their struggle to have a decent existence. The main goal of the movement was to show absolute reality on screen instead of the false escapism shown by commercial and mainstream films. 

The Budapest school movement closely resembled [[cinema verité]]. The first full-length film made in this manner was ''[[Jutalomutazás]]'' ("''The Prize Trip''") (1975) by István Dárday and Györgyi Szalai. The best-known example of the movement is "''[[Családi tűzfészek]]''" ("''Family Nest''") (1979) by Béla Tarr.

'''Cinema of Europe''' refers to the [[Film industry|film industries]] and [[film]]s produced in the continent of [[Europe]].

Europeans were the pioneers of the motion picture industry, with several innovative engineers and artists making an impact especially at the end of the 19th century. [[Louis Le Prince]] became famous for his 1888 [[Roundhay Garden Scene]], the first known celluloid film recorded. The [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] from [[Berlin]] used their "Bioscop" to amaze the [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Wintergarten theatre]] audience with the first film show ever, from November 1 through 31, 1895. The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière Brothers]] established the [[Cinematograph]]; which initiated the [[silent film]] era, a period where European cinema was a major commercial success. It remained so until the art-hostile environment of [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/188908/Cinema-Europe-The-Other-Hollywood-Part-1-Where-it-All-Began/overview| work= Rovi | publisher= The New York Times| accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable European early film movements include [[German Expressionism]] (1920s), [[Soviet Montage]] (1920s), [[French Impressionist Cinema]] (1920s), [[Poetic realism]] (1930s), and [[Italian neorealism]] (1940s); it was a period now seen in retrospect as [[Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood|"The Other Hollywood"]]. The first large-scale film studio was also established in Europe, with the [[Babelsberg Studio]] near Berlin in 1912.

Post [[World War II]] movements include [[Free Cinema]] (1950s), [[French New Wave]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Polish Film School]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Czechoslovak New Wave]] (1960s), [[New German Cinema]] (1960s&amp;ndash;80s), [[British New Wave]] (1950s&amp;ndash;60s), [[Spaghetti Western]] (1960s) and [[Cinema of Portugal#1960s|Novo Cinema]] (1960s&amp;ndash;70s).  The turn of the 21st century has seen movements such as [[Dogme 95]], [[New French Extremity]] and the [[Romanian New Wave]].

==History==
[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|The [[Babelsberg Studio]] near [[Berlin]] was the first large-scale film studio in the world (founded 1912) and still produces international movies every year.]]

===19th century===
[[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Antoine Lumière]] realized, on 28 December 1895, the first projection, with the [[Cinematograph]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ December 28, 1895.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Sadoul, ''Histoire du cinéma mondial, des origines à nos jours'', Flammarion, Paris, 1968, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/patrimoinelumiere/premiereseance.html Institut Lumière.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105021719/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/patrimoinelumiere/premiereseance.html |date=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1897, [[Georges Méliès]] established the first cinema studio on a rooftop property in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], near Paris.

===20th century===
According to one study, "In the 1900s the European film industry was in good shape. European film companies pioneered both technological innovations such as projection, colour processes, and talking pictures, and content innovations such as the weekly newsreel, the cartoon, the serial, and the feature film. They held a large share of the US market, which at times reached 60 per cent. The French film companies were quick in setting up foreign production and distribution subsidiaries in European countries and the USA, and dominated international film distribution before the mid-1910s... By the early 1920s, all this had changed. The European film industry only held a marginal share of the US market, and a small share of its home markets. Most large European companies sold their foreign subsidiaries and exited from film production at home, while the emerging Hollywood studios built their foreign distribution networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Gerben|date=2005-05-01|title=The decline and fall of the European film industry: sunk costs, market size, and market structure, 1890–19271|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00306.x/abstract|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=58|issue=2|pages=310–351|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0289.2005.00306.x|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Film Academy]] was founded in 1988 to celebrate European cinema through the [[European Film Awards]] annually.

Philippe Binant realised, on 2 February 2000, the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', n°hors-série, Paris, April 2000, p. 32 (''cf.'' also [http://academiecine.tv/files/8113/7674/5261/Histoire_communications.pdf ''Histoire des communications'', 2011, p. 10.]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/motion/uploadedFiles/FR_plugins_acrobat_fr_motion_action_actions29.pdf ''Cf.''

Founded in 1992 with funding from the MEDIA programme [[Creative Europe]] and from the Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée [[CNC, France]], Europa Cinemas is the first film theatre network focusing on European films. 
Its objective is to provide operational and financial support to cinemas that commit themselves to screen a significant number of European non-national films, to offer events and initiatives as well as promotional activities targeted at Young Audiences.
Thanks to the support of [[Eurimages]] and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the influence of Europa Cinemas extends to Eastern European countries, to the Balkans, to Russia and to Turkey.

'''''Collins St., 5 pm''''' is a [[1955 in art|1955]] painting by Australian artist [[John Brack]]. The painting depicts office workers walking along busy [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] in [[Melbourne]] after finishing work for the day{{mdash}}"Blank-faced office workers hurry by like sleep-walkers, thinking only of the pubs or their homes in the suburbs".&lt;ref name=McDonald&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=John|title=John Brack|url=http://johnmcdonald.net.au/2009/john-brack/|website=John McDonald|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Brack conceived the work after reading [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Engberg, Juliana, "Collins Street, 5pm: John Brack's Enduring Cultural Icon', ''Art and Australia'', vol. 34, no. 4, 1997, pp. 513-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is considered a companion piece to Brack's earlier work ''[[The Bar (painting)|The Bar]]''.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/19/2520543.htm|title=Gallery buys The Bar|date=19 March 2009|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was purchased from [[Peter Bray Gallery]]&lt;ref&gt;"In 1953, he had his first solo exhibition at Peter Bray's Gallery in Melbourne. ''Collins Street'' was exhibited at the same gallery in March 1956 and was immediately purchased by the NGV." McKiernan, M. (2010). 'John Brack Collins Street 5 pm, 1955'. ''Occupational Medicine'', 60(2), 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]'s permanent Australian art collection and is exhibited in the [[Ian Potter Centre]] in [[Federation Square]] in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/3161 National Gallery of Victoria Acquisition 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Looking back on his iconic picture ... Brack found it to be “totally unsatisfactory”, because of the condescending attitude he adopted in relation to the people in the street. “I should have known,” he said, “that their lives were just as complex as mine, if not more so.”|Art critic John McDonald|&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt;}}

In 2011, ''Collins St., 5 pm'' was voted the most popular work in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].&lt;ref name="The Australian - 19Apr2011 - John Brack's Collins St, 5pm, the Most Popular Painting at NGV "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/john-bracks-collins-st-5pm-the-most-popular-painting-at-ngv/story-fn3dxity-1226041321612|title=John Brack's Collins St, 5pm, the Most Popular Painting at NGV |last=Bennett|first=Sally|date=19 April 2011|work=[[The Australian]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theater was founded in October 1946 in [[Prizren]]. It was the first professional theatrical institution in [[Kosovo]] after the [[Second World War]]. Few months after the establishment, the theater was moved to [[Pristina]]. The first performances of the theater were mostly created by amateur artists and talented and enthusiastic idealists which were aided from professional artists from other theaters of ex-[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In the 1960s the ensemble of the theater was slowly enriched with professional staff.

Until 1989 there were over 400 premiers with over 10000 replays showed in the theater which were followed by over 3.2&amp;nbsp;million spectators.
The repertoire of this theater was built on many national, international and former Yugoslavian dramatic scripts. This theater performances, which were presented in different festivals with national and international character in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], were praised highly by critics of the time and were honored with various artistic awards. In 1967, the play "Erveheja" of director [[Muharrem Qena]] was honored with the Award for the Best Drama in the Yugoslavian Drama Festival [[Sterijino pozorje|"Sterijino Pozorje"]].
In addition to performances in the Albanian language, there were also performances in the Serbian language, especially after 1981 when the theater was operating under heavy politic pressure from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian communist regime]].

In 1990, the rigorous regime of [[Slobodan Milošević|Slobodan Milosevic]] placed the theater under a violent administration by expelling the [[Albanians|Albanian]] artists from the theater and putting it under a totalitarian control. During this period, in a parallel university education system created against the totalitarian regime, many school-homes were created from the artistic ensemble, which were already part of this professional ensemble theater. After the war in 1999, there have been numerous national and international plays in the theater. The theater is of a national character, as such, it is funded by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of the Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrikombetar.eu/?id=22 Teatri Kombëtar i Kosovës, Për Ne.] National Theater of Kosovo, For Us.

[[File:Ethnographic Museum in Prishtina.jpg|thumb|230px|Ethnographic Museum]]

The Ethnographic Museum "Emin Gjiku" is an integral part of the National Museum of Kosovo in Pristina, located in the old housing complex, consisting of four buildings: two of which date from the 18th century and two others from the 19th century. In 2006 a permanent ethnological exhibition of the National Museum of [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovo]] was set in this housing complex.

The concept of the Ethnographic Museum is based on 4 topics which present the life cycle starting from birth, life, death and spiritual heritage. The Stone house is also a part of the museum which during the 1950s was transferred from the old part of the city of Pristina to this housing complex. Today it serves as a center of [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzeu.rks-gov.net/en/plan-your-visit/ethnological-museum/ Muzeu Etnograpfik – "Emin Gjiku".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302185615/http://muzeu.rks-gov.net/en/plan-your-visit/ethnological-museum/ |date=2 March 2014 }} Etnographic Museum – "Emin Gjiku".

'''Francisco José Ricardo, Ph.D''' is a media philosopher, author, musician, theorist, and filmmaker. Ricardo is co-founder of the Digital Video Research Archive at [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/dbin/dance/|title=Morris, Sword, and Clog Dancing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the founding editor of the book series, ''International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/international-texts-in-critical-media-aesthetics/?pg=1|title=Bloomsbury - International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Bloomsbury. This series focuses primarily on electronic, or [[digital art]], and will publish its twelfth book in 2017. In 2013, Ricardo published ''The Engagement Aesthetic: Experiencing New Media Art through Critique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-engagement-aesthetic-9781623560409/|title=The Engagement Aesthetic|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he discusses different methods of reflecting on, interacting with, and critiquing [[new media art]]. As media and culture commentator, he examines the loss of reflection in social communication occurring in what he calls hashtag culture, characterized by diminished language, instinctive reactions and responses, a tendency to seek approval from others, and an obsession with certainty -- difficulties that he considers can be addressed by embracing expression through the arts and other self-directed creative activity. Ricardo has appeared on numerous radio talk shows to discuss this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/wtop-fjr-interview-2017september18|title=WTOP Washington, DC News Radio, On Air Interview with Veronica Robinson|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/hashtag-culture-on-kogo-21sep2017|title=Francisco Ricardo speaks about Hashtag Culture on NewsRadio 600 KOGO with Ted Garcia and LaDona Harvey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-on-followers-social-media-and-hashtag-culture-on-sirius|title=Francisco speaks on Followers, social media, on SiriusXM Urban View, The Laura Coates Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-with-terry-gilberg-on-social-media-hashtagculture|title=Francisco Speaks on Social Media and Hashtag Culture with Terry Gilberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Francisco J. Ricardo was born in 1962 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. When he was seven, the family moved to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and two years later, to [[New York City]]. His father, an architect, and professor at the [[University of Havana]], had studied under [[Josef Albers]] during Albers's residency in Havana. His mother had been a gymnast, and in the U.S. founded a "Health Bauhaus" based on alternative nutrition and numerous forms of exercise, yoga, and meditation. Ricardo studied at [[Harvard University]], receiving a C.A.S [HGSE], and an Ed.M. Ricardo transferred during his doctoral work at Harvard to receive the first Ph.D. in Humanities Computing conferred in the U.S. at the pioneering [[University Professors Program]] of [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/contributors.php|title=CyberText Yearbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as Research Associate, later teaching art theory at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

==Career==
After teaching at RISD, writing and presenting on artists and new media art, including electronic or [[digital art]] (see selected articles), Ricardo decided that he could better show this art, which often employs moving images, through the medium of film. He left teaching and formed the documentary film production company, Conceptualist Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com|title=ConceptualistFilms.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo's vision is to create a new form of documentary on extraordinary artists and musicians - fewer "talking heads" and biographical material; instead, he wants to engage the viewer with unusual imagery while discussing ideas and philosophies in an experimental and accessible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/press-release/|title=Press Release – Conceptualist Films Born!|date=22 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of his first documentary (released 2016) is on the creative art process of the multifaceted artist [[James Franco]]. Franco, once a student of Ricardo's at RISD, has a wide body of his own experimental art and film work which Ricardo explores in the film, according to the website for ''F FOR FRANCO.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fforfranco.com/|title=fforfranco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film contains hours of conversations between Ricardo and Franco, in various places such as the [[LA Theater]] and The [[Chateau Marmont]], as well as footage given by Franco to Ricardo of work rarely, if ever, seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/on-the-subject-of-subjects-james-franco/|title=On the Subject of Subjects – James Franco|date=7 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in 2015, reviewed by Neon Tommy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/neon-tommy/film-review-f-for-franco-ac92640b0fa6&lt;/ref&gt; and was reviewed by ''The Hollywood Reporter'', stating it was a "must for Franco completists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/f-franco-film-review-748389 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CD release==
In 2014, Ricardo released an album of electronic music titled, ''Adding and Subtracting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MUFM39E?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=adding%20and%20subtracting%20francisco&amp;qid=1452585514&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Adding and Subtracting|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second album of electronic music,''Groove Morphisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0193MZFMI?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=groove%20morphisms&amp;qid=1452584601&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Groove Morphisms|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more complex, and was released in December 2015. 
In early 2016, Francisco released ''A Singular Within'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B73SLZE?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=a%20singular%20within&amp;qid=1457418260&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=A Singular Within|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of nine meditative, ambient songs reminiscent of the work of Brian Eno. It's a marked departure from his previous two albums. The digital version of ''A Singular Within'' contains two bonus tracks not found on the physical CD.
Francisco composes his albums electronically, employing a variety of instruments, blending styles and creating complex rhythms. The latest are:
*Minimal Souvenirs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Minimal-Souvenirs-Francisco/dp/B01HGBW8BY/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506113581&amp;sr=1-1-mp3-albums-bar-strip-0&amp;keywords=Minimal+Souvenirs|title=Minimal Souvenirs}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

'''''Golf Ball''''' (sometimes '''''Golfball''''') is a 1962 painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It is considered to fall within the [[art movement]] known as [[Pop art]]. It depicts "a single sphere with patterned, variously directional semi-circular grooves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art|last=Lippard|first=Lucy R.|publisher=[[Praeger Publishers]]|year=1970|edition=third printing|isbn=|page=125|chapter=New York Pop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is commonly associated with black-and-white [[Piet Mondrian]] works. It is one of the works that was presented at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and one that was critical to his early association with pop art. The work is commonly critiqued for its tension involving a three-dimensional representation in two dimensions with much discussion revolving around the choice of a background nearly without any perspective.

==History==
When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in February 1962, it sold out before opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|last=Tomkins|first=Calvin|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|year=1988|isbn=0-8109-2356-4|location=|page=25|pages=|quote=His first show at Castelli's, in February 1962, was sold out before the opening.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Golf Ball'' was one of the works that Lichtenstein exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Critical History|last=|first=|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-520-21018-2|editor-last=Madoff|editor-first=Steven Henry|location=|page=198|pages=|chapter=Focus: The Major Artists|quote=Yes. The first show was very diverse.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Lichtenstein included ''Golf Ball'' in ''Still Life with Goldfish Bowl'', 1972, and ''Go for Baroque'', 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Still Lifes: 1972–76'', pp. 206–7, 216–7|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting exemplifies the novel [[superimposition]] of abstraction and [[Figurative art|figuration]].&lt;ref name="RLMOA60"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Meditations 0n Art|author=Mercurio, Gianni|first=|publisher=SKIRA|year=2010|isbn=978-88-572-0460-4|location=|page=60|pages=|quote=Good examples of just how abstraction and figuration were superimposed to propose fresh solutions are Lichtenstein's ''Golf Ball'' (1962) and ''Ball of Twine'' (1963).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, [[chiaroscuro]] and a landscape context.&lt;ref name=RLMOA61&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Meditations 0n Art|author=Mercurio, Gianni|publisher=SKIRA|isbn=978-88-572-0460-4|year=2010|page=61|quote=''Golf Ball'' and ''Ball of Twine'' highlight how the more an image is synthesized by eliminating its three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context, the more it takes on the characteristics of abstraction.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Composition in Black and White, 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Golf Ball'' is said to reflect the black and white elements of ''Compositions in Black and White'', 1917, [[Piet Mondrian]].]]
The use of black and white is regarded as dramatic, and although it may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Robert Motherwell]], it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 ''Composition in Black and White''.&lt;ref name=W33/&gt; Alternatively, it may have been a reference to another of Mondrian's Pre-[[World War I]] black and white oval paintings, such as ''Pier and ocean'', 1915.&lt;ref name="RLJH"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson|1993|loc=''The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous'', pp. 25–26}}  For someone familiar with modern art, the formally related oval paintings of Piet Mondrian from before the First World War (Ill. p. 26) may come to mind.&lt;/ref&gt; This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects.&lt;ref name="W33"&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 29-31}} "Lichtenstein's dramatic use of black and white is also a feature of subsequent paintings such as ''Golf Ball'', 1962 ...&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian ''Plus and Minus'' paintings.&lt;ref name=RLOF/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
In 1962, Lichtenstein produced several works in which he depicted "...the repetitive regularity of their patterned surfaces..."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson1993|loc=''The Pictures That Lichtenstein made Famous, or The Pictures that Made Lichtenstein Famous'', p. 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Golf Ball'' is a depiction of a [[golf ball]] using a [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]esque set of black and white arcs to depict the three-dimensionality of the subject. However, the neutral background manipulates the image and diminishes the volumetric characteristics by stripping the viewer of his perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=15|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Waldman|first= Diane|publisher=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|year=1969|quote=''Golf Ball'', 1962 is composed of a series of black and white arcs that form an abstract pattern reminiscent of Mondrian’s plus and minus system. At the same time, by means of their placement, these black and white lines conform to the shape of a three-dimensional object. But the placement of the golf ball on a neutral ground once again neutralizes the object as a volumetric form. This manipulation of the two and three dimensional is one that the artist obviously relishes for he returns to it repeatedly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is described as a "pure graphic mark on a gray ground" as well as a "totality of abstract marks."&lt;ref name=RLMOA60/&gt; Lichtenstein described ''Golf Ball'' as "the antithesis of what was thought of as having 'art meaning'" because of its lack of perspective.&lt;ref name="RLOF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: October Files|author=Lichtenstein, Roy|first=|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-51231-2|editor-last=Bader|editor-first=Graham|location=|page=60|pages=|chapter=A Review of My Work Since 1961—A Slide Presentation|quote=''Golf Ball'' (1962), a painting of a single object, is intended to remind one of a Mondrian ''Plus and Minus'' painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golf Ball'' is an example of the emerging "confident authority" of his single-image paintings with its "Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness".&lt;ref name=RLLA/&gt; The "frontal and centralized presentation"'s directness lacked the sophistication to market the images of household goods for advertising but was considered daring artistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|last=Livingstone|first=Marco|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]]|year=1990|isbn=0-8109-3707-7|location=|pages=|quote=The frontal and centralized presentation employed by Lichtenstein in early pairings of domestic objects, such as ''Roto Broil'' and ''Electric Cord'' of 1961 and ''Golf Ball'' (1962), was of such assertive directness that it would have been dismissed in contemporary advertising as too crude and unsophisticated. In the context of painting, however, this projection of an image so as to be instantly apprehended as a whole&amp;nbsp;– as a perceptual pattern or structure that in psychological terms would be labelled a Gestalt&amp;nbsp;– was daring in its austere simplicity, anticipating the Minimalism of the mid 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black and white painting on a grey background challenges both the natural perception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and the boundaries of abstraction.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop|last=Foster|first=Hal|publisher=[[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7148-5663-6|editor=Francis, Mark|location=|page=26|pages=|quote=A golf ball is a prime object of suburban banality, but here it also recalls the pristine plus-and-minus abstractions Mondrian painted forty-five years before.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work "gives us both the impression of space and the fact of surface".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop|last=Foster|first= Hal|editor-last=Francis|editor-first= Mark|isbn=978-0-7148-5663-6|publisher=Phaidon|year=2010|page=27|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golf Ball'' was one of the bases by which "critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art", although much is made about the painting's references to abstract painting, especially its likeness to Mondrian's works.  Furthermore, the painting leverages tensions regarding three-dimensional representation in two dimensions resulting from spatial ambiguities caused by the lack of cues in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: All About Art|last=Lobel|first=Michael|publisher=Louisiana Museum of Modern Art|year=2003|isbn=87-90029-85-2|editor1-last=Holm|editor1-first=Michael Juul|location=|page=84|pages=|chapter=Pop according To Lichtenstein|quote=...it was through paintings like...''Golf Ball''...that critics aligned him with other practitioners of Pop Art...Many of his paintings of objects veer toward abstraction, whether ''Golf Ball''{{'s}} radiating fields of arcs enclosed within a circular form...In this way these works often make reference to the traditions of abstract painting.|editor2-last=Tøjner|editor2-first=Poul Erik|editor3-last=Caiger-Smith|editor3-first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Diane Waldman refers to the subject of ''Golf Ball'' as a freestanding form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Reflections|last=Waldman |first=Diane|publisher=Electa|year=1999|isbn=88-435-7287-3|page=25|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the figures in which Lichtenstein demonstrates his draftsman experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 28}} "Lichtenstein's experience as a draftsman is reflected in his spare presentation of kitchen stoves, washing machines, bathroom interiors, golf balls, ice cream sodas....&lt;/ref&gt;  This work demonstrated his maturation as an artist with standardized contours that present uniformity and solidified inflections.&lt;ref name="RLLA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Alloway|first=Lawrence|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|year=1983|isbn=0-89659-331-2|location=|pages=18–19|quote=This is particularly evident in the single-image paintings, which take on a Rock of Gibraltar-like thereness, and in the paintings from war comics, which have a clarity and elaboration in advance of the comparatively constrained romance subjects.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a strong example of presenting the tension of volumetric potential balanced against two-dimensional presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Cliches into Icons: Early Pop Pictures'', p. 33}} "Both ''Black Flowers'' and ''Golf Ball'' are successful examples of this dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also shows how placement against a neutral background diminishes three-dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Critical History|last=|first=|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-520-21018-2|editor-last=Steven Henry|editor-first=Madoff|location=|page=208|pages=|chapter=Focus: The Major Artists|quote=At the same time, by means of their placement, the black and white lines conform to the shape of a three-dimensional object. But the placement of the golf ball on a neutral ground once again neutralizes the object as a volumetric form.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Lichtenstein's techniques to display/minimize dimensionality, the viewer imposes his or her own visualization experiences on the painting, which minimizes the effect of spatial illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Waldman|1993|loc=''Comic Strips and Advertising Images'', p. 47}} "We know that a golf ball is three-dimensional, and so most of us project the additional dimension onto such a two-dimensional image even though it may not be depicted in that manner."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hansō Sōshitsu|Genshitsu Sen]], 15th ''iemoto'' of the ''[[Urasenke]]'' school]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Iemoto'''''|家元|lead=yes|extra2=(lit. "family foundation")}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese term]] used to refer to the founder or current Grand Master of a certain school of traditional Japanese art. It is used synonymously with the word {{nihongo||宗家|[[sōke]]}} when it refers to the family or house that the iemoto is head of and represents. 

The word ''iemoto'' is also used to describe a system of familial generations in traditional Japanese arts such as [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] (inc. [[sencha tea ceremony]]), [[ikebana]], [[noh]], [[calligraphy]], [[traditional Japanese dance]], [[traditional Japanese music]], the Japanese art of incense appreciation ([[Japanese incense#Kōdō|kōdō]]), and [[Japanese martial arts]]. [[Shogi]] and [[Go (board game)|go]] once used the ''iemoto'' system as well. The ''iemoto'' system is characterized by a hierarchical structure and the supreme authority of the ''iemoto'', who has inherited the secret traditions of the school from the previous ''iemoto''.
==Titles==
An ''iemoto'' may be addressed by the title ''Iemoto'' or ''O-iemoto'', or by the title {{nihongo||宗匠|Sōshō}} or 
{{nihongo||大先生|Ō-sensei}}. In English, "Grand Master" is often the title that is used. The ''iemoto's'' main roles are to lead the school and protect its traditions, to be the final authority on matters concerning the school, to issue or approve licenses and certificates and, in some cases, to instruct the most advanced practitioners.

The title of ''iemoto'' in most cases is hereditary. It is commonly transmitted by direct line, or by adoption.  Once the "successor-to-be" is officially recognized, that successor-to-be may appropriate the title of {{nihongo||若宗匠|Wakasōshō|extra2="Young Master"}}.

There can only be one ''iemoto'' at a time, which sometimes leads to the creation of new "houses" or "lines."

By tradition, the title of ''iemoto'' is passed down along with a hereditary name.  In the [[Urasenke]] tradition of tea ceremony, for example, the ''iemoto'' carries the name Sōshitsu.
==Structure==
Officially recognized teachers of the traditional arts that have an "iemoto" have obtained a license to teach from the ''iemoto'', signifying the ''iemoto'''s trust that the so-licensed person is capable and qualified to faithfully pass on the school's teachings.  Students must also acquire licenses or certificates at various stages in their study.  Depending on the school, such certificates either give the student permission to study at a particular level or affirm that the student has achieved a given level of mastery.  Recipients must pay for these certificates which, at the highest level, may cost several million [[Japanese yen|yen]].  It is also the ''iemoto'' who authorises, selects and bestows ceremonial names for advanced practitioners.

==History==

As far back as the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), there were iemoto-like family lines that were responsible for passing down the secret traditions and orthodox teachings of their particular school of art, but the first appearance of the word ''iemoto'' in extant records dates to the end of the 17th century, where it is used in reference to families entitled to have their sons become priests at great temples. Its use in the sense that it is used today, in the realm of traditional Japanese arts, starts to appear in documents in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Chanoyu Vocabulary: Practical Terms for the Way of Tea (Kyoto: Tankosha, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of iemoto is a manifestation of the {{nihongo||家|ie}} or "household" and {{nihongo||同族|dōzoku}} or "extended kin" pattern of relationships in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;"Iemoto" entry by Francis L. K. Hsu in Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the {{Nihongo|"Iemoto System"|家元制度}} was explicated by the historian Matsunosuke Nishiyama in the post-war period to describe the social structures associated with exclusive family control and networks of instructors, a characteristic of the feudal era whose influence on traditional arts is still felt today.

==Famous families and schools==
===Go===

There were originally four main schools of [[Go_(game)|Go]] players: Hon'inbō, Hayashi, Inoue and Yasui; and three minor schools: Sakaguchi, Hattori and Mizutani.  

Early in the 17th century, the then best player in Japan, [[Hon'inbō Sansa]], was made head of a newly founded Go academy (the {{Nihongo|[[Hon'inbō school]]|本因坊}}, which developed the level of playing greatly, and introduced the martial arts style system of ranking players. The government discontinued its support for the Go academies in 1868 as a result of the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

In honour of the Hon'inbō school, whose players consistently dominated the other schools during their history, one of the most prestigious Japanese Go championships is called the "Honinbo" tournament.

===Ikebana===

The three main schools of Japanese flower arrangement, or [[ikebana]], are [[Ikenobō]], [[Ohara-ryū|Ohara]], and [[Sōgetsu]].

According to the organization Ikebana Network,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kadou.com/hp/ryuuha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; there currently are 138 registered schools of small and large size (as of August 2008).

===Japanese dancing===

There are about 200 schools of Japanese dancing. The five most famous are the Hanayagi-ryū, Fujima-ryū, Wakayagi-ryū, Nishikawa-ryū, and Bandō-ryū.

===Incense appreciation===
The two main schools of {{Nihongo|Incense appreciation|香道|kōdō}} are the Shino-ryū and the Nijō-ryū.

===Tea ===
see the article [[Schools of Japanese tea ceremony]]

==Criticisms and resistance==

The ''iemoto'' system has been described as rigid, expensive, nepotistic, authoritarian and undemocratic. Some groups have chosen to reject the ''iemoto'' system. In the realm of the Japanese tea ceremony, Sensho Tanaka in 1898 initiated the ''Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai''.&lt;ref name="Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai"&gt;[http://www.santokuan.or.jp/eng/index.html] Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai official web site (English)&lt;/ref&gt; Hiroaki Kikuoka, a [[shamisen]] player, created a presidential system for his group,&lt;ref name=Metropolis&gt;[http://metropolis.co.jp/biginjapanarchive299/266/biginjapaninc.htm "Hiroaki Kikuoka"], Metropolis&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] player [[Michiyo Yagi]] has rejected both the ''iemoto'' system and the traditional style of her instrument, choosing to strike [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref name=Weekend&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1406597 "Japanese Classical Music"], Weekend Edition Sunday, August 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
It was in the latter half of the 20th century that American publishers used Instant books more commonly as part of their publishing plan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Instant books were published on the [[Northeast blackout of 1965]], the [[Moon landing]], the [[Iran hostage crisis]], and the murder of [[John Lennon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the most successful instant books was the [[Warren Commission|Warren Commission Report]] published in 1964 by [[Bantam Books]], which by 1987 had over 1.7 million copies in print.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bantam followed this book up with over 70 other instant books over the next couple of decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Two ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalists wrote a book on the [[Jonestown massacre]] in 11 days, publishing it three hours before a competing work. [[Operation Entebbe]] and IBM's introduction of its [[PCjr]] home computer also received instant books.&lt;ref name="rosenberg19831125"&gt;{{Cite news |title=160-page 'Instant Book' on IBM's PCjr Home Computer Due Out Today |last=Rosenberg |first=Ronald |date=1983-11-25 |work=The Boston Globe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instant books have gone in and out of favor over the years. By the late 1980s, [[the New York Times]] said that their high cost of production along with several failed Instant books caused publishers to back away from this process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Publishers printed instant books in mass paperback in high quantity print runs that resulted in returns to the publisher after public interest waned in the topic. But by the 1990s advances in the publishing and distribution had allowed costs to go down and some publishers built instant publishing back into their plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20040209/21444-personnel-moves-at-running-press.html|title=Personnel Moves at Running Press|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|quote=As for the instant books, DeVito said that he'd like publishing to feel a little more urgency. "I definitely think that publishing has the ability to keep up with the electronic media. People force through an instant book now and then, but more often than not, the editorial and production staff try to keep people from doing that. We're at a stage now, with technology and smart management, where we can get out there very fast.|access-date=2016-12-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Jerry|date=July 1997|title=St Martin's Press's Charles Spicer: 'Instant books must truly be worth it.'|url=|journal=Writer's Digest|volume=|pages=33|via=GALE Biography in Context}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St Martin's Press published several instant books in the late 1990s focusing on true-crime, including books on the [[O. J. Simpson murder trial|O.J. Simpson case]] (''Fallen Hero'') and the [[Susan Smith]] case (''Sins of the Mother''). Executive editor, Charles Spicer, described to ''[[Writer's Digest]]'' how he looked for authors who were experienced reporters who were capable of gathering information quickly and writing to a deadline. He had chosen [[Carleton Smith|Carlton Smith]], an experienced reporter, to write an instant book on the [[Death of JonBenét Ramsey|Jon Benet Ramsay]] case (''Death of a Little Princess'').&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Spicer said that a book needed to be able to sell hundreds of thousands of copies to be worth a publisher's effort for an instant book.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==21st century==
Some types of instant books did not fare well in the 21st century. The advent of the [[Internet]] affected government and document instant publishing—a government document or report could be posted online instead of printed in book form for easy public access. Instead of publishing documents—publishers looked for other ways to create value with instant books by focusing on major sporting and news events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20020325/26992-a-seabiscuit-stampede.html|title=A 'Seabiscuit' Stampede|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a book publisher will team up with newspapers. [[Triumph Books]], a division of Random House, is an example of a publisher that focuses on creating instant books with newspapers. Triumph worked with [[Los Angeles Times]] to publish a book commemorating the 2012 [[Stanley Cup]], and with the [[Chicago Tribune]] for an Instant book commemorating the [[2016 World Series|2016 World series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/52582-triumph-scores-with-stanley-cup-instant-book.html|title=Triumph Scores With Stanley Cup Instant Book|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|quote=The book, which was produced with a 10,000-copy print run, documents in text and illustrations provided by the Los Angeles Times the number eight playoff seed’s unlikely journey towards the first Stanley Cup championship.|access-date=2016-12-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/72088-this-week-s-bestsellers-november-21-2016.html|title=This Week's Bestsellers: November 21, 2016|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JHU Press is an example of a publisher producing an Instant book tied to a news event. JHU Press published an instant book on the Gun Violence debate shortly after the Sandy Hook incident with materials gathered from a summit that was quickly conceived and put together. The publisher Press described their process for publishing an instant book using a simultaneous process to Publisher's Weekly in 2013:       &lt;blockquote&gt;Kathy Alexander, JHU Press’ publicity manager, reports that while the press is more accustomed to a publishing process that typically takes 11 months from transmission of the manuscript to book release, they are able to produce ''Reducing Gun Violence'' in 14 days by shifting from a linear production process, in which every task occurs in order, to a more simultaneous process, in which different tasks are performed at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The cover, for example, was designed before the title was finalized,” Anderson explained, “Metadata was pushed out to booksellers before the manuscript was complete. Even the peer review process was changed to accommodate the schedule with multiple readers reviewing individual parts simultaneously.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/55528-johns-hopkins-press-publishes-first-instant-book.html|title=JHU Press Publishes First Instant Book In Response to Gun Violence|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Over the years, printers and book manufacturers have adjusted their process to accommodate instant books through innovation and updating printing practices.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20021028/21532-book-production-shifts-gears.html|title=Book Production Shifts Gears|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=PublishersWeekly.com|quote=All over the industry, printing records are being broken.

'''Irworobongdo''' is a [[Korea]]n [[folding screen]] with a highly stylized [[landscape painting]] of a [[sun]] and [[moon]], five peaks which always was set behind [[Phoenix Throne|''Eojwa'']], the king’s royal [[throne]] during the [[Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="KTO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=259914 |title=The National Palace Museum of Korea |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]] |accessdate=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D61038F936A25753C1A965958260 |title=Sampling of Treasures From 18th-Century Korea |author=Holland Cotter |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 15, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It literally means ''"Painting of the Sun, Moon and the Five Peaks"'' and is also called "Irwoldo" or "Irwolgonryundo". The sun and moon symbolize the king and queen while the five peaks denotes a mythical place. The screen serves to display the majesty of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] royal court.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.empas.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&amp;i=257096&amp;v=43 |script-title=ko:일월곤륜도 (日月崑崙圖)|publisher=[[Empas]] / [[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the image==
The scene depicts a burning red sun, a full moon, five craggy peaks, and two fast-flowing streams with [[Waterfall|cascades]], all flanked by a pair of conifers. The brilliant colours &amp;mdash; known as tang-chae (Chinese colours) &amp;mdash; were fixed with either animal or fish glue, rendering the screens brilliant and waterfast.&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/22/2200381.pdf |title=Sun, moon, and five peaks |author=Chadwick A. |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |date=June 1998 |volume= 4 |issue=2 |pages=114&amp;ndash;115}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[New York Times]] critic Holland Cotter has described the screen's solid, saturated colors and robust forms as being regular as "textile patterns", and noted that these screens have "an archaic, hieratic look unlike Chinese or Japanese painting of the time." &lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

==Symbolic significance==
[[Image:Gojong-King.of.the.Korean.Empire-1903.jpg|thumb|left|The Irworobongdo on a portrait of Gojong, king of Joseon Dynasty]]
There are no existing documents from an early period to explain the original [[iconography]] of the Five Peaks. Chadwick reports the findings of Dr. Yi Song-mi, Professor of Art History at the [[Academy of Korean Studies]] in [[Seoul]].&lt;ref name="Yi Seong-mi"&gt;Yi Seong-mi, The screen of the Five Peaks of the Choson dynasty. Oriental Art 1996/1997;XLII/4:13&amp;ndash;23.&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that these screens were one of the most important elements in the throne hall, and that this formalized landscape illustrates the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] political [[cosmology]].&lt;ref name="HKMJ"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sunzi1.lib.hku.hk/hkjo/view/22/2200175.pdf |title=Sun, moon, and Immortal Peaches |author=Chadwick A. |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |date=September 1996 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=234&amp;ndash;235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "almost" red sun represents the king as the yang, the positive male principle, while the white moon represents the queen as the yin, the negative female principle. These two principles make the universe work.

An alternative explanation is that the screen might represent the blessing of Korea by Heaven, symbolized by the sun and moon in balance. When the king sat in front of this screen, he appeared to be at the pivotal point from which all force emanated and to which all returned. Thus, imbued with sacred power, the screen manifests a political cosmology as evidence of Heaven's favour, mandate, and continued protection of the ruler.&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"/&gt;

==History of the screens==
Chadwick (1998)&lt;ref name="HKMJ 1998"/&gt; also reports Yi's (1996)&lt;ref name="Yi Seong-mi" /&gt; study of the history of such screens. He attempts to establish whether they were used at the start of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] reigned by [[Taejo of Joseon|King Taejo]] (r. 1392&amp;ndash;1398). One suggestion Yi reports is that the practice of using the Five Peaks screen was established by [[Jeong Do-jeon]]. He was instrumental in the adoption of [[Neo-Confucianism]] as the Joseon's state [[ideology]]. Jeong Do-jeon used the screen as an important part of the design of the Joseon palace architecture in 1392. However, there is a painting from the 16th century referred to as "The martial arts performance at Soch'ong-dae in the reign of [[Myeongjong of Joseon|King Myeongjong]]" (r. 1545&amp;ndash;1567) and there is no screen behind the throne. A 19th century copy however has the screen in place behind the throne. Yi therefore suggests that the 1392 date might be far too early and prefers a more recent date for the establishment of the screens. He suggests that screens role might well have been adopted after the 1592 [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin wars]] as an attempt to reaffirm the dynasty's power. [[Image:Sungmundang (interior 2), Changgyeonggung - Seoul, Korea.jpg|thumb|Right|The Irworobongdo at Changgyeonggung]]

The [[National Museum of Korea]]'s entry on the screens asserts that the earliest written evidence for the use of a Sun, Moon, and Five Peaks screen in the Joseon palace dates from the mid-seventeenth century, but suggests that they could have been used earlier, as part of the Joseon court tried to distinguish itself from that of the [[Goryeo]] court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emuseum.go.kr/eng/mus/nat_10.jsp The National Museum of Korea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216035810/http://www.emuseum.go.kr/eng/mus/nat_10.jsp |date=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palace records suggest that the screens were constantly being produced. Today however, only around twenty originals remain. None are signed. Examples of the screens can be seen at royal palaces in [[Seoul]] such as at [[Gyeongbokgung|Gyeongbok Palace]], [[Changdeokgung|Changdeok Palace]] and [[Changgyeonggung]].&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;

'''Janet Evanovich''' (born '''Janet Schneider'''; April 22, 1943) is an American writer. She began her career writing short contemporary [[romance novels]] under the pen name '''Steffie Hall''', but gained fame authoring a series of contemporary mysteries featuring [[Stephanie Plum]], a former lingerie buyer from [[Trenton, New Jersey]], who becomes a [[bounty hunter]] to make ends meet after losing her job. The novels in this series have been on ''The New York Times'', [[USA Today]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] bestseller lists. Evanovich has had her last seventeen Plums debut at #1 on the ''NY Times'' Best Sellers list and eleven of them have hit #1 on ''USA Today'' Best-Selling Books list. She has over two hundred million books in print worldwide and is translated into over 40 languages.

== Early years ==
Evanovich is a second-generation American born in [[South River, New Jersey]] to a [[machinist]] and a housewife.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; After attending [[South River High School (New Jersey)|South River High School]],&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Debra. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DA113FF930A35752C1A9649C8B63 "IN PERSON; Imagine Trenton. One Author Did."], ''The New York Times'', November 3, 2002. Accessed March 20, 2011. "She graduated from South River High School, married her high school sweetheart and attended Douglass College.... If there is a typical career path for novelists, Mrs. Evanovich is certain that she has not followed it. After growing up in South River, she followed her husband, who was in the Navy, as he moved around the country, stayed at home and raised their two children and then, when she was in her 30s, decided that she wanted to write."&lt;/ref&gt; she became the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at [[Douglass College]], part of [[Rutgers University]], to study art.&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite web|last=MacDonald|first=Jay|title=Fame and Fortune: Author Janet Evanovich|publisher=Bankrate.com|date=October 24, 2006|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.bankrate.com/cbsmw/news/investing/Oct06_fame_fortune_Janet_Evanovich_a3.asp}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

When Evanovich had children, she chose to become a housewife like her mother. In her thirties, she began writing novels.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; To learn the art of writing dialog, Evanovich took lessons in [[Improvisational theatre|improv acting]].&lt;ref name=white/&gt; For ten years, she attempted to write the [[Great American Novel]], finishing three manuscripts that she was unable to sell. After someone suggested she try writing [[romance novels]], Evanovich read several romances and discovered that she enjoyed the genre. She wrote two romances and submitted them for publishing.&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jean|first=Lorna|publisher=All About Romance|title=Quickie with Janet Evanovich on her Stephanie Plum Series|date=September 18, 1998|url=http://www.likesbooks.com/quick20.html|accessdate=2007-08-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906013522/http://www.likesbooks.com/quick20.html|archivedate=September 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still unable to find a publisher, Evanovich stopped writing and signed with a temporary employment agency. Several months after beginning work for them, she received an offer to buy her second romance manuscript for $2,000, which she considered an "astounding sum."&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Claire E.|title=A Conversation with Janet Evanovich|publisher=The Internet Writing Journal|accessdate=2007-08-13|url=http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/jan99/evanovch.htm|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romance novels==
That novel, ''Hero at Large'', was published in 1987 in the Second Chance Love category line under the pseudonym Steffie Hall.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; The following year she began writing for Bantam Loveswept under her own name.&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt; For the next five years she continued to write category romances for Loveswept.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Her work within the romance novel genre helped her learn to create likable characters and attractive leading men.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt; In this time, Evanovich also became known for the humor that filled her novels. She believes that "it's very important to take a comic approach. If we can laugh at something, we can face it."&lt;ref name="jakeman"/&gt;

After finishing her twelfth romance, however, Evanovich realized that she was more interested in writing the action sequences in her novels than the sex scenes. Her editors were not interested in her change of heart, so Evanovich took the next eighteen months to formulate a plan for what she actually wanted to write.&lt;ref name="cochran"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cochran |first=Tracy |title=Jersey Janet Takes on the World |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=June 30, 2003 |accessdate=2007-08-13 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA308240.html?display=current&amp;industry=Features&amp;verticalid=792&amp;q=romance+writers+of+america |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203145352/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA308240.html?display=current&amp;industry=Features&amp;verticalid=792&amp;q=romance%2Bwriters%2Bof%2Bamerica |archivedate=February 3, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephanie Plum Series===
She quickly decided that she wanted to write romantic adventure novels.&lt;ref name="tierney"/&gt; Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in [[first person narrative]].&lt;ref name="white"/&gt; Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as "a sense of family and community."&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; In that vein, she intended her new style of writing to be based on the TV sitcom model. Like [[Seinfeld]], her new books would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney|first=Bruce|title=Janet Evanovich: Mystery maven keeps readers coming back for more|publisher=BookPage|date=July 2000|accessdate=2007-08-14|url=http://www.bookpage.com/0007bp/janet_evanovich.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703015540/http://www.bookpage.com/0007bp/janet_evanovich.html|archivedate=July 3, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the [[Robert De Niro]] movie ''[[Midnight Run]]'', Evanovich decided that her heroine would be a [[bounty hunter]].&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; This occupation provided more freedom for Evanovich as a writer, as bounty hunters do not have a set work schedule and are not forced to wear a uniform. The profession is also "romanticised to some extent."&lt;ref name="jakeman"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jakeman |first=Jane |title=The Books Interview:Janet Evanovich – Plum jobs for a woman of parts |newspaper=The (London) Independent |date=October 21, 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001021/ai_n14357679 |accessdate=2007-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211192718/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001021/ai_n14357679 |archivedate=February 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To become acquainted with the demands of the career, Evanovich spent a great deal of time shadowing bond enforcement agents. She also researched more about the city of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], where she wanted her books to be set.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt;

In 1994, her initial romantic adventure, ''[[One for the Money (novel)|One for the Money]]'', was published to good reviews.&lt;ref name="cochran"/&gt; This was the first of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter [[Stephanie Plum]]. ''One for the Money'' was named a ''New York Times'' notable book, a ''Publishers Weekly'' Best Book of 1994 and a ''USA Today'' Best Bet.&lt;ref name="hayward"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hayward|first=Mike|title=Interview: Janet Evanovich discusses Twelve Sharp and much else, with Mike Hayward |publisher=BookBrowse|url=http://www.bookbrowse.com/author_interviews/full/index.cfm?author_number=232|year=2006|accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evanovich has continued to write romantic adventures starring Stephanie Plum. The sixth book in the series, ''Hot Six'', was the first of her novels to reach number one on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]].&lt;ref name="macdonald"/&gt; Her subsequent Plum novels have each debuted at number one.&lt;ref name="cruz"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|title=How Janet Evanovich broke through|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 2, 2006|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1199996,00.html|accessdate=2007-08-14|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All About Romance'' has described her as the "rare breed of romance author who has left the genre and yet not alienated her many romance fans."&lt;ref name="jean"/&gt;

The Plum novels have taken many attributes from Evanovich's own life. Evanovich shares many commonalities with her character Stephanie Plum. Both are from New Jersey, both devour Cheetos, both had owned a hamster, and both have shared "similar embarrassing experiences."&lt;ref name=white/&gt; The character Grandma Mazur is loosely based on Evanovich's "Grandma Fanny" and "Aunt Lena." Evanovich claims the spirited elderly lady is "who I want to be when I grow up."&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Jean Marie|title=Author Interview: Janet Evanovich: Delivering a Plum Good Read|publisher=Crescent Blues|year=2004|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/7_9issue/int_evanovich.shtml|accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before ''[[One for the Money (novel)|One for the Money]]'' was released, Evanovich sold the movie rights to [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group|Columbia TriStar]] for $1 million.&lt;ref name="macdonald"/&gt; [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] released ''[[One for the Money (film)|One for the Money]]'' on January 27, 2012. The film stars [[Katherine Heigl]] as Stephanie Plum, [[Sherri Shepherd]] from ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' as Lula, [[Debbie Reynolds]] as Grandma Mazur, [[Jason O'Mara]] as Joe Morelli, and [[Daniel Sunjata]] as Ranger.  It was directed by [[Julie Anne Robinson]].&lt;ref name="EW 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/23/katherine-heigl-one-for-the-money-january-2012/ | title=Katherine Heigl comedy thriller 'One for the Money' moves to January 2012|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knight &amp; Moon  Series===
In 2016 Evanovich released the first book, ''Curious Minds'', in her new Knight &amp; Moon mystery series.  Co-authored with Phoef Sutton, the book introduces two new characters, Emerson Knight and Riley Moon.  Emerson Knight is a rich, eccentric introvert with little-to-no sense of social etiquette.  He is also brilliant and handsome.  Riley Moon is a recent Harvard Law and Harvard Business graduate.  Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald where Emerson is a client.  Together this unlikely duo finds themselves thrust into solving the most difficult of mysteries.

''Dangerous Minds'', the second book in the series, was written by Evanovich and released in June 2017.

===Wicked Series===
In 2010 Evanovich published ''Wicked Appetite'', spinning off the character Diesel from the between-the-numbers Plum books.  The heroine of ''Wicked Appetite'' is sweet cupcake baker Lizzie Tucker, who, unlike Stephanie Plum, can cook.  The "Wicked" series is set in Salem, Massachusetts.  In the series, Diesel &amp; Lizzie search for the seven stones of power, each representing a different deadly sin.  Lizzie &amp; Diesel are "Unmentionables", humans with additional powers. Their rivals for the stones are Diesel's dark cousin, Gerwulf "Wulf" Grimoire, introduced in ''Plum Spooky'' and his medieval-esque minion Hatchet.  Lizzie's animal companions are one-eyed Cat 7143 and Carl the Monkey, from ''Fearless Fourteen'' and ''Plum Spooky''.   Her friends include Glo, a "Questionable," and Clara Dazzle, an "Unmentionable" who lost her powers after congress with another "Unmentionable."  In ''Wicked Appetite'', the stone sought is that incarnating the sin of gluttony.

In 2012 Evanovich published ''Wicked Business'', the second in the series.  In ''Wicked Business'', the stone embodies the sin of lust.  A new villain is introduced, deranged candy heiress Deirdre Early, or Anarchy.  Lizzie, through a selfless act and exchange of body fluids with Wulf, converts the lust stone into the "icky true love stone", implying that in the right circumstances, the stones of sin can be converted into stones of virtue.

In 2015 Evanovich teamed up with [[Phoef Sutton]] for the third novel in the series, ''Wicked Charms''. The Stone of Avarice (Greed) is the focus of this installment.&lt;ref name="charms"/&gt;

===Fox and O'Hare Series===
In June 2013, Evanovich published the novella "Pros &amp; Cons" and the novel ''The Heist'', the first two works in a new series co-written with [[Lee Goldberg]]. Since then the series has grown to five novels (The Heist, The Chase, The Job, The Scam, and The Pursuit), two novellas (Pros &amp; Cons and The Shell Game) and one online short-story, The Caper.

The protagonist is FBI special agent Kate O’Hare who has devoted her career to taking down one of the FBI’s most wanted con men and master thieves, Nick Fox. That is until the FBI pairs Kate with the most unlikely person, Nick Fox, to take down criminals. Together they travel the globe skirting on the edge of what is legal and illegal. Kate’s father, Jake O’Hare, a retired Special Forces operative, often aids in their quest.  In June 2016, the fifth novel in the series, The Pursuit, was released.

===Other novels===
Evanovich began a collaborative effort with Charlotte Hughes because she wanted to see some of her other ideas on paper but did not have the time to write them. This resulted in the "Full" series.  The "Full" series is set in Beaumont, South Carolina and features Jamie Swift and Maximillian Holt, who meet in the second "Full" book, ''Full Tilt''.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt;

The ''Elsie Hawkins'' novels are stand alone romances with a supporting character Elsie Hawkins, who is a gun totin' retiree, with tight grey curls, who "doesn't take sass from no one."  Elsie drives a 1957 powder blue Cadillac that never seems to sustain damage.  In the Stephanie Plum series, Grandma Mazur and Stephanie drive Uncle Sandor's 1953 powder blue Buick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evanovich|first=Janet|title=Three To Get Deadly|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has similar indestructibility.

In 2004, Evanovich launched another series with ''Metro Girl.'' This book debuted at Number 2 on the New York Times Best Seller List.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt; The heroine is Alexandra Barnaby, an auto mechanic.  Her love interest is Sam Hooker, a hedonistic NASCAR driver.  The "Motor" series is set in the southern U.S. states.  Further books in the series include ''Motor Mouth'' and ''Troublemaker 1 &amp; 2'' (graphic novels).

Evanovich collaborated with [[Stephen J. Cannell]], noted T.V. writer and producer (''A Team, Rockford Files, Baretta, 21 Jump Street''), on a book entitled ''No Chance'', which was to be the first book in a new series. It was supposed to be released in October 2007. However, in July 2007, the book was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/no_chance_of_evanovichcannell_collaboration_63020.asp No Chance of Evanovich/Cannell Collaboration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826102131/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/authors/no_chance_of_evanovichcannell_collaboration_63020.asp |date=August 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen J. Cannell died in 2010 of melanoma.

==Personal life==
During the week, Evanovich works eight or more hours per day. On weekends she generally works for an additional four hours each day.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; She generally creates a brief outline before beginning a new book, with one or two sentences about what will happen in each chapter.&lt;ref name="ward"/&gt; Upon the release of a new book, Evanovich regularly goes on book tours. Her book signings attracted thousands of people. Beginning with her third Stephanie Plum book, ''Three to Get Deadly,'' and ending with ''Smokin' Seventeen'', all of the titles have been chosen from fan submissions.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt;

Evanovich lives in Florida with her husband, Pete, whom she married in 1964. Pete is of [[Serbs|Serbian]] ancestry. Members of Evanovich's family are employed by her company, Evanovich Inc., including her husband, Pete, son, Peter, and daughter Alexandra.

Evanovich's niece (by marriage) is author Stephanie Evanovich. (Stephanie's father is the brother of Janet's husband, Pete.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likesbooks.com/blog/?p=10266 A Tale of Two Evanoviches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jeune fille en buste''''' (Portrait of the young girl) is a work by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]] painted in 1794 and exhibited at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]. One of Guérin's early works, it treats the subject in a frank and direct way. Guérin uses the old "Titus style model". The smooth bottom, the simplicity of the design and the use of the measured color as Regnault left the students towards '''David'''.&lt;ref name= "u"/&gt;

The '''Krämerbrücke''' (Merchants' bridge) is a medieval [[arch bridge]] in the city of [[Erfurt]], in [[Thuringia]] in central Germany, which is lined with [[half timbered]] shops and houses on both sides of a cobblestone street. It is one of the few remaining bridges in the world that have inhabited buildings. It has been continuously inhabited for over 500 years, longer than any other bridge in Europe.&lt;ref name=stade&gt;Stade, Heinz, et al (2011) ''Damit Vergangenheit Zukunft hat'' pp 4-5. Erfurt: Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.erfurt-tourismus.de/sehens-wissenswertes/sehenswertes/kraemerbruecke/ Krämerbrücke] on [http://erfurt-tourismus.de erfurt-tourismus.de]. Retrieved 3 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone, pedestrian bridge, which dates from 1325, is one of the oldest secular structures in Erfurt.&lt;ref name=feste&gt;Ranglack, Klaus; Hans-Peter Brachmanski (1999) ''Die Erfurter Krämerbrücke und ihre Feste''. Erfurt: Verlagshaus Thüringen&lt;/ref&gt; It spans the [[Breitstrom]], a branch of [[Gera River]], and connects two town squares - Benediktsplatz and Wenigemarkt.

==Structure==
[[File:Erfurt-Kraemerbruecke1.jpg|thumb|left|An arch of the Krämerbrücke, with wooden ''Sprengwerk'' in front of it]]
From end to end, the Krämerbrücke is 125 m long in total. The stone bridge, which was built in 1325, is constructed from limestone and sandstone, and has six visible barrel arches ranging from 5.5 to 8 m wide.&lt;ref name=feste /&gt; The section of the bridge supported by the six arches is 79 m long.&lt;ref name=baumbach&gt;Baumbach, Dietrich; Vockrodt; Hans-Jörg (2000) ''Historische Bogen- und Gewölbebrücken der Stadt Erfurt'' pp 50-55. Berlin: Habel Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; Wooden stalls were built on top of the stone-bridge for trading goods.&lt;ref name=SR&gt;Raßloff, Steffen (1 June 2013) [http://www.erfurt-web.de/Kr%C3%A4merbr%C3%BCcke Krämerbrücke: Symbol der Handelsstadt] in ''Thüringer Allgemeine''. Retrieved 2 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The bridge originally had stone churches at both ends, where gated entrances were erected - St. Benedict's Church at the western end and St Ägidien's Church at the eastern end. St Ägidien's Church, the only one of the two that still exists, was previously a [[bridge chapel]]. The chapel was first mentioned in 1110. The archway of the church, via which the Krämerbrücke can be entered, is 3.75 m wide and 3.25 m high.&lt;ref&gt;Vockrodt, Hans-Jörg; Baumbach, Dietrich (2004) ''Brücken und Stege im alten Erfurt'' pp 33-35. Erfurt: Hans-Jörg Vockrodt und Dietrich Baumbach&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the houses on the Krämerbrücke was completed in 1486, following a fire in 1472 which destroyed nearly half of the city and the market stalls on the stone bridge.&lt;ref name=feste /&gt;&lt;ref name=SR /&gt; Sixty-two timber framed buildings were built on each side of the stone bridge, creating a street between the two rows.&lt;ref name=SR /&gt; Later, the small houses were gradually merged, so that there are now 32 houses on the bridge. They have shops on the ground floor and living accommodation above.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Hans, et al (2016) ''Erlebnisreise durch das Thüringen Land mit der Klassikerstraße''. Bad Münstereifel: Zeithen-Panorama Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; They are the longest rows of inhabited buildings on any bridge in Europe.&lt;ref name=EK&gt;Erfurt Tourismus (2003) ''Erfurt: Erlebnis Krämerbrücke'' [parallel title: ''Merchants' Bridge'']. Erfurt: Erfurt Stadtverwaltung&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three-storey houses are 13 m to 15 m in height. To make them habitable, the width of the bridge was extended by using wooden ''Sprengwerke'' (trusses or bracing) next to the arched vaults, so that the buildings partially overhang the stone bridge structure. The total width of the bridge, as completed in 1486, is 26 m. The road between the two rows of buildings is 5.5 m wide.&lt;ref name=baumbach /&gt;

== History==
[[File:Krämerbrücke Erfurt 2016 (21).jpg|thumb|left|North side, Krämerbrücke from the river, 2016]]
[[File:Krämerbrücke in Erfurt 55.JPG|thumb|Krämerbrücke, street view looking west]]
The bridge was part of the [[Via Regia]], a medieval trade and pilgrims' road network, which linked Rome with the Baltic Sea, and Moscow with [[Santiago de Compostela]] in northern Spain. The Krämerbrücke is on the route from the river [[Rhine]] to [[Silesia]].&lt;ref name=MDR&gt;Kadagge, Tatjana (Dir.). ''Unsere Boulevards - Die Krämerbrücke in Erfurt''. [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] TV programme (30 min), broadcast 22 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is also on one of the main routes of the [[Camino de Santiago]], the Way of St. James pilgrimage. Erfurt was at a major crossroads of the Via Regia and it became an important trading centre in the Middle Ages. It was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]].&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Philippe (2000) [https://books.google.de/books?id=UOlQuaYvBu8C&amp;lpg=PR44&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=erfurt&amp;f=false ''The German Hansa''] Stanford University Press. Retrieved 11 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

A wooden bridge was built at sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries at the same river [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] as the present day Krämerbrücke.&lt;ref name=stade /&gt; The bridge was first mentioned in 1117 after its destruction by one of many fires.&lt;ref name=SR /&gt;

The first written evidence of a “pons rerum venalium”, i.e. "a market bridge", on the site dates back to 1156.&lt;ref name=herz&gt;Herz, Andrea (2015) ''Stadtgucker Erfurt, Krämerbrücke''. Erfurt: Herzformat&lt;/ref&gt; Merchants and trades people had already set up market stalls on both sides of the bridge by this date. The name ''Krämerbrücke'', which means "merchants' bridge", has been in common usage since 1510.&lt;ref name=GK&gt;Kaiser, Gerhard (1998) ''Die Krämerbrücke in Erfurt''. Lindenberg: Kunstverlag Fink&lt;/ref&gt;

There were repeated fires on the wooden bridge in 1175, 1178, 1213, 1222, 1245, 1265, and 1293. The idea of building a stone bridge was discussed after the 1265 fire and in 1293 the municipal administration acquired all bridge rights from the monasteries, who traded goods on the bridge. However, the stone bridge wasn't completed until 1325.&lt;ref name=herz /&gt;&lt;ref name=SR /&gt; 

For about the first hundred years following the stone bridge`s construction, mainly local produce was sold in its stalls. There were a number of important monasteries in Erfurt, including [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St Augustine's]], where [[Martin Luther]] was later a monk; the Dominican Prediger Monastery where the mystic [[Meister Eckhart]] (c. 1260 - 1328) was the prior; and the Benedictine monastery of St Peter and Paul, which was on the hill where [[Petersberg Citadel]] now stands. These continued to have stalls on the bridge, selling "Apoteki", such as herbs for healing and culinary use, wine and vegetables.&lt;ref name=herz /&gt;

Later, goods such as paper, goldsmiths' work, silk, spices and oriental perfumes such as [[frankincense]] from places up to 7000 km away were sold on the bridge, and the locally produced [[woad]], a valuable and important dye for which Erfurt was renowned, was sold to traders who took it across Europe.&lt;ref name=herz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirsk, Joan (1997) [https://books.google.de/books?id=ptJ-uRDb4E4C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=erfurt+woad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8ev3iYLBhi&amp;sig=L6nZKssBAlq4xo6tuOFwS4TzoV8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiovfLTp5fUAhUqL8AKHZJ-BocQ6AEIajAO#v=onepage&amp;q=erfurt%20woad&amp;f=false Alternative Agriculture: A History: From the Black Death to the Present Day], Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th and 17th centuries, after the current half-timbered houses had been built, trades people such as toymakers, [[furriers]], [[passementerie]] makers and [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanners]] began to operate from the workshops on the bridge.&lt;ref name=GK /&gt; 

In 1624 the city council gave permission for street musicians to play on and around the bridge, with flutes, fiddles, trumpets, [[crumhorns]] and [[Pommer|pommers]]. Street musicians still play on the bridge today; both traditional music and contemporary bands are an important part of the annual ''Krämerbrückenfest''.&lt;ref name=herz /&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===
St. Benedict's Church at the west end of the bridge was sold in 1807 and later demolished, apart from its tower, in 1810, in order to build a new house. In 1895 the tower was also demolished to enable the construction of the Rathausbrücke (town hall bridge), which crosses the river parallel to the Krämerbrücke on its south side. When the Rathausbrücke was being planned, the idea of completely demolishing the Krämerbrücke was discussed.&lt;ref name=SR /&gt;

In 1945, house numbers 11 to 14 were damaged in an allied air raid, with number 12 being completely destroyed. The buildings were reconstructed in 1954.&lt;ref name=blatt&gt;Raßloff, Steffen (c. 2015) [https://www.erfurt-tourismus.de/fileadmin/download/Blaetterbuch_Kraemerbruecke.pdf Blaetterbuch_Kraemerbruecke.pdf]. Erfurt: Stiftung Krämerbrücke. Retrieved 10 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

An extensive restoration of the whole bridge structure, including the arched vaults, was carried out by the [[East German]] government in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref name=blatt /&gt; Since then, vehicles up to a weight of 11 tons have been allowed to use the bridge, although it remains essentially a pedestrian bridge, with only small delivery and maintenance vehicles accessing it at restricted times.

Since 1990 the bridge has been under continual maintenance. Over 1 million Euro has been spent on it.&lt;ref name=blatt /&gt;

== The Krämerbrücke today==
[[File:KraemerbrueckeOben.jpg|thumb|left|Krämerbrücke viewed from St. Ägidien's tower]]
The bridge is still an important thoroughfare for local residents, as well as being one of Erfurt's main tourist sites. It is still in much the same use as it has been for over 500 years.&lt;ref name=MDR /&gt;

About 80 people live on the Krämerbrücke. The shops at street level house businesses such as artisans' workshops, specialist food outlets, antique shops, wine merchants, art galleries, cafes, etc. A bakery operates at the western end of the bridge. The upper levels of the buildings are mainly inhabited homes.&lt;ref name=MDR /&gt; Except for the buildings numbered 15, 20, 24 and 33, all the other buildings on the bridge are municipal property. 

In medieval times buildings were not numbered and many people were illiterate, so house signs were sometimes hung on buildings or placed over doorways, so that the house and its occupants could be easily located. Examples of these can still be seen on the bridge, as well as original doors which may be hundreds of years old.&lt;ref name=herz /&gt;

The ''Stiftung Krämerbrücke'' (Krämerbrücke Foundation) was founded in 1996 by the city council. It is responsible for maintaining the bridge and promoting its history. The foundation strictly controls what type of businesses can operate from the bridge to ensure that it remains in keeping with its historical roots.&lt;ref name=EK /&gt; In the “Haus der Stiftung” (Krämerbrücke 31), there is a permanent exhibition about the history of the bridge.&lt;ref name=stade /&gt; The information centre also provides information on the organisations that ensure that the bridge is properly looked after; these are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erfurt.de/ef/de/wirtschaft/partner/stiftungen/kraemerbruecke/bruecke/121184.html ''Stiftung Krämerbrücke: Haus der Stiftung''] in Erfurt.de website.

==Krämerbrückenfest==

The ''Krämerbrückenfest'' is an important festival in Erfurt, attracting about 130,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tag24.de/nachrichten/erfurt-thueringen-kraemerbrueckenfest-clueso-michael-schulte-namika-feuerwerk-bilder-646093 Volle Gassen und tolle Musiker: Das war das 43.

It is a celebration of the bridge and the culture of the Middle Ages. The festival is officially opened by an actor playing the folkloric character [[Till Eulenspiegel]], who according to legend visited Erfurt and fooled the professors at the university that he had taught a donkey to read.&lt;ref name=feste /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.erfurt-tourismus.de/events-veranstaltungen/hoehepunkte-2018/kraemerbrueckenfest/ Das 43.

'''Independent bookstores''' are small bookselling businesses, usually with one or a small number of locations in a limited geographic area. They contrast with corporate or chain bookstores, operated by a larger company, often with many stores across a large area.

The '''''Madonna of Loreto''''' is a c.1507 oil on panel painting by [[Perugino]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]], which bought it in 1879. It shows the Madonna and Child flanked by [[Jerome]] (left) and [[Francis of Assisi]] (right). Two angels hover over Mary's head holding a crown. It reuses the low parapet from ''[[Madonna and Child with St Rose and St Catherine]]'' (1492) and probably also involved the master's studio assistants.  

The painting was commissioned by Giovanni di Matteo Schiavone (died 7 June 1507) for a planned chapel at Santa Maria dei Servi church in Perugia. It was delivered in September 1507. It probably originally had a [[predella]] of three small panels (''Annunciation'', ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' and ''Baptism of Christ''), now in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]].

'''Master W with the Key''' also known as '''Master WA''' and '''Master of the Housemark''' (active c. 1465–1490) was an anonymous [[Netherlandish]] [[Engraving|engraver]], who is thought to have been a [[goldsmith]] in [[Bruges]]. The name given to him refers to his [[monogram]], which is a W followed by a key symbol. Eighty-two works signed with that monogram are extant. Many of these are [[ornament print]]s, depicting elements of [[gothic architecture]] and decorative objects, and were probably marketed mainly as patterns for other craftsmen to follow. He also produced prints of ships, the first known. He influenced several other contemporary Dutch engravers, most notably [[Master&amp;nbsp;I.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;M. of Zwolle]]. He probably worked for Duke [[Charles the Bold]] of Burgundy, and his ship series may have been "portraits" of the ducal fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 51-52 (illustrating two additional ships)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nu à la cheminée''''', also referred to as '''''Nu dans un intérieur''''', '''''Femme nu''''', and '''''Nu''''' or '''''Nude''''', is a painting by [[Jean Metzinger]]. The work was exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1910, and the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], Galerie La Boétie in Paris, October 1912. It was published in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Jean Metzinger and [[Albert Gleizes]] in 1912, and subsequently published in ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations (Les Peintres Cubistes)]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 1913. ''Nu à la cheminée'' was in the collection of G. Commerre (or Comerre, a relative of Albert Gleizes) at the time. The work has not been seen in public since, and its current location is unknown.

==Overview==
{{centered pull quote|Until 1910 P. Picasso, J. Metzinger, and G. Braque were the only pioneers of the movement [...] and it was they who originated the term ''cubism''. ([[Maurice Raynal]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Raynal]], ''L'Exposition de la 'Section d'Or' (The Section d'Or Exhibition)'', 1912, in Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', The University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jean Metzinger, judging from an interview with [[Gelett Burgess]] in ''[[Architectural Record]]'',&lt;ref name="Gelett Burgess"&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/inthecause/0702MenOfParis/MenOfParis3.asp Gelett Burgess, Wild Men of Paris, The Architectural Record, May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt; appears to have abandoned his [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style in favor of the ''faceting of form'' associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt; A resident of [[Montmartre]], Metzinger frequented the [[Bateau Lavoir]] at this time and exhibited with [[Georges Braque]] at the [[Berthe Weill]] gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of [[Picasso]] (''Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier'', 1910), Braque (''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910) and Metzinger (''Nu à la cheminée, Nude'', 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to depicting the subject matter classically from one point of view, Metzinger used a concept he enunciated for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' (published in ''Pan'', 1910),&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; of 'mobile perspective' to portray the subject from a variety of angles. The images captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive intervals in time are shown simultaneously on the canvas.&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, Cubist Works, 1910–1921, p.&amp;nbsp;43, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity between Metzinger's own work of 1910 to that of Picasso is exemplified in his ''Nu à la cheminée''. The style of lips in both Metzinger's ''Nude'' and Picasso's ''Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde'' (spring-automn 1910) bear resemblance to each other (both are in the form of an "X"). So too, both pictures merge the model with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. Metzinger, however—in addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective—has included the image of a clock in the upper right quadrant, a fact that reveals Metzinger's didactic visual and literary reference to the physicist, mathematician and philosopher of science [[Henri Poincaré]], and to the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s 'duration'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such mathematical and philosophical inferences had little in common with the paintings of Picasso or Braque. Metzinger's interpretation targeted a wide audience—as opposed to private gallery collectors—exhibits in abundance an underlying idealism, a temporal reconstruction of dissected subjects based on the principles of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. These inferences were compelling because they offered a stimulating and intelligible rationale for his innovations—consistent with contemporary intellectual trends in literature; notably with the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] group and [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref name="Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Nude%22+1910,+Metzinger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EDDDUfrWCOPL4ATvuYGgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nude%22%201910%2C%20Metzinger&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometrical follies==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1910-11, Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women), oil on canvas, 92 x 66 cm, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Sweden.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Metzinger, 1910–11, ''[[Deux Nus|Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women)]]'', oil on canvas, 92 × 66 cm, [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]], Sweden. Exhibited at the first Cubist manifestation, Room 41 of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], Paris]]
At the 1910 [[Salon des Indépendants]] the works of Metzinger (''Nu'', n. 3635, possibly ''Nu à la cheminée'', and ''Portrait de M. Guillaume Apollinaire'', n. 3636),&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k133418b/f155.image.r=Salon%20des%20Ind%C3%A9pendants.langEN Société des artistes indépendants, 26, Catalogue de la 26e exposition, 1910, Jean Metzinger, numbers 3631–3636 of the catalogue], Gallica, bibliothèque numérique de France&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Gleizes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k133418b/f243.image.r=Salon%20des%20Ind%C3%A9pendants.langEN Société des artistes indépendants, 26, Catalogue de la 26e exposition, 1910, Albert Gleizes, numbers 2159-2164 of the catalogue], Gallica, bibliothèque numérique de France&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Le Fauconnier]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k133418b/f212.image.r=Salon%20des%20Ind%C3%A9pendants.langEN Société des artistes indépendants, 26, Catalogue de la 26e exposition, 1910, Henri Le Fauconnier, numbers 3047-3050], Gallica, bibliothèque numérique de France&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Delaunay]] were hung in close proximity, where the mutual geometric interests, then observable  collectively, began to unite as a group sensibility. Critics had begun treating these mutual interests as a single style, though the term Cubism would not emerge until the following spring relative to the same artists, on the occasion of the [[Salon des Indépendants]]. The autumn of 1910 saw Metzinger's ''Nude'' as the most purely Cubist work shown.&lt;ref name="Milton A. Cohen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gtSzgZrq4cUC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Nude%22+1910,+Metzinger&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7kPDUe61BISY0QWL4YDgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nude%22%201910%2C%20Metzinger&amp;f=false Milton A. Cohen, ''Movement, manifesto, melee: the modernist group, 191–1914'', Lexington Books, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne, published in ''La Presse'', art critique Edmond Epardaud writes of the 'geometric follies' of Metzinger, and describes both Gleizes and Le Fauconnier as 'specious architects' (''architectes fallacieux'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k596525z/f2.image Edmond Epardaud, ''On Inaugure demain le Salon d'Automne'', La Presse, 30 September 1910, Numéro 6675, pp. 1, 2]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critic Jean Claude writes in his review of the same salon, with reference to ''Nu à la cheminée'', published in ''Le Petit Parisien'', "Metzinger painted a puzzle, cubic and triangular, which after verification, is a naked woman. I managed to discover the head, torso and legs. I had to give up finding arms. This is beyond comprehension".&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k563747g/f5.image Jean Claude, ''Grand Palais, Le Salon d'Automne'', Le Petit Parisien, 2 October 1910, Numéro 12391, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months earlier, reviewing the Indépendants, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] had described Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay and [[Fernand Léger|Léger]] as "ignorant geometers".&lt;ref name="Milton A. Cohen" /&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] reviewing the 1910 Salon d'Automne used the terms "analytical" and "synthesis" in relation to Metzinger's ''Nu à la cheminée'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Metzinger's nude and his landscape are ruled by an equal striving for fragmentary synthesis. No usual cliché from the aesthetic vocabulary fits the art of this disconcerting painter. Consider the elements of his nude: a woman, a clock, an armchair, a table, a vase with flowers...such, at least, is an account of my personal inventory. The head whose expression is very noble is rendered formally, and the artist seems to have drawn back from the integral application of his law. [...] The analytical kinships among objects and their mutual subordinations will be henceforth of little importance since they will be suppressed in the painted realization. These come into play later, subjectively, in each individual's mental realization.&lt;ref name="Robbins, p. 15"&gt;Daniel Robbins, "Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism", 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"The importance of Allard's understanding of the genuine innovation visible at the salon is hard to overestimate," writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "He goes well beyond Metzinger's emphasis in the ''Pan'' article on multiple points of view, that is, beyond the technical innovations of the new painting. He penetrates to its intellectual core: an art capable of synthesizing a reality in the mind of the observer..."&lt;ref name="Robbins, p. 15" /&gt;

[[Albert Gleizes]], in his review of the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]] writes about Metzinger's ''Nu à la cheminée'':&lt;ref name="Gleizes"&gt;Albert Gleizes, "L'Art et ses représentants", ''La Revue Indépendante'', September 1911, pp. 161–172. In Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten, ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906–1914'', The University of Chicago Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, he wishes to develop the visual field by multiplying it, in order to inscribe it within the space of the canvas itself. It is at that point that the cube will play a role, and it is there that Metzinger will use that means to reestablish a balance that has been momentarily interrupted by these audacious inscriptions.

At the last Salon d'Automne [1910], we were able to get an idea of that technique, inscribed and set out in simple terms.

His ''Femme nu'', depicted from various angles and in integral relationship with the setting, the shapes very subtly nestled one into another, was more like a masterful demonstration of the tootal image than an exclusively pictorial creation.

Certain discriminating critics [...] considered it a metaphysical discovery more than a manifestation of art. Alembics, laboratory tubing, intellectual masturbation—people have called his work all those things, with the greatest seriousness in the world.&lt;ref name="Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nutcracker dolls''', also known as '''Christmas nutcrackers''', are decorative [[nutcracker]] figurines most commonly made to resemble a [[toy soldier]]. In German tradition, the dolls are symbols of good luck, scaring away bad spirits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/holidays/2010/12/in_a_nutshell.html|title=In a Nutshell|last=Malone|first=Noreen|date=2010-12-16|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianballet.com.au/behind-ballet/the-nutcracker-doll-a-history|title=The nutcracker doll: a history {{!}} The Australian Ballet|website=australianballet.com.au|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Nussknackermuseum 002.jpg|thumb|left|Original nutcracker dolls from [[Nussknacker Museum]] in [[Neuhausen, Saxony]]]]
Nutcracker dolls originate from late-17th century Germany, particularly the [[Ore Mountains]] (German: ''Erzgebirge'') region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One origin story attributes the creation of the first nutcracker doll to a craftsman from [[Seiffen]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were often given as gifts, and at some point they became associated with [[Christmas]] season. They grew in popularity around the 19th century and spread to nearby European countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the demand grew, nutcracker doll production also began on a mass scale in factories.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; {{ill|Friedrich Wilhelm Füchtner|de}} (1844–1923), commonly known in Germany as "father of the nutcracker", began the first mass production of the design (using a [[lathe]]) at his workshop in [[Seiffen]] in [[Saxony]] during 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutcrackermuseum.com/history.htm|title=NM The History of Nutcrackers ~ Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum|website=www.nutcrackermuseum.com|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanton2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Maureen |last=Stanton|title=Killer Stuff and Tons of Money: An Insider's Look at the World of Flea Markets, Antiques, and Collecting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JpjtUNexvC4C&amp;pg=PT25|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-51605-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   http://www.fuechtnerwerkstatt.de/tradition|title =     Gotthelf Friedrich Füchtner |publisher = Werkstatt alter Volkskunst|accessdate= December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=    http://www.thechristmashaus.com/craftspeople.htm|title =Füchtner Nutcrackers|publisher =thechristmashaus|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative nutcracker dolls began being popularized outside of Europe after the [[Second World War]], when numerous American soldiers stationed in Germany came home to the United States with German nutcrackers as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Further popularization came from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', a ballet adaptation of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s story ''[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]'', which featured a toy soldier nutcracker.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ballet, introduced to America during the mid-20th century, became a favorite holiday tradition across the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and helped make nutcracker dolls a [[Christmas decoration]] and a seasonal icon across Western culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Design==
An average handcrafted nutcracker doll is made out of about 60 separate pieces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nutcracker dolls traditionally resemble toy soldiers, and are often painted in bright colors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Different designs proliferated early; by the early 19th century there were ones dressed as miners, policemen, royalty or soldiers from different armies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recent variations have been made to resemble various pop-culture or historical figurines, from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]-uniform American soldiers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians''' ('''OISTAT''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) founded in 1968 in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. According to its founding name, the organization is mainly a network for theatre designers, theatre architects and theatre technicians around the world, made up of people associated with creating or studying live performances, including educators, researchers and practitioners. The organization has members from 53 countries,{{cn|date=March 2018}} in the membership categories: Centre Member, Associate Member and Individual Member.

==History==
The predecessor of the organization was the scenography section of the [[International Theatre Institute]] (ITI), founded in 1948. This institute was expected to form an international co-operation of all artistic fields and establish leading publishing and educational direction from the drama sections. The project failed, but interest in the visual elements of theatre grew.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Shortly after, in 1958, the International Association of Theatre Technicians (IATT) was formed in Paris. This association also faltered due to lack of direction, programming, organizational structure, administrative and financial provisions.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The representatives sought ITI to take up the activities again, and the ITI Secretary General [[Jean Darcante]] went to Prague in 1967 to discuss with representatives of the Czechoslovak National ITI Center, the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography, the possibility of establishing an organization with a general secretariat in Prague. Czechoslovak scenographers, including professional workers and theatre specialists from both institutions, prepared a draft program for the activity of the new organization with the Czechoslovak Ministry of Culture. Darcante travelled to Prague again in early 1968 to obtain a binding promise from the Czechoslovak official authorities and agree the final details with the Theatre Institute and the Institute of Scenography. On 7 and 8 June 1968, the foundation committee met to establish the new International Organization of Scenographers and Theatre Technicians ({{lang-fr|Organisation Internationale des Scénographes et technicians de Théatre}}; OISTT). The founding membership consisted of representatives from Czechoslovakia, Canada, Israel, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Organizational structure==
===The World Congress===
OISTAT is composed of members in regions around the world, known as OISTAT Centres, Associate members and Individual members. As defined in the Statutes, "the directing body of OISTAT is the Congress, which is formed when the delegates of the OISTAT Centres, Associate Members and Individual Members are assembled in plenary session". Every four years, the delegates of the World Congress elect the President and the members of Executive Committee. They also decide on changes in the Statutes and other arising issues of the organization.

===Executive Committee and Governing Board ===
OISTAT affairs are coordinated by the Governing Board and its Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consists of eight elected members including the President, elected at the congress. The Governing Board consists of the elected chairs of the six commissions.

===Headquarters===
The Headquarters, known as the Secretariat until 2011, are the only constant office of the organization in charge of daily communications, and serve as the central network for its members and commissions. The Headquarters has moved twice since its foundation; it was in Prague from 1968-1993, in the Netherlands from 1993-2005, and since 2006 it is in Taipei, Taiwan.

===Commissions===
Six commissions lead various projects in their field of studies: 

* '''Architecture''': The Architecture commission was composed mainly of architects, theatre designers and technicians. The commission initiated the quadrennial Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC) in 1978 and the finalist designs are exhibited at the Prague Quadrennial.
* '''Education''': This commission is the main facilitator of OISTAT Scenofest and International Stage Design Students' Works Exchange (ISDSWE) in Beijing, China.
* '''Research''': The Research commission focuses on the theoretical and historical aspects of theatre [[scenography]], architecture, and technologies. The Theatre Timeline Sub-commission is a recent establishment by the commission focusing on archiving theatre technologies, recording and preservation.
* '''Performance design''': Performance Design includes four sub-commissions: Costume Design, Lighting Design, Sound Design and Space Design.

===Theatre Architecture Competition (TAC)===
Theatre Architecture Competition is an international ideas competition, aimed at students and emerging practitioners, which is organized every four years by the Architecture commission. The sites of the competition have been in these cities:
*1978, Paris, France 
*1983, Stockholm, Sweden
*1990, Moscow, Russia
*1999, Prague, Czech Republic
*2003, Hengelo, Netherlands
*2007, Prague, Czech Republic
*2011, Prague, Czech Republic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103062538/http://www.pq.cz/en/tac-competition.html |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;
*2015, Berlin, Germany
*2017, Hsinchu, Taiwan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/6v6aqkgqnfazoqs/10th+OISTAT+Theatre+Architecture+Brief.final.+Hsinchu+City_rev.pdf?dl=0|title=10th OISTAT Theatre Architecture Brief.final. Hsinchu City_rev.pdf|website=Dropbox.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the competition theme was to design a theatre for a specific performance. The theatre can be in 'found' spaces which were not previously or presently a performing space or create a temporary installation.

In 2015, the theme was to construct a 'floating theatre' on Spree River in Berlin, Germany. The competition has moved from Prague Quadrennial to Berlin's Stage|Set|Scenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oistat.org/Item/list.asp?id=1503|title=TAC Info &amp; Schedule|website=Oistat.org|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the theme is 'Theatre as Public Space'. The aim of the competition is to challenge the conventional typology of the theatre and to focus on the design of a temporary theatre (or theatres) in The Public Activity Center, a disused sports stadium in Hsinchu City in Taiwan. The 25 selected entries of TAC 2017 were exhibited and awarded during 2017 World Stage Design on July 1–9, 2017 in Taipei, Taiwan.

===World Stage Design===
World Stage Design is an international exhibition of performance design from theatre, dance, music, and opera, as well as a showcase for cross-disciplinary performances and installations in non-conventional theatre spaces since 2005. It is held every four years on different continents, to purposely show the latest designs in theatre performances. Different from the Prague Quadrennial which presents designs curated by each country, World Stage Design allows every individual designer to submit design works directly to the curatorial panel for the grand exhibition. It has been in these cities:
*2005, Toronto, Canada
*2009, Seoul, South Korea
*2013, Cardiff, UK
*2017, Taipei, Taiwan

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to software:

'''[[Software]]''' – collection of [[computer program]]s and related [[data]] that provides the instructions for telling a [[computer]] what to do and how to do it. Software refers to one or more computer programs and data held in the storage of the computer for some purposes. In other words, software is a set of ''programs, procedures, algorithms'' and its ''documentation'' concerned with the operation of a data processing system. The term was coined to contrast to the old term [[computer hardware|hardware]] (meaning physical devices). In contrast to hardware, software "cannot be touched".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software is also sometimes used in a more narrow sense, meaning [[application software]] only. Sometimes the term includes data that has not traditionally been associated with computers, such as film, tapes, and records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=software..(n.d.). |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1)| accessdate =2007-04-13|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/software}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Testware]] – any software for testing hardware or software.
* [[Firmware]] – low-level software often stored on electrically programmable memory devices. Firmware is given its name because it is treated like hardware and run ("executed") by other software programs. Firmware often is not accessible for change by other entities but the developers' enterprises.
* Shrinkware is the older name given to consumer-purchased software, because it was often sold in retail stores in a [[shrink wrap]]ped box.
* [[Device driver]]s – control parts of computers such as [[disk drive]]s, [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[CD drive]]s, or [[computer monitor]]s.
* [[Programming tool]]s – assist a programmer in writing [[computer program]]s, and software using various programming languages in a more convenient way. The tools include:
** [[Compiler]]s
** [[Debugger]]s
** [[interpreter (computing)|Interpreters]]
** [[linker (computing)|Linkers]]
** [[Text editor]]s
** [[Integrated development environment]] (IDE) – single application for managing all of these functions.

[[File:Quilled flowers sample quilling picture.jpg|thumb|A [[Quilling|quilled]] basket of flowers]]

'''Paper craft''' is the collection of [[art]] forms employing [[paper]] or [[card stock|card]] as the primary [[artistic medium]] for the creation of three-dimensional objects.  It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded,  stitched, or layered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=6 |title=The Complete Photo Guide to Paper Crafts|first=Patrice |last=Boerens |isbn=978-1-58923-468-0 |publisher=Creative Publishing International |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Papermaking]] by hand is also an important paper craft. [[Painting]] and [[calligraphy]] though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.

Paper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caribbean-craft.com/|title=Handmade Home Decor {{!}} Paper Mache {{!}} Caribbean Craft|last=Craft|first=Caribbean|website=www.caribbean-craft.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the [[education]] of children.  Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals.&lt;ref name="Therapy"&gt;Carol Tubbs, Margaret Drake, ''Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy'', "Paper crafts", (2006), p. 221-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials.  Paper crafts may also be used in [[psychotherapy|therapeutic]] settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.&lt;ref name="Therapy"/&gt;

==Folded paper==
The word "paper" derives from [[papyrus]], the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in [[Egypt]] as far back as the third millennium B.C.&lt;ref name=Skeat&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat, 1935. "Papyrus and its uses"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018121945/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/Egerton/BellSkeat2.html |date=2013-10-18 }} ([[British Museum]] pamphlet).&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the earliest known example of "paper folding" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern [[road]] [[map]].&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt; However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers.&lt;ref name="Bible"/&gt;

Courier Dover Publications. {{ISBN|0-486-25837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In much of the [[Western world|West]], the term [[origami]] is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi ([[Chinese paper folding]]), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and [[paper plane]]s.

==Cut paper==
{{Main|Papercutting}}
[[Papel picado]], as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while [[Chinese paper cutting]] uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. [[Wycinanki]] and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.

==Paper pulp painting==

Images built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. [[Chuck Close]], [[Lynn Sures]] are among contemporary artist developing this medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments''''' is a 1735 [[oil painting]] by [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts an array of famous [[Rome|Roman]] monuments in a rural setting.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Panini was a famed painter of [[Capriccio (art)|capriccios]], architectural fantasies. In this case, he combined a staggering array of monuments by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] without regard to topography. From left to right, he included the [[Temple of Hadrian]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], the [[Temple of Vesta, Tivoli|Temple of Vesta]], the [[Maison Carrée]], and the [[Theater of Marcellus]], all of them surrounding the [[Obelisk of Thutmose III]]. In front of this overabundance of history, he placed the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian statue]] of [[Marcus Aurelius]], around which contemporary Roman peasants carry out their business.

While quite cavalier with regards to geography, Panini was remarkably faithful in his architectural reconstructions. He carefully edited out later additions to the original buildings, such as the walled-in sections in the arches of the Theater of Marcellus and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini's]] bell towers on the Pantheon's pediment.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
Panini's earliest training was with a painter of [[theatrical scenery]], and certain elements of that early influence can be seen in this painting. The arrangement of monuments is very similar to the way architectural perspective was achieved in the Italian theater. At the front of the "stage" are the peasant-actors in quaint costumes.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

Fashionable European youths undertook the [[Grand Tour]] throughout the eighteenth century, and for half a century to either side, and liked to bring back souvenirs of their travels. Thus, sketches and paintings of landmarks such as those in the ''Capriccio'' were very lucrative for Panini and his contemporaries. Escapism and contemplation were more important than geographical accuracy, so Panini was free to rearrange scenery in paintings like this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Facos|first=Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Facos|title=An Introduction to Nineteenth Century Art|year=2011|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=0203833074|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk4WgsO2OZsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=Roman+Capriccio:+The+Pantheon+and+Other+Monuments+Panini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GqS3n-u_PS&amp;sig=jaws0rhmEZ3zItkz89u1Lo1PFXo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mv8HUY2pKsTgyQGcyoCABg&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Capriccio%3A%20The%20Pantheon%20and%20Other%20Monuments%20Panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creative reorganization led to a better comprehension of the ideal, rather than current, conditions of the monuments and the civilization that made them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Innes|first=Randy Norman|title=On the Limits of the Work of Art: The Fragment in Visual Culture|year=2008|format=thesis|publisher=[[University of Rochester]]|location=[[Rochester, New York]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hG2bSQ4K9M0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=Roman+Capriccio:+The+Pantheon+and+Other+Monuments+Panini&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YwAIUZPXCaj1ygHkyID4BQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20Capriccio%3A%20The%20Pantheon%20and%20Other%20Monuments%20Panini&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The IMA received ''Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments'' and its [[Pendant#Other meanings|pendant]], ''The Colosseum and Other Monuments'' in 1950, as gifts of Lila Allison Lilly in memory of her husband, Josiah Kirby Lilly. Both are currently on view in the Jane H. Fortune Gallery. It has the accession number 50.5.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Capriccio: The Pantheon and Other Monuments|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/roman-capriccio-pantheon-and-other-monuments-panini-giovanni-paolo|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20814">[[File:Aberdour Castle -17th century painted ceiling.jpg|thumb|300px|The 17th-century painted ceiling at [[Aberdour Castle]], Fife]]
'''Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings''' are decorated ceilings in Scottish houses and [[Scottish castles|castles]] built between 1540 and 1640. This is a distinctive national style, though there is common ground with similar work elsewhere, especially in [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;See Palau de l'Almirall [[Valencia, Spain]] and later examples at Saint Cornely Church, [[Carnac]] Brittany and Peter und Paul Kirche [[Köngen]].&lt;/ref&gt; An example in England, at [[Wickham, Hampshire|Wickham]], [[Hampshire]], was recorded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Chinnery, Victor, ''Oak Furniture'', Antique Collector's Club (1979), p.36, pictured: Lewis, Elizabeth, 'A jettied house at Wickham', in ''Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club'', no.36 (1979/1980), pp.203-215: associated wall-painting is exposed in Wickham Wine Bar, the ceiling is now concealed, [[Sites and Monuments Record|SMR]] no.MWC4723.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most surviving examples are painted simply on the boards and joists forming the floor of the room above. Rooms or galleries in attic storeys were fully lined with thin pine boarding and painted.  The fashion was superseded by decorative plasterwork and sometimes the painted ceilings were broken up to form lathing for the new plaster.

==Paint and painters==
[[File:16th C Painted Beam Ceiling MacMoran's House, Riddle's Court, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Ceiling with cherub's heads and an Imperial eagle and thistle motif at [[Riddle's Court]]]]
The paint used employed protein [[Sizing|size]] with chalk and pigments, including [[Ochre|natural ochres]], [[vermilion]], and [[orpiment]] often mixed with [[indigo]] to form vibrant greens.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 92, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pine timber was imported from [[Norway]]. The names of many painters have been found in contemporary records, but as yet no painter of any particular surviving ceiling has been identified through archival research.  However, it is recorded that in 1554, Edinburgh painters led by Walter Binning assaulted an outsider, David Warkman, who had been painting a ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;''Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh 1528 - 1557'', 194-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Warkman family were settled at [[Burntisland]] in [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]] the 1590s.&lt;ref&gt;Apted, 'Mary Somerville's House', in ''PSAS'', (1974), p.228&lt;/ref&gt; The Skelmorlie Aisle at Largs was signed by John Stalker, and initials "IM" painted at [[Delgatie Castle]] may be those of the painter John Mellin or Melville.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Ailsa, ''eConservation Magazine'', 10, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that only the wealthiest of the merchant classes and aristocrats could afford this decoration, though the picture is unbalanced as more modest interiors do not survive.

==Types of patterns==
The largest group of these ceilings have patterns of fruit and flowers, and may perhaps have evoked tapestry borders.  Some ceilings in [[Long gallery|galleries]] at the top of buildings incorporated [[wikt:vignette|vignette]]s with biblical or [[emblem]]atic scenes. Others employ [[Renaissance]] [[grotesque]] ornament including symbolic emblems.  A gallery in a demolished building on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile#Castle Esplanade and Castlehill|Castlehill]] had scenes of the [[Apocalypse]] and ''Christ asleep in a storm'', set in the [[Firth of Forth]], with a backdrop of the Edinburgh [[Royal Mile]] skyline viewed from Fife.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (1891), 194-201&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments survive in storage at the [[National Museums of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 239-241&lt;/ref&gt; Ceilings painted with rows of heraldic shields included; the gallery at [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Collairnie Castle]], [[Fife, Scotland|Fife]], a ceiling at [[Linlithgow]] High Street,&lt;ref&gt;Cook (1868), 409-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[White Castle, East Lothian|Nunraw House]], [[East Lothian]].
[[File:Deathbed Scene. St Mary's, Grandtully - geograph.org.uk - 34798.jpg|thumb|left|Death bed scene from the ceiling of St. Mary's, [[Grandtully]]]]
Several surviving examples can be seen in [[Edinburgh]]; including [[John Knox's House]], [[Gladstone's Land]], and the [[The People's Story Museum|Canongate Tolbooth museum]]. The birthroom at [[Edinburgh Castle]] was painted by James Anderson to commemorate the fiftieth birthday of [[James VI]], and restored by Walter Melville in 1693.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Moses, ed., ''Building Scotland'', John Donald (2010), 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's Land dating from 1619 also has relatively well preserved decoration on plaster contemporary with the ceiling. More extensive domestic mural painting survives at [[Kinneil House]], dating from the 1550s, and painted for the [[James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault|Regent Arran]], who employed Walter Binning on some of his projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_075/75_184_204.pdf JS Richardson, 'Mural Decorations at Kinneil,',''PSAS'', vol. 75, (1940–41), 184-204]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aberdour Castle]], Fife, has one of latest ceilings c.1633, and [[Huntingtower Castle]] the earliest c.1540. Ceilings at [[Crathes Castle]] are decorated with the [[Nine Worthies]] and the [[Muses]]. As at Crathes, beams at [[Traquair House]] and Sailor's Walk, Kirkcaldy, carry proverbial and biblical admonitions, written in [[Middle Scots]]. A gallery at [[Provost Skene]]'s House, Aberdeen, is similar in format to the Castlehill painting,&lt;ref&gt;Meldrum, (1958/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grandtully|St. Mary's, Grandtully]], and the [[Skelmorlie Aisle]] at [[Largs]], two examples in churches, are painted on the thin lining boards of wooden barrel vaults. [[Culross Palace]], built by Sir [[George Bruce of Carnock]], has a variety of painted interiors including suites of emblems, geometric patterns and biblical scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Jervise, Andrew, (1854)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ceilings remain in private buildings, and a number of ceilings were salvaged and stored by [[Historic Scotland]] including two from [[Dysart, Fife]]. The National Museum of Scotland displays a ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]] Burntisland, Fife,&lt;ref&gt;Apted (1971/2): Thomson (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and a screen from Wester Livilands, near Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1898/9)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirling Smith Museum and Art Gallery]] has a ceiling from [[Robert Drummond of Carnock]]'s house. A room from [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline]]'s [[Pinkie House]] is displayed at [[Museum of Edinburgh|Edinburgh's Huntly House Museum]]. Painted beams from [[Midhope Castle]] were moved to [[Royal Mile#Abbey Strand|Abbey Strand]] Edinburgh, and a ceiling from [[Prestongrange House]] is at [[Merchiston Tower]] though these last two are not regularly open to the public.  Two rooms in the [[Missoni#Brands|Hotel Missoni]] in Edinburgh still have painted ceilings from the original early seventeenth century [[tenement]] building on the [[Lawnmarket]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Crone &amp; D. Sproat, 'Revealing the History, timber framed building at No 302 Lawnmarket Edinburgh' in ''Journal of Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland'', 22 (EUP 2012) pp. 19-36&lt;/ref&gt;  Painted ceilings concealed by later plasterwork continue to be discovered. A ceiling with grotesques and scrollwork "of exceptional quality" was found at [[Moubray House]] on Edinburgh's Royal Mile in 1999. After restoration the whole building was pledged as a gift to [[Historic Scotland]] by an American benefactor in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), p.245: [http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/american-aircraft-millionaire-donates-historic-royal-mile-property-to-nation-1-2486920 ''Scotsman Newspaper'', Lifestyle, 24 August 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another ceiling on Edinburgh's Royal Mile was discovered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Shân Ross, {{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Builders-uncover-rare-slice-of.6487770.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Scotsman on Sunday newspaper, 22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources of the designs==
[[File:Painted ceiling from Rossend Castle.JPG|thumb|Ceiling from [[Rossend Castle]], [[Burntisland]], in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], painted for [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Sir Robert Melville of Murdocairney]] with emblems taken from Claude Paradin]]
Some of the ceilings include pictures or [[emblemata|emblems based on European printed books]]. Prestongrange's ceiling has comic figures from [[Richard Breton]]'s ''Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel'', Paris (1565).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songesdrolatiques.fr/ |title=Les songes drolatiques de Pantagruel}} (1565).&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ornament came from 17 engravings after [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] called the ''Grottesco'', printed by [[Gerard de Jode]] in [[Antwerp]] (1565–71), and another set the ''Caryatidum'' depicting architectural 'terms' - load bearing figures. The ceiling is dated 1581 and at that time complimented a [[sideboard]] gifted by [[Esmé Stuart, 1st Duke of Lennox|Esmé Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Margaret H.B., ''A Kindly Place'', Tuckwell (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; At Rossend, (now in the National Museum) emblems by Claude Paradin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/ French Emblems at Glasgow] - two editions of Paradin are available here.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriele Simeoni and [[Alciato]] were used, again with ornamental detail from Vredeman de Vries's ''Grottesco'', with devices of European princes. A ceiling at [[John MacMorran|Riddle's Court]] in Edinburgh has the [[Flags of the Holy Roman Empire|eagle]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] combined with a thistle, perhaps to commemorate the visit of the [[Ulrik of Denmark (1578–1624)|Duke of Holstein]] in 1598.&lt;ref&gt;M. Pearce, 'Riddle's Court', in ''History Scotland Magazine'', vol.12 no.4 (July/August 2012), pp. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Emblems at Culross Palace were adapted from ''A Choice of Emblems'' by [[Geoffrey Whitney|Geffrey Whitney]], London (1586). The tiny engravings made by the French goldsmith [[Etienne Delaune]] supplied the ornament at the Skelmorlie Aisle. Amongst the sources used at Pinkie were de Vries's ''Perspectiva'', (1605), [[Otto van Veen|Otto van Veen's]] ''Emblemata Horatiana'', Antwerp (1607), and Denis de Lebey de Batilly's ''Emblemata'', Frankfurt (1596). These demonstrate the use of renaissance pattern books by painters and patrons in Scotland, and coupled with copious classical quotations, the wealth and topicality of the library of Alexander Seton.&lt;ref&gt;Bath (2003), 79-103, 231, 236, 249-252, 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical literature==
[[File:St Mary's Chapel, Grandtully - Painted Ceiling - geograph.org.uk - 406576.jpg|thumb|left|Painted wooden vault at [[Grandtully]] Chapel]]
There are no contemporary references to this type of decoration.  Most examples were concealed behind later interiors or neglected in buildings which became lower status accommodation.  In the early nineteenth century antiquarian interest was kindled by discovery during the demolition of buildings in Edinburgh and Dundee. [[Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe]] and Rev. Sime rescued a part of the ''Apocalypse'' painting from Edinburgh's Castlehill and made a series of coloured record drawings now held by the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland|Royal Commission (RCAHMS)]]. Daniel Wilson described the ceiling at length in his ''Memorials of Edinburgh''. At the end of the century, Andrew Lyons, artist and antiquarian, made drawings of a number of ceilings (also in RCAHMS), and published articles in the ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries, Scotland, PSAS.''

In the first half of twentieth century conservation works were led by John Houston of the Ministry of Works.  Ian Hodkinson, a [[Conservator (museum)|conservator]], and Michael R Apted, an [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979|inspector of ancient monuments]], were instrumental in the rescue and salvage of a number of painted ceilings, published in Apted's 1966 monograph, and a series of ''PSAS'' articles. Apted made an exhaustive search of archive references to painting for his Edinburgh PhD, and this formed the basis for his collaboration with Susan Hannabuss on ''Painters in Scotland: A Biographical Dictionary'' published in 1978. John Cornforth admired the contribution of the Stenhouse Conservation Centre as antiquarian and romantic.&lt;ref&gt;Cornforth (1994), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Michael Bath, emeritus professor of English, [[Strathclyde University]], has re-assessed the corpus with a particular focus on the emblems used and their origins and meanings to the Scottish patrons. Bath has published a number of articles and a detailed illustrated 2003 monograph exploring sources with a useful comprehensive inventory of examples both extant and destroyed. Ailsa Murray's 2009 article and Chantal‐Helen Thuer's 2011 report explore conservation methods.

[[File:Shell necklaces (Cook Islands).jpg|thumb|Necklaces made in [[Raratonga]], [[Cook Islands]]]]
[[File:Sépulture de Teviec (5).jpg|thumb|A [[Stone Age]] burial in [[Brittany]] dating from 5000-7000 BC shows the skeletons of two women who were buried wearing necklaces made of numerous [[gastropod shell|shells]] of the [[sea snail]] ''[[Trivia (gastropod)|Trivia]]''.]]

'''Shell jewelry''' is [[jewelry]] that is primarily made from [[seashell]]s, the shells of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s. Shell jewelry is a type of [[shellcraft]]. One very common form of shell jewelry is [[necklace]]s that are composed of large numbers of [[bead]]s, where each individual bead is the whole (but often drilled) [[Gastropod shell|shell]] of a small [[sea snail]]. Numerous other varieties of shell jewelry are made, including [[bracelet]]s and [[earring]]s.

As well as sea snail shells, shell jewelry also sometimes uses the shells of clams ([[bivalves]]) and tusk shells ([[scaphopod]]s). Occasionally shell jewelry is made from the shells of non-marine mollusks such as the shells of [[land snail]]s [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/274/1627/2907.full], or the shells of freshwater mollusks. Not all shell jewelry is made from whole shells; some kinds are made from parts of shells, including the shell layer known as [[mother of pearl]] or [[nacre]], and the "trapdoor" or  [[operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] which is part of some sea snails.

In recent times, inexpensive shell jewelry is often found at tropical beach destinations, where it is offered to tourists as informal wear, or as a [[souvenir]]. However, shell jewelry has a very ancient past, and is of great importance in [[archeology]] and [[anthropology]]. In fact, shell beads are the oldest form of jewelry known, dating back over 100,000 years.

==In prehistory==
The oldest known jewelry in the world consists of two perforated beads made from shells of the sea snail ''[[Nassarius gibbosulus]]''. These beads were discovered at [[Skhul and Qafzeh hominids|Skhul]] in Israel, and were recently dated to between 100,000 and 135,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1731| date=Jun 2006 | issn = 0036-8075| doi = 10.1126/science.312.5781.1731| issue = 5781| title = Archaeology.

One example is the site of [[Oued Djebbana]] in Algeria, for example, where an ''N. gibbosulus'' bead was found; at the time the shell was used there, this site was at least 190&amp;nbsp;km away from the sea.&lt;ref name="Vanhaeren et al 2006" /&gt;

Shell ornaments were very common during the [[Upper Paleolithic]], from 50–40,000 years ago onwards, when they spread with modern humans to Europe and Asia. They generally take the form of perforated shells (as well as other hard organic material such as [[tooth]], [[bone]], [[antler]] and [[mammoth]] ivory) which are thought to have been suspended and used as jewelry. The most commonly found species are ''[[Homalopoma sanguineum]]'', ''[[Littorina obtusata]]'', ''[[Cyclope]]'' species, ''[[Nassarius mutabilis]]'' and ''Nassarius gibbosulus''. Fossil shells were used alongside those of contemporary species. Some shells were stained with [[ochre]]. In Europe, the shells of both [[Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean]] species were used, again circulating over distances of hundreds of kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Esteban Álvarez|last2=Jöris|first2=Olaf|title=Personal Ornaments in the Early Upper Paleolithic of Western Eurasia: an Evaluation of the Record|journal=Eurasian Prehistory|year=2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=31–44|url=https://rgzm.academia.edu/OlafJ%C3%B6ris/Papers/802932/Personal_Ornaments_in_the_Early_Upper_Paleolithic_of_Western_Eurasia_an_Evaluation_of_the_Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[neolithic]] period shell [[necklaces]] were made with the shells of  3 genera [[Spondylus]], [[Glycymeris (shells)|Glycymeris]] and [[Charonia]].&lt;ref name="Gardelková-Vrtelová"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gardelková-Vrtelová |first=Anna |last2=Golej |first2= Marián |date=2013 |title=The necklace from the Strážnice site in the Hodonín district (Czech Republic).

A '''stagehand''' is a person who works backstage or behind the scenes in theatres, film, television, or location performance.  Their work include setting up the scenery, lights, sound, props, rigging, and special effects for a production.

==General==
Stagehands are usually skilled in multiple disciplines, including rigging, carpentry, stage electrics, stage lighting, audio, video/projection, and props. Stagehands are often responsible for operating the systems during shows or taping and also for the repair and maintenance of the equipment. Most stagehands have a general knowledge of all the phases of a production, but tend to develop specialties and focus on specific areas.

'''Riggers''' are in charge of the things that hang. This may include building structures that are tens of stories high. They use safety gear similar to that used for mountain climbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alderson|first=Mick|title=Stagehand Primer - Temporary Rigging|url=http://iatselocal500.info/education/primer/rigging.htm|publisher=International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States and Canada|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carpenters''' construct and set up scenery. They may also move scenery on stage during a show.

'''Electricians,''' or more commonly known as "Lighting technicians", set up all the lights, program the light design in the lighting console and run the follow spot (what people often call a spotlight).

Stagehands are generally employed on a show-by-show basis, although most major theaters and studios maintain staff heads of departments and assistants. Often, they are union members, typically part of the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees|I.A.T.S.E.]] in North America or [[ABTT]] in the UK.

==Challenges==
{{unreferenced-section|date=January 2018}}
{{how to|date=January 2018}}
Stagehands may work in many different venues, including both large and small traditional theatrical spaces, convention centers, outdoor venues, concert arenas, film sets, television studios and others. Skilled stagehands know how to work in a wide range of theaters and other venues to support successful shows.

Different disciplines experience different risks. The most serious injury risk for riggers is falling. The primary risks for carpenters are things falling on them or being injured by power tools. Electrocution is the most serious risk for stagehands working with lighting or power.

When a show travels or goes on tour, some stagehands travel with the show (sometimes known as the road crew for a show) and others work to support the shows at each new venue (sometimes known as the local crew). Usually everything the show needs is transported from venue to venue in trucks. Local stagehands load-in a tour under the direction of the road crew, also known as roadies.

After the show, which can be one day or as long as a month, they take it all apart and load back onto the fleet of trucks to haul it to the next city.

When a show is produced locally, stagehands build and set up the scenery, hang all the lights, and set up sound systems. Stagehands work closely with the directors, lighting designers, set designers, costume designers, and sound designers to ensure their visions are realized.

Some stagehands work conventional hours but more often they work nights and weekends. Employment can be intermittent due largely to the seasonal nature of theatrical production work.
 
Many production companies and venues have union contracts. Stagehands in the United States and Canada are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]]. In smaller productions, stagehands are not all paid, many are volunteers, theatre students or unpaid interns.

==Education and art training==
In 1951, after a summer studying at [[Black Mountain College]], she entered [[Hunter College]] where she studied with [[Robert Motherwell]] and received her BA in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suzi Gablik - Artist, Fine Art Prices, Auction Records for Suzi Gablik|url=http://askart.com/artist/Suzi_Gablik/101594/Suzi_Gablik.aspx|website=askart.com|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After working primarily as a painter, she had her first solo show in 1966. Later, she turned her attention to [[collage]].

Gablik’s ''The Reenchantment of Art'' announced her disenchantment with “the compulsive and oppressive consumeristic framework in which we do our work,” and argued that a re-connection to the primordial and to ritual might allow “for a return of soul.”&lt;ref name="Reenchantment"&gt;Gablik, Suzi.

Retrieved February 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of traditional forms of religion, however, Gablik sought out contemporary art that she believed broke out of the Western framework, championing the work of artists such as [[Frank Gohlke]], [[Gilah Yelin Hirsch]], [[Nancy Holt]], Dominique Mazeaud, [[Fern Shaffer]] and Otello Anderson, [[Starhawk]], [[James Turrell]] and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], in the book and in subsequent critical writing.&lt;ref name="Orion"&gt;Gablik, Suzi. “Arts and the Earth: Making Art as If the World Mattered,” ''Orion'', Autumn 1995, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her critical articles, Gablik has conducted interviews with other artists, art critics or philosophers, such as [[Richard Shusterman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAU - Breaking Out of the White Cube|url=http://www.fau.edu/humanitieschair/white-cube.php|website=www.fau.edu|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaffer Anderson"&gt;Gablik, Suzi. “The Ecological Imperative, An Interview with [[Fern Shaffer]] and Othello Anderson,” ''Art Papers'', Nov. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written essays for exhibition catalogues of shows that she has curated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=apexart :: Suzi Gablik :: Sacred Wild|url=http://www.apexart.org/exhibitions/gablik.htm|website=www.apexart.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Gablik taught at [[Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts]] and [[Washington and Lee University]], and has lectured at many others.

A '''taste receptor''' is a type of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] which facilitates the sensation of [[taste]]. These receptors are of four types. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a sensation of taste are considered "sapid".&lt;ref name="oven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-14706-4/the-science-of-the-oven/excerpt|title=The Science of the Oven - Excerpt from Chapter 1|last=This|first=Hervé|date=2012|accessdate=30 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taste receptors are divided into two families:{{cn | reason = There are five basic tastes; only 3 are represented with these two families.  It would be more credible if a good reference says there are only these two. |date=April 2018}}

Combinations of these receptors in dimers or other complexes contributes to different perceptions of taste.

Visual, olfactive, “sapictive” (the perception of tastes), trigeminal (hot, cool), mechanical, all contribute to the perception of ''taste''. Of these, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 ([[TRPV1]]) vanilloid receptors are responsible for the perception of heat from some molecules such as capsaicin, and a [[TRPM8|CMR1 receptor]] is responsible for the perception of cold from molecules such as menthol, eucalyptol, and icilin.&lt;ref name="oven"/&gt;

== Tissue distribution ==

The [[gustatory system]] consists of taste receptor cells in [[taste bud]]s. Taste buds, in turn, are contained in structures called [[lingual papillae|papillae]]. There are three types of papillae involved in taste: [[fungiform papilla]]e, [[foliate papilla]]e, and [[circumvallate papilla]]e. (The fourth type - [[lingual papilla#filiform papillae|filiform papillae]] do not contain taste buds). Beyond the papillae, taste receptors are also in the [[palate]] and early parts of the [[digestive system]] like the [[larynx]] and upper [[esophagus]].  There are three [[cranial nerve]]s that innervate the tongue; the [[vagus nerve]], [[glossopharyngeal nerve]], and the [[facial nerve]].  The [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] and the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the [[facial nerve]] innervate the TAS1R and TAS2R taste receptors.

In 2010, researchers found bitter receptors in lung tissue, which cause airways to relax when a bitter substance is encountered.  They believe this mechanism is evolutionarily adaptive because it helps clear lung infections, but could also be exploited to treat [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deshpande DA, Wang WC, McIlmoyle EL, Robinett KS, Schillinger RM, An SS, Sham JS, Liggett SB | title = Bitter taste receptors on airway smooth muscle bronchodilate by localized calcium signaling and reverse obstruction | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 11 | pages = 1299–304 | date = Nov 2010 | pmid = 20972434 | pmc = 3066567 | doi = 10.1038/nm.2237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

[[Taste]] helps to identify [[toxin]]s and maintain [[nutrition]].  Five basic tastes are recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and [[umami]].  Salty and sour taste sensations are both detected through [[ion channel]]s.  Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes, however, are detected by way of [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein-coupled]] taste receptors.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachmanov AA, Beauchamp GK | title = Taste receptor genes | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 389–414 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17444812 | pmc = 2721271 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.26.061505.111329 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some agents can function as [[:Category:Taste modifiers|taste modifiers]], as [[miraculin]] or [[curculin]] for sweet or [[sterubin]] to [[:Category:Bitter-masking compounds|mask bitter]].

== Mechanism of action ==

The standard bitter, sweet, or umami taste receptor is a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] with seven transmembrane domains.  Ligand binding at the taste receptors activate [[second messenger]] cascades to depolarize the taste cell. [[Gustducin]] is the most common taste Gα subunit, having a major role in TAS2R bitter taste reception.  Gustducin is a homologue for [[transducin]], a G-protein involved in vision transduction.&lt;ref name="Sainz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sainz E, Cavenagh MM, LopezJimenez ND, Gutierrez JC, Battey JF, Northup JK, Sullivan SL | title = The G-protein coupling properties of the human sweet and amino acid taste receptors | journal = Developmental Neurobiology | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 948–59 | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17506496 | doi = 10.1002/dneu.20403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, taste receptors share the use of the TRPM5 ion channel, as well as a phospholipase PLCβ2.&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Cook B, Wu D, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways | journal = Cell | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–301 | date = Feb 2003 | pmid = 12581520 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00071-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
=== Savory or glutamates ===
The [[TAS1R1]]+[[TAS1R3]] heterodimer receptor functions as the savory receptor, responding to L-[[amino acid]] binding, especially L-[[glutamate]].&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  The [[umami]] taste is most frequently associated with the food additive [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG) and can be enhanced through the binding of [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP) and [[guanosine monophosphate]] (GMP) molecules.&lt;ref name="Nelson2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Chandrashekar J, Hoon MA, Feng L, Zhao G, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = An amino-acid taste receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6877 | pages = 199–202 | date = Mar 2002 | pmid = 11894099 | doi = 10.1038/nature726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Delay"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delay ER, Beaver AJ, Wagner KA, Stapleton JR, Harbaugh JO, Catron KD, Roper SD | title = Taste preference synergy between glutamate receptor agonists and inosine monophosphate in rats | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 507–15 | date = Oct 2000 | pmid = 11015322 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/25.5.507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TAS1R1+3 expressing cells are found mostly in the [[fungiform papilla]]e at the tip and edges of the tongue and palate taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  These cells are shown to synapse upon the [[chorda tympani]] nerves to send their signals to the brain, although some activation of the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] has been found.&lt;ref name="Nelson2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danilova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danilova V, Hellekant G | title = Comparison of the responses of the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves to taste stimuli in C57BL/6J mice | journal = BMC Neuroscience | volume = 4 | pages = 5 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12617752 | pmc = 153500 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2202-4-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweet ===

The [[TAS1R2]]+[[TAS1R3]] heterodimer receptor functions as the [[sweet]] receptor by binding to a wide variety of [[sugar]]s and [[sugar substitute]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Li"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li X, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title = Human receptors for sweet and umami taste | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 7 | pages = 4692–6 | date = Apr 2002 | pmid = 11917125 | pmc = 123709 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.072090199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  TAS1R2+3 expressing cells are found in [[circumvallate papilla]]e and [[foliate papilla]]e near the back of the [[tongue]] and [[palate]] taste receptor cells in the roof of the mouth.&lt;ref name="pmid11509186"/&gt;  These cells are shown to [[synapse]] upon the [[chorda tympani]] and [[glossopharyngeal nerve]]s to send their signals to the brain.&lt;ref name="pmid17444812"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Danilova"/&gt; The [[TAS1R3]] homodimer also functions as a sweet receptor in much the same way as TAS1R2+3 but has decreased sensitivity to sweet substances.  Natural sugars are more easily detected by the [[TAS1R3]] receptor than [[sugar substitute]]s.  This may help explain why sugar and artificial sweeteners have different tastes.&lt;ref name="Zhao"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhao GQ, Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Erlenbach I, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = The receptors for mammalian sweet and umami taste | journal = Cell | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–66 | date = Oct 2003 | pmid = 14636554 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00844-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bitter===
The TAS2R proteins function as [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Hoon MA, Adler E, Feng L, Guo W, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = T2Rs function as bitter taste receptors | journal = Cell | volume = 100 | issue = 6 | pages = 703–11 | date = Mar 2000 | pmid = 10761935 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80706-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 43 human ''TAS2R'' genes, each of which (excluding the five [[pseudogene]]s) lacks [[intron]]s and codes for a [[GPCR]] protein.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  These proteins, as opposed to TAS1R proteins, have short extracellular domains and are located in [[circumvallate papillae]], [[palate]], [[foliate papillae]], and [[epiglottis]] taste buds, with reduced expression in [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt; Though it is certain that multiple TAS2Rs are expressed in one taste receptor cell, it is still debated whether mammals can distinguish between the tastes of different bitter [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10761934"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;  Some overlap must occur, however, as there are far more bitter compounds than there are TAS2R genes.  Common bitter ligands include [[cycloheximide]], [[denatonium]], PROP (6-''n''-propyl-2-[[thiouracil]]), PTC ([[phenylthiocarbamide]]), and β-[[glucoside|glucopyranosides]].&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

[[Signal transduction]] of bitter stimuli is accomplished via the α-subunit of [[gustducin]].  This G protein subunit activates a taste [[phosphodiesterase]] and decreases [[cyclic nucleotide]] levels.  Further steps in the transduction pathway are still unknown.  The βγ-subunit of gustducin also mediates taste by activating IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[inositol triphosphate]]) and DAG ([[diglyceride]]).  These second messengers may open gated ion channels or may cause release of internal [[calcium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Margolskee RF | title = Molecular mechanisms of bitter and sweet taste transduction | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 277 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11696554 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1074/jbc.R100054200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though all TAS2Rs are located in gustducin-containing cells, knockout of gustducin does not completely abolish sensitivity to bitter compounds, suggesting a redundant mechanism for bitter tasting&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt; (unsurprising given that a bitter taste generally signals the presence of a [[toxin]]).&lt;ref name = "pmid12581520"/&gt;  One proposed mechanism for gustducin-independent bitter tasting is via ion channel interaction by specific bitter ligands, similar to the ion channel interaction which occurs in the tasting of sour and salty stimuli.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

One of the best-researched TAS2R proteins is [[TAS2R38]], which contributes to the tasting of both PROP and PTC.  It is also the only taste receptor whose [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s are shown to be responsible for differences in taste perception.  Current studies are focused on determining other such taste phenotype-determining polymorphisms.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

[[File:Signal Transaction of Taste; Bitter.svg|thumb|The diagram depicted above shows the signal transduction pathway of the bitter taste.

Part III is the response of the taste cell. 6. This leads to increased levels of Ca+. 7. The neurotransmitters are activated. 8. The signal is sent to the neuron.]]

=== Sour ===

Historically it was thought that the sour taste was produced solely when free [[Hydronium|hydrogen ions]] (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) directly depolarised taste receptors. However, specific receptors for sour taste with other methods of action are now being proposed.  HCN1 and HCN4 ([[HCN channel]]s) were two such proposals; both of these receptors are cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.  The two ion channels suggested to contribute to sour taste are [[ACCN1]] and TASK-1.

Object A is a taste bud, object B is a taste receptor cell within object A, and object C is the neuron attached to object B. I. Part I is the reception of hydrogen ions or sodium ions. 1.

Cation, such as K+, channels are opened. III. Part III is the response of the cell. 3. An influx of Ca+ ions is activated.4. The Ca+ activates neurotransmitters. 5. A signal is sent to the neuron attached to the taste bud.]]

=== Salt ===

Various receptors have also been proposed for salty tastes, along with the possible taste detection of lipids, complex carbohydrates, and water.  Evidence for these receptors is, however, shaky at best, and is often unconvincing in mammal studies.  For example, the proposed [[ENaC]] receptor for sodium detection can only be shown to contribute to sodium taste in ''Drosophilia''.&lt;ref name = "pmid17444812"/&gt;

=== Carbonation ===

An enzyme connected to the sour receptor transmits information about carbonated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703113412/http://www.nih.gov/news/health/oct2009/nidcr-15.htm |archivedate=2015-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fat===
A possible taste receptor for fat, [[CD36]], has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laugerette F, Passilly-Degrace P, Patris B, Niot I, Febbraio M, Montmayeur JP, Besnard P | title = CD36 involvement in orosensory detection of dietary lipids, spontaneous fat preference, and digestive secretions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 115 | issue = 11 | pages = 3177–84 | date = Nov 2005 | pmid = 16276419 | doi = 10.1172/JCI25299 | pmc=1265871}}&lt;/ref&gt; CD36 has been localized to the circumvallate and foliate [[lingual papillae|papillae]], which are present in [[taste bud]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simons PJ, Kummer JA, Luiken JJ, Boon L | title = Apical CD36 immunolocalization in human and porcine taste buds from circumvallate and foliate papillae | journal = Acta Histochemica | volume = 113 | issue = 8 | pages = 839–43 | date = Dec 2011 | pmid = 20950842 | doi = 10.1016/j.acthis.2010.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and research has shown that the CD36 receptor binds long chain [[fatty acid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baillie AG, Coburn CT, Abumrad NA | title = Reversible binding of long-chain fatty acids to purified FAT, the adipose CD36 homolog | journal = The Journal of Membrane Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–81 | date = Sep 1996 | pmid = 8694909 | doi=10.1007/s002329900111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in the amount of CD36 [[gene expression|expression]] in human subjects was associated with their ability to taste fats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pepino MY, Love-Gregory L, Klein S, Abumrad NA | title = The fatty acid translocase gene CD36 and lingual lipase influence oral sensitivity to fat in obese subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | pages = 561–6 | date = Mar 2012 | pmid = 22210925 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M021873 | pmc=3276480}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a case for the receptor's relationship to fat tasting. Further research into the CD36 receptor could be useful in determining the existence of a true fat-tasting receptor.

[[GPR120]] and [[Free fatty acid receptor 1|GPR40]] have been implicated to respond to oral fat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DiPatrizio NV | title = Is fat taste ready for primetime? | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 136 | pages = 145–54 | date = Sep 2014 | pmid = 24631296 | doi = 10.1016/j.physbeh.2014.03.002 | pmc=4162865}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their absence leads to reduced fat preference and reduced neuronal response to orally administered fatty acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cartoni C, Yasumatsu K, Ohkuri T, Shigemura N, Yoshida R, Godinot N, le Coutre J, Ninomiya Y, Damak S | title = Taste preference for fatty acids is mediated by GPR40 and GPR120 | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 25 | pages = 8376–82 | date = Jun 2010 | pmid = 20573884 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0496-10.2010 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/30/25/8376.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Human bitter taste receptor genes are named TAS2R1 to TAS2R64, with many gaps due to non-existent genes, pseudogenes or proposed genes that have not been annotated to the most recent human genome assembly. Many bitter taste receptor genes also have confusing synonym names with several different gene names referring to the same gene. See table below for full list of human bitter taste receptor genes:

'''The Big Read''' was a survey on books carried out by the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2003, where over three quarters of a million votes were received from the British public to find the nation's best-loved novel of all time.&lt;ref&gt;The [[BBC]]'s Big Read [https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml BBC - The Big Read] April 2003, Retrieved 2008-12-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110110172119/http://pressoffice.penguin.co.uk/static/downloads/releases2003/160503_bigreadstop100_2.pdf Penguin Dominates The Big Read Top 100] ''[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]'' Press Office&lt;/ref&gt; The year-long survey was the biggest single test of public reading taste to date,&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard (15 Dec 2003) [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/15/bbc.books Tolkien runs rings round Big Read rivals]. ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated with several programmes hosted by celebrities, advocating their favourite books.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd Tonkin (24 Oct 2003) [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/a-week-in-books--the-big-read-aims-to-reflect-mass-taste-584433.html A Week in Books: The Big Read aims to reflect mass taste]. ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The BBC started the Big Read with the goal of finding the "Nation's Best-loved Novel" by way of a viewer vote via the Web, SMS, and telephone. The show attracted controversy for adopting an allegedly [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] approach to [[literature]], but supporters praised it for raising the public awareness of reading.&lt;ref name=RDB/&gt; The British public voted originally for any novel that they wished.&lt;ref name=RDB&gt;[http://www.librarything.com/bookaward/BBC's+Big+Read Book awards: BBC's Big Read - LibraryThing] Retrieved 2010-11-28&lt;/ref&gt; From this, a list of 200 was drawn up, with the highest 21 then put forward for further voting, on the provision that only one book per author was permitted in the top 21. As the poll was based on novels, the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were not part of the survey.

;Multiple novels in the Top 25
In the first stage, all four extant [[Harry Potter]] novels by [[J. K. Rowling]] were among the 25 leaders. So were both [[Middle-earth]] novels by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]].

Those two novels finally placed fifth and first; the other preliminary leaders by Rowling and Tolkien nominally led the also-rans in ranks 22–25.

'''''The Five Orders of Architecture''''' (''Regola delle cinque ordini d'architettura'') is a book on classical architecture by [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] from 1562, and is considered "one of the most successful architectural textbooks ever written",&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Evers|first=Vernd|title=Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present |year=2003|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-1699-8|pages=845|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5OK-Yw-A3cC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having no text apart from the notes and the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summerson|first=John|title=The classical language of architecture|year=1963|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-69012-6|pages=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57aoJE26kQkC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=Vignola+%22no+text%22+orders&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6wn5TIeqFI2P4gap2qHnBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22no%20text%22%20orders&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in Italian as ''Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura'', it has been fully or partially translated in English with different titles, including ''Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Rules of the Five Orders of Architecture''; ''Vignola: an elementary treatise on architecture comprising the complete study of the five orders, with indication of their shadows and the first principles of construction''; ''The Five Orders of Architecture according to Giacomo Barozzio of Vignola, to Which are Added the Greek Orders''; and ''The five orders of architecture, the casting of shadows and the first principles of construction based on the system of Vignola''.

==Contents==
The book tackles the five orders, [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], Doric, [[Ionic order|Ionic]], Corinthian, and [[Composite order|Composite]] in separate sections, each subdivided in five parts on the [[colonnade]], [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]], arcade with [[pedestal]], individual pedestals, and [[entablature]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]]. Following those 25 sections were some less related parts on [[cornice]]s and other elements. Written during the 1550s, it was published in 1562, and was soon considered the most practical work for the application of the five orders. Apart from the introduction, the book existed solely of 32 annotated plates, with views from the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] illustrating the [[Corinthian order]] and the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] for the [[Doric order]]. Later editions had more illustrations.

==Author==
Vignola was an Italian [[Renaissance]] architect who was the assistant of [[Michelangelo]] during his work on the [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. He was also one of the architects of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] and the [[Church of the Gesu]]. Following the examples of the Classical Roman work of [[Vitruvius]] and the five books of the ''Regole generali d'architettura'' by [[Sebastiano Serlio]] from 1537 on, Vignola started writing an architecture rule book on the [[classical order]]s. His work was more practical than the preceding two books which were more philosophical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallgrave|first=Harry Francis|title=An Anthology from Vitruvius to 1870|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0258-2|pages=590|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fxo8t5cZf6MC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions and translations==
It was over the next centuries often reprinted, translated, and used as an inspiration, e.g. for [[William Robert Ware]]'s main work ''The American Vignola'' from 1904. By 1700, it had been reprinted 15 times in Italian, and was translated in Dutch, English, French, German, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=William R.|title=The American Vignola: a guide to the making of classical architecture|year=1994|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28310-4|pages=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nV3eiQFnwyAC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=Vignola+%22Five+Orders%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rvP4TPjLI9WW4Abr6eTABw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20%22Five%20Orders%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the twentieth century, more than 250 editions of the book had been published,&lt;ref name=Taschen/&gt; marking it as "the most widely used architectural textbook of all up to the nineteenth century [...] forming one of the universal bases of courses of architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruft|first=Hanno-Walter|title=A history of architectural theory: from Vitruvius to the present|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-010-2|pages=706|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPTfVyHyVW4C&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=Vignola+cinque&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YP_4TLpXiJWzBqXhobQD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Vignola%20cinque&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Pall Mall Magazine''''' was a monthly [[United Kingdom|British]] [[literary magazine]] published between 1893 and 1914. Begun by [[William Waldorf Astor]] as an offshoot of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', the magazine included poetry, short stories, serialized fiction, and general commentaries, along with extensive artwork. It was notable in its time as the first British magazine to "publish illustrations in number and finish comparable to those of American periodicals of the same class"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/06/24/100095726.pdf | title = BUYS PALL MALL MAGAZINE.; Hearst Company Acquires Publication that W.W. Astor Started. | author = [unsigned] | date = 1914-06-24 | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 1 | format = PDF | accessdate  = 2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of which was in the late [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style. It was often compared to the competing publication ''[[The Strand Magazine]]''; many artists, such as illustrator [[Sidney Paget]] and author [[H. G. Wells]], sold freelance work to both.

During its run, the magazine published many of the most significant artists of the day, including illustrators [[George Morrow (illustrator)|George Morrow]] and [[Edmund Joseph Sullivan]], poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], and authors such as [[Julian Osgood Field]], [[Bernard Capes]], [[Charlotte O'Conor Eccles]], [[Jack London]], and [[Joseph Conrad]], whose novel ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'' was first serialized therein. Among the magazine's editors were [[Douglas Straight]] (1893–1896), [[Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton]] (1896–1900), [[George Halkett]] (1901–1905) and [[Charles Morley (editor)|Charles Morley]] (1905–1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On October 6, 1912, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Waldorf Astor had sold the magazine, "Said to Have Obtained Very Little for It." In 1914, as romantic ideas faded with the onset of the [[World War I|First World War]], ''The Pall Mall Magazine'' merged with ''Nash's Magazine'', controlled by the [[Hearst Corporation]] since 1910, to become ''[[Nash's Pall Mall Magazine]]''. From May 1927, the two magazines were again published separately, but they were re-merged after the September 1929 issue, and finally ceased publication altogether following the issue of September 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots''''' is a British [[children's book]] written by [[Beatrix Potter]] and illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] published in 2016. The manuscript was discovered by [[Jo Hanks]], a publisher at [[Penguin Random House Children's Books]], in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] archive in 2015.
&lt;ref name="kitty in boots"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beatrix Potter story Kitty-in-Boots discovered after 100 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35407846|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potter sent the manuscript to her publisher in 1914, and mentioned in letters that she intended to complete it; however, her work was interrupted by the outbreak of [[World War I]] and personal events such as her marriage and illness.&lt;ref name="kitty in boots"/&gt;

The story centres around "a well-behaved prime black Kitty cat, who leads rather a double life", and includes characters from other Potter stories, including [[Peter Rabbit]], and [[Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle]].&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lost Beatrix Potter tale 'Kitty-in-Boots' rediscovered - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/26/entertainment/new-beatrix-potter-kitty-in-boots/index.html|website = CNN|access-date = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was published on 1 September 2016 ({{ISBN|978-0241247594}}) by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]], the publisher of Potter's other works, which since 1983 has been an imprint of [[Penguin Group]].&lt;ref name=amazon&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tale of Kitty-in-Boots|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Tale-Kitty-In-Boots-Beatrix-Potter/dp/0241247594|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Warne|url=http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/frederickwarne/|publisher=Penguin Group|accessdate=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication coincided with the 150th anniversary of Potter's birth.&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

'''Train of Thought''' is an evolving community arts journey from west to east coast, with on-board activities and over 20 stops along the way. '''Train of Thought''' is produced by Toronto's [[Jumblies Theatre]] with partners all across Canada and will be taking place May and June 2015.

== History ==

'''Train of Thought''' was hatched by a group of artists sharing community engagement practices and projects across the country. Its focus is collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities.

== Themes ==

In developing the idea for '''Train of Thought''', [[Jumblies Theatre]] and partners asked what theme merited such a huge cross-country undertaking, a question that led to a focus on collaborations and alliances between First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities: the most challenging and urgent matter that all of us are grappling with and learning about from our different regional and cultural perspectives. Thus, '''Train of Thought''' takes a counter-colonial route to collect and share stories, buried histories and imagined landscapes of the land where we live: as it might have been, as it is, as it could be: drawing on perception, memory, history and imagination; merging whimsy and serious intent, bringing together artists and community members, the land’s first people and all those who have found refuge here over the years and generations.

== Production ==

'''Train of Thought''' is an evolving community arts journey from west to east coast, with on-board activities and over stops along the way. At each stop, a travelling company will get off until the next train comes through. Local arts organizations will host interactive events, and add to creative tasks. Additional travellers will hop aboard to join in conversations and art-making en route.

== Purpose ==

'''Train of Thought''' is less about trains than about the relationships and discoveries that the journey will enable. The tour is an imperfect and incomplete adventure - part of a longer and unending imperative to learn, connect and help to change tracks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">'''World Press Cartoon''' is an independent organization based in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Founded in 2005 the organization is known for holding one of the world's largest and most prestigious annual press cartoon contests. World Press Cartoon has also organized separate exhibitions under thematic criteria, as gender violence or environment protection. In 2017 World Press Cartoon had its 12th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/06/14/world-press-cartoon-awards-top-prize-to-iranian-artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017, the awards ceremony is held in the [[Caldas da Rainha]]. After the contest, the prizewinning cartoons are assembled into a traveling exhibition that was already presented in Spain, France, Belgium, Mozambique, Brazil, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Mexico, United Kingdom, China and India. A catalogue presenting all the prizewinning entries is published annually in English and Portuguese.

Another primary objective of the organization is to support professional cartoonists on a wide international scale, with a special focus in the [[freedom of the press]].

'''Zenitism''' ({{Lang-sh|Zenitizam / Зенитизам}}) was an [[art]] movement in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from 1921 until 1926, first in [[Zagreb]] from 1921 to 1924 and from 1924 in [[Belgrade]]. The movement was mainly involved in [[visual arts]], [[graphic design]], [[poetry]], [[literature]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[architecture]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.nb.rs/zenit/english.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like other avant-garde movements at the time, it held anti-war, anti-bourgeois and anti-nationalist views and rejected traditional culture and art. Micić defined the movement as "abstract metacosmic expressionism."

Most of its ideas were communicated through the [[Zenit (magazine)|Zenit]] magazine which [[Ljubomir Micić]] launched and which published 43 issues.

==The movement==

The movement was established following [[World War I]], during which [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] lost a million inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Erlikman, Vadim (2004). Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik. Moscow. {{ISBN|5-93165-107-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some artists from the region were known in Europe, Zenitism was the first notable art movement from the Balkans in Europe.
