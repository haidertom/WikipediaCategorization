      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4102">{{About|the physiological principle|the finance term|All or none|the mathematical term|Zero–one law}}

The '''all-or-none law''' is the principle that the strength by which a [[nerve]] or [[Skeletal striated muscle|muscle fibre]] responds to a stimulus is independent of the strength of the stimulus. If that stimulus exceeds the [[threshold potential]], the nerve or muscle fibre will give a complete response; otherwise, there is no response. 

It was first established by the American physiologist [[Henry Pickering Bowditch]] in 1871 for the [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] of [[Cardiac muscle|heart muscle]]. According to him, describing the relation of response to stimulus,&lt;blockquote&gt;““An induction shock produces a contraction or fails to do so according to its strength; if it does so at all, it produces the greatest contraction that can be produced by any strength of stimulus in the condition of the muscle at the time.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The individual fibres of both [[skeletal muscle]] and nerve respond to stimulation according to the all-or-none principle.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Walter B. ''Biographical Memoir, Henry Pickering Bowditch, 1840–1911''. Washington, D.C.: [[National Academy of Sciences]], Volume xvii, eighth memoir. 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship between stimulus and response==
The magnitude of the [[action potential]] set up in any single [[nerve fibre]] is independent of the strength of the exciting stimulus, provided the latter is adequate. An [[Electrical muscle stimulation|electrical stimulus]] below threshold strength fails to elicit a propagated spike potential. If it is of threshold strength or over, a spike (a nervous impulse) of maximum magnitude is set up. Either the single fibre does not respond with spike production, or it responds to the utmost of its ability under the conditions at the moment. This property of the single nerve fibre is termed the all-or-none relationship. This relationship holds only for the unit of [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]; for [[nervous tissue]] the unit is the [[nerve cell]], for [[skeletal muscle]] the unit is the individual muscle fiber and for the heart the unit is the entire [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or the entire [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s.

Stimuli too weak to produce a spike do, however, set up a local [[Electrotonic potential|electrotonus]], the magnitude of the electronic potential progressively increasing with the strength of the stimulus, until a spike is generated. This demonstrates the all-or-none relationship in spike production.

The above account deals with the response of a single nerve fibre. If a [[Sympathetic trunk|nerve trunk]] is stimulated, then as the exciting stimulus is progressively increased above a threshold, a larger number of fibres respond. The minimal effective (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;[[Threshold potential|threshold]]) stimulus is adequate only for fibres of high excitability, but a stronger stimulus excites all the nerve fibres. Increasing the stimulus further does increase the response of whole nerve.

[[Cardiac muscle|Heart muscle]] is excitable, i.e., it responds to external stimuli by [[Muscle contraction|contracting]]. If the external stimulus is too weak, no response is obtained; if the stimulus is adequate, the heart responds to the best of its ability. Accordingly, the [[Atrium (heart)|auricles]] or [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s behave as a single unit, so that an adequate stimulus normally produces a full contraction of either the auricles or ventricles. The force of the contraction obtained depends on the state in which the muscles fibres find themselves. In the case of [[muscle fibre]]s, the individual muscle fibre does not respond at all if the stimulus is too weak. However, it responds maximally when the stimulus rises to threshold. The contraction is not increased if the stimulus strength is further raised. Stronger stimuli bring more muscle fibres into action and thus the tension of a muscle increases as the strength of the stimulus applied to it rises.

[[File:10 Tango Tree generated from the reference tree P after the last warm-up search for element 20, Nodes in pink are roots of Auxiliary trees.jpg|thumb|Arboresence is defined by vertical hierarchy rather than horizontal connections]]

'''Arborescent''' ({{lang-fr|arborescent}}) is a term used by the French thinkers [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] to characterize thinking marked by insistence on [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing]] principles, [[binarism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. The term, first used in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) where it was opposed to the [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]], comes from the way [[genealogy tree]]s are drawn: unidirectional [[progress (history)|progress]], with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non-hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific [[species]]: rhizomes are [[heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and [[machine]]s to create the - most surprising - concept of [[desiring-production|desiring machine]]s). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent [[evolutionism]] theory. Deleuze also criticizes the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of [[formal languages]], which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari | Guattari, Félix]]. 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4326">{{About|the literary device|"back-stories" of consumer goods|Back-story (production)|the book by [[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]]|David Mitchell: Back Story}}
A '''backstory''', '''background story''', '''back-story''', or '''background''' is a set of events invented for a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], presented as preceding and leading up to that plot. It is a [[literary device]] of a [[narrative history]] all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. 

In [[acting]], it is the history of the [[character (arts)|character]] before the drama begins, and is created during the actor's preparation. 

It is the history of characters and other elements  that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Even a purely historical work selectively reveals backstory to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/backstory Backstory at Merriam Webster online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/backstory Backstory at Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage&lt;!--'Main story' redirects here--&gt;==
As a [[literary device]], backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the '''main story'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The usefulness of having a  [[Discovery (fiction)|dramatic revelation]] was recognized by [[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']].

Backstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/2009/08/backstory-importance-of-what-isnt-told.html Backstory: The Importance of What Isn't Told]&lt;/ref&gt;

Backstory may be revealed by various means, including [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[dialogue]], [[Narrative|direct narration]], [[:wikt:summary|summary]], [[recollection]], and [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]]. The original ''[[Star Wars (film) | Star Wars]]'' movie and its first two [[sequels]] are examples of a work with a preconceived backstory, which was later released as the "prequel" second set of three movies.

== Recollection ==
[[Recollection]] is the [[Fiction-writing modes|fiction-writing mode]] whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.

For example, Orson Scott Card observes that "If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . ." Furthermore, "If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event."&lt;ref&gt;Card, Orson Scott (1988), "Character &amp; Viewpoint", p. 113. Cincinnati, OH: Writer's Digest Books. {{ISBN|0-89879-307-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared universe ==
In a [[shared universe]] more than one author may shape the same backstory. The later creation of a backstory that conflicts with a previously written main story may require the adjustment device known as [[retroactive continuity]], informally known as "[[retcon]]".

==Acting==
Actors may create their own backstories for characters, going beyond the sometimes meager information in a script. Filling in details helps an actor interpret the script and create fully imagined characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homan |first1=Sidney |last2=Rhinehart |first2=Brian |title=Comedy Acting for Theatre: The Art and Craft of Performing in Comedies |date=2018 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9781350012783 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oMVIDwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=backstory+acting&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=26 November 2018 |chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[behaviorism]] approach to psychology, '''behavioral scripts''' are a sequence of expected behaviors for a given situation.&lt;ref name="Barnett06"&gt;Barnett, D.W. et al. (2006). [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-170157273.html Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice]. ''Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis'', 2(2), 158–181 {{issn|1932-4731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scripts include default standards for the actors, props, setting, and sequence of events that are expected to occur in a particular situation. The classic script example involves an individual dining at a restaurant.  This script has several components: props including tables, menus, food, and money, as well as roles including customers, servers, chefs, and a cashier.  The sequence of expected events for this script begins with a hungry customer entering the restaurant, ordering, eating, paying and then ends with the customer exiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|title=Cognitive Psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-31-391-5|pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt; People continually follow scripts which are acquired through habit, practice and simple [[Schedule|routine]]. Following a script can be useful because it could help to save the time and mental effort of deciding on appropriate behavior each time a situation is encountered.

==Psychology==
There have been many empirical research studies conducted in order to test the validity of the script theory.  One such study, conducted by Bower, Black, and Turner in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=G.H|author2=Black, J.B.|author3=Turner, T. J|title=Scripts in memory for texts|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1979|volume=11|pages=177–220|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(79)90009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  asked participants to read 18 different scenarios, all of which represented a doctor’s office script.  The participants were later asked to complete either a recall task or a recognition task.  In the recall task, the participants were asked to remember as much as they could about each scenario.  Here, the participants tended to recall certain parts of the stories that were not actually present, but that were parts of the scripts that the stories represented.  In the recognition task, participants were asked to rate various sentences on a 7-point scale regarding their personal confidence that they had seen each sentence in the scenario.  Some sentences shown to participants were from the stories and some were not.   Of the sentences that were not from the stories, some were relevant to the doctor’s office script and others were not relevant to the script at all.  Here, participants tended to recognize certain non-story sentences as having come from the story if the non-story sentence was relevant to the script.  Ultimately, Bower, Black, and Turner’s study suggested that scripts serve as a guide for a person’s recall and recognition for certain things that they already know.

Some people may have a tendency to [[habituate]] behavioral scripts in a manner that can act to limit consciousness in a subliminal way.  This can negatively influence the [[subconscious]] mind and, subsequently, can negatively affect perceptions, judgments, values, beliefs, [[cognition]] and [[behavior]]. For example, over-reliance upon behavioral scripts combined with [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] that encourage an individual to use these behavioral scripts may influence one to [[stereotype]] and develop a [[prejudiced]] attitude toward others based on [[socioeconomic status]], ethnicity, race, etc.

Some applied behavior analysts even use scripts to train new skills&lt;ref name="Barnett06"/&gt; and 20 years of research supports script use as an effective way to build new language, social, and activity routines for adults and children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="Barnett06"/&gt; With language scripts fading, efforts are being made in an attempt to help the scripts recombine in order to approximate more natural language.

The '''Bowman–Heidenhain''' hypothesis is an early explanation of [[renal function]] and [[urinary]] [[secretion]]. 

The hypothesis states that the [[kidney]] is first and foremost a secreting [[gland]]. According to the theory, [[glomeruli]] are merely filters, while the [[tubules]] are the true secretory structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Experimental pharmacology| last=McGuigan| first=Hugh| publisher=Lea &amp; Febiger| year=1919| page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove his [[hypothesis]], Rudolph Heidenhain injected [[methylene blue]] into an animal's [[bloodstream]], which soon appeared in the [[urine]]. More evident proof of this theory is that when the tubules are destroyed, urine becomes watery and [[urea]] and other toxic products remain in the [[blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Examination of the urine| author=George Alexander de Santos Saxe| year=1904| publisher=W.B. Saunders &amp; Co.| page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This theory was later merged with the [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy|Ludwig theory]] to form the modern theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Bowman-Heidenhain+theory|title=Bowman-Heidenhain theory|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262640201_Brain_Emotional_Learning-Inspired_Models Brain Emotional Learning-inspired Models]''' or '''BELiMs''' can be considered as a primary step to take inspiration from emotional systems to form new computational Intelligence (CI)  models. BELIMs have been inspired by [[fear conditioning]] that is one of the emotional systems in [[mammalians]] and is a mechanism by which a [[biological system]] learns how to predict aversive events.&lt;ref&gt;M. Parsapoor, “Brain Emotional Learning-Inspired Models. Licentiate dissertation”, Halmstad University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis behind the development of BELiMs is that "the neural structure of fear conditioning can be considered as a natural system that consists of some components (e.g., the amygdala, thalamus, and the sensory cortex) and whose functionality is fulfilled through interaction among its components. Fear conditioning as a system shows an intelligent behavior by learning how to respond to fear-induced stimuli and thus can be utilized to design new CI models for prediction and decision-making applications" &lt;ref&gt;[2]M. Parsapoor, ‘Towards Emotion inspired Computational Intelligence (EiCI)’, PhD dissertation, Halmstad University Press, Halmstad, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Caveat emptor''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|k|æ|v|i|æ|t|_|ˈ|ɛ|m|p|t|ɔr}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|k|æ|v|i|ɑː|t}}) is [[Latin]] for "Let the buyer beware"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Caveat%20emptor |title=Caveat emptor - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-03-30 |publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(from ''caveat'', "may he beware", a [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] form of ''cavēre'', "to beware" + ''ēmptor'', "buyer").  Generally, ''caveat emptor'' is the [[contract law]] [[legal principle|principle]] that controls the sale of [[real property]] after the date of [[Closing (real estate)|closing]], but may also apply to sales of other goods.  The phrase ''caveat emptor'' and its use as a disclaimer of warranties arise from the fact that buyers typically have less information about the good or service they are purchasing, while the seller has more information.  The quality of this situation is known as '[[information asymmetry]]'. Defects in the good or service may be hidden from the buyer, and only known to the seller.

A common way that information asymmetry between seller and buyer has been addressed is through a legally binding [[warranty]], such as a [[Warranty#Satisfaction guarantee|guarantee of satisfaction]].  But without such a safeguard in place the ancient rule applies, and the buyer should beware.

== Explanation ==
Under the [[principle]] of ''caveat emptor'', the [[buyer]] could not recover damages from the [[Sales|seller]] for defects on the [[property]] that rendered the property unfit for ordinary purposes. The only exception was if the seller actively concealed latent defects or otherwise made material misrepresentations amounting to [[fraud]].

Before [[statutory law]], the buyer had no express [[warranty]] ensuring the quality of goods. In the UK, [[common law]] requires that goods must be "fit for the particular purpose" and of "merchantable quality", per Section 15 of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979|Sale of Goods Act]] but this [[implied warranty]] can be difficult to enforce and may not apply to all products.  Hence, buyers are still advised to be cautious.

====Real estate====
The modern trend in the U.S. is that the [[Implied warranty|implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose]] applies in the real-estate context to only the sale of new residential [[House|housing]] by a builder-seller and that the ''caveat emptor'' rule applies to all other real-estate sale situations (e.g. homeowner to buyer).&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Stambovsky v. Ackley]],'' 572 N.Y.S.2d 672 (N.Y. App. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Other jurisdictions{{which|date=June 2016}} have provisions similar to this.

====Chattel property====
{{Main|Personal property}}
Under Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], adopted by all U.S. states, the sale of new goods is governed by the "perfect-tender" rule unless the parties to the sale expressly agree in advance to terms equivalent to ''caveat emptor'' (such as describing the goods as sold "as is" and/or "with all faults") or other limitations such as the below-discussed limitations on remedies.  The perfect-tender rule states that if a buyer who inspects new goods with reasonable promptness discovers them to be "nonconforming" (failing to meet the description provided or any other standards reasonably expectable by a buyer in his/her situation) and does not use the goods or take other actions constituting acceptance of them, the buyer may promptly return or refuse to accept ("reject") them and demand that the defect be remedied ("cured").  When goods fitting the same description and expectations are available for sale (''e.g.'', when the vendor has other instances of the same mass-produced merchandise in stock inventory), either the vendor or the buyer may insist on an "even exchange" for other, "conforming" instances of the product.  When conforming goods are not available in stock but are available for the dealer to purchase (usually on the open or "spot" market), the buyer may require that the seller obtain the goods elsewhere, even at a higher price, with the seller having to incur a loss equivalent to the price difference.  If the vendor still does not or cannot provide the goods and the dispute proceeds to litigation (as opposed to renegotiation or settlement), then as in all cases of vendor breaches of contract, the buyer may recover only the damages that s/he would have suffered had s/he taken all feasible steps to minimize ("mitigate") his/her damages suffered.

As a default rule, the perfect-tender rule may be "contracted around" in ways that specify or limit a buyer's remedies (and that accordingly reduce the market price that rational buyers are [[Willingness to pay|willing to pay]] for the goods).  In many cases, the [[vendor]] will not provide a refund but will provide [[Credit (finance)|store credit]]. In the cases of [[Computer software|software]], [[Film|movies]], and other [[copyright]]ed material, many vendors will offer only a direct exchange for another copy of the same title, with the effect that the initial transfer or license of intellectual-property rights is preserved. Most [[Retailing|stores]] require [[proof of purchase]] and impose time limits on exchanges or refunds. Some larger [[chain stores]], such as [[F.Y.E.]], [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], or [[Walmart]], will, however, do exchanges or refunds at any time, with or without proof of purchase, although they usually require a form of picture identification and place per-transaction and/or per-person quantity or dollar limitations on such returns.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, consumer law has moved away from the ''caveat emptor'' model, with laws passed that have enhanced [[consumer rights]] and allow greater leeway to return goods that do not meet legal standards of acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/cgi-bin/bglitem.cgi?file=BADV073-1011.txt |title=Trader's Guide to Civil Law |publisher=Trading Standards |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211185017/http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/cgi-bin/bglitem.cgi?file=badv073-1011.txt |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer purchases are regulated by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]], whilst business-to-business purchases are regulated by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]].

In the UK, consumers have the right to a full refund for faulty goods. However, traditionally, many retailers allow customers to return goods within a specified period (typically two weeks to two months) for a full refund or an exchange, even if there is no fault with the product. Exceptions may apply for goods sold as damaged or to clear.

Goods bought through "distance selling," for example online or by phone, also have a statutory "cooling off" period of fourteen calendar days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/changed-your-mind/changing-your-mind-about-something-youve-bought/|title=Changing your mind about something you've bought|website=citizensadvice.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which the purchase contract can be cancelled and treated as if not done.

Although no longer applied in consumer law, the principle of ''caveat emptor'' is generally held to apply to transactions between businesses unless it can be shown that the seller had a clear information advantage over the buyer that could not have been removed by carrying out reasonable [[due diligence]].

==Variations==

=== ''Caveat venditor'' === &lt;!-- Incoming redirect from [[Caveat venditor]] --&gt;
''Caveat venditor'' is [[Latin]] for "let the seller beware." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/caveat-venditor/|title=Caveat Venditor Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the landmark case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916), [[New York Court of Appeals|New York Court Appeals]] Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] established that [[Privity of contract#Third-party rights|privity of duty]] is no longer required in regard to  a lawsuit for [[product liability]] against the seller. This case is widely regarded as the origin of ''caveat venditor'' as it pertains to modern [[tort]] law in US. &lt;ref name="ReiboldtMallers2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reiboldt|first1=Wendy|last2=Mallers|first2=Melanie Horn|title=Consumer Survival: An Encyclopedia of Consumer Rights, Safety, and Protection &amp;#91;2 Volumes&amp;#93;: An Encyclopedia of Consumer Rights, Safety, and Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY6dAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|date=26 November 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-937-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Restat 2d of Torts, § 395:  "In 1916 the leading modern case of MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050, L.R.A. 1916F, 696, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 440, 13 N.C.C.A. 1029 (1916), discarded the general rule of non-liability, by holding that "inherently dangerous" articles included any article which would be dangerous to human safety if negligently made. After the passage of more than forty years, this decision is now all but universally accepted by the American courts."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Caveat lector'' ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
''Caveat lector'' is Latin for "let the reader beware".
One variant of this phrase is "caveat auditor", where the caveat is addressed to any receiver of a given (kind of) message (not necessarily a written one).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3320">'''''Clemons v. Department of Commerce''''' (see also [[United States congressional apportionment#Controversy and history]]) was a lawsuit filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]] on September 17, 2009, and unsuccessfully appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]], that challenged the constitutionality of the [[Public Law 62-5|law]] setting membership in the [[United States House of Representatives]] at 435 members.

== The case ==
The case, in brief, asked the court to decide three major points:
# Does the Constitution’s requirement of [[One man, one vote|one person, one-vote]] [see also ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]''] apply to the interstate apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives?
# Does the current level of inequality violate this standard?
# Does Congress need to increase the size of the House to remediate this inequality?&lt;ref&gt;Jurisdictional Statement, August 26, 2010, http://apportionment.us/JurisdictionalStatement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the principle of [[One man, one vote|one person, one-vote]], the suit cited a lack of compliance with [[Article I of the United States Constitution#Section 2: House of Representatives|Article I, Section 2]] and [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution#Apportionment of Representatives|Amendment XIV, Section 2]] of the [[United States Constitution]] that "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers" and asked that the court declare the current apportionment system to be unconstitutional.

== History of the case and current status ==
On July 7, 2010, the three-judge panel in the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi]] ruled that Congress has discretion to set the size of the [[United States House of Representatives]], even if significant voter inequality results. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the [[United States Supreme Court]] on August 26, 2010.  On November 17, 2010, the government filed a motion to dismiss the case or affirm the lower court decision (against the plaintiffs).  The appellants' Reply Brief was filed November 22, 2010, completing the cycle of filings.  The court considered the case in the conference of December 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court docket for the case https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-291.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2010, the complaint was vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court orders for December 13, 2010 https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121310zor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This essentially leaves the case as if it never occurred, leaving open the possibility of a future lawsuit to the same effect, but also throwing out the extensive legal analysis done by both parties.

'''[[Container deposit legislation]]''' ('''CDL''') also known as a Container Deposit Scheme (CDS) is a scheme that was first implemented in [[South Australia]] in 1977 and over the decades has spread to the [[Northern Territory]] in 2012, [[New South Wales]] in 2017 and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in June 2018. [[Queensland]] has announced it will pursue a scheme in partnership with NSW for implementation by 1 November 2018. [[Western Australia]] has also announced plans for a scheme commencing in early 2020.

Attempts to introduce similar legislation in [[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] have been unsuccessful to date. [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] did have a similar scheme in place in the 1980's called 'Cash for Cans' but was later rescinded. A [[Newspoll]] survey found a majority of people in Australia support a deposit scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tandlnews.com.au/2012/08/07/article/container-deposit-scheme-gathers-momentum/|title=Container deposit scheme gathers momentum|date=7 August 2012|work=Transport &amp; Logistics News|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national scheme has also been proposed many times over the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanup.org.au/au/Whatelsewesupport/why-do-we-need-a-container-deposit-legislation-.html|title=Why we need a Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recent [[NSW]] scheme was strongly opposed by the beverage industry and highlighted their influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/beverage-giants-lobby-against-nsw-container-deposit-scheme-20141108-11iqup.html|title=Beverage giants lobby against NSW container deposit scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of deposits and the scope of their application have been influenced by the Australian federal constitution's guarantee of free trade between the states. The defining case in this issue was the attempt to introduce a differential between reusable and recyclable bottle deposits. The issue was taken to the High Court of Australia in the ''[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]]'' court case.,&lt;ref name="Tooheys HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|1990|litigants=[[Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia]] |parallelcite=(1990) 169 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 436 |date=7 February 1990 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; State based schemes need to be exempted from the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act which guarantees products can be sold in any jurisdiction without requiring any special labelling. This formed the basis of legal action against the Northern Territories' scheme until an exemption was granted. South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales and the ACT is offering 10c to anyone who donates an empty container.

==CDL by state==

===Australian Capital Territory===
The ACT government has always been supportive of container deposit legislation, but has never acted alone due to its relatively small size and being enclaved inside the much larger state of NSW. They have always said if NSW adopts a scheme they will follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/canberra-likely-to-follow-nsw-into-refunds-for-drinks-containers-20150105-12i7m0.html|title=Canberra likely to follow NSW into refunds for drinks containers|author=Kirsten Lawson|date=14 January 2015|work=Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ACT Container Deposit Scheme legislation was passed into law on 9 November 2017 and a public consultation was conducted ahead of  the scheme's implementation in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yoursay.act.gov.au/act-container-deposit-scheme|title=Your say: ACT Container Deposit Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme began on 30 June 2018.

===New South Wales===
[[File:Reverse vending machine for the NSW Container Deposit Scheme at the Kooringal Mall 2.jpg|thumb|Reverse vending machine, December 2017.]]
The [[New South Wales]] government has indicated it wishes to push ahead with a container deposit scheme as part of a raft of new policies aimed at protecting the environment and doing more to prevent litter and pollution entering the state's rivers, oceans, and parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-01-04/nsw-government-to-introduce-a-drinks-container-deposit-scheme/5999102|title=NSW Government set to introduce a drinks container deposit scheme|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme has strong backing from the public, various politicians, NSW councils,&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2014/12/nsw-councils-back-container-deposit-scheme|title=NSW councils back container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various environmental groups such as Cleanup Australia, Boomerang Alliance, and Total Environment Centre.

In February 2015 it was revealed that the Baird government has been under a well planned, sustained attack from multiple beverage industry companies and their executives. They have organised the lobbying of various members of parliament in NSW and other jurisdictions (even at the federal level) in order to gain influence over Mike Baird and Minister for the Environment, Rob Stokes, in order to force them to abandon plans for a container deposit scheme in NSW. The beverage industry has even threatened to run scare campaign election advertising. The government said that all of this time and money spent on lobbying has ultimately failed to change their position and the scheme will go ahead and is currently being designed. They have also invited the beverage industry to get on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/how-beverage-companies-joined-forces-to-attack-baird-recycling-scheme-20150207-1389dx.html|title=How beverage companies joined forces to attack Baird recycling scheme|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSW government initially announced the start date of a container deposit/refund system being July 2017, however, this was extended to December 2017 following requests from environment groups and industry bodies.&lt;ref name="epa.nsw.gov.au"&gt;http://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/resources/MinMedia/EPAMinMedia17021601.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 8 May 2016 it was officially announced the NSW will be implementing a full 10c Container Deposit Scheme after looking at many options, including public submissions and industry alternatives. As it stands, drink containers from 150ml in size up to 3L will be covered as long as it has the appropriate NSW labelling. There will be some exclusions - such as wine bottles - as it is mainly targeting drink containers consumed away from home. Draft legislation will be brought forward and an implementation advisory group will be established to meet the 1 December 2017 start date. This will affect the ACT and also QLD which are currently examining options for a state based scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/baird-backs-kids-over-big-beverage-10-for-every-drink-bottle-you-can-find-20160507-gooqih.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2017 the NSW EPA announced the scheme coordinator would be a joint venture called Exchange for Change,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exchangeforchange.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 5 of Australian beverage companies: Asahi, Carlton &amp; United Breweries, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coopers Brewery and Lion. However, there has been some criticism of this decision given some of these organisations have actively opposed CDL in the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/politics/nsw/utter-stupidity-greens-attack-cokes-role-in-nsw-container-scheme-20170731-gxmh5u.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2017, the Container Deposit Scheme, named [[Return and Earn]], officially started, as it pushed to reduce the volume of litter in NSW by 40% by 2020. During the first couple of weeks in the scheme, many people were complaining about it, which including drink prices going up, boxes and bags dumped next to the machines, the allowance of only cans and bottles that were empty, uncrushed, unbroken and had the original label attached, and also, the limited number of collection points around the state. Although there was plenty of problems throughout Return And Earn, the number of containers that were returned increased, as did the amount of collection points. The Environment Minister announced that the scheme has been a success, and they were working hard to fix the minor teething problems. During Christmas and New Years celebrations, the amount grew to over 1 million containers returned a day, and then to over 3 million in towards April March. As of 17 April, there is a growing number of the 549 collection points available out of the planned 800+, and over 240 million containers have been returned throughout the state. A common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase."

===Northern Territory===
The [[Northern Territory]] introduced a container deposit scheme similar to South Australia's from 3 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017042522/http://www.nretas.nt.gov.au/environment-protection/containerdeposit |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged in the Federal Court by [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Schweppes Australia]] and [[Lion (Australasian company)|Lion Pty Ltd]] using the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act and the scheme ceased on 4 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/business/companies/coca-cola-wins-federal-court-case-cash-for-containers-recycling-found-illegal/story-fnda1bsz-1226590179763|title=Coca-Cola wins Federal Court case, cash for containers recycling found illegal|work=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the Federal Court loss, the NT government personally stepped in to keep the scheme going until a permanent exemption to the Mutual Recognition Act could be secured. On 7 August 2013 the Federal Executive Council (ExCo) ratified the permanent exemption making the NT container deposit scheme completely legal and permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-07/nt-container-deposit-schme-back-on-track-federal-law-exemption/4870244|title=Container deposit scheme back on full-bottle track|work=www.abc.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this, all beverage containers sold in Australia now must bear the words "10c refund at SA/NT collection depots in state/territory of purchase". With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase"

===Queensland===
In 2013, the [[Newman government]] has indicated it does not want to increase the cost of QLD residents' costs of living, seeing the refund scheme as more of a tax rather than a refundable deposit even though 85% of Queenslanders are in favor of a scheme according to a Newspoll.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/most-queenslanders-want-container-deposit-laws-introduced-but-the-government-cans-the-idea/story-fnihsrf2-1226666475414&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, the newly elected [[Palaszczuk Ministry|Palaszczuk government]] indicated a total overhaul of the state's environmental policies including supporting a national container deposit scheme and also a state based container deposit scheme. It is likely that QLD will follow suit with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.resourcerecovery.biz/news/labor-poised-overhaul-queensland-recycling-policies&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 the QLD government announced its support for a Cash for Containers scheme in Queensland, potentially in 2018 after NSW implements its own scheme. The QLD environment minister says he was inspired by trash that was sent to his office. He has ordered a review and wants to establish an advisory group to help his department with a consultation process with the public and stake holders commencing later this year. He also says he will work with NSW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/environment-minister-steven-miles-tackles-queenslands-recycling-issue-20150520-gh5zm3.html|title=Environment Minister Steven Miles tackles Queensland's recycling issue|author=Amy Remeikis|date=20 May 2015|work=Brisbane Times}}
As of May 2016, with NSW formally signing off on a full 10c CDS - it is likely QLD will adopt a similar model for implementation in 2018. QLD is observing the NSW situation closely.
&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the [[Queensland]] government on 22 July 2016 announced that State will have a Container Deposit Scheme "to get drink cans and bottles off our beaches, and out of our parks and public areas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Container deposit scheme for Queensland|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2016/7/22/container-deposit-scheme-for-queensland|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The Queensland Container Refund Scheme (CRS) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quensland Container Refund Scheme|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/management/waste/container-refund-about|website=qld.gov.au|publisher=Queensland government|accessdate=27 July 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to start from 1 July 2018 but was delayed to 1 November 2018.

===South Australia===

In the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid shopkeepers and "marine store collectors" ("bottle-ohs") for the return of their (proprietary) containers, both bottles and crates. By arrangement between the manufacturers, the refund to the consumer was standardized (for many decades 2d, later 6d or 5c. for soft drink bottles and ½d for generic beer bottles) and the collectors received a premium for their part in the process. A substantial cost was incurred by the manufacturer in the transportation, sorting, storage, washing and sterilizing of the bottles and their inspection for contamination and damage. With the advent of cheaper single-use bottles great savings were achievable, and their subsequent disposal the responsibility of the consumer.

CDL in [[South Australia]] was put in place under the Beverage Container Act 1975 (SA) and came into operation in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/BEVERAGE%20CONTAINER%20ACT%201975/1995.04.30_%281988.03.10%29/1975.77.PDF|title=Beverage Container Act 1975|year=1975|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environment Protection Act 1993]] (SA) now governs the levying and refund of deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/C/A/Environment%20Protection%20Act%201993.aspx|title=South Australian Legislation – Environment Protection Act 1993|publisher=Attorney-General's Department, Government of South Australia|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a refund of 10 cents per can or bottle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottlebill.org/legislation/world/australia.htm|title=BottleBill.org – Beverage Container Legislation in Australia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (raised from 5 cents in late 2008). In the 1970s deposits ranged from 20c for a 30 oz bottle and 10c for a 10 oz and 6½ oz bottle. With the introduction of plastic and non re-usable bottles the deposit was reduced to 5c (including aluminium cans). This amount remained unchanged for around thirty years.

Around 600 people are employed in the recovery of bottles in South Australia. Groups such as the Scouts operate container refund depots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/other7680.html|title=What are Bottle Bills|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are professional collectors who collect on an arranged basis from particular venues (e.g. pubs and restaurants), usually operating small trucks for the job, there are also many socially marginalised collectors who forage in spots such as refuse bins for discarded deposit bottles; these collectors often travel by bicycle, sometimes with relatively elaborate and inventive modifications to allow them to carry bulky loads of bottles.

Until 2008, every beverage container in Australia bore the words "5c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase". This changed to "10c refund at SA collection depots in state of purchase" in late 2008. Since the [[Northern Territory]] started their own scheme in 2012, this message has changed again. With other jurisdictions implementing their own schemes a common label has been developed which will start appearing on bottles and cans: "10c refund at collection depots/points in participating State/Territory of purchase".

===Tasmania===
In December 2014 a state based deposit scheme was rejected by the government, citing costs and the need to ship containers to the Australian mainland for processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-20/knock-back-for-container-deposit-scheme-tas/5980924|title=Container deposit scheme rejected in Tasmania after report estimates $4m cost|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various environmental organisations, including The Greens and many Tasmanian local councils&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governmentnews.com.au/2013/12/tasmanian-councils-harden-push-for-container-deposit-scheme/|title=Tasmanian councils harden push for container deposit scheme|work=Government News}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been pushing for a scheme in Tasmania for many years. Most people are in favour of a scheme according to various studies that have been conducted over the years.

In 2018 the Tasmanian Government has made a commitment to consider establishing a Container Refund Scheme (CRS) and has engaged a consulting company to produce a report with recommendations. This report is now available and the Tasmanian Government is now reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.tas.gov.au/policy/other-topics/resource-recovery/container-deposit-scheme|title=Studies into Container Deposit Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victoria===
The state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] once had a container deposit scheme in the 1980's called "Cash for Cans" but was rescinded in 1989.&lt;ref name="governmentnews.com.au"/&gt;
In 2009 the [[Victorian Greens]] introduced a bill for a 10c deposit scheme, which was passed in the [[Victorian Legislative Council|upper house]] but the government quashed the bill in the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|lower house]], allegedly on constitutional grounds, by refusing to allow it to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McMahon |first = Stephen |title = Brumby Government halts Greens law to reintroduce bottle deposit system| work = HeraldSun |date = 25 June 2009 | url = http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/brumby-government-halts-greens-law-to-reintroduce-bottle-deposit-system/story-e6frf7jo-1225739810093 | accessdate = 22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite supporting the Greens' bill when in opposition, when it later became the government the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] decided it would not back a bottle refund scheme. Instead, it said it would support a national scheme if one were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucas|first=Clay|title=Baillieu retreats on bottle refund scheme|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/baillieu-retreats-on-bottle-refund-scheme-20120304-1ub4u.html|accessdate=25 January 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012/2013, the Napthine government indicated its strong support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victorian-premier-denis-napthine-backs-cashforcans-recycling-scheme-20140322-35ab5.html|title=Victorian Premier Denis Napthine backs cash-for-cans recycling scheme|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a state based scheme possibly in partnership with NSW. Since there has now been a change of government, the legislation has not been introduced into parliament as of January 2015.

In February 2015, the then Environment Minister [[Lisa Neville]] has publicly said she is not in favour of a container deposit scheme for Victoria. She believes current recycling programs are good enough, even though Clean-up Australia claims beverage related rubbish in Victoria now outnumbers cigarette related rubbish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/lisa-neville-against-cashforcontainers-recycling-scheme-in-victoria-20150107-12j14t.html|title=Lisa Neville against cash-for-containers recycling scheme in Victoria|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2017 her successor [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] confirmed the state's continuing opposition to a state scheme on the basis that the costs would outweigh the environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heffernan|first1=Madeleine|last2=Preiss|first2=Benjamin|title=Victoria open to 'going it alone' on plastic bag ban if national deal not reached|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/victoria-open-to-going-it-alone-on-plastic-bag-ban-if-national-deal-not-reached-20170725-gxi9av.html|accessdate=24 September 2017|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Victorian Environment Minister [[Lily D'Ambrosio]] announced a $37m package to tackle recycling in her State. Although she is no longer explicitly saying a CDS for Victoria is off the table, she has stated that she is carefully monitoring the situation in NSW in relation to the newly rolled out scheme.
There are private companies that accept used aluminum cans and pay cash for them - usually by weight or by per filled 'metal storage cage'.

===Western Australia===
In 2011, opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and [[Australian Greens|Greens]] MPs called for the introduction of a container deposit scheme. The Minister for Environment, [[Bill Marmion]], said that WA would wait for a national "consultation regulatory impact statement" to be completed at the end of 2011 before taking any action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-16/container-deposit-feature/3675712|title=A container deposit scheme is proposed for WA|first1=Oliver|last1=Peterson|date=16 November 2011|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the WA Government announced a State container deposit scheme commencing in 2018. Minister for the Environment [[Albert Jacob]] said that efforts to pursue a national scheme had "fallen by the wayside" but that Western Australia's policy should be aligned with recent changes in Queensland and New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-17/10-cent-container-deposit-scheme-for-wa-recyclable-bottles-cans/7751328|title=WA container deposit scheme: Consumers to get 10c for bottles, cans in recycling push|first1=Andrew|last1=O'Connor|date=17 August 2016|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a change of government at the March 2017 election, the new Environment Minister [[Stephen Dawson (politician)|Stephen Dawson]] said he wanted to make a container deposit scheme a priority and in August 2017. The new WA Government held public consultation and will start a container deposit scheme in January 2020 in a bid to lift the State’s low recycling rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme|title=WA Container Deposit Scheme|publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical==
Through the early 20th century, when the cost of producing glass bottles was higher, a natural industry of glass bottle collectors and merchants performed a similar function to the modern CDL. Bottle accumulators, a licensed and unionized workforce commonly known as "bottle-ohs" from their [[street cries]], travelled by cart around the streets buying empty bottles from households and businesses. They would then sell the bottles to a bottle yard, which would store and sort the bottles before selling them in bulk to brewers and other bottlers. It was an industry from which a bottle-oh could make a good living; in 1904, they could buy a dozen beer bottles for 6[[Penny (Australian)|d.]], sell them to the bottle yard for 9d., who could sell them to brewers for 1[[shilling (Australian)|s.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]]
|date=28 January 1904|page=2|title=How people live V: the accumulator – money in bottles|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/112789298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial reuse of glass bottles and the bottle collecting industry had all but disappeared by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|page=2|title=The silence of the bottle-oh|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/18244445|date=15 December 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Soft drink and other beverage bottles were still collected in Queensland and returned for deposits up to the late 1960s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10683">In [[software engineering]], '''coupling''' is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are;&lt;ref name="ISO_24765"&gt;ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 Systems and software engineering — Vocabulary&lt;/ref&gt; the strength of the relationships between modules.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC TR 19759:2005, Software Engineering — Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupling is usually contrasted with [[cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]]. [[Loose coupling|Low coupling]] often correlates with high cohesion, and vice versa. Low coupling is often a sign of a well-structured [[Computer|computer system]] and a good design, and when combined with high cohesion, supports the general goals of high readability and maintainability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==
The [[software metric|software quality metrics]] of coupling and cohesion were invented by [[Larry Constantine]] in the late 1960s as part of a [[structured design]], based on characteristics of “good” programming practices that reduced maintenance and modification costs. Structured design, including cohesion and coupling, were published in the article {{harvtxt|Stevens|Myers|Constantine|1974}} and the book {{harvtxt|Yourdon|Constantine|1979}}, and the latter subsequently became standard terms.

== Types of coupling ==
[[Image:Coupling sketches cropped 1.svg|thumb|300px|right|upright=2.0|Conceptual model of coupling]]
Coupling can be "low" (also "loose" and "weak") or "high" (also "tight" and "strong"). Some types of coupling, in order of highest to lowest coupling, are as follows:

=== Procedural programming ===
A module here refers to a subroutine of any kind, i.e. a set of one or more statements having a name and preferably its own set of variable names.

;Content coupling (high): Content coupling is said to occur when one module uses the code of other module, for instance a branch. This violates information hiding - a basic design concept.
;Common coupling: Common coupling is said to occur when several modules have access to the same global data. But it can lead to uncontrolled error propagation and unforeseen side-effects when changes are made.
;External coupling: External coupling occurs when two modules share an externally imposed data format, communication protocol, or device interface. This is basically related to the communication to external tools and devices.
;Control coupling: Control coupling is one module controlling the flow of another, by passing it information on what to do (e.g., passing a what-to-do flag).
;Stamp coupling (data-structured coupling): Stamp coupling occurs when modules share a composite data structure and use only parts of it, possibly different parts (e.g., passing a whole record to a function that needs only one field of it).
:In this situation, a modification in a field that a module does not need may lead to changing the way the module reads the record.
;Data coupling: Data coupling occurs when modules share data through, for example, parameters. Each datum is an elementary piece, and these are the only data shared (e.g., passing an integer to a function that computes a square root).

=== Object-oriented programming ===
;Subclass coupling: Describes the relationship between a child and its parent. The child is connected to its parent, but the parent is not connected to the child.

;Temporal coupling: When two actions are bundled together into one module just because they happen to occur at the same time.

In recent work various other coupling concepts have been investigated and used as indicators for different modularization principles used in practice.&lt;ref&gt;F. Beck, S. Diehl. On the Congruence of Modularity and Code Coupling. In Proceedings of the 19th ACM SIGSOFT Symposium and the 13th European Conference on Foundations of Software Engineering (SIGSOFT/FSE '11), Szeged, Hungary, September 2011. {{doi|10.1145/2025113.2025162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Tightly coupled systems tend to exhibit the following developmental characteristics, which are often seen as disadvantages:

# A change in one module usually forces a [[ripple effect]] of changes in other modules.
# Assembly of modules might require more effort and/or time due to the increased inter-module dependency.
# A particular module might be harder to reuse and/or test because dependent modules must be included.

== Performance issues ==
Whether loosely or tightly coupled, a system's performance is often reduced by message and parameter creation, transmission, translation (e.g. marshaling) and message interpretation (which might be a reference to a string, array or data structure), which require less overhead than creating a complicated message such as a [[SOAP]] message. Longer messages require more CPU and memory to produce. To optimize runtime performance, message length must be minimized and message meaning must be maximized.
;Message Transmission Overhead and Performance: Since a message must be transmitted in full to retain its complete meaning, message transmission must be optimized. Longer messages require more CPU and memory to transmit and receive. Also, when necessary, receivers must reassemble a message into its original state to completely receive it. Hence, to optimize runtime performance, message length must be minimized and message meaning must be maximized.

;Message Translation Overhead and Performance: Message protocols and messages themselves often contain extra information (i.e., packet, structure, definition and language information). Hence, the receiver often needs to translate a message into a more refined form by removing extra characters and structure information and/or by converting values from one type to another. Any sort of translation increases CPU and/or memory overhead. To optimize runtime performance, message form and content must be reduced and refined to maximize its meaning and reduce translation.

;Message Interpretation Overhead and Performance: All messages must be interpreted by the receiver. Simple messages such as integers might not require additional processing to be interpreted. However, complex messages such as [[SOAP]] messages require a parser and a string transformer for them to exhibit intended meanings. To optimize runtime performance, messages must be refined and reduced to minimize interpretation overhead.

== Solutions ==
One approach to decreasing coupling is [[functional design]], which seeks to limit the responsibilities of modules along functionality. Coupling increases between two classes '''''A''''' and '''''B''''' if:

*'''''A''''' has an attribute that refers to (is of type) '''''B'''''.
*'''''A''''' calls on services of an object '''''B'''''.
*'''''A''''' has a method that references '''''B''''' (via return type or parameter).
*'''''A''''' is a subclass of (or implements) class '''''B'''''.

Low coupling refers to a relationship in which one module interacts with another module through a simple and stable interface and does not need to be concerned with the other module's internal implementation (see [[Information Hiding]]).

Systems such as [[CORBA]] or [[Component Object Model|COM]] allow objects to communicate with each other without having to know anything about the other object's implementation. Both of these systems even allow for objects to communicate with objects written in other languages.

== Coupling versus cohesion ==
Coupling and [[cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]] are terms which occur together very frequently. Coupling refers to the interdependencies between modules, while cohesion describes how related the functions within a single module are. Low cohesion implies that a given module performs tasks which are not very related to each other and hence can create problems as the module becomes large.

== Module coupling ==
Coupling in Software Engineering&lt;ref name=Pressman&gt;Pressman, Roger S. Ph.D. (1982).  Software Engineering - A Practitioner's Approach - Fourth Edition.  {{ISBN|0-07-052182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a version of metrics associated with this concept.

For data and control flow coupling:

* '''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of input data parameters
* '''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of input control parameters
* '''d&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of output data parameters
* '''c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of output control parameters

For global coupling:

* '''g&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of global variables used as data
* '''g&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''': number of global variables used as control

For environmental coupling:

* '''w''': number of modules called (fan-out)
* '''r''': number of modules calling the module under consideration (fan-in)

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Coupling}(C) = 1 - \frac{1}{d_{i} + 2\times c_{i} + d_{o} + 2\times c_{o} + g_{d} + 2\times g_{c} + w + r}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Coupling(C)&lt;/code&gt; makes the value larger the more coupled the module is. This number ranges from approximately 0.67 (low coupling) to 1.0 (highly coupled)

For example, if a module has only a single input and output data parameter

&lt;math&gt;C = 1 - \frac{1}{1+0+1+0+0+0+1+0} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = 0.67&lt;/math&gt;

If a module has 5 input and output data parameters, an equal number of control parameters, and accesses 10 items of global data, with a fan-in of 3 and a fan-out of 4,

&lt;math&gt;C = 1 - \frac{1}{5 + 2\times 5 + 5 + 2\times 5 + 10 + 0 + 3 + 4} = 0.98&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6804">Groups of working individuals are typically classified based on the colors of their '''collars''' worn at work; these can commonly reflect one's occupation or sometimes gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benczes|first1=Réka|title=Creative Compounding in English: The Semantics of Metaphorical and Metonymical Noun-Noun Combinations|date=2006|publisher=John Benjamins|location=Amsterdam|pages=144–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White-collar worker]]s are named for the white-collared shirts that were fashionable among office workers in the early and mid-20th century. [[Blue-collar worker]]s are referred to as such because in the early 20th century, they usually wore sturdy, inexpensive clothing that didn't show dirt easily, such as blue [[denim]] or [[cambric]] shirts. Various other "collar" descriptions exist as well.

==White collar==
{{main|White-collar worker}}
The term "white-collar worker" was coined in the 1930s by [[Upton Sinclair]], an American writer who referenced the word in connection to clerical, administrative and managerial functions during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition. Electronically indexed online document. White collar, usage 1, first example.&lt;/ref&gt; A white-collar worker is a salaried professional, typically referring to general office workers and management. However, in certain developed countries like the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]], a person is assumed to be a white-collar worker when one engages in a highly professional and successful career or works in either an administrative or managerial role.

==Blue collar==
{{main|Blue-collar worker}}
A blue-collar worker is a member of the [[working class]] who performs manual work and either earns an hourly wage or is paid piece rate for the amount of work done.  This term was first used in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest. [http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html "Working Man's Blues:  Why do we call manual laborers blue collar?"] [[Slate.com]], 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pink collar ==
{{main|Pink-collar worker}}
A pink-collar worker is also a member of the working class who performs in the [[service industry]]. They work in positions such as [[Waiting staff|waiters]], [[retail clerk]]s, [[salesperson]]s, and many other positions involving relations with people. The term was coined in the late 1990s as a phrase to describe jobs that were typically held by women; now the meaning has changed to encompass all service jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, Kathleen (February 17, 2015) [http://www.businessinsider.com/pink-collar-jobs-dominated-by-women-2015-2 "20 jobs that are dominated by women"] ''[[Business Insider]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/pink-collar "Pink collar"] ''Dictionary.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennery, Ann (Mat 23, 2012) [http://business.time.com/2012/05/23/the-term-pink-collar-is-silly-and-outdated-lets-retire-it/ "The Term 'Pink Collar' Is Silly And Outdated — Let’s Retire It"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other classifications==
Some job categories involve duties that fall under one or more of the categories listed above, or none of the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Work in America: M-Z|pages=597|year=2003|isbn=9781576076767|publisher=ABC-Clio Ltd|location=CA, USA|last=Van Horn|first=Carl|last2=Schaffner|first2=Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories include:

* [[Gold-collar worker|Gold collar]] – Highly skilled professionals who may be in high demand, such as company secretary, chartered accountants, surgeons, anesthesiologists, engineers and lawyers.
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Red collar}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;– [[Civil service|Government workers]] of all types;&lt;ref name=puneet /&gt; derived from compensation received from red ink budget. Also in China, refers to [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] officials in private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red-Collars in Private Companies|url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/17thCPC/txt/2007-06/25/content_78050.htm|website=Beijing Review|accessdate=14 April 2015|date=Jun 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Grey-collar|Grey collar]] – Skilled technicians, typically someone who is both white and blue collar; an example is information technology workers. They are principally white-collar, but perform blue-collar tasks with some regularity, such as engineers. May also be used to refer to old aged workers after retirement age.

The world's poor are significantly more likely to have or incur a [[disability]] within their lifetime compared to more financially privileged populations. The rate of disability within impoverished nations is notably higher than that found in more [[developed countries]]. Though no one explanation entirely accounts for this connection, recently{{since when?|date=August 2014}} there has been a substantial amount of research illustrating the cycle by which poverty and disability are mutually reinforcing. Physical, cognitive, mental, emotional, sensory, or developmental impairments independently or in tandem with one another may increase one's likelihood of becoming impoverished, while living in poverty may increase one's potential of having or acquiring special needs in some capacity.

==Extent==
[[File:Disable begger in Dhaka.JPG|thumbnail|Man with disabilities in Bangladesh]]
A multitude of studies have been shown to demonstrate a significant rate of [[disability]] among individuals living in [[poverty]]. People with disabilities were shown by the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] to comprise 15 to 20 percent of the poorest individuals in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."&gt;Elwan, A. (1999). Poverty and disability: A review of the literature. The World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; Former World Bank President [[James Wolfensohn]] has stated that this connection reveals a link that should be broken. He stated, “People with disabilities in developing countries are over-represented among the poorest people. They have been largely overlooked in the development agenda so far, but the recent focus on poverty reduction strategies is a unique change to rethink and rewrite that agenda.”&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;The World Bank. (2011). Poverty and disability. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:20193783~menuPK:419389~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The link between disability and development has been further stressed by [[Judith Heumann]], the World Bank's first advisor for international [[Disability rights movement|disability rights]], who indicated that of the 650 million people living with disabilities today eighty percent live in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov"&gt;The Office of Policy Planning and Public Diplomacy. (2012). Special advisor Heumann's remarks on inclusive development. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311193836/http://www.humanrights.gov/tag/judith-heumann/ |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some research investigations with proved social impact are opening venues that lead to establish enabling factors to break the cycle of deprivation faced by poor people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00450|title=It also helped refine international approaches to the education of the disabled. [Social Impact]. RECOUP. Research Consortium on Educational Outcomes and Poverty (2005-2009)|last=|first=|date=|website=SIOR, Social Impact Open Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department for International Development|United Kingdom Department for International Development]], 10,000 individuals with disabilities die each day as a result of extreme poverty, showing that the connection between these two constructs is especially problematic and deep-seated.&lt;ref name="dfid"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new development agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is also present in developed countries, with the Disability Funders Network reporting that in the United States alone those with disabilities are twice as likely to live below the poverty line than those without special needs.&lt;ref name="Philanthropy"&gt;Dickson, J. (2011). Philanthropy's Blind Spot: The Disability Rights Movement. National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
According to the World Bank, “Persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic outcomes than persons without disabilities, such as less education, worse health outcomes, less employment, and higher poverty rates.”&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. (2012). Disability: Overview. Webaccessed: http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTDISABILITY/0,,contentMDK:21151218~menuPK:282706~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282699,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have demonstrated that these reduced outcomes may be attributed to a myriad of institutional barriers and other factors. Furthermore, the prevalence of disabilities in impoverished populations has been predicted to follow a cyclical pattern by which those who live in poverty are more likely to acquire a disability and those who have a disability are more likely to become impoverished.

===The vicious circle===
Experts from the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council attribute the connection between disability and poverty to many systemic factors that promote a “vicious circle.”&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;Yeo, R. &amp; Moore, K. (2003). Including disabled people in poverty reduction work: “Nothing about us, without us”. World Development 31, 571-590.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics affirm the mutually reinforcing nature of special needs and low socioeconomic status, showing that people with disabilities are significantly more likely to become impoverished and people who are impoverished are significantly more likely to become disabled. Barriers presented for those with disabilities can lead individuals to be deprived of access to essential resources, such as opportunities for education and employment, thus causing them to fall into poverty. Likewise, poverty places individuals at a much greater risk of acquiring a disability due to the general lack of health care, nutrition, sanitation, and safe working conditions that the poor are subject to.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt;

Experts assert that this cycle is perpetuated mainly by the lack of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] afforded to those living in poverty. The few options available to the poor often necessitate that these individuals put themselves in harms way, consequently resulting in an increase in the acquisition of preventable impairments.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Living in poverty is also shown to decrease an individual's access to preventative health services, which results in an increase in the acquisition of potentially preventable disabilities. In a study by [[Oxfam]], the organization found that well over half of the instances of childhood blindness and hearing impairment in Africa and Asia were considered preventable or treatable.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, H. (1999). Discussion paper for Oxfam: Disability as a development issue and how to integrate a disability perspective into the SCO. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; Another estimate released by Oxfam provides further evidence of this vicious circle, finding that 100 million people living in poverty suffer from impairments acquired due to malnutrition and lack of proper sanitation.&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;

Discrimination
Prejudice held against individuals with disabilities, otherwise termed [[ableism]], is shown to be a significant detriment to the successful outcomes of persons in this population. According to one study following the lives of children with disabilities in South Africa, the children in the sample described "discrimination from other metal children and adults in the community as their most significant daily problem."&lt;ref name="Clacherty"&gt;Clacherty, G., Matsha, K., &amp; Sait, W. (2004). How do children with disabilities experience poverty, disability, and service? Cape Town, South Africa: Idasa.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional forms of discrimination may lead disability to be more salient in already [[social exclusion|marginalized]] populations. Women and individuals belonging to certain ethnic groups who have disabilities have been found to more greatly suffer from discrimination and endure negative outcomes. Some researchers attribute this to what they believe is a “double rejection” of girls and women who are disabled on the basis of their sex in tandem with their special needs.&lt;ref name="Coleridge"&gt;Coleridge, P. (1993). Disability, liberation, and development. Oxford: Oxfam.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotypes that accompany both of these attributes lead females with disabilities to be seen as particularly dependent upon others and serve to amplify the misconception of this population as burdensome.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; In a study done by Oxfam, the societal consequences of having a disability while belonging to an already marginalized population were highlighted, stating, “A disabled women suffers a multiple handicap. Her chances of marriage are very slight, and she is most likely to be condemned to a twilight existence as a non-productive adjunct to the household of her birth… it is small wonder that many disabled female babies do not survive.”&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Additionally, women with disabilities are particularly susceptible to abuse. A 2004 UN survey in Orissa, India, found that every women with disabilities in their sample had experienced some form of physical abuse.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "&gt;United Nations. (2012). Fact sheet on persons with disabilities. Webaccessed: http://www.un.org/disabilities/documents/toolaction/pwdfs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This double discrimination is also shown to be prevalent in more industrialized nations. In the United States, for example, 72 percent of women with disabilities live below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The intensified discrimination individuals with disabilities may face due to their sex is especially important to consider when taking into account that, according to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], women report higher incidences of disability than men.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Furthermore, the connection between disability and poverty holds particular significance for the world's women, with females accounting for roughly 70 percent of all individuals living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;WHO. (2010). Integrating poverty and gender into health programs. The World Health Organization Webaccessed: http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/Nutritionmodule2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional discrimination also exists as there are policies existing in organizations that result in inequality between a disabled person and non-disabled person. Some of these organizations systematically ignore the needs of disabled people and some interfere in their lives as a means of social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Colin|date=1994|title=Institutional discrimination, disabled people and inter professional care|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2014.969831|journal=Journal of Interprofessional Care|volume=8|issue=2|pages=203-212|doi=10.3109/13561829409010420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Another reason individuals living with disabilities are often impoverished is the high [[health care|medical costs]] associated with their needs. One study, conducted in villages in South India, demonstrated that the annual cost of treatment and equipment needed for individuals with disabilities in the area ranged from three days of income to upwards of two years' worth, with the average amount spent on essential services totaling three months worth of income.&lt;ref&gt;Erb, S., &amp; Harriss-White, B. (2001). ''The Economic Impact and Developmental Implications of Disability and Incapacity in Adulthood: a village study in South India''. Cambridge: Welfare, Demography, and Development.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not take into account the unpaid work of caregivers who must provide assistance after these procedures and the opportunity costs leading to a loss of income during injury, surgery, and rehabilitation.
Studies reported by medical anthropologists Benedicte Ingstad and Susan Reynolds Whyte have also shown that access to medical care is significantly impaired when one lacks mobility. They report that in addition to the direct medical costs associated with special needs, the burden of transportation falls most heavily on those with disabilities. This is especially true for the rural poor whose distance from urban environments necessitates extensive movement in order to obtain health services.&lt;ref name="Whyte"&gt;Ingstad, B. &amp; Whyte, S. R. (2007). ''Disability in Local and Global Worlds''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these barriers, both economic and physical, it is estimated that only 2 percent of individuals with disabilities have access to adequate rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Despouy, 1993, Human Rights and Disabled Persons (Study Series 6), Centre for Human Rights Geneva and UN New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaccessibility of health care for those living in poverty has a substantial impact on the rate of disability within this population.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Individuals living in poverty face higher health risks and are often unable to obtain proper treatment, leading them to be significantly more likely to acquire a disability within their lifetime.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; Financial barriers are not the only obstacles those living in poverty are confronted with. Research shows that matters of geographic inaccessibility, availability, and cultural limitations all provide substantial impediments to the acquisition of proper care for the populations of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Peter, D. H., Garg, A., Bloom, G., Walker, D. G., Brieger, W. R., &amp; Rahman, H. (2008). "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Brieger2/publication/229569366_Poverty_and_Access_to_Health_Care_in_Developing_Countries/links/59e39a3a458515393d5b8faf/Poverty-and-Access-to-Health-Care-in-Developing-Countries.pdf Poverty and access to health care in developing countries]". ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences''. doi:10.1196&lt;/ref&gt; Sex-specific ailments are particularly harmful for women living in poverty. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that each year 20 million women acquire disabilities due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth that could be significantly mitigated with proper pre-natal, childbirth, and post-natal medical care.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"&gt;DFID (2000). Disability, poverty, and development. The Department for International Development. Webaccessed: http://www.handicap-international.fr/bibliographie-handicap/4PolitiqueHandicap/hand_pauvrete/DFID_disability.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other barriers to care are present in the lack of treatments developed to target [[diseases of poverty]]. Experts assert that the diseases most commonly affecting those in poverty attract the least research funding. This discrepancy, known as the [[10/90 gap]], reveals that only 10 percent of global health research focuses on conditions that account for 90 percent of the global disease burden.&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;Stevens, P. (2004) Diseases of poverty and the 10/90 gap. The World Health Organization. Webaccessed: http://www.who.int/intellectualproperty/submissions/InternationalPolicyNetwork.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Without a redistribution in research capital, it is likely that many of the diseases known to cause death and disability in impoverished populations will persist.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;

===Institutional barriers===
Researchers assert that institutional barriers play a substantial role in the incidence of poverty in those with disabilities.

====[[Accessibility]]====
Physical environment may be a large determinant in one's ability to access ladders of success or even basic sustenance. Professor of urban planning Rob Imrie concluded that most spaces contain surmountable physical barriers that unintentionally create an “apartheid by design,” whereby individuals with disabilities are excluded from areas because of the inaccessible layout of these spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Imrie, R. (1996). Disability and the city: International perspectives. London: Chapman.&lt;/ref&gt; This "apartheid" has been seen by some, such as the United Kingdom Disabled Persons Council, as especially concerning with regard to public transportation, education and health facilities, and perhaps most relevantly places of employment.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt; Physical barriers are also commonly found in the home, with those in poverty more likely to occupy tighter spaces inaccessible to wheelchairs.&lt;ref name="Clacherty"/&gt; Beyond physical accessibility, other potential excluding agents include a lack of [[Braille]], [[sign language]] and shortage of audio tape availability for those who are blind and deaf.&lt;ref name="Yeo" /&gt;

====Education====
The roots of unemployment are speculated to begin with discrimination at an early age. [[UNESCO]] reports that 98 percent of children with disabilities in developing countries are denied access to formal education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. (1995). Review of the present situation in special education. Webaccessed: http://www.unesco.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C133AD0AF05E62AC54C2DE8EE1C026DABFAF3000/filename/281_79.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, at least 40 million children with disabilities do not receive an education thus barring them from obtaining knowledge essential to gainful employment and forcing them to grow up to be financially dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; This is also reflected in a finding obtained by the [[World Development Report]] that 77 percent of persons with disabilities are illiterate.&lt;ref name="Elwan, A. (1999)."/&gt; This statistic is even more jarring for women with disabilities, with the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] reporting that the global literacy rate for this population is a mere 1 percent.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; This may be attributed to the fact that, according to the World Health Organization, boys with disabilities are significantly more likely to receive an education than similarly abled girls.&lt;ref name="DFID 2000"/&gt; Beyond simply the skills obtained, experts such as former World Bank advisor [[Judith Heumann]] speculate that the societal value of education and the inability of schools to accommodate special needs children substantially contributes to the discrimination of these individuals.&lt;ref name="Humanrights.gov" /&gt; It is important to note that the deprivation of education to individuals with special needs may not be solely an issue of discrimination, but an issue of resources. Children with disabilities often require [[Special education|specialized educational]] resources and teaching practices largely unavailable in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Action on Disability and Development (1998). ADD Uganda annual report. Kampala: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment====
Some sociologists have found a number of barriers to employment for individuals with disabilities. These may be seen in [[workplace discrimination|employer discrimination]], architectural barriers within the workplace, pervasive negative attitudes regarding skill, and the adverse reactions of customers.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, W.H., &amp; Wilder, E.I. (2005). Voices from the heartland: The needs and rights of individuals with disabilities. Brookline, MA: Brookline Books.&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Edward Hall, "More disabled people are unemployed, in lower status occupations, on low earnings, or out of the labour market altogether, than non-disabled people."&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, R. &amp; Parr, H. (1999). Mind and body spaces: geographies of illness, impairment, and disability. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization]] estimates that roughly 386 million of the world's working age population have some form of disability, however, up to eighty percent of these employable individuals with disabilities are unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Statistics show that individuals with disabilities in both industrialized and developing countries are generally unable to obtain formal work. In India, only 100,000 of the country's 70 million individuals with disabilities are employed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; In the United States, 14.3 of a projected 48.9 million people with disabilities were employed, with two-thirds of those unemployed reporting that they were unable to find work.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Similarly in Belgium, only 30 percent of persons with disabilities were able to find gainful employment.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, R. (2000). [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DISABILITY/Resources/280658-1172606907476/DisabilityIssuesMetts.pdf Disability issues, trends and recommendations for the World Bank]. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 45 percent of adults with disabilities were found to live below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;Barnes, C., &amp; Mercer, G. (2003). Disability. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliable data on the rate of unemployment for persons with disabilities has yet to be determined in most developing countries.

Sociologists Colin Barnes and Geof Mercer demonstrated that this exclusion of persons with disabilities from the paid labor market is a primary reason why the majority of this population experiences far greater levels of poverty and are more reliant on the financial support of others.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt; In addition to the economic gains associated with employment, researchers have shown that participation in the formal economic sector reduces discrimination of persons with disabilities. One anthropologist who chronicled the lives of persons with disabilities in Botswana noted that individuals who were able to find [[informal sector|formal employment]] “will usually obtain a position in society equal to that of non-disabled citizens.”&lt;ref name="Ingstad"&gt;Ingstad, B. (1997). Community-based rehabilitation in Botswana. Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the formal workplace is such a social space, the exclusion of individuals with disabilities from this realm is seen by some sociologists to be a significant impediment to social inclusion and equality.&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

Equity in employment has been strategized by some, such as sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters, to depend on heightened awareness of current barriers, wider use of assistive technologies that can make workplaces and tasks more accessible, more accommodating job development, and most importantly deconstructing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

Creating inclusive employment that better facilitates the participation of individuals with disabilities is demonstrated to have a significantly positive impact on not only the lives of these individuals, but also the economies of nations who implement such measures. The International Labour Organization estimates that the current exclusion of employable individuals with special needs is costing countries possible gains of 1 to 7 percent of their GDP.&lt;ref name="ILO"&gt;International Labour Office. (2012). Employment for social justice and a fair globalization: Overview of ILO Programmes. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/documents/publication/wcms_140958.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The relationship between disability and poverty is seen by many to be especially problematic given that it places those with the greatest needs in a position where they have access to the fewest resources. Researchers from the [[United nations|United Nations]] and the [[Yale School of Public Health]] refer to the link between disability and poverty as a manifestation of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] where the assumption that this population is a drain of resources leads society to deny them access to avenues of success. Such exclusion of individuals on the basis of their special needs in turn denies them the opportunity to make meaningful contributions that disprove these stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Chamie, M., Me, A., &amp; Groce, N.E. (2000). Measuring the quality of life: Rethinking the World Bank's disability adjusted life years. Webaccessed: {{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000914180312/http://www.disabilityworld.org/June-July2000/International/DALY.html |archivedate=2000-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfam asserts that this negative cycle is largely due to a gross underestimation of the potential held by individuals with disabilities and a lack of awareness of the possibilities that each person may hold if the proper resources were present.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

The early onset of preventable deaths has been demonstrated as a significant consequence of disability for those living in poverty. Researchers show that families who lack adequate economic agency are unable to care for children with special medical needs, resulting in preventable deaths.&lt;ref name="Yeo"/&gt; In times of economic hardship studies show families may divert resources from children with disabilities because investing in their livelihood is often perceived as an investment caretakers cannot afford to make.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, B. (1999). Promoting the rights of the disabled children globally disabled children become adults: Some implications. Frome: ADD.&lt;/ref&gt; Benedicte Ingstad, an anthropologist who studied families with a member with disabilities, asserted that what some may consider neglect of individuals with disabilities “was mainly a reflection of the general hardship that the household was living under."&lt;ref name="Ingstad" /&gt; A study conducted by Oxfam found that the rejection of a child with disabilities was not uncommon in areas of [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; The report went on to show that neglect of children with disabilities was far from a deliberate choice, but rather a consequence of a lack of essential resources. The study also demonstrated that services necessary to the well being of these children “are seized upon” when they are made available. The organization thus concludes that if families had the capacity to care for children with special needs they would do so willingly, but often the inability to access crucial resources bars them from administering proper care.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

==Current initiatives==
Initiatives on the local, national, and transnational levels addressing the connection between poverty and disability are exceedingly rare. According to the UN, only 45 countries throughout the world have anti-discrimination and other disability-specific laws.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet "/&gt; Additionally, experts point to the Western world as a demonstration that the association between poverty and disability is not naturally dissolved through the development process. Instead, a conscious effort toward inclusive development is seen by theorists, such as Disability Policy expert Mark Priestley, as essential in the remediation process.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;Priestley, Mark. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hrrpeMGQCLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Disability and the life course: Global perspectives]. NY, NY: University of Cambridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability rights advocate [[James Charlton (activist)|James Charlton]] asserts that it is crucial to better incorporate the voices of individuals with disabilities into the decision making process.&lt;ref name="Nothing"&gt;Charlton, J.I. (2000). Nothing about us without us: Disability oppression and empowerment. London, England: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His literature on disability rights made popular the slogan, “Nothing about us without us,” evidencing the need to ensure those most affected by policy have an equitable hand in its creation. This need for agency is an issue particularly salient for those with special needs who are often negatively stereotyped as dependent upon others.&lt;ref name="Nothing"/&gt; Furthermore, many who are part of the [[disability rights movement]] argue that there is too little emphasis on aid designed to eliminate the physical and social barriers those with disabilities face. The movement asserts that unless these obstacles are rectified, the connection between disability and poverty will persist.&lt;ref name=" Philanthropy "/&gt;

Employment is seen as a critical agent in reducing stigma and increasing capacity in the lives of individuals with disabilities. The lack of opportunities currently available is shown to perpetuate the vicious cycle, causing individuals with disabilities to fall into poverty. To address these concerns many recent initiatives have begun to develop more inclusive employment structures.&lt;ref name="ILO"/&gt; One example of this is the Ntiro Project for Supported and Inclusive Employment.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"&gt;Parmenter,T.R.(2011). Promoting training and employment opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities. International Labour Office. Webaccessed: http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---ifp_skills/documents/publication/wcms_167316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Located in South Africa, the project aims to eliminate the segragationist models prevalent in the country through coordinated efforts between districts, NGOs, and community organizations. The model stresses education and pairs individuals with intellectual disabilities with mentors until they have developed the skills necessary to perform their roles independently. The program then matches individuals with local employers. This gradualist model ensures that people who may have been deprived of the resources necessary to acquire essential skills are able to build their expertise and enter the workforce.&lt;ref name="Parmenter"/&gt;

The United Nations has been at the forefront of initiating legislation that aims to deter the current toll disabilities take on individuals in society, especially those in poverty. In 1982 the UN published the [[World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons]], which explicitly states "Particular efforts should be made to integrate the disabled in the development process and that effective measures for prevention, rehabilitation and equalization of opportunities are therefore essential."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=23&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine set stage for the UN Decade of the Disabled Person from 1983 to 1992, where, at its close, the General Assembly adopted the [[Standard Rules of the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/dissre00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Standard Rules encourages states to remove social, cultural, economic, educational, and political barriers that bar individuals with disabilities from participating equally in society.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (2012). The convention in detail. Webaccessed: {{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id%3D222 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612120639/http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=222 |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that these movements on behalf of the UN helped facilitate more inclusive development policy and brought disability rights to the forefront.&lt;ref name="dfid_a"&gt;Yeo, R. (2005). Disability, poverty, and the new poverty agenda. Disability Knowledge and Research Programme. Webaccessed: http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/PDF/Outputs/Disability/RedPov_agenda.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics assert that the relationship between disability and poverty may be overstated. Cultural differences in the definition of disability, bias leading to more generous estimates on behalf of researchers, and the variability in incidences that are not accounted for between countries are all speculated to be part of this mischaracterization.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; These factors lead some organizations to conclude that the projection asserting 10 percent of the global population belongs to the disabled community is entirely too broad. Speculation over the projection of a 10 percent disability rate has led other independent studies to collect varying results. The [[World Health Organization]] updated their estimate to 4 percent for developing countries and 7 percent for industrialized countries. [[USAID]] maintains the initial 10 percent figure, while the United Nations works off half of that rate with a projection of 5 percent.&lt;ref name="dfid" /&gt; The percentage of the world's population with disabilities remains a highly contested matter.

The argument that development should be channeled to better the agency of individuals with disabilities has been contested on several grounds. First, critics argue that development is enacted to harness potential that most individuals in this population do not possess.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt; Second, the case that health care costs for many persons with special needs are simply too great to be shouldered by the government or [[NGO]]'s has been made, especially with regard to emerging economies. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that investing in an individual's rehabilitation will result in substantial change in their agency. Lastly is the proposition of priorities. It is argued that most countries in need of extensive development must focus on health ails such as infant mortality, diarrhea, and malaria that are widespread killers not limited to a specific population.&lt;ref name="Coleridge" /&gt;

Critique with respect to potential solutions has also been made. In regards to implementing change through policy, critics have noted that the weak legal standing of United Nations' documents and the lack of resources available to aid in their implementation have resulted in a struggle to achieve the goals set forth by the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="dfid_a" /&gt; Other studies have shown that policy on a national level has not necessarily equated to marked improvements within these countries. One such example is the United States where sociologists Esther Wilder and William Walters purport that “the employment of disabled individuals has increased only marginally since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed.”&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; The smaller than anticipated impact of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] and other policy-based initiatives is seen as a critical flaw in legislation. This is because many issues surrounding disability, namely employment discrimination, are generally reconciled through the legal system necessitating that individuals engage in the often expensive process of litigation.&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4740">In [[software engineering]], '''don't repeat yourself''' ('''DRY''') is a [[Principle#Principle as axiom or logical fundament|principle]] of [[software development process|software development]] aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foote |first1=Steven |title=Learning to Program |date=2014 |publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional |isbn=9780133795226 |pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing it with abstractions or using [[data normalization]] to avoid redundancy.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system". The principle has been formulated by [[Andy Hunt (author)|Andy Hunt]] and [[Dave Thomas (author)|Dave Thomas]] in their book ''[[The Pragmatic Programmer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Andrew |last2=Thomas |first2=David |title=The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master |date=1999 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=USA |isbn=978-0201616224 |pages=320 |edition=1 |url=https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; They apply it quite broadly to include "[[database schema]]s, [[test plan]]s, the [[software build|build]] system, even [[software documentation| documentation]]".&lt;ref name='HuntThomasBroadInfo'&gt; {{cite web

|author=Dave Thomas, interviewed by Bill Venners
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in [[Synchronization|sync]]. Besides using [[method (computer science)|methods]] and [[subroutine]]s in their code, Thomas and Hunt rely on [[Automatic programming|code generators]], automatic build systems, and [[scripting language]]s to observe the DRY principle across layers.

==DRY vs WET solutions==
Violations of DRY are typically referred to as WET solutions, which is commonly taken to stand for either "write everything twice", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time".  WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with, for example, adding a comment field on a form in a web application. The text string "comment" might be repeated in the label, the HTML tag, in a read function name, a private variable, database DDL, queries, and so on. A DRY approach eliminates that redundancy by using frameworks that reduce or eliminate all those edit tasks excepting the most important one, leaving the extensibility of adding new knowledge variables in one place.&lt;ref name='DryIsForLosers'&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] arises in the study of the [[Lorenz Oscillator]], a dynamical system.]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''dynamical system''' is a system in which a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] describes the [[time]] dependence of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[Manifold|geometrical space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock [[pendulum]], [[fluid dynamics|the flow of water in a pipe]], and [[population dynamics|the number of fish each springtime in a lake]].

At any given time, a dynamical system has a [[State (controls)|state]] given by a [[tuple]] of [[real numbers]] (a [[vector space|vector]]) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate [[state space]] (a geometrical [[manifold]]). The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a function that describes what future states follow from the current state.  Often the function is [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], that is, for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strogatz |first=S. H. |year=2001 |title=Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: with Applications to Physics, Biology and Chemistry |location= |publisher=Perseus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Katok |first2=B. |last2=Hasselblatt |title=Introduction to the Modern Theory of Dynamical Systems |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-34187-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some systems are [[stochastic system|stochastic]], in that random events also affect the evolution of the state variables.

In [[physics]], a '''dynamical system''' is described as a "particle or ensemble of particles whose state varies over time and thus obeys differential equations involving time derivatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/subjects/dynamical-systems|publisher=Springer Nature|accessdate= 17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a prediction about the system’s future behavior, an analytical solution of such equations or their integration over time through computer simulation is realized.

The study of dynamical systems is the focus of [[dynamical systems theory]], which has applications to a wide variety of fields such as mathematics, physics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melby|first1=P.|last2=et.al.|title=Dynamics of Self-Adjusting Systems With Noise|journal=Chaos 15|date=2005|doi=10.1063/1.1953147|bibcode=2005Chaos..15c3902M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gintautas|first1=V.|last2=et.al.|title=Resonant forcing of select degrees of freedom of multidimensional chaotic map dynamics|journal=J.

Dynamical systems are a fundamental part of [[chaos theory]], [[logistic map]] dynamics, [[bifurcation theory]], the [[self-assembly]] process, and the [[edge of chaos]] concept.

==Overview==
The concept of a dynamical system has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]].  There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is an implicit relation that gives the state of the system for only a short time into the future.  (The relation is either a [[differential equation]], [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]] or other [[Time scale calculus|time scale]].)  To determine the state for all future times requires iterating the relation many times&amp;mdash;each advancing time a small step.  The iteration procedure is referred to as ''solving the system'' or ''integrating the system''. If the system can be solved, given an initial point it is possible to determine all its future positions, a collection of points known as a ''[[trajectory]]'' or ''[[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]''.

Before the advent of [[computers]], finding an orbit required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could be accomplished only for a small class of dynamical systems.  Numerical methods implemented on electronic computing machines have simplified the task of determining the orbits of a dynamical system.

For simple dynamical systems, knowing the trajectory is often sufficient, but most dynamical systems are too complicated to be understood in terms of individual trajectories.  The difficulties arise because:
* The systems studied may only be known approximately&amp;mdash;the parameters of the system may not be known precisely or terms may be missing from the equations.  The approximations used bring into question the validity or relevance of numerical solutions.  To address these questions several notions of stability have been introduced in the study of dynamical systems, such as [[Lyapunov stability]] or [[structural stability]].  The stability of the dynamical system implies that there is a class of models or initial conditions for which the trajectories would be equivalent. The operation for comparing orbits to establish their [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] changes with the different notions of stability.
* The type of trajectory may be more important than one particular trajectory.  Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class.  Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the qualitative study of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. [[Linear dynamical system]]s and [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem|systems that have two numbers describing a state]] are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.
* The behavior of trajectories as a function of a parameter may be what is needed for an application. As a parameter is varied, the dynamical systems may have [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation points]] where the qualitative behavior of the dynamical system changes.  For example, it may go from having only periodic motions to apparently erratic behavior, as in the [[Turbulence|transition to turbulence of a fluid]].
* The trajectories of the system may appear erratic, as if random.  In these cases it may be necessary to compute averages using one very long trajectory or many different trajectories.  The averages are well defined for [[ergodic theory|ergodic systems]] and a more detailed understanding has been worked out for [[Anosov diffeomorphism|hyperbolic systems]]. Understanding the probabilistic aspects of dynamical systems has helped establish the foundations of [[statistical mechanics]] and of [[chaos theory|chaos]].

==History==

Many people regard [[Henri Poincaré]] as the founder of dynamical systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Philip. "Poincaré, celestial mechanics, dynamical-systems theory and "chaos"." ''Physics Reports'' 193.3 (1990): 137-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]], which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

[[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamic system.

In 1913, [[George David Birkhoff]] proved Poincaré's "[[Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem|Last Geometric Theorem]]", a special case of the [[three-body problem]], a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his ''[http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll9/ Dynamical Systems]''Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the [[ergodic theorem]]. Combining insights from [[physics]] on the [[ergodic hypothesis]] with [[measure theory]], this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of [[statistical mechanics]]. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.

[[Stephen Smale]] made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

[[Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky]] developed [[Sharkovsky's theorem]] on the periods of [[discrete dynamical system]]s in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the [[real line]] has a [[periodic point]] of period&amp;nbsp;3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

==Basic definitions==
{{Main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
A dynamical system is a [[manifold]] ''M'' called the phase (or state) space endowed with a family of smooth evolution functions Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; that for any element of ''t'' ∈ ''T'', the time, map a point of the [[phase space]] back into the phase space.  The notion of smoothness changes with applications and the type of manifold.  There are several choices for the set&amp;nbsp;''T''.  When ''T'' is taken to be the reals, the dynamical system is called a ''[[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]''; and if ''T'' is restricted to the non-negative reals, then the dynamical system is a ''semi-flow''. When ''T'' is taken to be the integers, it is a ''cascade'' or a ''map''; and the restriction to the non-negative integers is a ''semi-cascade''.

=== Examples ===
The evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is often the solution of a ''differential equation of motion''

:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = v(x). &lt;/math&gt;

The equation gives the time derivative, represented by the dot, of a trajectory ''x''(''t'') on the phase space starting at some point&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[vector field]] ''v''(''x'') is a smooth function that at every point of the phase space ''M'' provides the velocity vector of the dynamical system at that point. (These vectors are not vectors in the phase space&amp;nbsp;''M'', but in the [[tangent space]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M'' of the point&amp;nbsp;''x''.)  Given a smooth Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, an autonomous vector field can be derived from it.

There is no need for higher order derivatives in the equation, nor for time dependence in ''v''(''x'') because these can be eliminated by considering systems of higher dimensions.  Other types of [[differential equations]] can be used to define the evolution rule:

: &lt;math&gt; G(x, \dot{x}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is an example of an equation that arises from the modeling of mechanical systems with complicated constraints.

The differential equations determining the evolution function Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; are often [[ordinary differential equation]]s; in this case the phase space ''M'' is a finite dimensional manifold.  Many of the concepts in dynamical systems can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds&amp;mdash;those that are locally [[Banach space]]s&amp;mdash;in which case the differential equations are [[partial differential equation]]s.  In the late 20th century the dynamical system perspective to partial differential equations started gaining popularity.

==Linear dynamical systems==
{{Main|Linear dynamical system}}
Linear dynamical systems can be solved in terms of simple functions and the behavior of all orbits classified.  In a linear system the phase space is the ''N''-dimensional Euclidean space, so any point in phase space can be represented by a vector with ''N'' numbers.  The analysis of linear systems is possible because they satisfy a [[superposition principle]]: if ''u''(''t'') and ''w''(''t'') satisfy the differential equation for the vector field (but not necessarily the initial condition), then so will ''u''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''w''(''t'').

===Flows===
For a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]], the vector field Φ(''x'') is an [[affine transformation|affine]] function of the position in the phase space, that is,
:  &lt;math&gt; \dot{x} = \phi(x) = A x + b,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix, ''b'' a vector of numbers and ''x'' the position vector.  The solution to this system can be found by using the superposition principle (linearity).
The case ''b''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 with ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is just a straight line in the direction of&amp;nbsp;''b'':

: &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_1) = x_1 + b t. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' is zero and ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 the origin is an equilibrium (or singular) point of the flow, that is, if ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, then the orbit remains there.
For other initial conditions, the equation of motion is given by the [[matrix exponential|exponential of a matrix]]: for an initial point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

:  &lt;math&gt;\Phi^t(x_0) = e^{t A} x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

When ''b'' = 0, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' determine the structure of the phase space.  From the eigenvalues and the [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' it is possible to determine if an initial point will converge or diverge to the equilibrium point at the origin.

The distance between two different initial conditions in the case ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 will change exponentially in most cases, either converging exponentially fast towards a point, or diverging exponentially fast.  Linear systems display sensitive dependence on initial conditions in the case of divergence. For nonlinear systems this is one of the (necessary but not sufficient) conditions for [[chaos theory|chaotic behavior]].

===Maps===
A [[Discrete-time dynamical system|discrete-time]], [[Affine transformation|affine]] dynamical system has the form of a [[matrix difference equation]]:
: &lt;math&gt; x_{n+1} =  A x_n + b, &lt;/math&gt;
with ''A'' a matrix and ''b'' a vector.  As in the continuous case, the change of coordinates ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''A'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' removes the term ''b'' from the equation. In the new [[coordinate system]], the origin is a fixed point of the map and the solutions are of the linear system ''A''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
The solutions for the map are no longer curves, but points that hop in the phase space.  The orbits are organized in curves, or fibers, which are collections of points that map into themselves under the action of the map.

As in the continuous case, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of ''A'' determine the structure of phase space.  For example, if ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector of ''A'', with a real eigenvalue smaller than one, then the straight lines given by the points along ''α''&amp;nbsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''α''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''R''', is an invariant curve of the map. Points in this straight line run into the fixed point.

There are also many [[List of chaotic maps|other discrete dynamical systems]].

The qualitative properties of dynamical systems do not change under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative):   a ''singular point'' of the vector field (a point where&amp;nbsp;''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a ''periodic orbit'' is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop.  It is in the neighborhood of singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the qualitative study of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.

===Rectification===
A flow in most small patches of the phase space can be made very simple.  If ''y'' is a point where the vector field ''v''(''y'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, then there is a change of coordinates for a region around ''y'' where the vector field becomes a series of parallel vectors of the same magnitude.  This is known as the rectification theorem.

The ''rectification theorem'' says that away from [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]] the dynamics of a point in a small patch is a straight line.  The patch can sometimes be enlarged by stitching several patches together, and when this works out in the whole phase space ''M'' the dynamical system is ''integrable''.  In most cases the patch cannot be extended to the entire phase space.  There may be singular points in the vector field (where ''v''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0); or the patches may become smaller and smaller as some point is approached. The more subtle reason is a global constraint, where the trajectory starts out in a patch, and after visiting a series of other patches comes back to the original one. If the next time the orbit loops around phase space in a different way, then it is impossible to rectify the vector field in the whole series of patches.

===Near periodic orbits===
In general, in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit the rectification theorem cannot be used.  Poincaré developed an approach that transforms the analysis near a periodic orbit to the analysis of a map. Pick a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the orbit γ and consider the points in phase space in that neighborhood that are perpendicular to ''v''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).  These points are a [[Poincaré section]]  ''S''(''γ'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), of the orbit. The flow now defines a map, the [[Poincaré map]] ''F''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''S''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''S'', for points starting in ''S'' and returning to&amp;nbsp;''S''.  Not all these points will take the same amount of time to come back, but the times will be close to the time it takes&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

The intersection of the periodic orbit with the Poincaré section is a fixed point of the Poincaré map ''F''. By a translation, the point can be assumed to be at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The Taylor series of the map is ''F''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;O(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so a change of coordinates ''h'' can only be expected to simplify ''F'' to its linear part

: &lt;math&gt; h^{-1} \circ F \circ h(x) = J \cdot x.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the conjugation equation.  Finding conditions for this equation to hold has been one of the major tasks of research in dynamical systems.  Poincaré first approached it assuming all functions to be analytic and in the process discovered the non-resonant condition.  If ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''ν''&lt;/sub&gt; are the eigenvalues of ''J'' they will be resonant if one eigenvalue is an integer linear combination of two or more of the others.  As terms of the form ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ndash; ∑ (multiples of other eigenvalues) occurs in the denominator of the terms for the function ''h'', the non-resonant condition is also known as the small divisor problem.

===Conjugation results===
The results on the existence of a solution to the conjugation equation depend on the eigenvalues of ''J'' and the degree of smoothness required from ''h''.  As ''J'' does not need to have any special symmetries, its eigenvalues will typically be complex numbers.  When the eigenvalues of ''J'' are not in the unit circle, the dynamics near the fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of ''F'' is called ''[[Hyperbolic fixed point|hyperbolic]]'' and when the eigenvalues are on the unit circle and complex, the dynamics is called ''elliptic''.

In the hyperbolic case, the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]] gives the conditions for the existence of a continuous function that maps the neighborhood of the fixed point of the map to the linear map ''J''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''x''. The hyperbolic case is also ''structurally stable''.  Small changes in the vector field will only produce small changes in the Poincaré map and these small changes will reflect in small changes in the position of the eigenvalues of ''J'' in the complex plane, implying that the map is still hyperbolic.

The [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM)]] theorem gives the behavior near an elliptic point.

==Bifurcation theory==
{{Main|Bifurcation theory}}
When the evolution map Φ&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (or the [[vector field]] it is derived from) depends on a parameter μ, the structure of the phase space will also depend on this parameter. Small changes may produce no qualitative changes in the [[phase space]] until a special value ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is reached.  At this point the phase space changes qualitatively and the dynamical system is said to have gone through a bifurcation.

Bifurcation theory considers a structure in phase space (typically a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], a periodic orbit, or an invariant [[torus]]) and studies its behavior as a function of the parameter&amp;nbsp;''μ''. At the bifurcation point the structure may change its stability, split into new structures, or merge with other structures.  By using Taylor series approximations of the maps and an understanding of the differences that may be eliminated by a change of coordinates, it is possible to catalog the bifurcations of dynamical systems.

The bifurcations of a hyperbolic fixed point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of a system family ''F&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be characterized by the [[eigenvalues]] of the first derivative of the system ''DF''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of ''DF&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. For more information, see the main article on [[Bifurcation theory]].

Some bifurcations can lead to very complicated structures in phase space. For example, the [[Ruelle&amp;ndash;Takens scenario]] describes how a periodic orbit bifurcates into a torus and the torus into a [[strange attractor]]. In another example, [[Bifurcation diagram|Feigenbaum period-doubling]] describes how a stable periodic orbit goes through a series of [[period-doubling bifurcation]]s.

==Ergodic systems==
{{Main|Ergodic theory}}
In many dynamical systems, it is possible to choose the coordinates of the system so that the volume (really a ν-dimensional volume) in phase space is invariant.  This happens for mechanical systems derived from Newton's laws as long as the coordinates are the position and the momentum and the volume is measured in units of (position)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(momentum).  The flow takes points of a subset ''A'' into the points Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') and invariance of the phase space means that
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{vol} (A) = \mathrm{vol} ( \Phi^t(A) ). &lt;/math&gt;
In the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]], given a coordinate it is possible to derive the appropriate (generalized) momentum such that the associated volume is preserved by the flow.  The volume is said to be computed by the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville measure]].

In a Hamiltonian system, not all possible configurations of position and momentum can be reached from an initial condition. Because of energy conservation, only the states with the same energy as the initial condition are accessible.  The states with the same energy form an energy shell Ω, a sub-manifold of the phase space. The volume of the energy shell, computed using the Liouville measure, is preserved under evolution.

For systems where the volume is preserved by the flow, Poincaré discovered the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|recurrence theorem]]: Assume the phase space has a finite Liouville volume and let ''F'' be a phase space volume-preserving map and ''A'' a subset of the phase space.  Then almost every point of ''A'' returns to ''A'' infinitely often.  The Poincaré recurrence theorem was used by [[Ernst Zermelo|Zermelo]] to object to [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s derivation of the increase in entropy in a dynamical system of colliding atoms.

One of the questions raised by Boltzmann's work was the possible equality between time averages and space averages, what he called the [[ergodic hypothesis]].  The hypothesis states that the length of time a typical trajectory spends in a region ''A'' is vol(''A'')/vol(Ω).

The ergodic hypothesis turned out not to be the essential property needed for the development of [[statistical mechanics]] and a series of other ergodic-like properties were introduced to capture the relevant aspects of physical systems.  [[Bernard Koopman|Koopman]] approached the study of ergodic systems by the use of [[functional analysis]].  An observable ''a'' is a function that to each point of the phase space associates a number (say instantaneous pressure, or average height).  The value of an observable can be computed at another time by using the evolution function φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;.  This introduces an operator ''U''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[transfer operator]],

: &lt;math&gt; (U^t a)(x) = a(\Phi^{-t}(x)). &lt;/math&gt;

By studying the spectral properties of the linear operator ''U'' it becomes possible to classify the ergodic properties of&amp;nbsp;Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In using the Koopman approach of considering the action of the flow on an observable function, the finite-dimensional nonlinear problem involving Φ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; gets mapped into an infinite-dimensional linear problem involving&amp;nbsp;''U''.

The Liouville measure restricted to the energy surface Ω is the basis for the averages computed in [[Statistical mechanics|equilibrium statistical mechanics]].  An average in time along a trajectory is equivalent to an average in space computed with the  [[Statistical mechanics#Canonical ensemble|Boltzmann factor exp(&amp;minus;β''H'')]].  This idea has been generalized by Sinai, Bowen, and Ruelle (SRB) to a larger class of dynamical systems that includes dissipative systems. [[SRB measure]]s replace the Boltzmann factor and they are defined on attractors of chaotic systems.

===Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaos===
{{Main|Chaos theory}}
Simple nonlinear dynamical systems and even piecewise linear systems can exhibit a completely unpredictable behavior, which might seem to be random, despite the fact that they are fundamentally deterministic. This seemingly unpredictable behavior has been called ''[[chaos theory|chaos]]''. [[Anosov diffeomorphism|Hyperbolic systems]] are precisely defined dynamical systems that exhibit the properties ascribed to chaotic systems.  In hyperbolic systems the tangent space perpendicular to a trajectory can be well separated into two parts: one with the points that converge towards the orbit (the ''stable manifold'') and another of the points that diverge from the orbit (the ''unstable manifold'').

This branch of [[mathematics]] deals with the long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a [[steady state]] in the long term, and if so, what are the possible [[attractor]]s?" or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

Note that the chaotic behavior of complex systems is not the issue. [[Meteorology]] has been known for years to involve complex&amp;mdash;even chaotic&amp;mdash;behavior. Chaos theory has been so surprising because chaos can be found within almost trivial systems. The [[logistic map]] is only a second-degree polynomial; the [[horseshoe map]] is piecewise linear.

=== Geometrical definition ===
A dynamical system is the tuple &lt;math&gt; \langle \mathcal{M}, f , \mathcal{T}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; a manifold (locally a Banach space or Euclidean space), &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; the domain for time (non-negative reals, the integers, ...) and ''f'' an evolution rule ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;) such that ''f&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] of the manifold to itself. So, f is a mapping of the time-domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; into the space of diffeomorphisms of the manifold to itself. In other terms, ''f''(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, for every time ''t'' in the domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; .

=== Measure theoretical definition ===
{{main|Measure-preserving dynamical system}}
A dynamical system may be defined formally, as a measure-preserving transformation of a [[sigma-algebra]], the quadruplet (''X'', Σ, μ, τ). Here, ''X'' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], and Σ is a [[sigma-algebra]] on ''X'', so that the pair (''X'', Σ) is a measurable space. μ is a finite [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the sigma-algebra, so that the triplet (''X'', Σ, μ) is a [[measure space|probability space]]. A map τ: ''X'' → ''X'' is said to be [[measurable function|Σ-measurable]] if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\tau^{-1}\sigma \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A map τ is said to '''preserve the measure''' if and only if, for every σ ∈ Σ, one has &lt;math&gt;\mu(\tau^{-1}\sigma ) = \mu(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;. Combining the above, a map τ is said to be a '''measure-preserving transformation of ''X'' ''', if it is a map from ''X'' to itself, it is Σ-measurable, and is measure-preserving. The quadruple (''X'', Σ, μ, τ), for such a τ, is then defined to be a '''dynamical system'''.

The map τ embodies the time evolution of the dynamical system. Thus, for discrete dynamical systems the [[iterated function|iterates]] &lt;math&gt;\tau^n=\tau \circ \tau \circ \cdots\circ\tau&lt;/math&gt; for integer ''n'' are studied. For continuous dynamical systems, the map τ is understood to be a finite time evolution map and the construction is more complicated.

Dynamical systems are defined over a single independent variable, usually thought of as time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple independent variables and are therefore called [[multidimensional systems]].

'''Embedded feminism''' is the attempt of state authorities to legitimize an intervention in a conflict by co-opting feminist discourses and instrumentalizing feminist activists and groups for their own agenda. This term was introduced in the analysis of the US-led [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]], but can also be applied to several historical examples where women's rights were used as justification and legitimization of Western [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nachtigall|first1=Andrea|title=Embedded Feminism|journal=Peripherie|date=2014|volume=133|issue=35|pages=90–93|doi=10.3224/peripherie.v34i133.22464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Originally, the Canadian gender researcher Krista Hunt developed the [[conceptual framework]] of embedded feminism to describe the gendered nature of the [[Afghanistan War (2001-present)|US-led invasion of Afghanistan]] in 2001 and the practice of the US government to justify the [[War on Terror]] in the eyes of the public.
Hunt defines the concept as the "incorporation of feminist discourse and feminist activists into political projects that claim to serve the interests of women, but ultimately subordinate and/or subvert that goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Krista|editor1-last=Hunt|editor1-first=Krista|editor2-last=Rygiel|editor2-first=Kim|title=(En)Gendering the War on Terror. War Stories and Camouflaged Politics|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|location=Hampshire|pages=51–71|chapter=‘Embedded Feminism’ and the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hunt coined the term embedded feminism referring to the "[[embedded journalism]]" or "embedded media" approach of the US Department of Defense which became prominent in the media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Defense|title=Public Affairs Guidance for Embedded Reporters|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/dod/embed.html|publisher=Office of Freedom of Information|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government attached journalists, photographers, and camera people to military units and granted them unprecedented access to the battle frontline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jeppesen|first1=Helle|title=To Embed or Not To Embed - The Debate Over War Reporting|url=http://dw.com/p/DzJY|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=DW|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although "[[embedded journalism]]" allowed the public to get an exclusive look at the situation in Iraq, this practice was regarded as problematic, as it could undermine the independent reporting and promote the preferences of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wells|first1=Matt|title=Embedded Reporters 'Sanitised' Iraq War|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/06/broadcasting.Iraqandthemedia|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "far-reaching process of appropriating and subverting feminism through appeals to women's rights"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Krista|editor1-last=Hunt|editor1-first=Krista|editor2-last=Rygiel|editor2-first=Kim|title=(En)Gendering the War on Terror. War Stories and Camouflaged Politics|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|location=Hampshire|pages=51–71|chapter=‘Embedded Feminism’ and the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is embedded feminism is different from simple co-optation practices by state authorities in so far as it goes beyond the absorption "of the meanings of the original concepts to fit into the prevailing political priorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lippe|first1=Berit von der|title=The White Woman's Burden: "Feminist" War Rhetoric and the Phenomenon of Co-optation|journal=Nordic Journal of Feminist and Gender Research|date=2012|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–36|doi=10.1080/08038740.2011.618811|hdl=11250/93478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications of embedded feminism in the fight for women's rights ==

=== Historical examples ===
Krista Hunt argues that appeals to women's liberation have been embedded in political projects for centuries to mobilize feminists and their discourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enloe|first1=Cynthia|title=Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics|date=1989|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Linkogle|first1=Stephanie|editor1-last=Rowbotham|editor1-first=Sheila|editor2-last=Linkogle|editor2-first=Stephanie|title=Women Resist Globalization: Mobilizing for Livelihood and Rights|date=2001|publisher=Zed Books|location=New York|pages=118–133|chapter=Nicaraguan Women in the Age of Globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tetrault|first1=Mary Ann|editor1-last=Peterson|editor1-first=V. Spike|title=Gendered States: Feminist (Re)Visions of International Relations Theory|date=1992|publisher=Lynne Rienner|location=Boulder|pages=99–121|chapter=Women and Revolution: A Framework for Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A large body of feminist literature has analyzed the gender-related dimensions of (post-) colonial projects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abu-Lughod|first1=Lila|title=Do Muslim Women Really Need Saving? Anthropological Reflections on Cultural Relativism and Its Others|journal=American Anthropologist|date=2002|volume=104|issue=3|pages=783–790|doi=10.1525/aa.2002.104.3.783}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahmed|first1=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|date=1992|publisher=Yale Univ.

Such rescue narratives generally presuppose a homogeneity of women as an oppressed group, as showed in the work of Chandra Mohanty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohanty|first1=Chandra|title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses|journal=Feminist Review|date=1988|volume=30|pages=61–88|doi=10.1057/fr.1988.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put into play the [[Orientalism|orientalized]] nature of the seemingly dangerous "brown man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|date=1978|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, feminism which was incorporated in the [[Modernization theory|modernization]] and civilization projects of imperial countries is argued to have helped strengthening [[colonialism]] and [[patriarchy]] instead of promoting women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Krista|editor1-last=Hunt|editor1-first=Krista|editor2-last=Rygiel|editor2-first=Kim|title=(En)Gendering the War on Terror. War Stories and Camouflaged Politics|date=2006|publisher=Ashgate|location=Hampshire|pages=51–71|chapter=‘Embedded Feminism’ and the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Feminists also claim that feminist activists and their discourses have been instrumentalized for nationalist projects. During the [[History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser era]] in Egypt for example, feminists are said to have played a major role in helping create a sense of cohesion and bonding and therefore directly contributed to the emergence of a national identity during and after the struggle for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Ali|first1=Nadje|title=Secularism, Gender and the State in the Middle East. The Egyptian Women's Movement|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, women remained mostly absent from the public sphere of politics once the project succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hafez|first1=Sherine|title=An Islam of Her Own. Reconsidering Religion and Secularism in Women's Islamic Movements|date=2011|publisher=New York Univ. Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== The War on Terror ===
The history of the war on terrorism throughout the IR realm consistently showcased a male-stream discipline and a hyper-masculine war hero narrative. In other words, the story is narrated by these men, who hold high positions of power and are fixated to exemplify their heroic qualities to shield women from harm and collide with the world’s difficulties&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140)&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, according to the former US President, George W. Bush, the central goal of the terrorists is the brutal oppression of women…that is the reason this great nation, with our friends and allies, will not rest until we bring them all to justice&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140)&lt;/ref&gt; . This rallying cry by the Bush administration is exactly the narrative that is at question. The time-honored tradition of the good guys defeating the bad guys and protecting racialized women serves to reinforce patriotism and justify violence both abroad and at home. However, how does one exemplify “the bad guys”?  By using a gendered lens and looking at the war of terror through a gendered perspective, a simple rallying cry has far more complexities. For instance, there is a power dynamic at play here involving two opposing parties. There is the Western men and women who are deemed to be the saviors. Then there are the Afghan women who needs saving. What does this do? This creates a subtle social construct that the war on terror has created different kinds of men and women based on race, religion and nationality&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140)&lt;/ref&gt; . Having said that, a gendered lens does ignore specific factors. It ignores the power dynamic of liberated white western women against their oppressed Afghan women. Basically, in a war, your race and nationality come heavily into play when it comes to who is deemed to be more liberated.  It ignores the historical colonial justification for invasion by proclaiming racialized men are harmful to racialized women. Feminists analyzed Bush’s rallying cry and found similarities to the white men knowing what’s right and saving the racialized women because of perceptions about the racialized men. It ignores the reinforced resistance to women’s rights, whereas men see it as Western imposition. In a war situation, when a Western country tries to help an oppressed nation, it is seen as western imposition because it is as if “the west knows best”, without even being apart or living in an oppressed nation and gives the perception that anything the West does (even empowering women) is treated as imposition.  It ignores the obscurity of the reality that white Western women are still being oppressed by the same powers that are trying to liberate Afghan women. Finally, it ignores the overarching point of all these factors which is the creation of a divide and conquer situation of women while also initiating solidarity of all women&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140)&lt;/ref&gt; . In other words, what all these factors mean is the examination of race, class, nationality, religion and sexuality, we notice factors that were passive such as progressing onward with political agendas that are traditional, old testament and problematic while also trying to play the good guy by silencing other related key issues. In conclusion, Gender has become a topic that is heavily scrutinized but also heavily appreciated and even in the most traditional of scenarios, a gender lens/perspective is very much needed to tackle the real issue of IR.

In 2001, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] began expressing their concerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bush|first1=George W.|title=State of the Union Address|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/21/september11.usa13|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Taliban treatment of women|situation of women]] under the [[Taliban]] regime. According to Hunt, it invoked the struggle for women's rights and women's liberation as a rational to justify the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|invasion of Afghanistan]]. This increased gender awareness can be interpreted as part of a [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] strategy which conflated the [[War on Terror]] with the fight for women's rights as a proxy for universal human rights. In the eyes of many feminists, the rescue of oppressed women from the [[Taliban]] became the powerful normative legitimation of the invasion which obtained broad public approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nachtigall|first1=Andrea|last2=Bewernitz|first2=Torsten|editor1-last=Engels|editor1-first=Bettina|editor2-last=Gayer|editor2-first=Corinna|title=Geschlechterverhältnisse, Frieden und Konflikt.

The doubts in the government's commitment to further women's rights through war arose due to its lack of interest before [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Ali|first1=Nadje|title=Embedded Feminism - Frauenrechte als Legimitation für Krieg|url=http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/node/21335|website=Heinrich Böll Stiftung|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after the terror attacks, that politicians in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Colin|title=Remarks at Reception to Mark International Women's Day|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/remarks/2002/8691.htm|website=U.

Despite its usual non-violent stance, the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]] (FMF) supporter the policies of the Bush administration and is therefore regarded as one of the most vocal feminist supporters embedded in the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russo|first1=Ann|title=The Feminist Majority Foundation's Campaign to Stop Gender Apartheid.

Bush|Bush]]'s political project was strongly criticized by other NGOs and the critical public because their role was considered to be legitimizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Elizabeth|title=An Open Letter to the Editors of Ms. Magazine|url=http://www.rawa.org/tours/elizabeth_miller_letter.htm|website=RAWA|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolhatkar|first1=Sonali|last2=Rawi|first2=Mariam|title=Why Is a Leading Feminist Organization Lending Its Name to Support Escalation in Afghanistan?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/141165/why_is_a_leading_feminist_organization_lending_its_name_to_support_escalation_in_afghanistan|website=AlterNet|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayden|first1=Tom|title=Pentagon Enlists Feminists for War Aims|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-hayden/pentagon-enlists-feminist_b_238715.html|accessdate=30 October 2016|agency=The Huffington Post|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hunt sees embedded feminism as a concept that was used to advance the engendered war story of the Bush administration that the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|invasion of Afghanistan]] could liberate Afghan women. It has further created a division between feminist groups that supported the war and those groups that refused to get involved in the usurpation of feminism for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wibben|first1=Annick T. R.|editor1-last=Wibben|editor1-first=Annick T. R.|title=Researching War: Feminist Methods, Ethics and Politics|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London &amp; New York|chapter=Female Engagement Teams in Afghanistan. Exploring the ‘War on Terror’ Narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt; A division also emerged between "Western" feminists who strived to save the "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" women from an [[Orientalism|orientalised]] enemy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Said|first1=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|date=1978|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Afghan feminists who criticized the notion that war could liberate them.

== Hegemonic Western feminism and post-colonial critique ==
Hunt notes that there is a striking similarity between the logic of embedded feminism in colonialist projects and the [[War on Terror]]. Both are inherently [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] and present the West as culturally and normatively superior to the "unmodern" Eastern societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Said|first1=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|date=1978|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rationale would give the West a prerogative to intervene and rescue the "monolithic group" of [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mohanty|first1=Chandra|title=Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses|journal=Feminist Review|date=1988|volume=30|pages=61–88|doi=10.1057/fr.1988.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have no [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] on their own. [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Spivak]]'s famous post-colonial critique of the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized subjects in "Can the Subaltern speak?" condenses this relationship to the strategy of "white men saving brown women from brown men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spivak|first1=Gayatri Chakravorty|editor1-last=Nelson|editor1-first=Cary|editor2-last=Grossberg|editor2-first=Lawrence|title=Marxism and the Interpretation of Culture|date=1988|publisher=Univ. of Illinois Press|location=Urbana &amp; Chicago|pages=271–313|chapter=Can the Subaltern Speak?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis can also be applied to the seemingly neo-imperialist strategy that the US government was pursuing by [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] [[Taliban]] men in Afghanistan as a danger to women who were presented as victims in need of help from the West.
Characteristic for Western [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] feminism was the disregard of Western actors for the opinions of Afghan women's groups who argued that a war would certainly have a negative impact on women and fuel [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Afghan Women's Mission|title=US-Backed Fundamentalists in Afghan War No Different From 9/11 Perpetrators|url=http://www.afghanwomensmission.org/2011/09/us-backed-fundamentalists-in-afghan-war-no-different-from-911-perpetrators/|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan|title=Taliban Should be Overthrown by the Uprising of Afghan Nation|url=http://www.rawa.org/us-strikes.htm|website=RAWA|accessdate=30 October 2016|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolhatkar|first1=Sonali|title=The Impact of U.S. Intervention on Afghan Women's Rights|journal=Berkeley Journal of Gender, Law and Justice|date=2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=12–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Bush's agenda was in fact interpreted as an attack on Islamic values and resulted in a backlash from the conservative forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Christina|title=Responding to Orientalist Feminism|journal=Australian Feminist Studies|date=2010|volume=25|issue=66|pages=433–439|doi=10.1080/08164649.2010.525211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hegemony|Hegemonic]] feminism also tends to reproduce binary gender roles, especially in the visual representation of women and children as victims of war or oppression in the media. [[Cynthia Enloe]] has called this conflation of women and children as victimized subjects "womenandchildren", a single [[Trope (literature)|trope]] that is being invoked in [[Patriarchy|patriarchic]] narratives to support state security interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enloe|first1=Cynthia|title=Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics|date=1989|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley|title-link=Bananas, Beaches and Bases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextualisation ==
The unique nature of embedded feminism as a state strategy is not just the argumentation based on the representation of women and children as victims but the conjunction of this discourse with the struggle for women's rights. 
Hunt's concept has made an impact on gender-related conflict research and has been applied to the wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Ali|first1=Nadje|last2=Pratt|first2=Nicola|title=What Kind of Liberation: Women and the Occupation of Iraq|date=2009|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nachtigall|first1=Andrea|last2=Bewernitz|first2=Torsten|editor1-last=Engels|editor1-first=Bettina|editor2-last=Gayer|editor2-first=Corinna|title=Geschlechterverhältnisse, Frieden und Konflikt. Feministische Denkanstöße für die Friedens- und Konfliktforschung|date=2011|publisher=Nomos|location=Baden-Baden|pages=27–46|chapter=Von ‚FrauenundKindern' zu ‚Embedded Feminism'. Frauen(rechte) als Legitimation für militärische Intervention in den Medien – Variationen einer Legitimationsfigur zwischen Kosovo-, Afghanistan- und Irakkrieg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Embedded feminism can also be used in other contexts such as neo-liberal [[globalization]] and can be applied to several other policy fields where pseudo-feminist arguments and feminist groups are misused to legitimize a state-led action or to construct an alternative story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4653">'''Empathy-altruism''' is a form of [[altruism]] based on feelings for others.

The [[social exchange theory]] states that altruism does not exist unless benefits to the helper outweigh the costs. [[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]] holds that people help others in need out of genuine concern for the well-being of the other person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |last2=Wilson |first2=T. D. |last3=Akert |first3=A. M. |year=2005 |title=Social Psychology |edition=5th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-178686-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key ingredient to helping is "[[empathic concern]]".  According to his {{'}}'''''empathy-altruism''' '''hypothesis'''''{{'}}, if someone feels [[empathy]] towards another person, they will help them, regardless of what they can gain from it (1991). An alternative hypothesis that exists is {{'}}'''''empathy-joy'''''{{'}}, which states a person helps because they find pleasure at seeing another person experience relief (2008). When they do not feel empathy, the social exchange theory takes control.

==Evidence==
Debate over whether other-helping behavior is motivated by self- or other interest has raged over the last 20 years. The prime actors in this debate are [[Daniel Batson]] arguing for empathy-altruism and [[Robert Cialdini]] arguing for [[self-interest]].
However, Batson recognized that people sometimes helped out of selfish reasons.  He and his team were interested in finding ways to distinguish between motives. In one experiment, students were asked to listen to tapes from a radio program. One of the interviews was with a woman named Carol, who talked about her bad car accident in which both of her legs were broken, her struggles and how behind she was becoming in class. Students who were listening to this particular interview were given a letter asking the student to share lecture notes and meet with her. The experimenters changed the level of empathy by telling one group to try to focus on how she was feeling (high empathy level) and the other group not to be concerned with that (low empathy level).  The experimenters also varied the cost of not helping: the high cost group was told that Carol would be in their psychology class after returning to school and the low cost group believed she would finish the class at home. The results confirmed the empathy-altruism hypothesis: those in the high empathy group were almost equally as likely to help her in either circumstance, while the low empathy group helped out of self-interest. Seeing her in class every day made them feel guilty if they did not help (Batson &amp; Toi, 1982&lt;!--Not in reference list--&gt;). 

===Countering hypotheses===
The authors of "Five Studies Testing Two New Egoistic Alternatives to the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis" set out to show that empathy motivates other-regarding helping behavior not out of self-interest but out of true interest in the well-being of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Batson |first=C. D. |last2=Dyck |first2=J. L. |last3=Brandt |first3=J. R. |last4=Batson |first4=J. G. |last5=Powell |first5=A. L. |year=1988 |title=Five Studies Testing Two New Egoistic Alternatives to the Empathy-Altruism Hypothesis |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=52–77 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.1.52 |pmid=3418490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two hypotheses that counter the empathy-altruism hypothesis are addressed in this article:
*1) Empathy Specific Reward: Empathy triggers the need for social reward which can be gained by helping.
*2) Empathy Specific Punishment: Empathy triggers the fear of social punishment which can be avoided by helping.

:''Not to be confused are [[UFO religion]]s or [[ancient astronaut]] theories that posit that historical religious scripture or mythology was inspired by visits from extraterrestrials.''
:''"Exotheism" is a fictional denomination in the [[Vampire: The Requiem]] role-playing game.''

The term "'''exotheology'''" was coined in the 1960s or early 1970s&lt;ref&gt;An early attestation is the title "A Jewish Exotheology" in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and Doubt: Studies in Traditional Jewish Thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; for the examination of [[theology|theological]] issues as they pertain to [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial intelligence]]. It is primarily concerned with either conjecture about possible theological beliefs that extraterrestrials might have, or how our own theologies have been or will be influenced by evidence of and/or interaction with extraterrestrials.

One of the main themes of exotheology is applying the concept of extraterrestrials who are sentient, and more to the point, endowed with a [[soul]],  as a [[thought experiment]] to the examination of a given theology, mostly [[Christian theology]], occasionally also [[Jewish theology]].

==Christianity==
A Christian writer early to address the question was [[C. S. Lewis]] (1898–1963) who in a 1950s article  in the  ''Christian Herald'' contemplated the possibility of the [[Son of God]] incarnating in other, extraterrestrial, worlds, or else that God could devise an entirely distinct plan of salvation for extraterrestrial communities from the one applicable to humans.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web

Lutheran theologian [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] (2003) asserts that the questions raised by the possibility of extraterrestrial life are by no means new to Christian theology and by no means pose, as asserted by other authors, a threat for Christian dogma. Peters points out that medieval theology had frequently considered the question of "what if God had created many worlds?", as early as the discussion of the [[Antipodes]] by the  [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Peters, ''Science, theology, and ethics'', Ashgate science and religion series, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-0825-7}}, chapter 6: "Exotheology: Speculations on Extraterrestrial Life"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Holy See|Vatican]] theologian [[Corrado Balducci]] often discussed the question in Italian popular media, and in 2001 published a statement ''UFOs and Extraterrestrials - A Problem for the Church?''.
In a 2008 statement, [[José Gabriel Funes]], head of the Vatican Observatory, said
"Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can't put limits on God's creative freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac Vatican scientist says belief in God and aliens is OK] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220145808/http://www2.canada.com/ottawacitizen/technology/science/science/story.html?id=fa0c5620-4d7f-44e6-9436-5cd4cb7153ac |date=20 February 2009 }} Reuters, May 14, 2008

Smaller denominations also have similar treatments in passing in their key writings: [[Christian Science]] and the [[A Course in Miracles|Course in Miracles]] treat extraterrestrials as effectively brother spiritual beings in a non-absolute physical experience, the founder of the former writing, "The universe of Spirit is peopled with spiritual beings,...",&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy|Eddy, Mary Baker]], [[Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures]], p. 264:32.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] wrote, "Anyone with a sound intellect can know from many considerations that there are numerous worlds with people on them. Rational thought leads to the conclusion that massive bodies such as the planets, some of which are larger than our own earth, are not empty masses created merely to wander aimlessly around the sun, and shine with their feeble light on one planet. No, they must have a much greater purpose than that. ... What would one planet be to God, who is infinite, and for whom thousands, or even tens of thousands of planets, all full of inhabitants, would be such a trifling matter as to be almost nothing?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

While other [[Protestant]] denominations have tended to be somewhat terracentric, much as [[Roman Catholicism]] was until more recent times, receptivity to the idea of extraterrestrial civilizations likely depends on the degree of associated [[biblical literalism]].  Those of more fundamentalist leanings as interviewed occasionally on UFO- and paranormal-themed radio shows like [[Coast to Coast AM]] often try to fit extraterrestrial beings into the mold of [[demon]]s or [[Nephilim]], lacking much better category in which to place them, whereas schools of less literal persuasion would be more open to alternative perspectives.  These would include either fundamental reexamination of traditional assumptions, some reconsideration of extraterrestrials as in some sense [[angels]], or at least wider interpretations possible in the saying ascribed to [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]], "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.",&lt;ref&gt;The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] ([[King James Version]]), [[Gospel of John|John]] 10:16&lt;/ref&gt; which while probably quite presumptuous-sounding in the very large cosmic perspective could potentially lend itself to a reading in some more impersonal sense as well better befitting the larger magnitude of exotheology.{{Original research inline|date=August 2016}}

==Judaism==
Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], who was also a physicist, was inclined toward the belief in extraterrestrial life, citing various classic Jewish authorities. Among them are the medieval philosopher Rabbi Chasdai Crescas (Ohr Hashem 4:2) and 18th century kabbalist Rabbi Pinchas Eliyahu Horowitz (Sefer HaBris). After presenting his sources, Rabbi Kaplan remarks, "We therefore find the basic thesis of the Sefer HaBris supported by a number of clear-cut statements by our Sages. There may even be other forms of intelligent life in the universe, but such life forms do not have free will, and therefore do not have moral responsibility"—at least in the same sense as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;
[Aryeh Kaplan. "On Extraterrestrial Life."] The Aryeh Kaplan Reader, Artscroll/Mesorah Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Kaplan also cites Judges 5:23 ("Cursed is Meroz..."), about which Rashi, the foremost medieval commentator remarks, "Some say [Meroz] was a planet, and some say [Meroz] was a prominent person who was near the battle area and yet did not come [to intervene]." (The basis of Rashi's comment is a Talmudic discussion in tractate Moed Katan 16a. However, the verse in Judges is more commonly understood as a literary usage by Deborah the Prophetess and not an affirmation of possible intelligent life on another planet.)

Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], former chancellor of [[Yeshiva University]], has also written on this subject, asserting that if the existence of extraterrestrial life should be confirmed, religious scholars must revise previous assumptions to the contrary. He, too, does not rule out this possibility from an Orthodox Jewish point of view.&lt;ref&gt;
"A Jewish Exotheology," published as Chapter 5 in Norman Lamm, ''Faith and doubt: studies in traditional Jewish thought'', Ktav Pub. House, 1971, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], an eminent 20th century Talmudic authority and rabbinical leader, is cited as having been open-minded about extraterrestrial life. He is said to have remarked that life on other planets would only reflect God's greatness, which exceeds mortal understanding, while not contradicting the role of the Jewish people to heed the Torah and in so doing to perform God's will here on earth.&lt;ref&gt;
David Holzer, ''The Rav: Thinking Aloud'', HolzerSeforim, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
Depending on the [[sura]]s cited, the [[Quran]] of [[Islam]] appears to leave open the door to the idea of extraterrestrials, as in 27:65, situated similarly on a par with humans subject to a divine judgment leading toward a [[heaven]] or [[hell]] as reward or punishment for the deeds of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Umsonstladen Freiburg.jpg|right|thumb|Inside a free shop in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]]]
'''Give-away shops''', '''swap shops''', '''freeshops''', or '''free stores''' are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to [[charity shop]]s, with mostly second-hand items—only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a [[book]], a piece of [[furniture]], a garment or a [[household]] item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops).

== Concept ==
The free store is a form of constructive [[direct action]] that provides a shopping alternative to a [[monetary]] framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside of a money-based economy.   The anarchist [[1960s counterculture|1960s countercultural]] group [[Diggers (theatre)|the Diggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Campbell McMillian |author2=Paul Buhle |title=The new left revisited |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Ohks41z2IC&amp;pg=PA112 |accessdate=28 December 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-976-0 |pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened free stores which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name="Lytle2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lytle|first=Mark Hamilton|title=America's Uncivil Wars: The Sixties Era from Elvis to the Fall of Richard Nixon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w3iBwAAQBAJ|year=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-029184-6|pages=213, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]]&lt;ref name="Digger Archives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="American Experience doc"&gt;{{cite video

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although free stores have not been uncommon in the United States since the 1960s, the [[freegan]] movement has inspired the establishment of more free stores. 

[[File:Kostnix innsbruck.png|thumb|Inside the KostNix free shop in Innsbruck, Austria]]
Culturally, some people feel that accepting free goods carries a [[social stigma|stigma]], so many people who use these shops are those who are led to them either by need (financially poor, such as [[student]]s, [[single parent]]s, the working-class, and the [[elderly]]) or by conviction ([[anti-capitalist]]s and [[environmentalists]]). [[Barter|Swap]] shops, where you are asked to bring something in order to take something, are one way in which stigma issues are addressed.

== Similar phenomena ==
In the [[United States]], [[Really Really Free Market]] groups organize periodic "market days" in city parks. Participants are encouraged to share unneeded items, food, skills and talents (entertainment, haircutting, etc.), to clean up after themselves and to take home any of their own items they were unable to give away during the event. In other cases, used goods are picked up from the donors' homes, thus eliminating overhead costs. Donors are often not motivated by financial need or strictly [[anti-capitalist]] conviction, but by a desire to get rid of what would otherwise be [[Waste|garbage]] without adding it to [[landfill]]s.

Another recent development in the give-away shop movement is the creation of the [[Freecycle Network]]. It began in the state of [[Arizona]], [[United States]] for the purpose of connecting people who had extra belongings to get rid of with people who needed something, organized as discussion/distribution lists, and usually hosted on one of the free websites.

In 2007 a similar concept began to flourish in Devon, England where a group of free-bookshops called Book-Cycle began; A volunteer-run registered charity, that gives books and trees away in exchange for a donation. Any proceeds are then used to send free books to developing countries and plant trees in the local area.

[[File:Gmp logo.png|thumb|Global Marshall Plan Initiative Logo]]
The '''Global Marshall Plan Initiative''' views itself as an integrative organizational platform for a "world in balance". Composed of a network of more than 5000 supporters from all levels of society, brought together from politics, economics and [[civil society]], the Initiative is based on five core goals for fair [[globalization]]. Through its network-like character, it is organized through even hierarchies and without a centre. Everyone is invited to actively participate and take action with their circles and the accompanying opportunities to implement a World in Balance!

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to establish a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy – a global Eco-Social Market Economy.

== Origins  ==
[[File:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|thumb|Al Gore - Author of "Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit"]]
The idea of a [[Global Marshall Plan]] was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist [[Al Gore]] in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical [[Marshall Plan]] after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for [[hope]], [[solidarity]] and [[peace]].

The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: [[Kofi Annan]], [[Al Gore]], [[Hans Küng]], [[Susan George (political scientist)|Susan George]], Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, [[George Soros]], Lutz Wicke, [[Georg Winter (manager)|Georg Winter]] and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a Kerosin tax.

As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, [[poverty]] and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 [[civil society]] organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for [[world peace]], [[sustainability]] and [[justice]], and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation.

The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and [[sustainability]]. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal to develop the initiative as openly as possible and also to win over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the great possible support to the world to ensure that plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage.

In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further and eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled to be published in September 2004.

In the meantime, more and more members of the [[European Parliament]] and national parliaments began to back the initiative. Soon organizations from the civil society and the economy followed, as well as the first university. The initiative was also received very well internationally. The initiative has grown into a network made up of over 5000 individual supporters, organizations as well as numerous federal states and communities.

Believing that change will come from the centre of society, supporters raise awareness of the issues surrounding globalization and motivate those around them for the implementation of fair globalization. Lectures are an essential part of spreading the word. By raising awareness and informing, alliances are formed and pressure is created from “[[Business development|bottom-up]]”. Those motivated are trained through multiplier training in Global Marshall Plan Academies.

== Self-understanding ==
Material prosperity of mankind has never before experienced such an increase. Nevertheless poverty, deprivation and the resulting illnesses are still alarmingly widespread. The increasing overexploitation of nature, wasted limited [[resources]] and expected catastrophic climate consequences linked to [[pollution]] will present mankind in the next 30 years with their biggest challenge yet.

Unsustainable consumption of developing countries, poverty and [[population growth]] are among the key problems. Many hundreds of millions of people do not benefit from the positive effects of ongoing globalization, which has further increased the income gap between rich industrial nations and the poorest developing countries. The spread of [[AIDS]] and looming population growth also accelerate this.

Any effort to overcome this unsustainable development will be four times more difficult in the future, or even impossible, if a fundamental turnaround is not set in place soon.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative wants to strengthen these turnarounds. With the self-understanding of a network-style movement for a World in Balance, positively aligned powers from politics, economics, science and civil society are brought together in a wide alliance based on the key requirements of fair globalization. This relies on the simultaneous pursuit of “bottom-up” and “top-down” approach, thus raising awareness and lobbying.

Through lectures, information events and publications, more people and groups are continually informed about the absolute necessity and the possibility of a global Eco-Social framework, so that political change comes from the centre of society. At the same time, support for the Global Marshall Plan and a global Eco-Social Market Economy is acquired from national, European and international decision makers through a direct approach.

== Goals  ==
The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to make a substantial contribution to a global eco-social market economy. This eco-social Marshall Plan would include realistic perspectives:

* to overcome the degrading poverty of half of mankind, which long has been identified as chief cause of the existing world problems
* to successfully establish global ecological and social standards for a [[sustainable development]]
* to overcome the deep cultural frustration and humiliation experienced by the majority of the world’s civilization and at the same time to eliminate the explosive environment that generates international [[terrorism]] and endangers global security
* for a new economic miracle which specifically boosts the human potential of more than three billion people (which until now has been laying absolutely idle). This would ultimately bring use to the whole human race
* to create fair globalisation
* and to accomplish [[human rights]] and human dignity for everyone.

According to the initiative, a Global Marshall Plan could also allow attractive new perspectives for many other problems caused by an unbalanced globalization. Possible impacts for example could be:

* The wealth and therefore the wages would increase in developing countries, so that the wage pressure in the economies of traditional industrialised countries will drop. The increased demand on the worlds market would also then contribute to a heightened job security in industrialised countries.
* An implementation of ecological goals would be far more realistic than is currently the case, since because poverty is, as the argument goes, one of the reasons for environmental damages in the poorest countries. Who would fight for daily survival, will be hardly convinced of environmental protection. In most parts of the world the implementation of ecological goals can only be realistic when they are directly linked to active promotion of social and ecological development.
* The model of an open, peaceful, democratic, constitutional and educated civil society, which many see as best guarantee for a good and dynamic future perspective, would be brought forward by the eco-social Marshall Plan.

The goal of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative is to globally link appropriate order processes with competitive mechanisms to create value added systems by combining potential, resources and [[infrastructure]] with well planned, institutional solutions. A global eco-social market economy would therefore create the right balance between competitive economy, social solidarity and ecological sustainability.

== The logic of the plan ==
Central to the logic of a plan is the following basic principle, as introduced by the Global Marshall Plan Initiative:

[[Investments]], coordinated market openings and co-financing provide the harmonization that results in social and ecological standards. A form of targeted global overcoming of poverty should therefore emerge that will release especially strong new economic stimuli for the regions concerned, as well as for the whole global economy. By combining new growth with clear ecological standards at the same time a strong environmental approach to economic activities should be encouraged.

According to initiative, the new economic, ecological and social perspectives would have a strong impulse for the inner peace of the global community, which in turn is important for a lasting and sustained growth of economy.

It is also assumed that the positive effects of a Global Marshall Plan would also consequently increase the pull on governments, who so far have been averse to the eco-social movement. It would reinforce the pressure on these governments to give space for these developments, to reduce corruption and boost [[Good Governance]]. Good Governance signifies a well working guidance and control system of a political social unit as a state or a community. The principles often include terms such as transparency, efficiency, participation, responsibility, constitutional state, democracy and justice often belong to the principles.

Especially important is that the Global Marshall Plan overcomes old clashes of interests and that it achieves an unusually wide support.

One of the surprising intermediate results of the present process is that it is supported by commercial and industrial enterprises and their federations as well as severe critics of the previous form of globalisation and representatives from the “North” and “South”. Several well known representatives of all main political movements, all civil sectors and global acting networks of civil society argued vehemently for the initiative. The existing approaches and ideas of the initiative could open is a real prospect to bridge the wide social gap.

== Key requirements for a world in balance ==
Elements of the Global Marshall Plan, including the five interrelated building blocks of the plan, have already been mentioned in previous UN summits, European policy and demands from various [[NGO]]s and institutions. The five building blocks, which are continually adapted to the current challenges, form the starting point and at the same time the foundation of the initiative.

=== Further development and implementation of the UN Millennium Development Goals ===
In September 2000 the [[United Nations]] (UN) came together at the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] to discuss the most important challenges in the coming decade. In the final [[Millennium Declaration]], globalization was highlighted as one of the most important current issues.

In this declaration, the 192 [[UN member states]] committed themselves to the concrete [[Millennium Development Goals]], which should help to ensure everyone benefits from globalization.

The UN Millennium Development Goals represent the beliefs of the initiative – the first intermediate step towards fair world order and to sustainable development. It is unlikely that the goals will be achieved by 2015. Many problems have even worsened, highlighting a glaring failure of the international community. If anything, this should be all the more incentive to updates the goals and meet them promptly.

=== Achieving the 0.7% target and raising an additional necessary funds ===
A series of appropriate and necessary declarations and agreements (such as the above-mentioned Millennium Development Goals) have been only previously implemented to an extremely discouraging extent. If the apparent gap between declaration of intent and ability to act is not soon overcome, we are threatened with an escalation of global problems. Especially worrying is the looming crisis of confidence in decision-making processes on all levels and inability to enact policies in general.

The phase of understanding must therefore immediately be followed by a phase of decisive implementation. This involves not only the delivery mechanism (see 5.4) but also all questions of financing.

The financial means needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals lies, after an analysis from the UNO, at around US$50 billion per year plus some $20 billion for the provision of public goods and humanitarian missions. Considering the current situation significantly more resources are needed for development aid and the implementation of the MDGs. By enforcing the 0.7% GNP target, which the United Nations has been aiming at for decades, the means to finance [[development aid]] would be available.

In comparison:

The percentage volume of the US Marshall Plan after the Second World War was 1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the USA – over a time period of 4 years.
 
Global military spending in 2004 amounted to around $1000 billion excluding the cost for the Iraq War. The Iraq War has already cost an additional several hundred billion US dollars.

These numbers illustrate that the proposed Global Marshall Plan on the stated level is by all means financeable.

=== Fair taxation on the global value-added processes ===
As well as market openings and new delivery mechanisms, global development also requires the above-mentioned financial means for international cooperation. Despite the principal way of using national budgets to provide the necessary funds, it would be easier, from a fundamental and procedural point of view, to find another way to allocate these funds.

On the one hand, national budgets are not directly charged, but on the other hand, the generated funds could be better separated from the national interests of donating countries, and it is easier to move forward together when everyone moves at the same pace. Since in the past self-contained national interests have repeatedly affected the efficiency of measures for development cooperation and consequently the public reputation of such programs has significantly decreased. An improvement in finding new means of financing could prove critical both politically as well as for the public acceptance of a Global Marshall Plan.

Therefore, the initiative urges that for regulatory reasons, due to improved governance action, for increased transparency, and in particular for better controls on the world finance sectors, tax on global value-added processes and the use of Global Commons must be systematically established. Examples of these include a global [[financial transactions tax]], the trade with CO2 emissions allowances in context of [[climate justice]] and a kerosene tax. The following are some examples:

==== Financial transactions tax ====
Another proposal to finance a Global Marshall Plan, which also has support from numerous experts, is a tax on global financial transactions. The [[financial transaction tax]] (FTT) is currently on the verge of a breakthrough in the [[European Union|EU]].

Critics of this idea are concerned that as a result of the tax, the “[[collective intelligence]]” in control of highly sensitive financial flows would be charged. On the contrary, in the recent excesses and “bubbles” of international capital, financial markets and the [[New Economy]], this intelligence has proved to be not all that far reaching. However it is in any case only a cautious use of these instruments and this suggested only on a global level.

A cautious start could be, for example, a global financial transaction tax of initially 0.01% If this proves to be positive, the value could be increased to 0.02%. With this, $30–40 billion could be raised each year.

However it must be acknowledged that such a global tax would require the establishment of new international structures that would possess the necessary authority as well as the effective sanctions.

==== Other considerations ====
In addition to the two presented financing options, the establishment of a Global Climate Certificate System (GCCS), a Future Bond, an [[International Finance Facility]] and a Kerosene Tax are also being discussed.

Other important considerations include the debt of development countries, closing offshore tax havens, which deprive national tax systems of some $50 billion every year, dismantling protectionist structures as well as discussions on an international cartel authority.

=== Fair, global partnerships and effective appropriation of funds ===
A fair partnership in development assistance on all levels and an adequate cash flow are the requirements for a sustainable future perspective for the entire world. Promoting Good Governance, subsidiaries, rationality, education, combating corruption, as well as an appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, are considered crucial for self-regulated development (e.g. micro-financing).

To be able to develop the desired effect and gain broad and sustained support of global civil society but also to find the economy and politics, earlier mistakes in development cooperation must be avoided in the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan.

The overcoming of global [[market fundamentalism]] and the realization of a global eco-social market economy should be made possible by establishing a better framework for the global economy in a fair global agreement. The most appropriate way appears to primarily be the relationship between ethic, economic, ecological, social, cultural and democratic standards with such a programme.

The standards and codes of practice are related to (co)financing programmes. The allocation of funds must not be influenced through short-term economic interests of rich countries or through short-term power interests of elites in poor countries. This can best be achieved through a consistent focus on the mentioned standards, an associated accountability, an active and transparent involvement of industry and the organisation of civil society.

The first phase of the Global Marshall Plan seeks for the application of the following standards which have already been agreed on by UN member states:

Basic economic, social and cultural human rights, which are largely congruent with the core standards of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), such as organisational rights, [[gender equality]], prohibition of [[child labour]] etc.

Standards of international environmental and conservation agreements such as the Convention on Bio-diversity, [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or the Washington Convention) and the [[Kyoto Protocol]].
 
Ignoring some of these standards represents, in many areas, the most important competitive economic advantages for less developed countries. The example of EU enlargement shows however that agreements on the application of common high standards and protection levels can be achieved, if accompanied by a co-financing of the development of weaker partners by developed countries is ensured. This coupling is profitable for all involved.

Previously the most effective ways of enforcing standards on a global level were held by the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). However the organisation has received criticism like hardly any other. This is mainly because, in accordance with their mandate, they primarily promote the reduction of trade barriers and in doing so, discounts ecological, social and cultural aspects.

In the long-term, however, the WTO could still be reformed into a sustainable institution with trade regulations associated with the above-mentioned standards towards a fair, balanced and sustainability-oriented economic system. This should provide all elements of the prospective framework for non-compliance with the same legal action and sanction options. The equality of trade, environmental and social standards through a link with the WTO is one of the central concerns of the initiative.

Alternative considerations concerning the enforceability of ecological and social standards focus on strengthening a reformed UN and more efficient means of enforcing social standards within the ILO or human rights.

Every level, from the individual and local, to the national and global, has its own, essential function in a globalised world. One accomplishment of the tasks according to the principle of subsidiarity (principle that states matters ought to be handled by the smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority) is essential for an efficient implementation of a Global Marshall Plan and requires a lot of changes, since the political decision-making structures of today are still far from fulfilling the needs of the growing world society.

Knowledge transfers, empowerment, investments directed at education and health must be central to the effort. Important aspects to achieve a reasonable regulatory framework and a self-regulated development include:

* Fair cooperation based on partnerships on all levels
* Strengthening of decision-making and organisation opportunities for partner countries
* Promoting Good Governance and fighting corruption
* Appropriation of funds, coordinated and directed at a grass-roots level, e.g. micro-credit
* and adequate funding

The ideology that the luck is on the side of the fittest, thus essentially stating that poverty is caused by itself, dismisses the many dimensions of poverty and neglects its causes which lie not finally in the unequal property and power structures that have maintained poverty and dependence for centuries.

A worldwide expansion of “Western” development and suppressing our unsustainable, undesirable development does not lead to worldwide wealth in any way, but to cultural impoverishment as well as the destruction of our natural resources.

==== From development aid to development cooperation ====
The arrogance of the Western civilisation, which is perceived by people as humiliating, degrading and threatening, provokes anti-Western sentiment and provides the breeding ground for hate and violence. There are also unfairly distributed opportunities and a lack of balance of interests.

Combating the misery in the world is not just a handout, but humanitarian duty and peace policy is also in our best interests. These days widespread human security can not be achieved when we’re against one another, only when we’re with one another. In addition it is necessary to build mutual trust, to accept those in disadvantaged countries as equal partners and to allow contributions from international negotiation and decision-making processes.

==== Application of funds ====
Given the above considerations, the Global Marshall Plan Initiative sees the following principles and suggestions for the application of funds as particularly noteworthy:

* The specific development programmes should be coordinated by the appropriated specialized organisations and programmes of the United Nations. The role of the United Nations must be strengthened.
* The example of the already established financing organisation “[[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]]” should be observed to see whether establishing such financing organisation in the UN’s own interaction with the economy and civil society is helpful to the key objectives of the Global Marshall Plan.
* Provided that funds are acquired from world trade tax, it would be worth considering investing this initially into development goals in every economic sector so that income accumulated in these sectors would increase agreement from the economy.
* An essential tool in the application of funds should be the public tender of proposed programmes from NGOs to maintain the best cost-income ratio in healthier competition.
* Projects should have clear priority, which are based on entrepreneurial potential of local people – for example small credit banks and development schools where locals are trained by aid workers.
* In technology transfers, the choice of promoted projects should be orientated above all towards those that teach largest possible number of locals the skills, so they are able to cope on their own as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The search for particularly successful, socially efficient and ecological projects and those success criteria should be defined and promoted as new international research priority. In this way the efficiency of many current forms of development assistance could be substantially increased.

=== Framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy: a global Eco-Social Market Economy ===
With the gradual implementation of a global Eco-Social Market Economy, a framework compatible with sustainability for the global economy will be established and the global market fundamentalism will be overcome. Functioning Global Governance structures need to reform existing institutions and policies (e.g. United Nations, World Trade Organization and World Finance Sector), as well as their coherent linkup to create a functioning whole.

== Next stages ==
Currently the initiative for a Global Marshall Plan is supported by more than 5000 individuals, 200 organisations, all Austrian federal states as well as some German states and prominent public figures. In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative’s own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body.

As an international initiative, the goals are strategic: implementing a Global Marshall Plan and developing a broad public awareness of globally responsible action. Only an increased awareness and an improved understanding can be a reliable basis to lead the initiative to become better known and to create fairer globalization.

The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences:

* To all people in the world to contribute to the initiative with their knowledge, experiences and ideas
* To religious organisations as well as the media and artists to spread the ideas of the Global Marshall plan and create awareness
* To interested groups as well as in NGO organised civil societies. The goal is to join forces and fight for a fair, sustainable globalization together.
* To science. All disciplines are invited to help to develop the Global Marshall Plan with detailed and interdisciplinary established projects.
* To the economy to make the Global Marshall Plan one its own concerns to create a socially fair and ecologically responsible economic development
* To governments and parliaments of nation states to officially support the Global Marshall Plan and to develop it through discussion with other actors. This new quality of global action and problem-solving ability lies in the long-term interests of all countries.
* To the [[European Union]] as an important bearer of hope for the project and for many people in the entire world. The EU member states are faced with the historical opportunity to make the transition from former colonial powers to partners of efficient and comprehensively understood development policies. The EU can and should courageously develop an alternative to current forms of globalisation and consistently advocate them in international negotiations.
* To the UN and its programmes and specialized organisations that play a central role in the implementation of these projects. Initiatives to reform the UN in the direction of greater efficiency, competency and funding are supported by the initiative.
* To the [[G8]] to place combating poverty not as short-term measures such as aid and debt relief in the foreground, but to fight structural poverty through a reform of global regulations and institution at their roots.

Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children’s initiative [[Plant-for-the-Planet]], which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly.

Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative’s website.

The current projects of the initiative are the University Days: Eco-Social Market Economy and Sustainability, a collaborative project between the initiative and 5 other organizations, as well as other multiplier training through the internationalisation and offer of other formats within the Global Marshall Plan Academy. Both projects are supported by the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. The foundation of one of three project offices finances the University Days, for the Global Marshall Plan the organizational administration. The support and maintenance of local activities through the coordination office, the coordination and communication of speakers and lecturers are additional important component of the commitment of the initiative.

=== Supporters ===
Supporters of the initiative include [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Hubert Weinzierl (BUND), [[Rita Süssmuth]], Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Franz Josef Radermacher, [[Jakob von Uexküll]], Ulrich Martin Drescher, Renée Ernst, [[Sandra Maischberger]] (all from Germany), Josef Riegler, [[Franz Fischler]] (Austria), Prince El Hassan bin Talal (Jordan), [[Vandana Shiva]] (India), [[Jane Goodall]] (UK) and approximately 5000 supporters from Germany and Austria.

The supporting organisations include the [[Club of Rome]], the Eco-Social Europe, the German Federal Association of Economic Development and Foreign Economic Affairs, [[AIESEC]] Germany and Austria, Cap Anamur/German Emergency Doctors, [[VENRO]] (umbrella organisation of development non-governmental organisations), UN Millennium Campaign Germany as well as all the federal states of Austria.

In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan.

An up-to-date list of supports can be found on the Global Marshall Plan website.

== On a local level ==
Since Spring 2004, a year after the initiative was founded, the local and university groups were founded by supporters in numerous places. The members of these groups stand together for a World in Balance to support the goal of a fairer world. Again and again new like-minded people are brought together by getting involved in their area.

The members of predominantly German-speaking areas (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) as well as international operating local groups and individual contact points operate projects for raising awareness. Through bottom-up activities, supporters clear up to those around them topics such as the [[climate crisis]], global poverty and other inequalities to contribute actively towards the necessary changes. With the active announcement of the Global Marshall Plan the supporters understand as lobbying for the common goal – a World in Balance – and act from the centre of society, pressurizing politics and the economy.

The Global Marshall Plan University Group was brought to life in 2004 as the first local group. They already organised series of lectures with personalities such as nobel prize winner [[Muhammad Yunus]] and was an incentive and model for other local groups. Currently there are more than 33 contact points worldwide, 23 of which are in German speaking countries acting locally.

A '''graded category''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] concept.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[category theory|category]], then a
'''&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category'''
is a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; together with a [[functor]]
&lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Monoid]]s and [[group (mathematics)|group]]s can be thought of as categories with a single [[element (mathematics)|element]]. A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each [[morphism]] is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with [[function composition|composition]], in the sense that compositions have the product grade.

==Definition==

There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above.  A more concrete definition of a semigroup-graded Abelian category is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J. J.|title=Twisted Graded Algebras and Equivalences of Graded Categories|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|date=1 March 1996|volume=s3-72|issue=2|pages=281–311|doi=10.1112/plms/s3-72.2.281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Abelian category]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; a [[semigroup]].  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\{ S_{g} : g\in G \}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of [[functor]]s from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to itself.  If

* &lt;math&gt;S_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity functor on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}S_{h}=S_{gh}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,h\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;S_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Full and faithful functors|full and faithful functor]] for every &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;

we say that &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;-graded category.

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Under the homestead principle a [[farmer]] putting unowned [[Land (economics)|land]] to use gains [[ownership]] over it.]]
{{Libertarianism sidebar |expanded=Concepts}}

The '''homestead principle''' is the principle by which one gains ownership of an unowned [[natural resources|natural resource]] by performing an act of original [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. Appropriation could be enacted by putting an unowned resource to active use (as with using it to [[Production (economics)|produce]] a [[Product (business)|product]]), joining it with previously acquired property or by marking it as owned (as with [[livestock branding]]). Proponents of [[intellectual property]] hold that ideas can also be homesteaded by originally creating a [[Virtuality|virtual]] or [[tangible]] representation of them. Others however argue that since tangible manifestations of a single idea will be present in many places, including within the minds of people, this precludes their being owned in most or all cases. Homesteading is one of the foundations of [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] [[anarcho-capitalism]].

==In philosophy==

===John Locke===
{{main article|Labor theory of property}}
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[John Locke]] in his work [[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|''Second Treatise of Government'']], published in 1690 advocated the [[Lockean proviso]], which allows for homesteading. Locke famously sees the "mixing of labour" with land as the source of ownership via homesteading. He writes:
{{quote
| Though the earth and all inferior creatures be common to all men, yet every man has a ''property'' in his own ''person.'' This nobody has any right to but himself. The ''labour'' of his body and the ''work'' of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever, then, he removes out of the state that Nature hath provided and left it in, he hath mixed his ''labour'' with it, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his ''property''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=John |title=The Two Treatises of Government, Bk II, Chap 25, Sect 27 |date=1689 |publisher=A. Millar, et al. |location=London |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/222 |accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

However, Locke held that individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature only so long as "there is enough, and as good, left in common for others".&lt;ref&gt;Second Treatise of Government, Chapter V, paragraph 33&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lockean proviso]] maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would only be acceptable if it does not make anyone else worse off.

===Murray Rothbard===
Libertarian philosopher and [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] argues that homesteading includes all the rights needed to engage in the homesteading action, including nuisance and [[pollution]] rights. He writes:
{{quote|Most of us think of homesteading unused resources in the old-fashioned sense of clearing a piece of unowned land and farming the soil. … Suppose, for example, that an airport is established with a great deal of empty land around it. The airport exudes a noise level of, say, X decibels, with the sound waves traveling over the empty land. A housing development then buys land near the airport. Some time later, the homeowners sue the airport for excessive noise interfering with the use and quiet enjoyment of the houses.&lt;br /&gt;
Excessive noise can be considered a form of aggression but in this case the airport has already homesteaded X decibels worth of noise. By its prior claim, the airport now "owns the right" to emit X decibels of noise in the surrounding area. In legal terms, we can then say that the airport, through homesteading, has earned an easement right to creating X decibels of noise. This homesteaded easement is an example of the ancient legal concept of "prescription," in which a certain activity earns a prescriptive property right to the person engaging in the action.&lt;ref name="rothbard-law"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Applications and criticism from the Austrian school. |year=1997 |publisher=Elgar |location=Cheltenham [u.a.] |isbn=1-85898-570-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rothbard interprets the physical extent to which a homesteading act establishes ownership in terms of the relevant "technological unit", which is the minimal amount necessary for the practical use of the resource. He writes:
{{quote|If A uses a certain amount of a resource, how much of that resource is to accrue to his ownership? Our answer is that he owns the technological unit of the resource. The size of that unit depends on the type of good or resource in question, and must be determined by judges, juries, or arbitrators who are expert in the particular resource or industry in question.&lt;ref name="rothbard-law" /&gt;}}

===Anthony de Jasay===
[[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] [[Anthony de Jasay]] argued that a homesteader, having a claim prior to any other, must be [[prima facie]] considered the owner of the resource, in accordance with the principle "let ownership stand". He writes:
{{quote|[if] taking first possession of a thing is a feasible act of his that is admissible if it is not a tort (in this case not trespass) and violates no right; but this is the case by definition, i.e., by the thing being identified as “unowned.” Taking exclusive possession of it is, in terms of our classification of possible acts, a liberty, and as such only a contrary right can obstruct or oppose it. 14 The opponent of this simple thesis is trying to have it both ways: he is both asserting that the thing has no legitimate first owner from whom  a  second  or  nth  owner  could  have  legitimately  obtained  it  by  agreed transfer,  and  that  there  is  nevertheless  somebody  who  has  been  and  still  is entitled to use the thing and therefore can validly object to being excluded from it. But an entitlement to use the thing is an at least partial antecedent ownership claim needing an owner, or the permission of an owner, before it can be made; ownership cannot both exist yet not exist. If, on the other hand,  the  objectors  have  been  using  the  thing  without  being  entitled  to  it, because  no  third  party  had  excluded  them  by  taking  first  possession,  and because  they  were  unable,  unwilling,  or  uninterested  to  perform  the  act  of taking  first  possession  themselves  (whatever  that  act  may  consist  of),  their enjoyment of the thing was precarious, not vested. Its appropriation by a third party may have deprived them of an uncovenanted advantage, but it did not violate their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeJasay |first=Anthony |title=Against politics : on government, anarchy, and order |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=0-415-17067-2 |pages=173 |edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hans Hermann Hoppe===
{{main article|Argumentation ethics}}
Similarly to de-Jasay, [[Hans Hermann Hoppe]] argues that the denial of the homesteading rule entails a [[performative contradiction]]. That is because honest argumentation must presuppose an [[intersubjective verifiability|intersubjectively ascertainable]] [[Norm (philosophy)|norm]] (i.e. justifiable), and all norms not relying on the original establishment of a physical (and therefore evident) link to the owner are [[Subjectivity|subjective]] in nature, and therefore contradict the presuppositions of argumentation. He writes:
{{quote|Further, if one were not allowed to appropriate other resources through homesteading action, i.e., by putting them to use before anybody else does, or if the range of objects to be homesteaded were somehow limited, this would only be possible if ownership could be acquired by mere decree instead of by action. However, this does not qualify as a solution to the problem of ethics, i.e., of conflict-avoidance, even on purely technical grounds, for it would not allow one to decide what to do if such declarative claims happened to be incompatible. More decisive still, it would be incompatible with the already justified self-ownership, for if one could appropriate resources by decree, this would imply that one could also declare another person’s body to be one’s own. Thus, anyone denying the validity of the homesteading principle—whose recognition is already implicit in arguing two persons’ mutual respect for each other’s exclusive control over his own body—would contradict the content of his proposition through his very act of proposition making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Hans-Hermann |title=The economics and ethics of private property : studies in political economy and philosophy |year=2006 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Ala. |isbn=0-945466-40-4 |pages=199 |url=https://mises.org/books/economicsethics.pdf |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ayn Rand===
[[Ayn Rand]] has not elaborated on the characteristics of homesteading, but had expressed support for compatible laws, such as favourably citing the [[Homestead Act]] (1862). She writes:
{{quote|A notable example of the proper method of establishing private ownership from scratch, in a previously ownerless area, is the Homestead Act of 1862, by which the government opened the Western frontier for settlement and turned "public land" over to private owners. The government offered a 160-acres farm to any adult citizen who would settle on it and cultivate it for five years, after which it would become his property. Although that land was originally regarded, in law, as "public property," the method of its allocation, in fact, followed the proper principle (in fact, but not in explicit ideological intention). The citizens did not have to pay the government as if it were an owner; ownership began with them, and they earned it by the method which is the source and root of the concept of "property": by working on unused material resources, by turning a wilderness into a civilized settlement. Thus, the government, in this case, was acting not as the owner but as the custodian of ownerless resources who defines objectively impartial rules by which potential owners may acquire them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=The Property Status of Airwaves |journal=The Objectivist Newsletter |year=1964 |volume=3 |url=http://www.criminalgovernment.com/docs/aynrand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Linda and Morris Tannehill===
Linda and Morris Tannehill argue in ''[[The Market for Liberty]]''  that physically claiming the land (e.g. by fencing it in or prominently staking it out) should be enough to obtain good title:

{{quote|An old and much respected theory holds that for a man to come into possession of a previously unowned value it is necessary for him to "mix his labor with the land" to make it his own. But this theory runs into difficulties when one attempts to explain what is meant by "mixing labor with land." Just how much labor is required, and of what sort? If a man digs a large hole in his land and then fills it up again, can he be said to have mixed his labor with the land? Or is it necessary to effect a somewhat permanent change in the land? If so, how permanent?...Or is it necessary to effect some improvement in the economic value of the land? If so, how much and how soon?...Would a man lose title to his land if he had to wait ten months for a railroad line to be built before he could improve the land?...And what of the naturalist who wanted to keep his land exactly as it was in its wild state to study its ecology?...[M]ixing one's labor with the land is too ill-defined a concept and too arbitrary a requirement to serve as a ''criterion'' of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Market for Liberty |pages=57–58 |author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In law==

===Common law===
[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|right|thumb|Under the [[ad coelum]] doctrine land ownership extends in a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] from the [[Inner core|earth's core]] up to the [[exosphere]].]]
[[Common law]] provides the [[ad coelum]] [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] by which [[landlord]]s own everything below and above the land, up to the sky and below the earth to its core, with the exception of volatile minerals such as [[natural gas]]. The rules governing what constitutes [[homesteading]] were not specified by common law but by the local [[statutory law]]. Common law also recognizes the concept of [[adverse possession]] ("squatters' rights").&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/homesteading ''West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard]] criticized this doctrine as incompatible with his own homestead principle, as a literal application prevent aircraft from traveling over someone's land. Further:
{{Quote|But is the practical problem of aviation the only thing wrong with the ad coelum rule? Using the homesteading principle, the ad coelum rule never made any sense, and is therefore overdue in the dustbin of legal history. If one homesteads and uses the soil, in what sense is he also using all the sky above him up into heaven? Clearly, he isn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray |title=Law, Property Rights and Air Pollution |journal=Cato Journal |year=1982 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} So long as the aircraft did not damage or disturb the land, the owner would not have a claim. By the same principle, ownership of mineral and water resources on or under the land would also require homesteading, otherwise being left unowned.

===Statutory law===
In the 19th century, a number of [[government]]s formalized the homestead principle by passing laws that would grant property of land plots of certain standardized size to people who would settle on it and "improve" it in certain ways (typically, built their residence and started to farm at least a certain fraction of the land). Typically, such laws would apply to territories recently taken from their [[indigenous inhabitants]], and which the state would want to have populated by farmers. Examples:
* United States: [[Armed Occupation Act|Florida Armed Occupation Act]] (1842), [[Homestead Act]] (1862)
* Canada: [[Dominion Lands Act]] (1872)
* Australia: [[Robertson Land Acts|Crown Lands Acts]] (1861)

'''''Homo homini lupus''''', or in its unabridged form '''''Homo homini lupus est''''', is a [[Latin proverb]] meaning "A man is a wolf to another man," or more tersely "Man is wolf to man." It has meaning in reference to situations where people are known to have behaved in a way comparably in nature to a [[wolf]]. The wolf as a creature is thought, in this example, to have qualities of being predatory, cruel, inhuman i.e. more like an animal than civilized.

==History==
A variation of the proverb appeared as line 495 in the play ''[[Asinaria]]'' by [[Plautus]]: "''Lupus est homo homini, non homo, quom qualis sit non novit''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Titus Maccius Plautus|author-link=Plautus|title=Asinaria|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/plautus/asinaria.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikiquote:Plautus#Asinaria_.28The_One_With_the_Asses.29|has been translated]] as "Man is no man, but a wolf, to a stranger," or more precisely "A man is a wolf, not a man, to another man which he hasn't met yet."

As a counterpoint, [[Seneca the Younger]] wrote, in his ''[[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium]]'' (specifically, Epistula XCV, paragraph 33), "''homo, sacra res homini''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucius Annaeus Seneca|author-link=Seneca the Younger|title=Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/sen/seneca.ep14-15.shtml|website=The Latin Library|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[wikisource:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 95|has been translated]] as "man, an object of reverence in the eyes of man".

[[Erasmus]] included the proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', writing of the variation by Plautus, "Here we are warned not to trust ourselves to an unknown person, but to beware of him as of a wolf."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erasmus|first=Desiderius|author-link=Desiderius Erasmus|year=2001|orig-year=1500-1536|editor-last=Barker|editor-first=William|title=The Adages of Erasmus|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0802048749|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmJn6IFMyicC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvHxgZrDwC&amp;sig=EOZUjNww1ezfCBfkNQLPZekbB1c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0JSQVbDEMoOwsAWI0oPoBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher, theologian, and jurist [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (in Latin, Franciscus de Victoria) [[wikisource:De Indis De Jure Belli/Part_2|wrote in one of his ''Relectiones Theologicae'']] that the poet [[Ovid]] disagreed with the proverb: "'Man,' says Ovid, 'is
not a wolf to his fellow man, but a man.'"

[[Thomas Hobbes]] drew upon the proverb in his ''[[De Cive]]'', [[wikisource:De Cive|writing in the dedication]] "To speak impartially, both sayings are very true; That Man to Man is a kind of God; and that Man to Man is an arrant Wolfe. The first is true, if we compare Citizens amongst themselves; and the second, if we compare Cities." Hobbes was describing the tendency of people to act fairly and generously toward other people in the same society and the tendency of societies to act deceptively and violently toward other societies, or [[wikisource: De Cive|as he put it]], "In the one, there's some analogie of similitude with the Deity, to wit, Justice and Charity, the twin-sisters of peace: But in the other, Good men must defend themselves by taking to them for a Sanctuary the two daughters of War, Deceipt and Violence."

[[Sigmund Freud]] agreed with the proverb, writing in his ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'', "Men are not gentle creatures, who want to be loved, who at the most can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary, creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful share of aggressiveness. As a result, their neighbor is for them not only a potential helper or sexual object, but also someone who tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain, to torture and to kill him. ''Homo homini lupus.'' Who in the face of all his experience of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|author-link=Sigmund Freud|title=Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930 (excerpt)|url=http://historyguide.org/europe/freud_discontents.html|website=The History Guide|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primatologist and ethologist [[Frans de Waal]] disagreed with the proverb, writing that it "contains two major flaws. First, it fails to do justice to canids, which are among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet (Schleidt and Shalter 2003). But even worse, the saying denies the inherently social nature of our own species."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Frans|author-link=Frans de Waal|year=2006|title=Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691124477|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PccMuO2pcOcC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;1pg=PA3&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI1OW82OnbxgIVEEGICh1KXgTY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sacco and Vanzetti|Bartolomeo Vanzetti]], after being convicted of murder, along with Nicolo Sacco, in 1927, said that their pending execution would become an emblem "of a cursed past in which man was wolf to the man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/saccov/courtspeech.html|title=Speeches by Sacco and Vanzetti to the Court at the Time of Sentencing|last=Linder|first=Douglas O.|access-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3567">The '''Hornsleth Village Project''' was a controversial [[conceptual art]] project by [[Danish people|Danish]] artist [[Kristian von Hornsleth]] in which he went to the [[Uganda]]n village of Buteyongera and paid impoverished villagers to legally change their names to "Hornsleth". In exchange for consenting to have "Hornsleth" added to their identity documents, the villagers were given livestock. The project began in June 2006; in October 2006, [[Kampala]] officials put a stop to the project, citing ethical reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200610270148.html Govt Blocks Mukono Pig Project] from ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'', November 27, 2006; by Jude Luggya &amp; Agness Nandutu; archived at AllAfrica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By that time, 270 newly renamed Hornsleths had each received a pig, and another 70 had each received a goat.

Hornsleth, who said that he would like it if the village's name were eventually changed as well,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6157612.stm Storm over 'pig-for-name' artist], [[BBC]], 17 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; described it as a straightforward business transaction, wherein he paid the villagers to participate in his project and pose for photographs.

The Ugandan Minister of Ethics, [[James Nsaba Buturo]], criticized Hornsleth as being a cult leader,&lt;ref name=Grauniad&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2006/nov/17/ugandansswapn The Hornsleths of Uganda], by Lars Eriksen, at ''[[the Guardian]]''; published November 17, 2006; retrieved October 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; obscene, mentally deranged, evil,&lt;ref name=Satanic&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/3548/article-1G1-153425697/hornsleth-satanic-says-minister-buturo Hornsleth Satanic, Says Minister Buturo.], by Steven Candia, from [[AllAfrica.com]] (archived at [[HighBeam Research]]); published October 26, 2006; retrieved October 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; racist, and a homosexual,&lt;ref name=Grauniad/&gt; and the project as demeaning, and stated that official diplomatic measures would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/532458 Hornsleth show angers govt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234248/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/13/532458 |date=2007-09-27 }} at [[New Vision]], November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nsaba Buturo also protested against Hornsleth's use of the Ugandan national flag and the [[grey crowned crane|crested crane]] (Uganda's national bird) on the invitation cards to Hornsleth's photo exhibition in Copenhagen, entitled "We Can Help You, But We Want To Own You".

By June 2008, "most" of the residents of Buteyongera had gone back to their original names,&lt;ref name=URN&gt;[https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/memories-of-hornsleth-still-abound-in-buteyongera-village Memories of Hornsleth Still Abound in Buteyongera Village], by Hellen Ntegyereize, at Uganda Radio Network; published June 26, 2008; retrieved November 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2012, Hornsleth was cited by Ugandan law enforcement as an example of "foreign nationals" who have "ulterior, selfish motives".&lt;ref name=Suspicious&gt;[http://www.observer.ug/news-headlines/20453-suspicious-alien-arrested-in-nakasongola-barracks  Suspicious alien arrested in Nakasongola Barracks], by Benon Tugumisirize, at ''[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]''; published August 19, 2012; retrieved November 16, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intentional infliction of emotional distress''' ('''IIED'''; sometimes called the '''tort of outrage''')&lt;ref name= Cusimano/&gt; is a [[common law]] [[tort]] that allows individuals to recover for severe emotional distress caused by another individual who intentionally or recklessly inflicted emotional distress by behaving in an "extreme and outrageous" way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|title=Religiously Motivated "Outrageous" Conduct: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress as a Weapon Against 'Other People's Faiths'|first=Paul T.|last=Hayden|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|volume=34|issue=3|year=1993|page=579|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1853&amp;context=wmlr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts and commentators have substituted ''mental'' for ''emotional'', but the tort is the same.&lt;ref name= Cusimano &gt;{{cite web|last1=Cusimano|first1=Gregory S|title=Tort of Outrage|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=1-23+Alabama+Tort+Law+23.syn&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=5932&amp;key=c78c33472985632cff2ff07820298bd8|publisher=LexisNexis|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale for classification==
IIED was created in tort law to address a problem that would arise when applying the common law form of [[assault]]. The common law tort of assault did not allow for liability when a threat of [[battery (tort)|battery]] was not imminent. A common case would be a future threat of harm that would not constitute common law assault, but would nevertheless cause emotional harm to the recipient. IIED was created to guard against this kind of emotional abuse, thereby allowing a victim of emotional distress to receive compensation in situations where he or she would otherwise be barred from compensation under the common law form.

According to the first doctrine articulated by common law courts, a plaintiff could not recover for physical injury from fright alone absent a physical impact from an external source ("shock without impact"), even if the fright was proven to have resulted from a defendant's negligence, with the case on point referring to the negligent operation of a railroad.&lt;ref&gt;For English law, see ''Victorian Railways Commissioners v. Coultas'' (1888) 13 AC 222 (woman barred from recovery due to shock despite suffering a miscarriage); for a similar decision in New York in the same month, see ''Lehman v. Brooklyn City Railroad Co.'', 47 Hun (N.Y.) 355 (1888).&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with intentional conduct, absent material damage, claims for emotional harm were similarly barred.  "Mental pain or anxiety, the law cannot value, and does not pretend to redress, when the unlawful act causes that alone.  Though where a material damage occurs, and is connected with it, it is impossible a jury, in estimating it, should altogether overlook the feelings of the party interested."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Wensleydale, Lynch v. Knight (1861) 9 HLC 577 at 598; 11 ER 854, where a married woman unsuccessful sought redress for "slanderous imputation of unchastity"&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts had been reluctant to accept a tort for emotional harm for fear of opening a "wide door" to frivolous claims.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell v. Rochester Railway Co. 151 NY 107 (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;

A change first occurred in the [[History of Ireland (1801–1923)|Irish]] courts which repudiated the English railroad decision and recognised liability for "nervous shock" in the ''Byrne'' (1884) and ''Bell'' (1890) cases &lt;ref&gt;see ''Bell v. Great Northern Railway of Ireland'' (1895) 26 LR (Ir) 428; also citing an unreported decision in ''Byrne v. Great Southern and Western R. Co. of Ireland''.&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, the idea that physical/mental shock without impact from an external source should be a bar to recovery was first questioned at the Queen's Bench in ''Pugh v. London etc. Railroad Co.''&lt;ref&gt;[1896] 2 QB 248&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the Queen's Bench formally recognised the tort, for the first time, in the case of {{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Wilkinson v Downton]]|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=1897|num=1|parallelcite=[1897] 2 QB 57 }}, although it was referred to as "intentional infliction of mental shock".  ''Wilkinson'' has been subsequently approved by both the Court of Appeal (''[[Janvier v Sweeney]]'' [1919] 2 KB 316) and House of Lords ({{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Wainwright v Home Office]]|link=|court=UKHL|year=2003|num=53|parallelcite= [2004] 2 AC 406}}).  Citing ''Pugh'' and the Irish courts as precedent, the ''Wilkinson'' court noted the willful nature of the act as a direct cause of the harm.

==Elements==
# Defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; and
# Defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous; and
# Defendant's act is the cause of the distress; and
# Plaintiff suffers severe emotional distress as a result of defendant's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trucounsel.com/index.php/intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress|title=Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress - Trucounsel.com|author=|date=2 August 2011|website=trucounsel.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentional or reckless act===
It is not necessary that an act be ''intentionally'' offensive. A reckless disregard for the likelihood of causing emotional distress is sufficient. For example, if a [[defendant]] refused to inform a [[plaintiff]] of the whereabouts of the plaintiff's child for several years, though that defendant knew where the child was the entire time, the defendant could be held liable for IIED even though the defendant had no intent to cause distress to the plaintiff.

===Extreme and outrageous conduct===
The conduct must be heinous and beyond the standards of civilized decency or utterly intolerable in a civilized society. Whether the conduct is illegal does not determine whether it meets this standard. IIED is also known as the tort of "outrage", due to a classic formulation of the standard: the conduct must be such that it would cause a [[reasonable person]] to feel extremely offended, shocked, and/or outraged.

Some general factors that will persuade that the conduct was extreme and outrageous (1) there was a pattern of conduct, not just an isolated incident; (2) the plaintiff was vulnerable and the defendant knew it; (3) the defendant was in a position of power; (4) racial epithets were used; and (5) the defendant owed the plaintiff a [[fiduciary duty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Taylor v. Metzger'', 706 A.2d 685 (N.J. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GTE&gt;''GTE Southwest, Inc. v. Bruce'', 998 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causation===
The actions of the defendant must have actually caused the plaintiff's emotional distress beyond the bounds of decency. IIED can be done through speech or action; if emotional stress, must manifest physically.&lt;ref  name=GTE /&gt;

===Qualification===
The emotional distress suffered by the plaintiffs must be "severe."  This standard is quantified by the intensity, duration, and any physical manifestations of the distress.  A lack of productivity or a mental disorder, documented by a mental health professional, is typically required here, although acquaintances' testimony about a change in behavior could be persuasive. Extreme sadness, anxiety, or anger in conjunction with a personal injury (though not necessarily) may also qualify for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional Distress and Defamation in Personal Injury Cases|url=http://lawyersatlanta.com/emotional-distress-and-defamation-in-personal-injury-cases/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029055937/http://lawyersatlanta.com/emotional-distress-and-defamation-in-personal-injury-cases/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2015|publisher=Slappey &amp; Sadd|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an act which might form the basis for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress would be sending a letter to an individual falsely informing the person that a close family member had been killed in an accident.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2015}}

==Pleading practices==
In [[civil procedure]] systems (such as in the United States) that allow plaintiffs to plead multiple alternative theories that may overlap or even contradict each other, a plaintiff will usually bring an action for both intentional infliction of emotional distress and [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]] (NIED). This is just in case the plaintiff later discovers that it is impossible to prove at trial the necessary ''[[mens rea]]'' of [[intent (law)|intent]]; even then, the jury may still be able to rule for them on the NIED claim.

There are some reported cases in which a plaintiff will bring ''only'' a NIED claim even though a reasonable neutral observer could conclude that the defendant's behavior was probably intentional. This is usually because the defendant may have some kind of insurance coverage (like homeowners' insurance or automobile liability insurance). As a matter of public policy, insurers are barred from covering intentional torts like IIED, but may be liable for NIED committed by their policyholders, and therefore are targeted indirectly in this fashion as [[deep pocket]]s.

==First Amendment considerations==
The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell|Hustler v. Falwell]]'' involved an IIED claim brought by the evangelist [[Jerry Falwell]] against the publisher of [[Hustler|Hustler Magazine]] for a [[parody]] ad that described Falwell as having lost his virginity to his mother in an outhouse. The Court ruled that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected such parodies of public figures from civil liability.&lt;ref&gt;''Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell'', 485 U.S. 46 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Interval0.png|thumb|400|The addition ''x'' + ''a'' on the number line. All numbers greater than ''x'' and less than ''x'' + ''a'' fall within that open interval.]]In [[mathematics]], a ('''real''') '''interval''' is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s with the property that any number that lies between two numbers in the set is also included in the set.  For example, the set of all numbers {{mvar|x}} satisfying {{math|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}} is an interval which contains {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}, as well as all numbers between them. Other examples of intervals are the set of all real numbers &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all negative real numbers, and the [[empty set]].

Real intervals play an important role in the theory of [[Integral|integration]], because they are the simplest sets whose "size" or "measure" or "length" is easy to define.  The concept of measure can then be extended to more complicated sets of real numbers, leading to the [[Borel measure]] and eventually to the [[Lebesgue measure]].

Intervals are central to [[interval arithmetic]], a general [[numerical method|numerical computing]] technique that automatically provides guaranteed enclosures for arbitrary formulas, even in the presence of uncertainties, mathematical approximations, and [[rounding error|arithmetic roundoff]].

Intervals are likewise defined on an arbitrary [[total order|totally ordered]] set, such as [[integers]] or [[rational numbers]]. The notation of integer intervals is considered [[#Integer intervals|in the special section below]].

==Terminology==
An '''open interval''' does not include its endpoints, and is indicated with parentheses. For example, {{open-open|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}. A '''closed interval''' is an interval which includes all its limit points, and is denoted with square brackets. For example, {{closed-closed|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}. A '''half-open interval''' includes only one of its endpoints, and is denoted by mixing the notations for open and closed intervals. {{open-closed|0,1}} means greater than {{math|0}} and less than or equal to {{math|1}}, while {{closed-open|0,1}} means greater than or equal to {{math|0}} and less than {{math|1}}.

A '''degenerate interval''' is any [[singleton set|set consisting of a single real number]].  Some authors include the empty set in this definition.  A real interval that is neither empty nor degenerate is said to be  '''proper''', and has infinitely many elements.

An interval is said to be '''left-bounded''' or '''right-bounded''' if there is some real number that is, respectively, smaller than or larger than all its elements.  An interval is said to be '''bounded''' if it is both left- and right-bounded; and is said to be '''unbounded''' otherwise.  Intervals that are bounded at only one end are said to be '''half-bounded'''. The empty set is bounded, and the set of all reals is the only interval that is unbounded at both ends.  Bounded intervals are also commonly known as '''finite intervals'''.

Bounded intervals are  [[bounded set]]s, in the sense that their [[diameter]] (which is equal to the [[absolute difference]] between the endpoints) is finite.  The diameter may be called the '''length''', '''width''', '''measure''', or '''size''' of the interval.  The size of unbounded intervals is usually defined as {{math|+∞}}, and the size of the empty interval may be defined as {{math|0}} or left undefined.

The '''centre''' ([[midpoint]]) of bounded interval with endpoints {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')/2}}, and its '''radius''' is the half-length {{math|{{mabs|''a'' − ''b''}}/2}}.  These concepts are undefined for empty or unbounded intervals.

An interval is said to be '''left-open''' if and only if it contains no [[minimum]] (an element that is smaller than all other elements);  '''right-open''' if it contains no [[maximum]]; and '''open''' if it has both properties.  The interval {{closed-open|0,1}}&amp;nbsp;= {{mset|''x'' | 0 ≤ ''x'' &amp;lt; 1}}, for example, is left-closed and right-open.  The empty set and the set of all reals are open intervals, while the set of non-negative reals, for example, is a right-open but not left-open interval. The open intervals coincide with the [[open set]]s of the real line in its standard [[point-set topology|topology]].

An interval is said to be '''left-closed''' if it has a minimum element, '''right-closed''' if it has a maximum, and simply '''closed''' if it has both.  These definitions are usually extended to include the empty set and to the (left- or right-) unbounded intervals, so that the closed intervals coincide with [[closed set]]s in that topology.

The '''interior''' of an interval {{mvar|I}} is the largest open interval that is contained in {{mvar|I}}; it is also the set of points in {{mvar|I}} which are not endpoints of {{mvar|I}}.  The '''closure''' of {{mvar|I}} is the smallest closed interval that contains {{mvar|I}}; which is also the set {{mvar|I}} augmented with its finite endpoints.

For any set {{mvar|X}} of real numbers, the '''interval enclosure''' or '''interval span''' of {{mvar|X}} is the unique interval that contains {{mvar|X}} and does not properly contain any other interval that also contains {{mvar|X}}.

=== Note on conflicting terminology ===
The terms '''''segment''''' and '''''interval''''' have been employed in the literature in two essentially opposite ways, resulting in ambiguity when these terms are used.  The ''Encyclopedia of Mathematics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|title=Interval and segment - Encyclopedia of Mathematics|website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org|access-date=2016-11-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226211146/http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Interval_and_segment|archivedate=2014-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ''interval'' (without a qualifier) to exclude both endpoints (i.e., open interval) and ''segment'' to include both endpoints (i.e., closed interval), while Rudin's ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=31|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls sets of the form [''a'', ''b''] ''intervals'' and sets of the form (''a'', ''b'') ''segments'' throughout.  These terms tend to appear in older works; modern texts increasingly favor the term ''interval'' (qualified by ''open'', ''closed'', or ''half-open''), regardless of whether endpoints are included.

==Notations for intervals==
The interval of numbers between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, is often denoted {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}}. The two numbers are called the ''endpoints'' of the interval. In countries where numbers are written with a [[decimal comma]], a [[semicolon]] may be used as a separator, to avoid ambiguity.

===Including or excluding endpoints===
To indicate that one of the endpoints is to be excluded from the set, the corresponding square bracket can be either replaced with a parenthesis, or reversed. Both notations are described in [[International standard]] [[ISO 31-11]].  Thus, in [[set builder notation]],
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
{\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\color{RedOrange})}  = \mathopen{\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{RedOrange}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}x{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\color{RedOrange})}  = \mathopen{\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{RedOrange}[} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{OliveGreen}\le} x{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}b\}, \\{}
{\color{RedOrange}(} a,b{\color{OliveGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{RedOrange}]}a,b\mathclose{\color{OliveGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{RedOrange}&lt;}x{\color{OliveGreen}\le} b\}, \\{}
{\color{OliveGreen}[}a,b{\color{OliveGreen}]} = \mathopen{\color{OliveGreen}[} a,b\mathclose{\color{OliveGreen}]} &amp;= \{x\in\R\mid a{\color{OliveGreen}\le} x{\color{OliveGreen}\le} b\}.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
Note that {{open-open|''a'', ''a''}}, {{closed-open|''a'', ''a''}}, and {{open-closed|''a'', ''a''}} each represents the [[empty set]], whereas {{closed-closed|''a'', ''a''}} denotes the set&amp;nbsp;{{math|{''a''}{{null}}}}.  When {{math|''a'' &gt; ''b''}}, all four notations are usually taken to represent the empty set.

Both notations may overlap with other uses of parentheses and brackets in mathematics.  For instance, the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} is often used to denote an [[tuple|ordered pair]] in set theory, the [[coordinates]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] or [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] in [[analytic geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], or (sometimes) a [[complex number]] in [[algebra]].  That is why [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] introduced the notation {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the open interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/193|title=Why is American and French notation different for open intervals (x, y) vs. ]x, y[?|author=|date=|website=hsm.stackexchange.com|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notation {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} too is occasionally used for ordered pairs, especially in [[computer science]].

Some authors use {{math|]''a'', ''b''[}} to denote the complement of the interval&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''a'', ''b''}}; namely, the set of all real numbers that are either less than or equal to {{mvar|a}}, or greater than or equal to {{mvar|b}}.

===Infinite endpoints===
In some contexts, an interval may be defined as a subset of the [[extended real number line|extended real numbers]], the set of all real numbers augmented with {{math|−∞}} and {{math|+∞}}.

In this interpretation, the notations {{closed-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{open-closed|−∞, ''b''}} , {{closed-closed|''a'', +∞}} , and {{closed-open|''a'', +∞}} are all meaningful and distinct.  In particular, {{open-open|−∞, +∞}} denotes the set of all ordinary real numbers, while {{closed-closed|−∞, +∞}} denotes the extended reals. 

Even in the context of the ordinary reals, one may use an [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] endpoint to indicate that there is no bound in that direction.  For example, {{open-open|0, +∞}} is the set of [[positive real numbers]] also written ℝ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The context affects some of the above definitions and terminology. For instance, the interval {{open-open|−∞, +∞}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is closed in the realm of ordinary reals, but not in the realm of the extended reals.

===Integer intervals===
The notation {{closed-closed|''a'' .. ''b''}} when {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are [[integer]]s, or {{math|{''a'' .. ''b''}{{null}}}}, or just {{math|''a'' .. ''b''}} is sometimes used to indicate the interval of all ''integers'' between {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, including both.  This notation is used in some [[programming language]]s; in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], for example, it is used to formally define a subrange type, most frequently used to specify lower and upper bounds of valid [[Indexed family|indices]] of an [[Array data type|array]].

An integer interval that has a finite lower or upper endpoint always includes that endpoint.  Therefore, the exclusion of endpoints can be explicitly denoted by writing {{math|''a'' .. ''b'' − 1}} ,  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b''}} , or  {{math|''a'' + 1 .. ''b'' − 1}}.  Alternate-bracket notations like {{closed-open|''a'' .. ''b''}} or {{math|[''a'' .. ''b''[}} are rarely used for integer intervals.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Classification of intervals==
The intervals of real numbers can be classified into the eleven different types listed below{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers, and &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;:

: Empty: &lt;math&gt;[b,a] = (b,a) = [b,a) = (b,a] = (a,a) = [a,a) = (a,a] = \{ \} = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
: Degenerate: &lt;math&gt;[a,a] = \{a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Proper and bounded:
:: Open: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) = \{x\mid a &lt; x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,b] = \{x\mid a \leq x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed, right-open: &lt;math&gt;[a,b) = \{x\mid a \leq x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-open, right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(a,b] = \{x\mid a &lt; x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-bounded and right-unbounded:
:: Left-open: &lt;math&gt;(a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x &gt; a\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Left-closed: &lt;math&gt;[a,+\infty) = \{x\mid x \geq a\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Left-unbounded and right-bounded:
:: Right-open: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b) = \{x\mid x &lt; b\}&lt;/math&gt;
:: Right-closed: &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,b] = \{x\mid x \leq b\}&lt;/math&gt;
: Unbounded at both ends (simultaneously open and closed):  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,+\infty) = \R&lt;/math&gt;:

==Properties of intervals==
The intervals are precisely the [[connectedness|connected]] subsets of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the image of an interval by any [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] function is also an interval. This is one formulation of the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The intervals are also the [[convex set|convex subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt;.  The interval enclosure of a subset &lt;math&gt;X\subseteq \R&lt;/math&gt; is also the [[convex hull]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The intersection of any collection of intervals is always an interval.  The union of two intervals is an interval if and only if they have a non-empty intersection or an open end-point of one interval is a closed end-point of the other (e.g., &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \cup [b,c] = (a,c]&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; is viewed as a [[metric space]], its [[open ball]]s are the open bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{open-open|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}, and its [[closed ball]]s are the closed bounded sets&amp;nbsp;{{closed-closed|''c'' + ''r'', ''c'' − ''r''}}.

Any element&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}} of an interval&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} defines a partition of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} into three disjoint intervals {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: respectively, the elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}} that are less than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the singleton&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;[x,x] = \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;, and the elements that are greater than&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.  The parts {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and {{mvar|I}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are both non-empty (and have non-empty interiors) if and only if {{mvar|x}} is in the interior of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|I}}.  This is an interval version of the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy principle]].

==Dyadic intervals==

A ''dyadic interval'' is a bounded real interval whose endpoints are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{j}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math  display="inline"&gt;\frac{j+1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are integers.   Depending on the context, either endpoint may or may not be included in the interval.

Dyadic intervals have the following properties:

* The length of a dyadic interval is always an integer power of two.
* Each dyadic interval is contained in exactly one dyadic interval of twice the length.
* Each dyadic interval is spanned by two dyadic intervals of half the length.
* If two open dyadic intervals overlap, then one of them is a subset of the other.

The dyadic intervals consequently have a structure that reflects that of an infinite [[binary tree]].

Dyadic intervals are relevant to several areas of numerical analysis, including [[adaptive mesh refinement]], [[multigrid methods]] and [[wavelet|wavelet analysis]]. Another way to represent such a structure is [[p-adic analysis]] (for {{math|1=''p'' = 2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozyrev |first1=Sergey |year=2002 |title=Wavelet theory as {{mvar|p}}-adic spectral analysis |journal=[[Izvestiya: Mathematics|Izvestiya RAN. Ser. Mat.]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=149–158 |doi=10.1070/IM2002v066n02ABEH000381 |url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/izv/v66/i2/p149 |accessdate=2012-04-05|arxiv=math-ph/0012019 |bibcode=2002IzMat..66..367K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalizations ==

=== Multi-dimensional intervals ===
In many contexts, an '''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional interval''' is defined as a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; that is the [[Cartesian product]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals, &lt;math&gt;I = I_1\times I_2 \times \cdots \times I_n&lt;/math&gt;, one on each [[coordinate]] axis.

For &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as region bounded by  a [[square]] or [[rectangle]] whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, depending on whether the width of the intervals are the same or not; likewise, for &lt;math&gt;n=3&lt;/math&gt;, this can be thought of as a region bounded by an axis-aligned [[cube]] or a [[rectangular cuboid]].  
In higher dimensions, the Cartesian product of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; intervals is bounded by an [[N-dimensional space|n-dimensional]] [[hypercube]] or [[hyperrectangle]].

A '''facet''' of such an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the result of replacing any non-degenerate interval factor &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt; by a degenerate interval consisting of a finite endpoint of &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''faces''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; comprise &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; itself and all faces of its facets.  The '''corners''' of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are the faces that consist of a single point of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Complex intervals===
Intervals of [[complex number]]s can be defined as regions of the [[complex plane]], either [[rectangle|rectangular]] or [[disk (mathematics)|circular]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtqk6WgttzcC Complex interval arithmetic and its applications], Miodrag Petković, Ljiljana Petković, Wiley-VCH, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-527-40134-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topological algebra==
Intervals can be associated with points of the plane and hence regions of intervals can be associated with [[region (mathematical analysis)|region]]s of the plane. Generally, an interval in mathematics corresponds to an ordered pair (''x,y'') taken from the [[direct product]] R × R of real numbers with itself. Often it is assumed that ''y'' &gt; ''x''. For purposes of [[mathematical structure]], this restriction is discarded,&lt;ref&gt;Kaj Madsen (1979) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/586220.pdf Review of "Interval analysis in the extended interval space" by Edgar Kaucher]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from [[Mathematical Reviews]]&lt;/ref&gt; and "reversed intervals" where ''y'' &amp;minus; ''x'' &lt; 0 are allowed. Then the collection of all intervals [''x,y''] can be identified with the [[topological ring]] formed by the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of R with itself where addition and multiplication are defined component-wise.

The direct sum algebra &lt;math&gt;( R \oplus R, +, \times)&lt;/math&gt; has two [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, { [''x'',0] : ''x'' ∈ R } and { [0,''y''] : ''y'' ∈ R }. The [[identity element]] of this algebra is the condensed interval [1,1]. If interval [''x,y''] is not in one of the ideals, then it has [[multiplicative inverse]] [1/''x'', 1/''y'']. Endowed with the usual [[topology]], the algebra of intervals forms a [[topological ring]].  The [[group of units]] of this ring consists of four [[quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]]s determined by the axes, or ideals in this case. The [[identity component]] of this group is quadrant I.

Every interval can be considered a symmetric interval around its [[midpoint]].  In a reconfiguration published in 1956 by M Warmus, the axis of "balanced intervals" [''x'', &amp;minus;''x''] is used along with the axis of intervals [''x,x''] that reduce to a point.
Instead of the direct sum &lt;math&gt;R \oplus R&lt;/math&gt;, the ring of intervals has been identified&lt;ref&gt;[[D. H. Lehmer]] (1956) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/81372.pdf Review of "Calculus of Approximations"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from Mathematical Reviews&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[split-complex number]] plane by M. Warmus and [[D. H. Lehmer]] through the identification
: ''z'' = (''x'' + ''y'')/2 + j (''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'')/2.
This linear mapping of the plane, which amounts of a [[ring isomorphism]], provides the plane with a multiplicative structure having some analogies to ordinary complex arithmetic, such as [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]].

{{Confuse|intensive and extensive properties}}
An '''intrinsic''' property is a property of a system or of a material itself or within. It is independent of how much of the material is present and is independent of the form of the material, e.g., one large piece or a collection of small particles. Intrinsic properties are dependent mainly on the chemical composition or structure of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Packaging Engineering (IFNHH, Massey University, NZ)&lt;/ref&gt;

A property that is not essential or inherent is called an '''extrinsic''' property. For example, [[density]] is an intrinsic property of any [[Physical body|physical object]], whereas '''belonging to something''' is an extrinsic property that depends on another object.

In biology, intrinsic effects originate from inside an organism or cell, such as an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune]] disease or [[intrinsic immunity]].

{{Aliyah}}
The '''Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries''', or '''Jewish exodus from Arab countries''', was the departure, flight, expulsion, evacuation and migration of 850,000 Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/VideoLibrary/Pages/Jewish-refugees-from-Arab-lands.aspx|title=VI- November 30: Commemorating the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] background, from [[Arab countries|Arab]] and [[Muslim countries]], mainly from 1948 to the early 1970s. The last major [[Exodus of Iran's Jews|migration wave]] took place from Iran in 1979–80, as a consequence of the Islamic Revolution.

A number of small-scale Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries early in the 20th century with the only substantial [[aliyah]] coming from Yemen and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p. 327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of Israel]] in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that now make up the [[Arab world]]. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled [[North Africa]], 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aharoni |first=Ada |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/w91udxrhc7cf5a86 |title=The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries |journal=Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=53–60 |ref=harv |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/1040265032000059742 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to [[Israel]] between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state.&lt;ref name=colin63/&gt; Following the establishment of the State of Israel, a plan to accommodate 600,000 immigrants over four years, doubling the existing Jewish population, was submitted by the Israeli government to the Knesset.&lt;ref name=hokohen&gt;{{cite book |last=Hakohen |first=Devorah |title=Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions in the 1950s and After |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=46 |isbn=9780815629696|quote=After independence, the government presented the Knesset with a plan to double the Jewish population within four years. This meant bringing in 600,000 immigrants in a four-year period. or 150,000 per year. Absorbing 150,000 newcomers annually under the trying conditions facing the new state was a heavy burden indeed. Opponents in the Jewish Agency and the government of mass immigration argued that there was no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, however, encountered mixed reactions; there were those within the Jewish Agency and government who opposed promoting a large-scale emigration movement among Jews whose lives were not in danger.&lt;ref name=hokohen/&gt;

Later waves peaked at different times in different regions over the subsequent decades. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 following the [[Suez Crisis]]. The exodus from the other North African Arab countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of Jews from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adi-schwartz.com/israeli-arab-conflict/all-i-wanted-was-justice/|title=All I Wanted was Justice|last=Schwartz|first=Adi|date=4 January 2008|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulewitz&gt;Malka Hillel Shulewitz, ''The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands'', Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;Ada Aharoni [http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm "The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230126/http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm |date=13 February 2012 }}, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

In contrast, Jews from Arab lands came to this country under the initiative of the State of Israel and Jewish organizations. Some came of their own free will; others arrived against their will. Some lived comfortably and securely in Arab lands; others suffered from fear and oppression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting the history, those who view the Jewish exodus as analogous to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] generally emphasize the push factors and consider those who left as refugees, while those who do not, emphasize the pull factors and consider them willing immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Articles/General/Story2127.html|title=THE FORGOTTEN REFUGEES: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries By Philip Mendes - Palestine Remembered|website=www.palestineremembered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}
At the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, ancient Jewish communities had existed in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa since Antiquity. [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these groups were accorded certain rights as "[[People of the Book]]".

During [[Christian persecution of Jews|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; though in other times and places, Jews fled persecution in Muslim lands and found refuge in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhambra Decree|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Influx of Sephardi Jews from Iberia|invited to settle]] in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Banking and finance|merchants acting as intermediaries]] for their Muslim rulers.

==North Africa region==

===French colonization===
In the 19th century, [[Francization]] of Jews in the French colonial [[North Africa]], due to the work of organizations such as the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]{{sfn|Laskier|1994}} and French policies such as the [[Crémieux Decree|Algerian citizenship decree of 1870]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Israeli-Palestinian Conflict in the Francophone World|first=Nathalie|last=Debrauwere-Miller|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781135843878|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_giRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a separation of the community from the local Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Laskier|first=Michael|title=North African Jewry in the Twentieth Century: The Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria|publisher=NYU Press|year=1994|isbn=9780814750728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaked, Edith Haddad. "On the State of being (Jewish) between 'Orient' and 'Occident'" in Bat-Ami Bar On and Tessman, Lisa, eds. Jewish Locations: Traversing Racialized Landscapes. (City: Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2002), "Quite many observers have noted that it is remarkable how quickly Tunisian Jews shifted their identification and leapt from a way of life quite similar to that of the Muslim Arab population into a new European cultural world, following the establishment of the French Protectorate in Tunisia in 1882. Under the French Protectorate, the Jews had a different position, "one small notch above the Muslims on the pyramid which is the basis of all colonial societies." ... For the generation born under the protectorate, the French language replaced Judeo-Arabic as the Tunisian Jews' mother tongue.... Under French colonial rule, the Jews of Tunisia deconstructed many aspects of their "Oriental" selves, and experienced an image shift, from resembling the "Oriental" colonized Arabs to resembling the "Occidental" French colonizers, through their rapid adaptation to the French language, customs, and culture. Since the French administrators strongly encouraged the French acculturation of Tunisian Jews through many educational and economic opportunities, their "Oriental" past started just to fade away. As a result, a new society of French-assimilated Jews emerged. When Tunisia gained its independence from France and emerged as a Muslim Arab country, Tunisian Jews were not let to forget that after all, they were French-acculturated Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

The French began [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|the conquest of Algeria in 1830]]. The following century had a profound influence on the status of the Algerian Jews; following the 1870 "Décret Crémieux", they were elevated from the protected minority dhimmi status to French citizens of the colonial power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chouraqui|first=Andre|authorlink=André Chouraqui|year=2002|title=Between East and West: A History of the Jews of North Africa|isbn=1-59045-118-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Contemporary Jewry: Volume XIX: Jews and the State: Dangerous Alliances and the Perils of Privilege|last=Mendelsohn|first=Ezra|year=2004|isbn=9780195346879|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-TttDROff0C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree began a wave of [[Pied-Noir]]-led anti-Jewish protests (such as the 1897 anti-Jewish riots in [[Oran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algeria, 1830–2000: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&amp;pg=PA10|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8916-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which the Muslim community did not participate in, to the disappointment of the European agitators.
{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002|p=152|ps=: "A number of factors finally led to the defeat of the anti-Semitic party in Algeria and to its disappearance in 1902.... Most important perhaps was the refusal of the Moslems of Algeria to allow themselves to be drawn into the anti-Jewish manifestations, thus confounding the hopes and plans of the agitators. This phenomenon is a telling proof that the assertions regarding the so-called axiomatic hatred of the Moslems for the Jews were utterly unfounded."}} Though there were also cases of Muslim-led anti-Jewish riots, such as in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in 1934 when 34 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name="Vance2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Vance|title=The Martyrdom of a Moroccan Jewish Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eE0QbtrTAgC|date=10 May 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-20700-7|page=182|quote=Muslim anti Jewish riots in Constantine in 1934 when 34 jews were killed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring [[Husainid Dynasty|Husainid Tunisia]] began to come under European influence in the late 1860s and became [[French protectorate of Tunisia|a French protectorate]] in 1881. Since the 1837 accession of [[Ahmad I ibn Mustafa|Ahmed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002a|ps=: "Although the French Protectorate was established only in 1881, the occupation of Algeria in 1830 exerted a profound influence on Tunisia's rulers and on the life of the Jews there. The accession of Ahmed Bey to the throne in 1837 marked a turning point in the evolution of Tunisia, and during his eighteen-year reign the Jews had a foretaste of the security and freedom that they were to enjoy under the Protectorate."}} and continued by his successor [[Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn|Muhammed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002b|ps=: "Immediately after [Mohammed Bey's 1855] accession, he abolished the corvee duty to which Jews were still subjected under the old laws for the dhimmis, and he made the Jews subject to the same fiscal laws as Moslems."}} Tunisia's Jews were elevated within Tunisia society with improved freedom and security, which was confirmed and safeguarded during the French protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002c|ps=: "But for the Jews of Tunisia [the 1881 French Protectorate] did not signify the revolutionary change ... [but] rather, to confirm and safeguard through the French presence the existing liberal tendencies which had characterized the Regency since the reign of Ahmed Bey."}} Around a third of Tunisian Jews took French citizenship during the protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002d|ps=: "Altogether, 7,311 Jews were granted French nationality in Tunisia between 1911 and the end of the Protectorate. These, with their descendants, eventually made up one-third of the Jewish population of Tunisia."}}

Morocco, which had remained independent during the 19th century, became [[French protectorate in Morocco|a French protectorate]] in 1912. However, during less than half a century of colonization, the equilibrium between Jews and Muslims in Morocco was upset, and the Jewish community was again positioned between the colonisers and the Muslim majority.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002e|ps=: "[Moroccan] Jews became a monolithic block poised between Europeans and Moslems, not fully accepted by either group.... The equilibrium in which the Jews and Moslems had lived, for better or worse, for twelve centuries was upset by the introduction into Morocco of the third and henceforth most powerful force—the French.... Morocco's Jews found themselves, at the end of fifty years, alienated from both societies on whose perimeters they lived."}} French penetration into Morocco between 1906 and 1912 created significant Morocco Muslim resentment, resulting in nationwide protests and military unrest. During the period a number of anti-European or anti-French protests extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations, such as in [[Casablanca]], [[Oujda]] and [[Fes]] in 1907-08 and later in the [[1912 Fes riots]].{{sfn|Laskier|2012|p=42|ps=: "But the worst was yet to come, for the systematic French penetration after Algeciras brought Moroccan Muslim resentment to the boiling point. The resentment was manifested in the form of popular protests and tribal and military unrest throughout the country. The French proceeded by occupying Oujda; and following anti-European manifestations in Marrakesh and riots in Casablanca (1907), resulting in the killing of Europeans, the French government sent to Casablanca's coast the cruiser Galilee and a French expeditionary force. French troops were now in Casablanca whereas major portions of the adjacent Chaouia plain were occupied under the command of Generals Drude and d'Amade. ln 1907–1908 anti-European feelings extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations in Oujda, Casablanca, and Fez."}}

The situation in colonial Libya was similar; as for the French in the other North African countries, the [[History of Italian Libya|Italian influence in Libya]] was welcomed by the Jewish community, increasing their separation from the non-Jewish Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUM2phcxIFIC&amp;pg=PA111|title=The Making of Modern Libya, Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, p 111 |publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014|isbn=9780791417614 |author1=Ahmida |first1=Ali Abdullatif |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=160|ps=: "Moreover, the Libyan Jewish community benefited economically from Ottoman rule. As a result, there was little Jewish emigration during this period. At the same time, however, as European powers increased their economic influence in Libya, Jews increasingly became middlemen between them and the local population. More and more they were seen by Muslim Libyans as aligned with foreign powers. Italian rule soon made this partnership more overt. The colonial rule then further increased Muslim-Jewish conflict, eventually leading to both collective violence and migration. By the end of the Italian period, the Jewish community of Libya was no longer willing to accept a traditional subordinate place in a Muslim society, and in fact was unprepared to live in an independent Arab Muslim state."}}

The Alliance Israelite Universelle, founded in France in 1860, set up schools in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia as early as 1863.{{sfn|Laskier|2012}}{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002f|ps=: "Alliance Israelite Universelle['s first school in Morocco] was opened in 1862 at Tetuan"}}{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002g|ps=: "In 1863, a committee of the Alliance Israelite Universelle was set up in Tunisia ... and intervened effectively whenever an official measure was taken that might have discriminated against the Jews."}}

===World War II===
During World War II, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya came under [[Nazi]] or [[Operation Torch#Background|Vichy French]] occupation and their Jews were subject to various persecution. In Libya, the Axis powers established [[Italian concentration camps in Libya|labor camps]] to which many Jews were forcibly deported.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html History of the Jewish Community in Libya] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718035942/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/JewsofLibya/LibyanJews/thejews.html |date=18 July 2006 }}".

As in Tunisia and Algeria, [[Moroccan Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349&gt;{{harvnb|Laskier|1994|p=349}}: "... the policies adopted by Nasser's Egypt or Syria such as internment in prison camps, sequestration, or even outright confiscation of assets, and large-scale expulsions (as was the case with Egyptian Jews in 1956-57), were never implemented by Muhammad V, Hasan II, Bourguiba, or the FLN. The freedom of action granted in Algeria, Morocco (since 1961), and Tunisia to Jewish emigration societies... was unparalleled elsewhere in the Arab world. These organizations enjoyed greater legality than government opponents who were Muslims  ... albeit managed by foreigners and financed from abroad."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco the Vichy regime during World War II passed discriminatory laws against Jews; for example, Jews were no longer able to get any form of credit, Jews who had homes or businesses in European neighborhoods were expelled, and quotas were imposed limiting the percentage of Jews allowed to practice professions such as law and medicine to no more than two percent.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|reason=Contradicts Xavier Cornut JPost article - need quote from Stillman to clarify.|date=January 2016}} [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Mohammed V]] expressed his personal distaste for these laws, assuring Moroccan Jewish leaders that he would never lay a hand "upon either their persons or property". While there is no concrete evidence of him actually taking any actions to defend Morocco's Jews, it has been argued that he may have worked on their behalf behind the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Cornut, ''Jerusalem Post'', 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "During World War II, King Muhammad V had refused to apply the anti-Semitic laws of the protectorate imposed by the Vichy regime in France, prompting fidelity from Moroccan Jewry. ... In the late Fifties, before his coronation, he had shocked people during a visit in Lebanon by arguing that the only solution for the enduring conflict was to make peace and incorporate Israel in the Arab League. The king was fascinated by the idea of the "reconciliation of the Semitic brotherhood," although he never expressed it in the early years of his reign, aligning his country with the anti-Israeli alliance."&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1948, soon after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel was established]] and in the midst of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|first Arab–Israeli war]], [[1948 Oujda and Jerada pogrom|violent anti-Jewish riots]] broke out in Oujda and [[Djerada]], leading to deaths of 44 Jews. In 1948–49, after the massacres, 18,000 Moroccan Jews left the country for Israel. Later, however, the Jewish exodus from Morocco slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early 1950s, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:

{{quote|The more I visited in these (Berber) villages and became acquainted with their Jewish inhabitants, the more I was convinced that these Jews constitute the best and most suitable human element for settlement in Israel's absorption centers.

They are satisfied with few (material needs), which will enable them to confront their early economic problems. |Yehuda Grinker, ''The Emigration of Atlas Jews to Israel''&lt;ref&gt;Yehuda Grinker (an organizer of Jewish emigration from the Atlas), ''The Emigration of Atlas Jews to Israel'', Tel Aviv, The Association of Moroccan Immigrants in Israel, 1973.

The houses of some 200 Jews were too badly damaged during the riots for them to return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1955/08/26/archive/moroccan-jewish-leaders-leave-for-the-aix-les-bains-peace-talks#ixzz2hKqLoYcF Moroccan Jewish Leaders Leave for the Aix-les-bains Peace Talks], JTA, 26 August 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, Mossad had established an undercover base in Morocco, sending agents and emissaries within a year to appraise the situation and organize continuous emigration.&lt;ref name=Cornut1/&gt;  The operations were composed of five branches: self-defence, information and intelligence, illegal immigration, establishing contact, and public relations.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=236-37|ps=:"The clandestine North African operation was composed of five branches. The first one was self-defense, and from this force Havillio chose commanders for the other branches. The second branch was information and intelligence in support of Framework's own operations: it had to know everything it could about the jewish communities, Moroccan government decision-making and the activities of Moroccan police and security organs. The third branch was illegal immigration. In the fourth branch, young Moroccan Zionists worked in the underground with the Mossad. Their main function, Havillio explained, was to establish the first contact with jewish families to ask them if they [were] ready and willing to go. The fifth branch was public relations aimed at obtalnlng secret support from key members of the jewish Community. This branch, which included an underground medical organization and maintained contacts with foreign diplomats and the press, would approach community members and say, for example, "You have industries, you can help us organize a secret stock of arms."}} Mossad chief [[Isser Harel]] visited the country in 1959 and 1960, reorganized the operations, and created a clandestine militia named the "Misgeret" ("framework").&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Cornut, Jerusalem Post, 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "When Isser Harel visited Morocco in 1959 and 1960, he was convinced the Jews were ready to leave en masse to return to Zion. Soon after, Harel replaced Havilio with Alex Gatmon as Mossad head in Morocco. A clandestine militia was created, the "Misgeret" ("framework"), with central command in Casablanca and operatives recruited across the kingdom. Its goal was to defend the Jewish communities and organize departures clandestinely."&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 persons in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956. Between 1955 and independence in 1956, 60,000 Jews emigrated.&lt;ref name=Cornut1&gt;Xavier Cornut, Jerusalem Post, 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "In 1954, Mossad head Isser Harel decided to establish a clandestine base in Morocco. An undercover agent named Shlomo Havilio was sent to monitor the conditions of Jews in the country. His report was alarming: The Jews feared the departure of the French colonial forces and the growing hostility of pan-Arabism; Jewish communities could not be defended and their situation was likely to worsen once Morocco became independent. Havilio had only one solution: a massive emigration to Israel. Harel agreed. Less than a year after his report, the Mossad sent its first agents and emissaries to Morocco to appraise the situation and to organize a nonstop aliya. About 90,000 Jews had emigrated between 1948 and 1955, and 60,000 more would leave in the months preceding the country's independence. Then, on September 27, 1956, the Moroccan authorities stopped all emigration, declaring it illegal. From then until 1960 only a few thousand left clandestinely each year."&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1956, Morocco [[French protectorate in Morocco#Independence 1956|attained independence]]. Jews occupied several political positions, including three parliamentary seats and the cabinet position of Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. However, that minister, [[Leon Benzaquen]], did not survive the first cabinet reshuffling, and no Jew was appointed again to a cabinet position.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the relations with the Jewish community at the highest levels of government were cordial, these attitudes were not shared by the lower ranks of officialdom, which exhibited attitudes that ranged from traditional contempt to outright hostility.&lt;ref name=Stillman173&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco's increasing identification with the [[Arab world]], and pressure on Jewish educational institutions to [[Arabization|arabize]] and conform culturally added to the fears of Moroccan Jews.&lt;ref name=Stillman173/&gt; Between 1956 and 1961, emigration to Israel was prohibited by law;&lt;ref name=Cornut1/&gt; clandestine emigration continued, and a further 18,000 Jews left Morocco.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On 10 January 1961 the ''[[Egoz (ship)|Egoz]]'', a Mossad-leased ship carrying Jews attempting to emigrate undercover, sank off the northern coast of Morocco. According to [[Tad Szulc]], the Misgeret commander in Morocco, Alex Gattmon, decided to precipitate a crisis on the back of the tragedy,{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=258|ps=:"After the sinking of the Egoz in January 1961, Gattmon decided to precipitate a crisis. He felt that given the degree of risk, illegal emigration could not continue much longer. An agreement with the Moroccans was vital, but he also knew that the Moroccans had to be pushed, and the Jews had to be reassured that the Egoz tragedy did not mean the end of all departures for Israel."}} consistent with Mossad Director [[Isser Harel]]'s scenario that "a wedge had to be forced between the royal government and the Moroccan Jewish community and that anti-Hassan nationalists had to be used as leverage as well if a compromise over emigration was ever to be attained".{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=259|ps=:"Gattmon's pamphlet corresponded to Harel's scenario - that a wedge had to be forced between the royal government and the Moroccan Jewish community and that anti-Hassan nationalists had to be used as leverage as well if a compromise over emigration was ever to be attained."}} A [[pamphlet]] agitating for illegal emigration, supposedly by an underground Zionist organization, was printed by Mossad and distributed throughout Morocco, causing the government to "hit the roof".{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=258-259|ps=:"Consequently, he arranged for the clandestine printing of 10,000 copies of a pamphlet declaring that no Jew and no Zionist who wanted to leave Morocco for Israel would be kept against his will in the kingdom; despite the sinking of the Egoz, illegal emigration would continue. It was also intended to convince the king that he should not keep people against their volition in order to foster the belief that Morocco was a tolerant country. The pamphlet, supposedly printed by an underground Zionist organization, was circulated throughout Morocco, and the government hit the roof. The Moroccan ambassador to the United States, Mehdi Ben Aboud, said in a speech before an American Jewish audience in Washington that the wreck of the Egoz had "brought to light [the] clandestine immigration operation... which has been exploited in a premeditated press campaign of distortion intended to serve Zionist purposes... We have had no Jewish problem in Morocco in the past, and we do not have a Jewish problem in Morocco today. Al-Istiqlal magazine, speaking for the nationalist opposition party, wrote that the pamphlets "were distributed by adventurers, hired by the Zionist state.""}} These events prompted King Mohammed V to allow Jewish emigration, and over the three following years, more than 70,000 Moroccan Jews left the country,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily as a result of [[Operation Yachin]].

[[Operation Yachin]] was fronted by the New York-based [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] (HIAS),{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=209a|ps=:"History seemed to repeat itself on a steamy day in August 1961 when an emissary from Jerusalem and the head of the principal private American Jewish immigration agency shook hands in New York on a secret agreement to cooperate in negotiating and organizing departures of Jews from Morocco to Israel, both legally and illegally, in the largest postwar enterprise of its kind. The handshake was between Jewish Agency representative Baruch Duvdvani, a sixty-five-year-old veteran of Palestinian illegal immigration operations, and [[Murray Gurfein|Murray I. Gurfein]], a fifty-four-year-old noted American jurist and president of the United HIAS Service."}} who financed approximately $50 million of costs.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=210|ps=:"Under the 1961 arrangement between HIAS and the Jewish Agency, over 100,000 Moroccan Jews, including entire villages in the Atlas Mountains, were directly helped by the Americans in emigrating to Israel; thousands more were later indirectly assisted by HIAS in leaving the country. The cost to HIAS, which relied on contributions from American Jewry, was close to $50 million."}} HIAS provided an American cover for underground Israeli agents in Morocco, whose functions included organizing emigration, arming of Jewish Moroccan communities for self-defense and negotiations with the Moroccan government.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=209b|ps=:"The essence of their agreement, an oral one, as was customary in such cases, was that HIAS would provide an American cover for the activities of underground Israeli agents in Morocco, which included organizing Jewish emigration from the North African kingdom, the arming of Jewish Moroccan communities for self-defense and a variety of other clandestine programs, in addition to highly discreet negotiations with the Moroccan government to facilitate the Jewish exodus."}} By 1963, the Moroccan Interior Minister [[Mohamed Oufkir|Colonel Oufkir]] and Mossad chief [[Meir Amit]] agreed to swap Israeli training of Moroccan security services and some covert military assistance for intelligence on Arab affairs and continued Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=275|ps=:"By mid-1963, Operation Yakhin had become virtually routine. [[Mohamed Oufkir|Colonel Oufkir]], the new Interior Minister in Morocco, and [[Meir Amit]], the new chief of the Mossad, concluded a secret pact that year providing for the training of Moroccan security services by the Israelis and limited covert military assistance in exchange for a flow of intelligence on Arab affairs and continued free departures of jews. In 1965, the Mossad rendered Oufkir the shocking and sinister service of tracking down [[Mehdi Ben Barka|Mehdi Ben-Barka]], the leader of the leftist opposition in Morocco, whom both the king and his Interior Minister wished dead. Amit agreed to locate Ben-Barka, and Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris from Geneva under false pretenses. Near a restaurant, French plainclothesmen arrested Ben-Barka and handed him over to Oufkir's agents. They then took him to the countryside, killed him and buried him in a garden. Investigations by the French government uncovered the truth, and the Ben-Barka affair became a political scandal in France, Morocco and Israel."}}

By 1967, only 50,000 Jews remained.&lt;ref name=Stillman175&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] led to increased Arab–Jewish tensions worldwide, including in Morocco, and significant Jewish emigration out of the country continued. By the early 1970s, the Jewish population of Morocco fell to 25,000; however, most of the emigrants went to France, Belgium, Spain, and Canada, rather than Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillman175/&gt;

Despite their dwindling numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco; the King retains a Jewish senior adviser, [[André Azoulay]], and Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies. Despite this, Jewish targets have sometimes been attacked (notably the [[2003 Casablanca bombings|2003 bombing attacks]] on a Jewish community center in Casablanca), and there is sporadic anti-Semitic rhetoric from radical Islamist groups. Invitations from the late King [[Hassan II]] for Jews to return to Morocco have not been taken up by the people who had emigrated.

According to [[Esther Benbassa]], the migration of Jews from the North African countries was prompted by uncertainty about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UaiipUj3SJ8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Tunisia+Jews+france+emigrate|author=Esther Benbassa|title=The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present |isbn=978-0-691-09014-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, over 250,000&lt;ref name="Stearns"/&gt;–265,000&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt; Jews lived in Morocco.

===Algeria===

[[File:Oran synagogue.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Great Synagogue of Oran]], Algeria, confiscated and turned into a mosque after the departure of Jews]]

As in Tunisia and Morocco, [[Algerian Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349/&gt;

Jewish emigration from Algeria was part of a wider ending of French colonial control and the related social, economic and cultural changes.{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38a|ps=: "Indeed, although the French premier, Pierre Mendes-France, proposed granting greater autonomy for Tunisia and gradual internal reforms for Morocco in 1954, the early 1950s were characterized by widespread nationalist resistance and concomitant economic, political, and social breakdown. Likewise, in Algeria, the outbreak of anti-French agitation in November 1954, ultimately pitting Front de liberation nationals terrorism against the French military's ruthless tactics, undermined the lives of many residents. In response, thousands of Muslims, Christians, and Jews left the region, often for France but also for Canada, South America, Israel, and elsewhere in Europe. Jewish migration was very much a part of this wider collapse of colonial control and the social, economic, and cultural change that followed.}}

The Israeli government had been successful in encouraging Morocco and Tunisian Jews to emigrate to Israel, but were less so in Algeria. Despite offers of visa and economic subsidies, only 580 Jews moved from Algeria to Israel in 1954-55.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=84|ps=: "While obtaining a fair level of success in gaining émigrés from Morocco and Tunisia, the government of David Ben-Gurion detected only minimal enthusiasm in Algeria. With the offer of visas and economic subsidies, 580 Jews ended up relocating in Israel between 1954 and 1955."}}

Emigration peaked during the [[Algerian War]] of 1954–1962, during which thousands of Muslims, Christians and Jews left the country,{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38b}} particularly the Pied-Noir community. In 1956, Mossad agents worked underground to organize and arm the Jews of Constantine, who comprised approximately half the Jewish population of the country.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=85|ps=: "Taking serious interest in the possible stakes raised by Arab nationalism in Algeria, the Israeli government did not limit its intervention to consular affairs. In 2005, the Israeli daily newspaper, the Maariv, carried a story about the historical activities of the Mossad in Algeria during the war of independence. The article cited interviews with former Mossad agents who recounted working underground and arming the young Jews of Constantine during the Algerian War to rout the ALN. Two former Mossad members, Shlomo Havilio and "agent" Avraham Barzilai, now 78, spoke openly about having been sent by Israeli special services to Algeria in 1956 to organize underground Jewish cells. They had in fact crossed into Algeria from Egypt where they had taken part in organizing armed resistance against Egyptian president Gamal Nasser."}} In Oran, a Jewish counter-insurgency movement was thought to have been trained by former members of [[Irgun]].{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=86|ps=: "Constantine was not the only region in which there was active militant intervention on the part of Israeli organizations. French sources concerning the surveillance of Israeli military activity in Algeria are not open to public viewing, but documents issued by the Information services in La Rocher allude strongly (laissé entendre) to the active presence in Oran of former Irgun (the Israeli national military Organization) members and to their training of Algerian Jewish commandos. In fact, French intelligence reports refer repeatedly to persistent rumors about a Jewish counter-insurgency movement consisting solely of Oranais Jewish youth who had come back from Israel where they received military training. No other evidence was given in the French surveillance reports save for mention that the tactics used by the Constantine Jewish militants resembled those once used by the Irgun."}}

As of the last census in Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians in Algeria (10 percent of the total population including 130,000."

As the [[Algerian Revolution]] began to intensify in the late 1950s and early 1960s, most of Algeria's 140,000 Jews began to leave.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=95}} The community had lived mainly in [[Algiers]] and [[Blida]], Constantine, and Oran.

Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria's 140,000 Jews, who had French citizenship since 1870 (briefly revoked by Vichy France in 1940) left mostly for France, although some went to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=33|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430010359/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=33|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 April 2007|title=The Forgotten Refugees - Historical Timeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important factors that influenced the Libyan Jewish community to emigrate were "the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers".{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #1|ps= "As stated above, many factors influenced and strengthened the determination of the Jewish community in Libya to emigrate. Most important were the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers. These soldiers played an instrumental role in reviving Zionism in the community and turning it into a pragmatic program to fulfill the dream of immigrating to Israel. Moreover, the rise of nationalism and preparations for independence made many members of the community suspicious and apprehensive about their future in Libya. The difficulties raised by the British in allowing Libyan Jews to immigrate dampened the enthusiasm of many, however."}}

Zionist emissaries, "shlichim", has begun arriving in the early 1940s, with the intention to "transform the community and transfer it to Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Simon, [http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/schlichim-in-palestine.pdf Shlichim from Palestine in Libya], page 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]] began to send emissaries to prepare the infrastructure for the emigration of the Libyan Jewish community.{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #2|ps= "The Jewish Agency and the Mossad Le Aliyah Bet (the illegal immigration agency) realized the potential of this immigration and decided as early as the summer of 1943 to send three clandestine emissaries—Yair Doar, Zeev (Vilo) Katz and Naftali Bar-Ghiora—to prepare the infrastructure for aliyah of the Libyan Jewish community. These emissaries played a crucial role in establishing the immigration infrastructure that would later, in a more advanced form, facilitate the mass of immigration of Libyan Jews."}}

In 1942, [[Afrika Korps|German troops]] fighting the [[North African Campaign|Allies in North Africa]] occupied the Jewish quarter of [[Benghazi]], plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of that group of Jews perished. At the time, most of the Jews were living in cities of [[Tripoli]] and Benghazi and there were smaller numbers in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] and [[Misrata]].&lt;ref name=berkeley /&gt; Following the allied victory at the [[Battle of El Agheila]] in December 1942, German and Italian troops were driven out of Libya. The British installed the [[Palestine Regiment]] in [[Cyrenaica]], which later became the core of the [[Jewish Brigade]], which was later also stationed in [[Tripolitania]]. The pro-Zionist soldiers encouraged the spread of Zionism throughout the local Jewish population{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=150}}&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0RY7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 Jewish Brigade: An Army with Two Masters 1944–45]'', Morris Beckman, The History Press, 2010, pp. 42–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Jewish Palestinian Volunteering in the British Army during the Second World War'', Vol. III. ''The Standard Bearers - The Mission of the Volunteers to the Jewish People'', (Hebrew, Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the liberation of North Africa by allied forces, antisemitic incitements were still widespread. The most severe racial violence between the start of World War II and the establishment of Israel erupted in [[1945 Tripoli pogrom|Tripoli in November 1945]]. Over a period of several days more than 130 Jews (including 36 children) were killed, hundreds were injured, 4,000 were displaced and 2,400 were reduced to poverty. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.&lt;ref name="Stillman, 2003, p. 145"&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Shefler]] writes that "As awful as the pogrom in Libya was, it was still a relatively isolated occurrence compared to the mass murders of Jews by locals in Eastern Europe."&lt;ref name="SaadonandShefler"/&gt; The same year, violent anti-Jewish violence also occurred in [[1945 Cairo pogrom|Cairo]], which resulted in 10 Jewish victims.

In 1948, about 38,000 Jews lived in Libya.&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The pogroms continued in June 1948, when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, a few months after the events in Tripoli, the American consul in Tripoli, Orray Taft Jr., reported that: "There is reason to believe that the Jewish Community has become more aggressive as the result of the Jewish victories in Palestine. There is also reason to believe that the community here is receiving instructions and guidance from the State of Israel. Whether or not the change in attitude is the result of instructions or a progressive aggressiveness is hard to determine. Even with the aggressiveness or perhaps because of it, both Jewish and Arab leaders inform me that the inter-racial relations are better now than they have been for several years and that understanding, tolerance and cooperation are present at any top level meeting between the leaders of the two communities."{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=68}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 84, Libya— Tripoli, General Records 1948–49; file 800–833, Taft to Secretary of State (23 November 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to Israel began in 1949, following the establishment of a [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] office in Tripoli. According to Harvey E. Goldberg, "a number of Libyan Jews" believe that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, given that the riots helped them achieve their goal.{{sfn|Goldberg|p=156|ps=: "Immigration began when the British authorities granted permission to the Jewish Agency to set up an office in Tripoli and organize the operation. As an indication of how the causes of events can be reinterpreted in terms of their results, a number of Libyan Jews have told me that their guess is that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, for they clearly had the effect of bringing the Jews to Israel"}} Between the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and Libyan independence in December 1951 over 30,000 Libyan Jews emigrated to Israel.

On 31 December 1958 a decree was issued by the President of the Executive Council of Tripolitania, which ordered the dissolution of the Jewish Community Council and the appointment of a Muslim commissioner nominated by the Government. A law issued in 1961 required Libyan citizenship for the possession and transfer of property in Libya, a requirement that was rejected to all but 6 Libyan Jewish individuals. Jews were banned from voting, attaining public offices and from serving in the army or in police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/the-final-exodus-of-the-libyan-jews-in-1967/|title=The Final Exodus of the Libyan Jews in 1967 - Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimenaexperience.org/libya/about-jimena/past-and-present/|title=Jewish History|website=jimenaexperience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], the Jewish population of 4,000 was again subjected to riots in which 18 were killed,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and many more injured. According to [[David Harris (advocate)|David Harris]], the Executive Director of the Jewish advocacy organization [[American Jewish Committee|AJC]], the pro-Western Libyan government of [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] "faced with a complete breakdown of law and order ... urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily", permitting them each to take one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. In June and July over 4,000 traveled to Italy, where they were assisted by the Jewish Agency for Israel. 1,300 went on to Israel, 2,200 remained in Italy, and most of the rest went to the United States. A few scores remained in Libya and others managed to return between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 155–156, "Finally, faced with a complete breakdown of law and order, the Libyan government urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily. Whereas, in the past, Jews had had considerable difficulty obtaining travel documents, Libyan officials were now visiting Jewish homes and issuing such documents on the spot. Escorts were provided to the airports. But departing Jews were permitted only one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. ... Predictably, the so-called temporary exodus in 1967 became permanent. A few score of Jews remained in Libya, while others managed, in the two years prior to Qaddhafi's coup d'état in September 1969, to return briefly in an attempt to regain their possessions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 1999, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Libyan government issued new laws that confiscated all the assets of Libya's Jews, issuing in their stead 15-year bonds. However, when the bonds matured no compensation was paid. Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] justified this on the grounds that "the alignment of the Jews with Israel, the Arab nations' enemy, has forfeited their right to compensation."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main synagogue in Tripoli was renovated in 1999, it has not reopened for services. The last Jew in Libya, Esmeralda Meghnagi, died in February 2002. Israel is home to about 40,000 Jews of Libyan descent, who maintain unique traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews in Islamic Countries: Libya|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/libyajews.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdadi Jews|Kurdish Jews}}
The [[Mandatory Iraq|British mandate over Iraq]] came to an end in June 1930, and in October 1932 the country became independent. The Iraqi government response to the demand of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] autonomy (the Assyrians being the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Eastern Aramaic-speaking Semitic descendants of the ancient Assyrians and [[Mesopotamians]], and largely affiliated to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]), turned into a [[Simele massacre|bloody massacre]] of [[Assyrians in Iraq#Independent Kingdom of Iraq|Assyrian villagers]] by the Iraqi army in August 1933. This event was the first sign to the Jewish community that minority rights were meaningless under Iraqi monarchy. [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], known for his liberal policies, died in September 1933, and was succeeded by [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]], his nationalistic anti-British son. Ghazi began promoting [[Arab nationalist]] organizations, headed by Syrian and Palestinian exiles. With [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], they were joined by rebels, such as the [[Amin al-Husayni|Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The exiles preached pan-Arab ideology and fostered anti-Zionist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Iraqi nationalists, Nazi propaganda began to infiltrate the country, as Nazi Germany was anxious to expand its influence in the Arab world. Dr. [[Fritz Grobba]], who resided in Iraq since 1932, began to vigorously and systematically disseminate hateful propaganda against Jews. Among other things, Arabic translation of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was published and Radio Berlin had begun broadcasting in Arabic language. Anti-Jewish policies had been implemented since 1934, and the confidence of Jews was further shaken by the growing crisis in Palestine in 1936. Between 1936 and 1939 ten Jews were murdered and on eight occasions bombs were thrown on Jewish locations.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farhud mass grave.jpg|thumb|Mass grave of victims of the [[Farhud]], 1941.]]
In 1941, immediately following the British victory in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], riots known as the [[Farhud]] broke out in [[Baghdad]] in the [[power vacuum]] following the collapse of the pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] while the city was in a state of instability. 180 Jews were killed and another 240 wounded; 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001). ''Locked Doors: The Seizure of Jewish Property in Arab Countries''. (Praeger/Greenwood) {{ISBN|0-275-97134-1}}, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some accounts the Farhud marked the turning point for Iraq's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'' ("Either way, the farhūd was a significant turning-point for the Jewish community. In addition to its effect on relations between Iraqi Muslims and Jews, it exacerbated the tensions between the pro-British Jewish notables and the younger elements of the community, who now looked to the Communist Party and Zionism and began to consider emigration.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxEJrEY22egC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=FARHUD+TURNING+POINT&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeb3UreLB8jjswaB8IHABA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20TURNING%20POINT&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, p. 350]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Meir-Glitzenstein's [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=FARHUD+BEGINNING+OF+THE+END&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YBr4UuXRE8S04AS5s4DICw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20DYNAMICS&amp;f=false book on zionism in Iraq, p. 213]&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, see the pivotal moment for the Iraqi Jewish community much later, between 1948–51, since Jewish communities prospered along with the rest of the country throughout most of the 1940s,{{sfn|Bashkin|2012}}&lt;ref name=Gat&gt;Moshe Gat, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jewish_Exodus_from_Iraq_1948_1951.html?id=o-mbui7U_awC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''], quote(1): "[as a result] of the economic boom and the security granted by the government. ... Jews who left Iraq immediately after the riots, later returned." Quote(2): "Their dream of integration into Iraqi society had been dealt a severe blow by the farhud but as the years passed self-confidence was restored, since the state continued to protect the Jewish community and they continued to prosper." Quote(3): Quoting [[Enzo Sereni]]: "The Jews have adapted to the new situation with the British occupation, which has again given them the possibility of free movement after months of detention and fear."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n21/adam-shatz/leaving-paradise London Review of Books, Vol. 30 No. 21 • 6 November 2008, pages 23–25, Adam Shatz], "Yet Sasson Somekh insists that the farhud was not 'the beginning of the end'. Indeed, he claims it was soon 'almost erased from the collective Jewish memory', washed away by 'the prosperity experienced by the entire city from 1941 to 1948'. Somekh, who was born in 1933, remembers the 1940s as a 'golden age' of 'security', 'recovery' and 'consolidation', in which the 'Jewish community had regained its full creative drive'. Jews built new homes, schools and hospitals, showing every sign of wanting to stay. They took part in politics as never before; at Bretton Woods, Iraq was represented by Ibrahim al-Kabir, the Jewish finance minister. Some joined the Zionist underground, but many more waved the red flag. Liberal nationalists and Communists rallied people behind a conception of national identity far more inclusive than the Golden Square's Pan-Arabism, allowing Jews to join ranks with other Iraqis – even in opposition to the British and Nuri al-Said, who did not take their ingratitude lightly."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishvoiceny.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2165:world-organization-of-jews-from-arab-countries-wojac-history-and-purpose&amp;catid=113:oped&amp;Itemid=296 World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC): History and Purpose, 17 October 2012, Heskel M. Haddad], "The turning point for the Jews in Iraq was not the Farhood, as it is wrongly assumed."&lt;/ref&gt; and many Jews who left Iraq following the Farhud returned to the country shortly thereafter and permanent emigration did not accelerate significantly until 1950–51.&lt;ref name=Gat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt;

Either way, the Farhud is broadly understood to mark the start of a process of politicization of the Iraqi Jews in the 1940s, primarily among the younger population, especially as a result of the impact it had on hopes of long term integration into Iraqi society. In the direct aftermath of the Farhud, many joined the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] in order to protect the Jews of Baghdad, yet they did not want to leave the country and rather sought to fight for better conditions in Iraq itself.{{sfn|Bashkin|2012|p=141–182}} At the same time the Iraqi government that had taken over after the Farhud reassured the Iraqi Jewish community, and normal life soon returned to Baghdad, which saw a marked betterment of its economic situation during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Moshe|title=The Jewish exodus from Iraq: 1948–1951|year=1997|publisher=Cass|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=071464689X|pages=23–24|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Shlomo Hillel ; translated by Ina|title=Operation Babylon |year=1988 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=978-0002179843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Farhud in 1941, Mossad LeAliyah Bet sent emissaries to Iraq to begin to organize emigration to Israel, initially by recruiting people to teach Hebrew and hold lectures on Zionism. In 1942, [[Shaul Avigur]], head of [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]], entered Iraq undercover in order to survey the situation of the Iraqi Jews with respect to immigration to Israel.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=206|ps=:"Even as Schwartz spoke, the Joint was secretly underwriting and helping organize Jewish emigration from Yemen, Aden and Iraq. In late 1946, the Mossad launched Operations Ezra and Nehemiah (known together as Operation Babylon) to save Jews from successive regimes in Iraq. This was really the second phase of an operation that dated back to March 1942, when Avigur smuggled himself into Iraq. Ephraim Krasner Dekel, the head of the Shai, had introduced Avigur to a Jewish sergeant in a British Army transport company which ran regular routes between Tel Aviv and Baghdad. Avigur disguised himself as the assistant driver of a military truck - it was the only time in his life he ever wore any military uniform - and went to survey the situation of the Iraqi jewish community of some 150,000, one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. After crossing the Syrian desert in unbearable heat, Avigur wasted no time in Baghdad contacting Jewish community leaders."}} During the 1942–43, Avigur made four further trips to Baghdad to arrange the required Mossad machinery, including a radio transmitter for sending information to Tel Aviv, which remained in use for 8 years.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208a|ps=:"During 1942 and 1943, Avigur made four more secret trips to Baghdad to set up the Mossad machlnery, including the installation of a clandestine radio transmitter that broadcast dally to Tel Aviv headquarters for eight years."}} In late 1942, one of the emissaries explained the size of their task of converting the Iraqi community to Zionism, writing that "we have to admit that there is not much point in [organizing and encouraging emigration]. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm."{{sfn|Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=64–65|ps=: Sereni's letter stated "If we thought before we came here and when we started our work that our main task would be to organize and encourage—today we have to admit that there is not much point in either of these activities. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm. ... We have to prepare for the future, to educate a generation of young people, to prepare a young guard that can do our work here. Forming a Zionist organization, a youth movement, a vanguard are the main tasks of the hour."}} It was not until 1947 that legal and illegal departures from Iraq to Israel began.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208b|ps=:"But Jewish departures, legal and illegal, did not start from Iraq until 1947, when enough pressures and bribery finally moved the royal government to let the Jews go, albeit gradually."}} Around 8,000 Jews left Iraq between 1919–48, with another 2,000 leaving between mid-1948 to mid-1950.&lt;ref name=Marqusee&gt;[[Mike Marqusee]], "Diasporic Dimensions" in If I am Not for Myself, Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====1948 Arab–Israeli War====
In 1948, there were approximately 150,000 Jews in Iraq. The community was concentrated in Baghdad and [[Basra]].

Before [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] vote, the Iraq's prime minister [[Nuri al-Said]] told British diplomats that if the United Nations solution was not "satisfactory", "severe measures should [would?] be taken against all Jews in Arab countries".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, included the following statement: "Partition imposed against the will of the majority of the people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab–Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred."&lt;ref name="unispal.un.org"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |accessdate=15 October 2013 |title=U.N General Assembly, A/PV.126,28 November 1947, discussion on the Palestinian question |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084808/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |archivedate=16 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February 1949, al-Said acknowledged the bad treatment that the Jews had been victims of in Iraq during the recent months. He warned that unless Israel would behave itself, events might take place concerning the Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name="UN1949NuriSaid1949"/&gt; Al-Said's threats had no impact at the political level on the fate of the Jews but were widely published in the media.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #1|ps=: "Although Nuri's threats had no impact on the fate of the Jews on the political level, they were prominently publicized in the media."}}

In 1948, the country was placed under martial law, and the penalties for Zionism were increased. Courts martial were used to intimidate wealthy Jews, Jews were again dismissed from civil service, quotas were placed on university positions, Jewish businesses were boycotted (E. Black, p.&amp;nbsp;347) and [[Shafiq Ades]] (one of the most important anti-Zionist Jewish businessmen in the country) was arrested and publicly hanged for allegedly selling goods to Israel, shocking the community (Tripp, 123). The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as [[Shafiq Ades]] could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer.&lt;ref name="Bashkin2012p90"&gt;{{harvnb|Bashkin|2012|p=90}}: "the general sentiment was chat if a man as well connected and powerful as Adas could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq forbade any legal emigration of its Jews on the grounds that they might go to Israel and could strengthen that state. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment together with public expressions of antisemitism created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

Like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq initially forbade the emigration of its Jews after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state. However, by 1949 Jews were escaping Iraq at about a rate of 1,000 a month.&lt;ref name="Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p.365"&gt;Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the British believed that the Zionist underground was agitating in Iraq in order to assist US fund-raising and to "offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees".{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|ps=: "In a confidential telegram sent on 2 November 1949, the British ambassador to Washington explained ... the general view of officials in the State Department is that the [Zionist] agitation has been deliberately worked up for two reasons:&lt;br&gt;
(a) To assist fund-raising in the United States&lt;br&gt;
(b) To create favourable sentiments in the United Nations Assembly to offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees. They suggest that the Israeli Government is fully aware of the Iraqi Jews, but is prepared to be callous towards the community, the bulk of which, as [[Eliahu Eilat|Dr Elath]] admitted, has no wish to transfer its allegiance to Israel."}}

The Iraqi government took in only 5,000 of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|c.700,000 Palestinians who became refugees]] in 1948–49 and refused to submit to American and British pressure to admit more.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=296|ps=: "Throughout that time (1948–1949), Iraq took in only about 5,000 refugees and consistently refused to admit any more, despite British and American efforts to persuade Iraq and Syria to do more to solve the problem."}} In January 1949, the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said discussed the idea of deporting Iraqi Jews to Israel with British officials, who explained that such a proposal would benefit Israel and adversely affect Arab countries.{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=610|ps=: "Shortly after his government assumed power in January 1949, Nuri al-Said toyed with the idea of deporting the Iraqi Jews to Israel. However, the British ambassador in Palestine warned him that such an act could have serious unanticipated repercussions. Israel, the ambassador explained, would welcome the arrival of cheap Jewish labor and would demand that in return the Arab states assimilate Palestinian refugees. In February 1949, the Foreign Office instructed the British ambassador in Baghdad, Sir Henry Mack, to caution Nuri al-Said against expelling the Jews, as this would adversely affect the position of the Arab states."}}&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119,124, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripp 2002 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meir-Glitzenstein, such suggestions were "not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq".{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=297a|ps=: "Nuri's proposals for a forced population exchange were not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq. He knew that Britain and the United States would not condone the deportation of Iraqi Jews to Israel."}} In July 1949 the British government proposed to Nuri al-Said a [[population exchange]] in which Iraq would agree to settle 100,000 [[Palestinian refugees]] in Iraq; Nuri stated that if a fair arrangement could be agreed, "the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine."{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=613|ps=: "In July 1949, the British, fearing the decline of their influence in the Middle East, put forward a proposal for a population transfer and tried to persuade Nuri al-Said to settle 100,000 Palestinian refugees in Iraq. A letter sent by the British Foreign Office to its legations in the Middle East spoke of an "arrangement whereby Iraqi Jews moved into Israel, received compensation for their property from the Israeli government, while the Arab refugees were installed with the property in Iraq". The British Foreign Office believed that "the Israeli government would find it hard to resist an opportunity of bringing a substantial number of Jews to Israel." In return, Nuri al-Said demanded that half the Palestinian refugees be settled in the territory of Palestine and the rest in the Arab states. If the refugee arrangement were indeed fair, he said, the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine. Under the terms of the plan, an international committee was to assess the value of the property left behind by the Palestinian refugees who would be settled in Iraq, and they would receive restitution drawn from the property of the Iraqi Jews who would be sent to Palestine.... In October 1949, the world and Israeli press reported the Iraqi-British plan for a population exchange (e.g., Davar, 16 October 1949). The publicity embarrassed the other Arab leaders and caused a stir in the refugee camps of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

====A reversal: Allowing a Jewish immigration to Israel====

In March 1950 Iraq reversed their earlier ban on Jewish emigration to Israel and passed a law of one-year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on the condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. According to [[Abbas Shiblak]], many scholars state that this was a result of British, American and Israeli political pressure on [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi]]'s government, with some studies suggesting there were secret negotiations.{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|p=79|ps=: "Many studies, however, while not rejecting all the official Iraqi justifications out of hand, see the law as the result of continuous pressure on Iraq from the British, American, and Israeli governments. Some studies go further, regarding Law 1/1950 as the culmination of secret negotiations involving these parties together with the [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi|al-Suwaidi]] government."}} According to [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]],&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; the Iraqi government was motivated by "economic considerations, chief of which was that almost all the property of departing Jews reverted to the state treasury"&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; and also that "Jews were seen as a restive and potentially troublesome minority that the country was best rid of."&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; Israel mounted an operation called "[[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]]" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel.

The Zionist movement at first tried to regulate the amount of registrants until issues relating to their legal status were clarified. Later, it allowed everyone to register. Two weeks after the law went into force, the Iraqi interior minister demanded a CID investigation over why Jews were not registering.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A few hours after the movement allowed registration, four Jews were injured in a bomb attack at a café in Baghdad.

Immediately following the March 1950 Denaturalisation Act, the emigration movement faced significant challenges. Initially, local Zionist activists forbade the Iraqi Jews from registering for emigration with the Iraqi authorities, because the Israeli government was still discussing absorption planning.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202a}} However, on 8 April, a bomb exploded in a Jewish cafe in Baghdad, and a meeting of the Zionist leadership later that day agreed to allow registration without waiting for the Israeli government; a proclamation encouraging registration was made throughout Iraq in the name of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=MG202/&gt; However, at the same time immigrants were also entering Israel from Poland and Romania, countries in which Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] assessed there was a risk that the communist authorities would soon "close their gates", and Israel therefore delayed the transportation of Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name=MG204/&gt; As a result, by September 1950, while 70,000 Jews had registered to leave, many selling their property and losing their jobs, only 10,000 had left the country.&lt;ref name=MG203/&gt; According to Esther Meir-Glitzenstein, "The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable." The delay became a significant problem for the Iraqi government of Nuri al-Said (who replaced Tawfiq al-Suwaidi in mid-September 1950), as the large number of Jews "in limbo" created problems politically, economically and for domestic security.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205a}} "Particularly infuriating" to the Iraqi government was the fact that the source of the problem was the Israeli government.

As a result of these developments, al-Said was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=MG205/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glitzenstein2004p205"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bashkin277/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkbride/&gt; On 21 August 1950 al-Said threatened to revoke the license of the company transporting the Jewish exodus if it did not fulfill its daily quota of 500 Jews,{{failed verification|date=May 2014|reason=Not in source, and doesn't make sense as he was not prime minister in August}} and in September 1950, he summoned a representative of the Jewish community and warned the Jewish community of Baghdad to make haste; otherwise, he would take the Jews to the borders himself.&lt;ref name="Hakohen2003p124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gat2013p119"/&gt; On 12 October 1950, Nuri al-Said summoned a senior official of the transport company and made similar threats, justifying the expulsion of Jews by the number of Palestinian Arabs fleeing from Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2014|reason=Is this the same as the August reference above?possible sourced- Gat 2013 p. 115}}

Two months before the law expired, after about 85,000 Jews had registered, a [[1950–1951 Baghdad bombings|bombing campaign]] began against the Jewish community of Baghdad. The Iraqi government convicted and hanged a number of suspected Zionist agents for perpetrating the bombings, but the issue of who was responsible remains a subject of scholarly dispute. All but a few thousand of the remaining Jews then registered for emigration. In all, about 120,000 Jews left Iraq.

According to Gat, it is highly likely that one of Nuri as-Said's motives in trying to expel large numbers of Jews was the desire to aggravate Israel's economic problems (he had declared as such to the Arab world), although Nuri was well aware that the absorption of these immigrants was the policy on which Israel based its future.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Minister of Defence told the U.S ambassador that he had reliable evidence that the emigrating Jews were involved in activities injurious to the state and were in contact with communist agents.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 1950 and June 1951, Jewish targets in Baghdad were struck five times. Iraqi authorities then arrested 3 Jews, claiming they were Zionist activists, and sentenced two — Shalom Salah Shalom and Yosef Ibrahim Basri—to death. The third man, Yehuda Tajar, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hirst |first=David |authorlink=David Hirst (journalist) |title=The gun and the olive branch: the roots of violence in the Middle East |publisher=Nation Books |date=25 August 2003 |page=400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALVtAAAAMAAJ |isbn=1-56025-483-1 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June 1951, arms caches were discovered that allegedly belonged to the Zionist underground, allegedly supplied by the [[Yishuv]] after the Farhud of 1941.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} There has been much debate as to whether the bombs were planted by the [[Mossad]] to encourage Iraqi Jews to emigrate to Israel or if they were planted by Muslim extremists to help drive out the Jews.

The emigration law was to expire in March 1951, one year after the law was enacted. On 10 March 1951, 64,000 Iraqi Jews were still waiting to emigrate, the government enacted a new law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship, and extending the emigration period.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #2|ps=: "On 10 March 1951, precisely one year after the Denaturalization Law had come into effect, when 64,000 people were still waiting to emigrate, the Iraqi legislature enacted a law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship."}}

The bulk of the Jews leaving Iraq did so via Israeli airlifts named [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]] with special permission from the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moia.gov.il/English/FeelingIsrael/AboutIsrael/Pages/ezraVenechmia.aspx|title=Operation Ezra and Nehemiah – the Aliyah of Iraqi Jewry (1950-1951)|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Aliyah and Immigrant Absorption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After 1951====
In 1969, about 50 of the Jews who remained were executed; 11 were publicly executed after [[show trial]]s and hundred thousand Iraqis marched past the bodies in a carnival-like atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of fear: the politics of modern Iraq'' By Kanan Makiya, chapter 2 "A World of Fear", University of California 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, there were only about 100 left of this previously thriving community.

====Background====
Although there was a small indigenous community, most Jews in Egypt in the early twentieth century were recent immigrants to the country,{{Failed verification|reason=Article does not support that the Egyptian Jews were recent immigrants.|date=December 2014}} who did not share the Arabic language and culture.&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233" &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qjaDq1sRwC&amp;pg=PA233 The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914–1952, Gudrun Krämer], page 233, Quote: "Not only were they not Muslim, and mainly not of Egyptian origin; most of them did not share the Arabic language and culture, either. Added to these factors was their political diversity."&lt;/ref&gt; Many were members of the highly diverse [[Mutamassirun]] community, which included other groups such as Greeks, Armenians, Syrian Christians and Italians, in addition to the British and French colonial powers.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=174-5}} Until the late 1930s, the Jews, both indigenous and new immigrants, like other minorities tended to apply for foreign citizenship in order to benefit from a foreign protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government made it very difficult for non-Muslim foreigners to become naturalized. The poorer Jews, most of them indigenous and Oriental Jews, were left stateless, although they were legally eligible for Egyptian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The drive to Egyptianize public life and the economy harmed the minorities, but the Jews had more strikes against them than the others. In the agitation against the Jews of the late thirties and the forties, the Jew has been seen as an enemy&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233"/&gt; The Jews were attacked because of their real or alleged links to Zionism. Jews were not discriminated because of their religion or race, like in Europe, but for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha]] told the British ambassador:
"All Jews were potential Zionists [and] ... anyhow all Zionists were Communists."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008 p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 November 1947, the head of the Egyptian delegation to the [[United Nations]] General Assembly, Muhammad Hussein Heykal Pasha, said, "the lives of 1,000,000 Jews in Moslem countries would be jeopardized by the establishment of a Jewish state."&lt;ref name="morris2008p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1947, Dr Heykal Pasha said: "if the U.N decide to amputate a part of Palestine in order to establish a Jewish state, ... Jewish blood will necessarily be shed elsewhere in the Arab world ... to place in certain and serious danger a million Jews. Mahmud Bey Fawzi (Egypt) said: "Imposed partition was sure to result in bloodshed in Palestine and in the rest of the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/$FILE/gapal83.pdf 29th Meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine: 24 November 1947: Retrieved 31 December 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000442/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/%24FILE/gapal83.pdf |date=31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exodus of the foreign mutamassirun ("Egyptianized") community, which included a significant number of Jews, began following the First World War, and by the end of the 1960s the entire mutamassirun was effectively eliminated. According to Andrew Gorman, this was primarily a result of the "decolonization process and the rise of [[Egyptian nationalism]]".{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #1|ps=: "In the course of the 40 years from the end of the First World War until the early sixties, this considerable mutamassir presence was effectively eliminated, a casualty of the decolonization process and the rise of Egyptian nationalism. The relation between these two phenomena was exacerbated by British policy."}}{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #2|ps=: "During the Second World War, at the insistence of British authorities, adult male Italian citizens were incarcerated as enemy aliens. In 1948, the foundation of Israel made the position of all Jews in Egypt increasingly tenuous, no matter what their nationality, and the position of Greeks was affected by the vicissitudes of the Greek Civil War in the 1940s. Another critical setback came during the Suez crisis in 1956 when all those who held British and French citizenship were deemed enemy aliens and expelled from the country."}}

The exodus of Egyptian Jews was impacted by the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Egypt]], though such emigration was not significant as the government stamped the violence out and the Egyptian Jewish community leaders were supportive of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. In 1948, approximately 75,000 Jews lived in Egypt. Around 20,000 Jews left Egypt during 1948–49 following the events of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (including the [[1948 Cairo bombings]]).&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; A further 5,000 left between 1952–56, in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] and later the [[false flag]] [[Lavon Affair]].&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; The Israeli invasion as part of the [[Suez Crisis]] caused a significant upsurge in emigration, with [[1956–57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt|14,000 Jews leaving]] in less than six months between November 1956 and March 1957, and 19,000 further emigrating over the next decade.&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt;

====Suez Crisis====
In October 1956, when the Suez Crisis erupted, the position of the mutamassirun, including the Jewish community, was significantly impacted.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=177|ps=: "Hand in hand with the British retreat from empire came the rise of a strident even chauvinist Arab nationalism, particularly after 1956. Since at least the 1930s the dominance of foreign interests in many parts of the Egyptian economy, had prompted increasing calls for Egyptianization. The initial measures, while slow to take effect, made it progressively difficult for foreign nationals, resident or not, to own and operate business interests or maintain employment. The situation became more difficult following Suez, when a large number of businesses owned by British and French nationals were confiscated. The final blow came in 1961 when, though not aimed specifically at the mutamassirun, the nationalization laws effectively deprived many of their livelihoods. The emigration, already well underway, now seemed unstoppable."}}

1,000 Jews were arrested and 500 Jewish businesses were seized by the government. A statement branding the Jews as "Zionists and enemies of the state" was read out in the mosques of Cairo and Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Jewish bank accounts were confiscated and many Jews lost their jobs. Lawyers, engineers, doctors and teachers were not allowed to work in their professions. Thousands of Jews were ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to take only one suitcase and a small sum of cash, and forced to sign declarations "donating" their property to the Egyptian government. Foreign observers reported that members of Jewish families were taken hostage, apparently to insure that those forced to leave did not speak out against the Egyptian government. Jews were expelled or left, forced out by the anti-Jewish feeling in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Hopwood2002p56"/&gt; Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left, mainly for Europe, the United States, South America and Israel, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets. Similar measures were enacted against British and French nationals in retaliation for the invasion. By 1957 the Jewish population of Egypt had fallen to 15,000.&lt;ref name=JVL-Jewish-Refugees-from-Arab-Countries&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/jew_refugees.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later====
In 1960, the American embassy in Cairo wrote of Egyptian Jews that: "There is definitely a strong desire among most Jews to emigrate, but this is prompted by the feeling that they have limited opportunity, or from fear for the future, rather than by any direct or present tangible mistreatment at the hands of the government."&lt;ref&gt;NARA 886B. 41 1/2-2060, Cairo to Department of State (20 February 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=47}}

In 1967, Jews were detained and tortured, and Jewish homes were confiscated.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}} Following the Six Day War, the community practically ceased to exist, with the exception of several dozens of elderly Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Yemen===
{{main|Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)}}
{{see also|Yemenite Jews|History of the Jews in Aden}}

The Yemeni exodus began in 1881, seven months prior to the more well-known [[First Aliyah]] from Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=51}} The exodus came about as a result of European Jewish investment in the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], which created jobs for labouring Jews alongside local Muslim labour thereby providing an economic incentive for emigration.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=52}} This was aided by the reestablishment of Ottoman control over the [[Yemen Vilayet]] allowing freedom of movement within the empire, and the opening of the [[Suez canal]], which reduced the cost of travelling considerably. Between 1881 and 1948, 15,430 Jews had immigrated to Palestine legally.{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=71}}

In 1942, prior to the formulation of the [[One Million Plan]], David Ben-Gurion described his intentions with respect to such potential policy to a meeting of experts and Jewish leaders, stating that "It is a mark of great failure by Zionism that we have not yet eliminated the Yemen exile [diaspora]."{{sfn|Shenhav|2006|p=31}}

If one includes [[Aden]], there were about 63,000 Jews in Yemen in 1948. Today, there are about 200 left. In 1947, [[1947 Aden pogrom|rioters killed at least 80 Jews in Aden]], a British colony in southern Yemen. In 1948 the new [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] unexpectedly allowed his Jewish subjects to leave Yemen, and tens of thousands poured into Aden. The Israeli government's [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] evacuated around 44,000 Jews from Yemen to Israel in 1949 and 1950.&lt;ref name=Stillman156-157&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration continued until 1962, when the [[North Yemen Civil War|civil war in Yemen]] broke out. A small community remained until 1976, though it has mostly immigrated from Yemen since. In March 2016, the Jewish population in Yemen was estimated to be about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |title=Mission to airlift Jews out of Yemen heralds the end of one of oldest Jewish communities |first=Kim |last=Sengupta |date=22 March 2016 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=23 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322083906/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |archivedate=22 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon and Syria===

====Background====
{{see also|History of the Jews in Lebanon|History of the Jews in Syria}}
The area now known as Lebanon and Syria was the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BCE.

====Lebanon====
[[File:Maghen Abraham Synagogue (side).JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Maghen Abraham Synagogue]] in [[Beirut, Lebanon]]]]

In November 1945, fourteen Jews were killed in anti-Jewish riots in [[Tripoli (Lebanon)|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Schulze. "Lebanon". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor [[Norman A. Stillman]]. Brill Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other Arab countries, the Lebanese Jewish community did not face grave peril during the 1948 Arab–Israel War and was reasonably protected by governmental authorities. Lebanon was also the only Arab country that saw a post-1948 increase in its Jewish population, principally due to the influx of Jews coming from Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref name=Parfitt&gt;Parfitt, Tudor. (2000) p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 24,000 Jews in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Hendler, Sefi (19 August 2006). "Beirut's last Jews". Ynet. Retrieved on 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest communities of Jews in Lebanon were in [[Beirut]], and the villages near [[Mount Lebanon]], [[Deir al Qamar]], [[Barouk]], [[Bechamoun]], and [[Hasbaya]]. While the French mandate saw a general improvement in conditions for Jews, the Vichy regime placed restrictions on them. The Jewish community actively supported [[Lebanese Independence Day|Lebanese independence]] after World War II and had mixed attitudes toward Zionism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

However, negative attitudes toward Jews increased after 1948, and, by 1967, most Lebanese Jews had emigrated—to Israel, the United States, Canada, and France. In 1971, Albert Elia, the 69-year-old Secretary-General of the Lebanese Jewish community, was kidnapped in Beirut by Syrian agents and imprisoned under torture in [[Damascus]], along with Syrian Jews who had attempted to flee the country. A personal appeal by the [[U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]], to the late President [[Hafez al-Assad]] failed to secure Elia's release.

The remaining Jewish community was particularly hard hit by the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]], and by the mid-1970s, the community collapsed. In the 1980s, [[Hezbollah]] kidnapped several Lebanese Jewish businessmen, and in the 2004 elections, only one Jew voted in the municipal elections. There are now only between 20 and 40 Jews living in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="jewcy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/religion-and-beliefs/jews_lebanon_another_perspective|title=The Jews of Lebanon: Another Perspective - Jewcy|date=20 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3292543,00.html|title=Beirut's last Jews|date=19 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 30,000 Jews in Syria. In 1949, following defeat in the Arab–Israeli War, the CIA-backed [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état]] installed [[Husni al-Za'im]] as the President of Syria. Za'im permitted the emigration of large numbers of Syrian Jews, and 5,000 left to Israel.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}}

The subsequent Syrian governments placed severe restrictions on the Jewish community, including barring emigration.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}} Over the next few years, many Jews managed to escape, and the work of supporters, particularly [[Judy Feld Carr]],&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin, 2001, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; in smuggling Jews out of Syria, and bringing their plight to the attention of the world, raised awareness of their situation. Although the Syrian government attempted to stop Syrian Jews from exporting their assets, the American consulate in Damascus noted in 1950 that "the majority of Syrian Jews have managed to dispose of their property and to emigrate to Lebanon, Italy, and Israel".{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 59, 883.411/7-2550, Damascus to Department of State (25 July 1950)&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1954, the Syrian government lifted its ban on Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Fischbach|2013|p=34}}

In March 1964, the Syrian government issued a decree prohibiting Jews from traveling more than three miles from the limits of their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329&lt;/ref&gt; During 1967, riots broke out in Damascus and Aleppo. Jews were allowed to leave their homes only for few hours daily. Many Jews found impossible to pursue their business venture because the larger community was boycotting their products. In 1972 demonstrations were held by 1000 Syrian Jews in Damascus, after four woman were killed as they attempted to flee Syria. The protest surprised Syrian authorities, who closely monitored Jewish community, eavesdropped on their telephone conversations, and tampered with their mail.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], the United States put pressure on the Syrian government to ease its restrictions on Jews, and during Passover in 1992, the government of Syria began granting exit visas to Jews on condition that they did not emigrate to Israel. At that time, the country had several thousand Jews. The majority left for the United States—most to join the large Syrian Jewish community in [[South Brooklyn]], New York—although some went to France and Turkey, and those who wanted to go to Israel were brought there in a two-year covert operation.&lt;ref name="Landis" /&gt;

===Transjordan and West Bank===

{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}

The [[Tel Or]] village was established in 1930 (or 1932) in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] in the vicinity of [[Naharayim]] hydroelectric power plant. The village of Tel Or was the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. The village was built as housing compound for operation crews of the power plant and their families,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818&lt;/ref&gt; being predominantly Jewish. Tel Or had existed until its depopulation in 1948 during the Arab–Israeli War, when it was overran by the Transjordanian forces. The families of the employees were evacuated in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Yishuv forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. The village of Tel Or was shortly abandoned by the residents, who fled to Yishuv-controlled areas to the West of Jordan.

In 1948 during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]], Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter population of about 2,000 Jews was besieged, and forced to leave en masse. The defenders surrendered on 28 May 1948. Colonel [[Abdullah el Tell]], local commander of the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]], with whom [[Mordechai Weingarten]] negotiated the surrender terms, described the destruction of the Jewish Quarter, in his Memoirs (Cairo, 1959):
[[File:Weingarten and Yehudit.jpg|thumb|right|Weingarten negotiating the surrender with Arab Legion soldiers]]

{{quote|... The operations of calculated destruction were set in motion. ... I knew that the Jewish Quarter was densely populated with Jews who caused their fighters a good deal of interference and difficulty. ... I embarked, therefore, on the shelling of the Quarter with mortars, creating harassment and destruction. ... Only four days after our entry into Jerusalem the Jewish Quarter had become their graveyard. Death and destruction reigned over it. ... As the dawn of Friday, May 28, 1948, was about to break, the Jewish Quarter emerged convulsed in a black cloud—a cloud of death and agony.|Yosef Tekoah (Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations) quoting Abdullah el-Tal.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;}}

Greenwood Publishing Group. 2006: P60. {{ISBN|0-313-32053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the emigration of [[Persian Jews]] from Pahlavy Iran in 1950s and later migration wave from [[Iran]] during and after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, during which the community of 80,000 dropped to less than 20,000.&lt;ref name=Mahdi/&gt; The migration of Persian Jews after Iranian Revolution is mostly attributed to fear of religious persecution,&lt;ref name=Mahdi/&gt; economic hardships and insecurity after the deposition of the Shah regime and consequent [[consolidation of the Iranian Revolution|domestic violence]] and the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

While Iranian constitution generally respects minority rights of non-Muslims (though there are some forms of discrimination), the strong anti-Zionist policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran created a tense and uncomfortable situation for Iranian Jews, who became vulnerable for accusation on alleged collaboration with Israel.

===Turkey===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Turkey|2003 Istanbul bombings}}

When the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, [[Aliyah]] was not particularly popular among Turkish Jewry; migration from Turkey to Palestine was minimal in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk. "Aliya to Mandatory Palestine and Israel". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. New York University (NYU). 5 December 2012 [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/aliya-to-mandatory-palestine-and-israel-COM_0001450]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1923-1948, approximately 7,300 Jews emigrated from Turkey to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507a|ps=:"From 1923 to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, it is estimated that 7,308 Jews emigrated from Turkey to Palestine.}} After the [[1934 Thrace pogroms]] following the [[1934 Turkish Resettlement Law]], immigration to Palestine increased; it is estimated that 521 Jews left for Palestine from Turkey in 1934 and 1,445 left in 1935.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507b}} Immigration to Palestine was organized by the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Aliya Anoar Organization. The [[Varlık Vergisi]], a capital tax established in 1942, was also significant in encouraging emigration from Turkey to Palestine; between 1943 and 1944, 4,000 Jews emigrated."{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508}}

The Jews of Turkey reacted very favorably to the creation of the State of Israel. Between 1948 and 1951, 34,547 Jews immigrated to Israel, nearly 40% of the Jewish population at the time.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508a}} Immigration was stunted for several months in November 1948, when Turkey suspended migration permits as a result of pressure from Arab countries.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508b|ps=: "Turkey, having not recognized Israel immediately after its proclamation of statehood, suspended permits to emigrate there in November 1948, in response to objections from Arab countries. However, this restriction did not stop the emigration of Jews by illegal means."}}

In March 1949, the suspension was removed when Turkey officially recognized Israel, and emigration continued, with 26,000 emigrating within the same year. The migration was entirely voluntary, and was primary driven by economic factors given the majority of emigrants were from the lower classes.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505–9|ps=:"However, the emigration of the Jews was not part of a government-mandated population exchange. On the contrary, the Jews immigrated to Israel of their own free will.... In the great wave of 1948–51, a large majority of the emigrants came from the lower classes.... These lower classes were less influenced by the Alliance Israelite Universelle schools and the republic's modernizing trends.... Even so, economic factors were the dominant theme among lower-class emigrants in their motivation to move."}} In fact, the migration of Jews to Israel is the second largest mass emigration wave out of Turkey, the first being the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505|ps=:"The migration of Jews from Turkey to Israel is the second largest mass emigration movement out of Turkey, the first being labour migration to Europe. The largest mass emigration of minorities from Turkey was that of the Greeks during the Turkish–Greek population exchanges of the early 1920s."}}

After 1951, emigration of Jews from Turkey to Israel slowed materially.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=511|ps=:"After the emigration of 34,547 Turkish Jews to Israel in 1948–51, in the period up to 2001 another 27,473 made their way to the Jewish state.... A total of 6,871 emigrants arrived in Israel in 1952–60, 4,793 in 1961–64, 9,280 in 1965–71, 3,118 in 19702–79, 2,088 in 1980–89, 1,215 in 1990–2000, and 108 in 2001.36 The migration figures then decrease greatly. Only 68 immigrants arrived in Israel in 2002, 53 in 2003 and just 52 in 2004."}}

In the mid 1950s, 10% of those who had moved to Israel returned to Turkey. A new synagogue, the [[Neve Shalom Synagogue|Neve Şalom]], was constructed in [[Istanbul]] in 1951. Generally, Turkish Jews in Israel have integrated well into society and are not distinguishable from other Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;Toktas, Sule.

On the night of 6–7 September 1955, the [[Istanbul pogrom]] was unleashed. Although primarily aimed at the city's [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek population]], the Jewish and [[Armenians|Armenian]] communities of Istanbul were also targeted to a degree. The caused damage was mainly material - more than 4,000 shops and 1,000 houses belonging to Greeks, Armenians and Jews were destroyed - but it deeply shocked minorities throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Güven, Nationalismus, Sozialer Wandel und Minderheiten: Die Ausschreitungen gegen die Nichtmuslime der Tuerkei (6–7 September 1955), Universitaet Bochum, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with Afghanistan was difficult at this time and with many Jews facing persecution around the world, reports reached the outside world after a delay and were rarely researched thoroughly.

At the time of [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Pakistani independence in 1947]], some 1,300 Jews remained in [[Karachi]], many of them [[Bene Israel]] Jews, observing [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jewish rites. A small [[Ashkenazi]] population was also present in the city. Some Karachi streets still bear names that hark back to a time when the Jewish community was more prominent; such as Ashkenazi Street, Abraham Reuben Street (named after the former member of the Karachi Municipal Corporation), Ibn Gabirol Street, and Moses Ibn Ezra Street—although some streets have been renamed, they are still locally referred to by their original names. A small Jewish graveyard still exists in the vast [[Mewa Shah Graveyard]] near the shrine of a Sufi saint. The neighbourhood of Baghdadi in [[Lyari Town]] is named for the Baghdadi Jews who once lived there. A community of [[Bukharan Jews]] was also found in the city of [[Peshawar]], where many buildings in the old city feature a [[Star of David]] as exterior decor as a sign of the Hebrew origins of its owners. Members of the community settled in the city as merchants as early as the 17th century, although the bulk arrived as refugees fleeing the [[Russian Conquest of Bukhara|advance of the Russian Empire into Bukhara]], and later the Russian Revolution in 1917. Today, there are virtually no Jewish communities remaining in Karachi or Peshawar.

The exodus of Jews from Pakistan to [[Bombay]] and other cities in India came just prior to the creation of Israel in 1948, when anti-Israeli sentiments rose. By 1953, fewer than 500 Jews were reported to reside in all of Pakistan. Anti-Israeli sentiment and violence often flared during ensuing conflicts in the Middle East, resulting in a further movement of Jews out of Pakistan. Presently, a large number of Jews from Karachi live in the city of [[Ramla]] in Israel.

===Sudan===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Sudan}}

The Jewish community in Sudan was concentrated in the capital [[Khartoum]], and had been established in the late 19th century. By the middle of the 20th century the community included some 350 Jews, mainly of Sephardic background, who had constructed a synagogue and a Jewish school. Between 1948 and 1956, some members of the community left the country, and it finally ceased to exist by the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;M. Cohen, ''Know your people, Survey of the world Jewish population''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakham&gt;I. Nakham, ''The notebook of the Jewish community of Sudan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Bangladesh}}
The Jewish population in [[East Bengal]] was 200 at the time of the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947. They included a [[Baghdadi Jew]]ish merchant community that settled in [[Dhaka]] during the 17th-century. A prominent Jew in [[East Pakistan]] was Mordecai Cohen, who was a Bengali and English newsreader on East Pakistan Television. By the late 1960s, much of the Jewish community had left for [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianjewishlife.org/pages/articles/AJL_Issue_10_Sept2012/AJL_Feature_Unknown-Jews-Bangladesh.html|title=Asian Jewish Life - Feature Issue 10 - The Unknown Jews of Bangladesh|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bechollashon.org/resources/newsletters/05-11/bangladesh-jewish-community.php|title=Be'chol Lashon: Educational Resources: Newsletters: May 2011: Bangladesh – with Jewish connections|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table of Jewish population since 1948==
In 1948, there were between 758,000 and 881,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,600. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which was about 3% Jewish, the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

==Absorption==
Of the nearly 900,000 Jewish emigrants, approximately 680,000 emigrated to Israel and 235,000 to France; the remainder went to other countries in Europe as well as to the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709061329/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1185379004431 Congress mulls Jewish refugee cause] by Michal Lando.

Gerber, Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience, 1994, Page 257, quote "Most of Algeria's 150,000 Jews emigrated to France, Tunisia's Jewish population of 110,000 departed for France or Israel, and Morocco's 286,000 Jews, the last community to depart, left in stages, the majority going to Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beit Lid Maabara 1950.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Jewish children in front of Bet Lid camp. Israel, 1950]]

The majority of Jews in Arab countries eventually immigrated to the modern State of Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillmanxxi&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Jews were temporarily settled in the numerous [[immigrant camps (Israel)|immigrant camps]] throughout the country. Those were later transformed into [[ma'abarot]] (transit camps), where tin dwellings were provided to house up to 220,000 residents. The ma'abarot existed until 1963. The population of transition camps was gradually absorbed and integrated into Israeli society. Many of the North African and Middle-Eastern Jews had a hard time adjusting to the new dominant culture, change of lifestyle and there were claims of discrimination.{{Citation needed|reason=at least one specific example of such discrimination is needed|date=February 2014}}

===France===
France was also a major destination and about 50% (300,000 people) of modern French Jews have roots from North Africa. In total, it is estimated that between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco immigrated to France due to the decline of the French Empire and following the Six-Day War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esther Benbassa]], ''The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The United States was a destination of many Egyptian, Lebanese and Syrian Jews.

==Views on the exodus==

===United States Congress===
In 2003, {{USBill|108|hconres|311}} was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by pro-Israel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/Ileana-Ros-Lehtinen-Ready-to-play-hardball Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: Ready to play hardball], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 23 December 2010, "I think she'll be terrific on Israel relations issues. I don't think there's anybody better," assessed [[Morris J. Amitay|Morrie Amitay]], former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and currently the head of the staunchly pro-Israel Washington Political Action Committee. "She's 100 percent behind making Israel secure. I can't think of any issue affecting Israel in which she hasn't been on the right side," enthused Amitay, whose PAC has funded her campaigns generously over the years"&lt;/ref&gt; congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]. In 2004 [[simple resolution]]s {{USBill|108|hres|838}} and {{USBill|108|sres|325}} were issued into the House of Representatives and [[United States Senate|Senate]] by [[Jerrold Nadler]] and [[Rick Santorum]], respectively. In 2007 simple resolutions {{USBill|110|hres|185}} and {{USBill|110|sres|85}} were issued into the House of Representatives and Senate. The resolutions had been written together with lobbyist group [[Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|JJAC]],{{sfn|Fischbach|2008}} whose founder Stanley Urman described the resolution in 2009 as "perhaps our most significant accomplishment"&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Urman, [http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf "Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610042110/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf |date=10 June 2012 }}, Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, American Sephardi Federation, [[World Jewish Congress]], transcript from Strategic Review Phase II, October 2009. Quote: "Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls 'multiple population of refugees' with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and 'any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees' ... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees."&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives resolution was sponsored by Jerrold Nadler, who followed the resolutions in 2012 with House Bill {{USBill|112|hr|6242}}. The 2007–08 resolutions proposed that any "comprehensive Middle East peace agreement to be credible and enduring, the agreement must address and resolve all outstanding issues relating to the legitimate rights of all refugees, including Jews, Christians and other populations displaced from countries in the Middle East", and encourages President [[Barack Obama]] and his administration to mention Jewish and other refugees when mentioning Palestinian refugees at international forums. The 2012 bill, which was moved to committee, proposed to recognize the plight of "850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries", as well as other refugees, such as Christians from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf.

Jerrold Nadler explained his view in 2012 that "the suffering and terrible injustices visited upon Jewish refugees in the Middle East needs to be acknowledged. It is simply wrong to recognize the rights of Palestinian refugees without recognizing the rights of nearly 1 million Jewish refugees who suffered terrible outrages at the hands of their former compatriots."&lt;ref name="HR 185 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Congress-considers-recognizing-Jewish-refugees |title=Congress considers recognizing Jewish refugees |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR 185"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/jewish-refugees-bill-being-considered-by-u-s-house-of-representatives-1.455503 |title=Jewish refugees bill being considered by U.S. House of Representatives |work=Haaretz |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recognition House"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4262885,00.html |title=House members seek recognition for Jewish refugees from Arab countries |publisher=Yedioth Ahronot |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have suggested the campaign is simply an anti-Palestinian "tactic",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Refugee Repatriation: Justice, Responsibility and Redress|first=Megan|last=Bradley|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107026315|page=91|quote="Although this is arguably not so much an attempt to secure meaningful redress for the Mizrahi as a tactic to stymie any productive discussion of the Palestinians claims, the campaign has been well-received in the United States, with resolutions on the issue introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives in February 2007."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Michael Fischbach explains as "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischbach|2008|ps=:"On 1 April 2008, the New York–based coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding "sense of the House" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab–Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as "refugees", the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185—which JJAC helped to write—was not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli government position===
The issue of comparison of the Jewish exodus with the Palestinian exodus was raised by the Israeli Foreign Ministry as early as 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Information Division. ''The Jewish Exodus from the Arab Countries, and the Arab Refugees''. 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a special campaign on behalf of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries was established and gained momentum. The campaign urges the creation of an international fund that would compensate both Jewish and [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian Arab]] refugees, and would document and research the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-urges-ban-ki-moon-to-place-plight-of-post-1948-jewish-refugees-on-un-agenda/ |title=Israel urges Ban Ki-moon to place plight of post-1948 Jewish refugees on UN agenda |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Gur, Haviv Retting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the campaign plans to create a national day of recognition in Israel to remember the 850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries, as well as to build a museum that would document their history, cultural heritage, and collect their testimony.&lt;ref name="Step up"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=282835 |title=Gov't steps up campaign for Jewish Arab refugees |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Sharon, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2012, a special event was held at the United Nations to highlight the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Israeli ambassador [[Ron Prosor]] asked the United Nations to "establish a center of documentation and research" that would document the "850,000 untold stories" and "collect the evidence to preserve their history", which he said was ignored for too long. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] said that "We are 64 years late, but we are not too late." Diplomats from approximately two dozen countries and organizations, including the United States, the European Union, Germany, Canada, Spain, and Hungary attended the event. In addition, Jews from Arab countries attended and spoke at the event.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"/&gt;

===Jewish "Nakba" narrative===

====Comparison with Palestinian Naqba====
In response to the Palestinian Nakba narrative, the term "Jewish Nakba" is sometimes used to refer to the persecution and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries in the years and decades following the creation of the State of Israel. Israeli columnist [[Ben Dror Yemini]], himself a Mizrahi Jew, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Dror Yemini |title=The Jewish Nakba: Expulsions, Massacres and Forced Conversions |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/891/209.html |work=Maariv |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2009 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|However, there is another Nakba: the Jewish Nakba. During those same years [the 1940s], there was a long line of slaughters, of pogroms, of property confiscation and of deportations against Jews in Islamic countries. This chapter of history has been left in the shadows. The Jewish Nakba was worse than the Palestinian Nakba. The only difference is that the Jews did not turn that Nakba into their founding ethos. To the contrary.}}

Professor [[Ada Aharoni]], chairman of The World Congress of the Jews from Egypt, argues in an article entitled "What about the Jewish Nakba?" that exposing the truth about the expulsion of the Jews from Arab states could facilitate a genuine peace process, since it would enable Palestinians to realize they were not the only ones who suffered, and thus their sense of "victimization and rejectionism" will decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ada|last=Aharoni |title=What about Jewish Nakba? |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3743829,00.html |work=YnetNews |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Canadian MP and international human rights lawyer [[Irwin Cotler]] has referred to the "double Nakba". He criticizes the Arab states' rejectionism of the Jewish state, their subsequent invasion to destroy the newly formed nation, and the punishment meted out against their local Jewish populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irwin |last=Cotler |title=The double Nakba |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=106021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The result was, therefore, a double Nakba: not only of Palestinian-Arab suffering and the creation of a Palestinian refugee problem, but also, with the assault on Israel and on Jews in Arab countries, the creation of a second, much less known, group of refugees—Jewish refugees from Arab countries.}}

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative in Israel====
Iraqi-born [[Ran Cohen]], a former member of the [[Knesset]], said: "I have this to say: I am not a refugee. I came at the behest of Zionism, due to the pull that this land exerts, and due to the idea of redemption. Nobody is going to define me as a refugee." Yemeni-born [[Yisrael Yeshayahu]], former Knesset speaker, Labor Party, stated: "We are not refugees. [Some of us] came to this country before the state was born. We had messianic aspirations." And Iraqi-born [[Shlomo Hillel]], also a former speaker of the Knesset, Labor Party, claimed: "I do not regard the departure of Jews from Arab lands as that of refugees. They came here because they wanted to, as Zionists."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Historian [[Tom Segev]] stated: "Deciding to emigrate to Israel was often a very personal decision. It was based on the particular circumstances of the individual's life. They were not all poor, or 'dwellers in dark caves and smoking pits'. Nor were they always subject to persecution, repression or discrimination in their native lands. They emigrated for a variety of reasons, depending on the country, the time, the community, and the person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=15627 "Arab Jews and Myths of Expulsion and Exchange"] The Palestine Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2010}}

Iraqi-born Israeli historian [[Avi Shlaim]], speaking of the wave of Iraqi Jewish migration to Israel, concludes that, even though Iraqi Jews were "victims of the Israeli-Arab conflict", Iraqi Jews aren't refugees, saying "nobody expelled us from Iraq, nobody told us that we were unwanted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Meron Rapoport |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |title=No peaceful solution |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=11 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050814015754/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |archivedate=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restated that case in a review of [[Martin Gilbert]]'s book, ''In Ishmael's House''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/8ae6559c-b169-11df-b899-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1u5I93QVU "In Ishmael's house"] ''[[Financial Times]]''. 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yehuda Shenhav]] has criticized the analogy between Jewish emigration from Arab countries and the Palestinian exodus. He also says "The unfounded, immoral analogy between Palestinian refugees and Mizrahi immigrants needlessly embroils members of these two groups in a dispute, degrades the dignity of many Mizrahi Jews, and harms prospects for genuine Jewish-Arab reconciliation." He has stated that "the campaign's proponents hope their efforts will prevent conferral of what is called a 'right of return' on Palestinians, and reduce the size of the compensation Israel is liable to be asked to pay in exchange for Palestinian property appropriated by the state guardian of 'lost' assets."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Israeli historian [[Yehoshua Porath]] has rejected the comparison, arguing that while there is a superficial similarity, the ideological and historical significance of the two population movements are entirely different. Porath points out that the immigration of Jews from Arab countries to Israel, expelled or not, was the "fulfilment of a national dream". He also argues that the achievement of this Zionist goal was only made possible through the endeavors of the Jewish Agency's agents, teachers, and instructors working in various Arab countries since the 1930s. Porath contrasts this with the Palestinian Arabs' flight of 1948 as completely different. He describes the outcome of the Palestinian's flight as an "unwanted national calamity" that was accompanied by "unending personal tragedies". The result was "the collapse of the Palestinian community, the fragmentation of a people, and the loss of a country that had in the past been mostly Arabic-speaking and Islamic. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yehoshua|last=Porath |title=Mrs. Peters's Palestine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1986/jan/16/mrs-peterss-palestine/?pagination=false |work= ''The New York Review of Books |date=16 January 1986 |accessdate=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alon Liel, a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry says that many Jews escaped from Arab countries, but he does not call them "Refugees" since his definition for the term "Refugee" is different from [[UNWRA]]'s [[Palestinian refugee#UNRWA|definition]].&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt;

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative by Palestinians====
On 21 September 2012, at a [[United Nations]] conference, the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries was criticized by [[Hamas]] spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, who stated that the Jewish refugees from Arab countries were in fact responsible for the Palestinian displacement and that "those Jews are criminals rather than refugees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=285923 | title=Hamas: Arab Jews are not refugees, but criminals | publisher=Jerusalem Post | accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the same conference, Palestinian politician [[Hanan Ashrawi]] has argued that Jews from Arab lands are not refugees at all and that Israel is using their claims in order to counterbalance to those of Palestinian refugees against it.&lt;ref name=jpost2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Hamas-Arab-Jews-are-not-refugees-but-criminals |title=Hamas: 'Arab Jews' are not refugees, but criminals |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashrawi said that "If Israel is their homeland, then they are not 'refugees'; they are emigrants who returned either voluntarily or due to a political decision."&lt;ref name=jpost2012/&gt;

==Property losses and compensation==
In Libya, Iraq and Egypt many Jews lost vast portions of their wealth and property as part of the exodus because of severe restrictions on moving their wealth out of the country.

In the North Africa, the situation was more complex. For example, in Morocco emigrants were not allowed to take more than $60 worth of Moroccan currency with them, although generally they were able to sell their property prior to leaving,{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} and some were able to work around the currency restrictions by exchanging cash into jewelry or other portable valuables.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} This led some scholars to speculate the North African Jewish population, comprising two thirds of the exodus, on the whole did not suffer large property losses.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=88|ps=: "[In] the Maghrib countries of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, Jews largely did not suffer large-scale property losses upon emigration.... Because proper dispossession largely was not a problem for Jewish emigrants from the Maghrib, it is difficult to find much information about Jewish property there."}} However, opinions on this differ.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Yemeni Jews were usually able to sell what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=49|quote=: "In fact, by and large, property dispossession did not feature into the saga of the Jewish exodus from Yemen. Yemeni Jewish emigrants usually sold what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates. others were so poor as to own practically nothing to begin with."}}

===Estimated value===
Various estimates of the value of property abandoned by the Jewish exodus have been published, with wide variety in the quoted figures from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hirschberg, Private Property Keep Out!, Jerusalem Report 10th Anniversary, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', September 1999, "In 1945 there were 870,000 Jews living in the Middle East and North Africa. By 1952, hundreds of thousands had arrived in Israel, and tens of thousands had reached Western Europe and North and South America. Estimates on the collective value of the property they left behind vary wildly - from a few billion dollars to more than $100 billion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) estimated in 2006, that Jewish property abandoned in Arab countries would be valued at more than $100 billion, later revising their estimate in 2007 to $300 billion. They also estimated Jewish-owned real-estate left behind in Arab lands at 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the state of Israel).&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196|title=The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality by Sidney Zabludoff|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=38842 |title=Jews forced out of Arab countries seek reparations |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ejhdoal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=82191 |title=Expelled Jews hold deeds on abandoned property in Arab lands |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and extent of linkage between the Jewish exodus from Arab countries and the 1948 Palestinian exodus has also been the source of controversy. Advocacy groups have suggested that there are strong ties between the two processes and some of them even claim that decoupling the two issues is unjust.&lt;ref name=Mendes&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985 The forgotten refugees: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113093432/http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985 |date=13 January 2013 }}, Presented at the 14 Jewish Studies Conference Melbourne March 2002.

[[Holocaust restitution]] expert Sidney Zabludoff, writing for the Israeli-advocacy group [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], suggests that the losses sustained by the Jews who fled Arab countries since 1947 amounts to $700m at period prices based on an estimated per capita wealth of $700 multiplied by one million refugees, equating to $6 billion today, assuming that the entire exodus left all of their wealth behind.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196 The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality]", Sidney Zabludoff, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 20:1–2 (Spring 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli position===
The official position of the Israeli government is that Jews from Arab countries are considered refugees, and it considers their rights to property left in countries of origin as valid and existent.&lt;ref name=MOJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJEng/Rights+of+Jews+from+Arab+Lands/|title=Rights of Jews from Arab Lands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Sephardi party, [[Shas]], announced its intention to seek compensation for Jewish refugees from Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/shas-to-seek-payout-for-jews-deported-from-arab-countries-1.258142|title=Shas to seek payout for Jews deported from Arab countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Israeli lawmakers introduced a bill into the Knesset to make compensation for Jews from Arab and Muslim countries an integral part of any future peace negotiations by requiring compensation on behalf of current Jewish Israeli citizens, who were expelled from Arab countries after Israel was established in 1948 and leaving behind a significant amount of valuable property. In February 2010, the bill passed its first reading. The bill was sponsored by MK [[Nissim Ze'ev]] (Shas) and follows a resolution passed in the United States House of Representatives in 2008, calling for refugee recognition to be extended to Jews and Christians similar to that extended to Palestinians in the course of Middle East peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;Kliger, Rachelle [http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=169043 Israel vies to bring Mideast Jewish refugees into talks] (18 February 2010) in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG202&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202}}: "For the first few weeks after the enactment of the law, the Zionist activists forbade registration; they were waiting for a clarification of the aliyah routes and a decision by the Israeli government as to its willingness to take in the Jews of Iraq. This ban heightened the tension in the Jewish community. On 8 April 1950, the Zionist leadership (that is, the leaders of Hehalutz and the Haganah, along with the emissaries) convened and discussed the registration issue in view of the pressure from huge numbers of people who wanted to sign up. At the end of the meeting the leadership decided to instruct the people to register and not to wait for instructions from Tel Aviv. A bomb had blown up that day in a Jewish cafe, wounding four people, and the two events were presumably related.... The activists' faith in the Zionist ideal and their zeal to implement it, combined with their confidence that Israel would not ignore the aliyah needs of Iraqi Jewry, paved the way to this decision. To inform the Jews of the decision, the leadership issued a proclamation.... The fact that the proclamation was written in the name of the State of Israel lent it added force and gave the Jews the impression that the State of Israel and the Israeli government were calling on them to leave Iraq and move to Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG204&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=204}}: "As stated above, this situation was a consequence of the Israeli immigration and absorption policy. Throughout this period, Israel refused to instruct its emissaries in Baghdad to limit registration for emigration and instead expressed willingness to take in all Iraqi Jews who wished to leave. But immigrants were also flooding into Israel at the time from Poland and especially from Romania, where the exit gates had unexpectedly been re-opened, and Israel was unwilling to limit aliyah from there either. Israel could not afford the initial absorption of such large numbers of immigrants and therefore set quotas based on priorities. And Poland and Romania were given priority over Iraq.... The reason given for according priority to immigration from eastern Europe was concern that the communist regimes there would close their gates and put an end to the exodus.... Ben-Gurion maintained that the Iraqi leaders were determined to get rid of the Jews who had signed up to emigrate and assumed that delaying their departure would not put an end to the process. In contrast, he was afraid that aliyah from Romania would be terminated suddenly by an order from high up, and aliyah from Poland was expected to stop at the beginning of 1951."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG203&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=203}}: "The change began as a result of the immigration policy of the Israeli government: the pace of aliyah lagged far behind registration and revocation of the registrants' citizenship.&lt;br&gt;By September 1950, only 10,000 Jews had left; 60,000 of the 70,000 registrants were still in Iraq. The problem grew worse. By mid-November only 18,000 of 83,000 registrants had left. Matters had not improved by early January 1951: the number of registrants was up to 86,000, only about 23,000 of whom had left. More than 60,000 Jews were still waiting to leave! According to the law, Jews who had lost their citizenship had to leave Iraq within 15 days. Although in theory, only 12,000 Jews still in Iraq had completed the registration process and had their citizenship revoked, the position of the others was not very different: the Iraqi government was in no hurry to revoke their citizenship only because the rate of departure was already lagging behind the revocation of citizenship, and it did not want to exacerbate the problem.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, thousands of Jews had been fired from their jobs, had sold their property, and were waiting for Israeli aircraft, using up their meagre funds in the meantime. The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG205&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205}}: "But soon the delay in evacuating the Jews became the problem of the Iraqi state and not just that of the would-be emigrants and the emissaries. The condition of the Jews had ramifications for the overall political situation, domestic security and the Iraqi economy. The Iraqi government found that the problems of instability and turmoil not only remained unsolved but had become worse. Particularly infuriating was the awareness that the source of the problem was the Israeli government, which held the key to the volume and rate of departure of Iraqi Jewry.&lt;br&gt;These developments changed Iraq's attitude towards the Jews. From now on Iraq sought to get rid of everyone who had registered immediately and at almost any price. This policy was exacerbated when, in mid-September 1950, Nuri al-Said replaced Tawfiq aI-Suwaydi, who had initiated the Denaturalization Law, as prime minister. Nuri was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible, and when he discovered that Israel was unwilling to increase immigration quotas he suggested various ideas for expelling the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

It arose from a decision of the Iraqi government to retaliate for the expulsion of Arab refugees from Palestine by forcing the majority of the Jewish community of Iraq to go to Israel. Nuri Said, the Prime Minister of Iraq, who was on a visit to Amman, came out with the astounding proposition that a convoy of Iraqi Jews should be brought over in army lorries escorted by armed cars, taken to the Jordanian-Israeli frontier and forced to cross the line. Quite apart from the certainty that the Israelis would not consent to receive the deportees in that manner, the passage of the Jews through Jordan would almost certainly have touched off serious trouble among the very disgruntled Arab refugees who were crowded into the country. Either the Iraqi Jews would have been massacred or their Iraqi guards would have had to shoot other Arabs to protect the lives of their charges. The devious method employed by Nuri Said to make the suggestion was, in itself, enough to upset the King and the cabinet, who still resented the way in which they had been left In the lurch by the Iraqi Government in the Armistice negotiations. Nuri first telephoned me asking to be received at my house with [[Samir al-Rifai|Samir Rifa'i]] to discuss an important question about Palestine. I agreed to the meeting on the natural assumption that Samlr already knew all about it. Nuri then spoke to Samlr and told him that I wanted to see both of them at my house. The latter assumed that the initiative came from myself. When we got together and Nuri made his proposal, and added the equally surprising statement that he would be responsible for the consequences, Samir and I were flabbergasted and our faces must have shown our feelings. Both of us were vexed at having been tricked into a false position. I replied at once that the matter at issue was no concern of His Majesty's Government. Samlr refused his assent as politely as possible, but Nuri lost his temper at being rebuffed and he said: 'So. you do not want to do It, do you?' Samlr snapped back, 'Of course I do not want to be party to such a crime', Nuri thereupon exploded with rage and I began to wonder what the head of the diplomatic mlsslon would do if two Prime Ministers came to blows in his study. We then broke up in disorder, but I got them out of the house while preserving a minimum of propriety.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''limiting case''' of a [[mathematical object]] is a [[special case]] that arises when one or more components of the object take on their most extreme possible values. For example:

* In [[statistics]], the limiting case of the [[binomial distribution]] is the [[Poisson distribution]]. As the number of events tends to infinity in the binomial distribution, the random variable changes from the binomial to the Poisson distribution.
*A [[Circle#Circle as limiting case of other figures|circle is a limiting case]] of various other figures, including the [[Cartesian oval]], the [[ellipse]], the [[superellipse]], and the [[Cassini oval]]. Each type of figure is a circle for certain values of the defining parameters, and the generic figure appears more and more like a circle as the limiting values are approached.
*[[Archimedes]] calculated an approximate value of [[π]] by treating the circle as the limiting case of a [[regular polygon]] with 3 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sides, as ''n'' gets large.
*In [[electricity and magnetism]], the [[long wavelength limit]] is the limiting case when the [[wavelength]] is much larger than the system size.
*In [[economics]], two limiting cases of a [[demand curve]] or [[supply curve]] are those in which the [[elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] is zero (the totally inelastic case) or infinity (the infinitely elastic case).
*In [[finance]], [[continuous compounding]] is the limiting case of compound interest in which the compounding period becomes infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as the number of compounding periods per year goes to infinity.

A limiting case is sometimes a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate case]] in which some qualitative properties differ from the corresponding [[Generic property|properties of the generic case]]. For example:

*A [[Point (geometry)|point]] is a degenerate [[circle]], namely one with [[radius]] 0.
*A [[parabola]] can degenerate into two distinct or coinciding [[parallel lines]].
*An [[ellipse]] can degenerate into a single point or a [[line segment]].
*A [[hyperbola]] can degenerate into two [[intersecting lines]].

{{Manipulative methods}}

'''Manual therapy''', or '''manipulative therapy''', is a physical treatment primarily used by [[physical therapist]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[chiropractor]]s, [[massage therapist]]s, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[osteopath]]s, and [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States| physicians]] to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability; it most  includes kneading and manipulation of muscles, [[joint mobilization]] and [[joint manipulation]].&lt;ref name=French1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French HP, Brennan A, White B, Cusack T |title=Manual therapy for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee - a systematic review |journal=Manual Therapy |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=109–17 |year=2010 |month= |pmid=21146444 |pmc= |doi=10.1016/j.math.2010.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Tissue Sports Massage|url=http://www.thetreatmenttable.com/treatments/deep-soft-tissue-massage/|website=The Treatment Table|publisher=The Treatment Table|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 literature review indicates that placebo is one of likely many potentially relevant mechanisms through which manual therapy improves clinical outcomes related to musculoskeletal pain conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid22294849"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bialosky JE, Bishop MD, George SZ, Robinson ME| title=Placebo response to manual therapy: something out of nothing? | journal=J Man Manip Ther | year= 2011 | volume= 19 | issue= 1 | pages= 11-9 | pmid=22294849 | doi=10.1179/2042618610Y.0000000001 | pmc=3172952 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22294849  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Irvin Korr, J. S. Denslow and colleagues did the original body of research on manual therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facilitated Segments: a critical review |url=http://www.cpdo.net/res/page15.html |website=cpdo.net |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korr described it as the "Application of an accurately determined and specifically directed manual force to the body, in order to improve mobility in areas that are restricted; in joints, in connective tissues or in skeletal muscles."&lt;ref name="Korr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=I.M.

According to the ''Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice'' manual therapy is defined as a clinical approach utilizing specific hands-on techniques, including but not limited to manipulation/mobilization, used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissues and joint structures for the purpose of modulating pain; increasing range of motion (ROM); reducing or eliminating soft tissue inflammation; inducing relaxation; improving contractile and non-contractile tissue repair, extensibility, and/or stability; facilitating movement; and improving function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice |url=https://aaompt.org/aaompt_data/documents/AAOMPT_2008_MT_DASP_FINAL.pdf |website=aaompt.org |publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus study of US chiropractors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gatterman MI, Hansen DT | title = Development of chiropractic nomenclature through consensus | journal = J Manipulative Physiological Therapeutics | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 302–309 | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined manual therapy (generally known as the "chiropractic adjustment" in the profession) as "Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues."

== Use and method ==

In [[Western Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australasia]], manual therapy is usually practiced by members of specific health care professions (e.g. [[Chiropractor]]s, Occupational Therapists, [[Osteopath]]s, [[Osteopathic physician]]s, [[Physiotherapist]]s/Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and [[Physiatrist]]s).&lt;ref name="French1"/&gt; However, some lay practitioners (not members of a structured profession), such as [[bonesetters]] also provide some forms of manual therapy.

A survey released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] focused on who used [[:category:alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM), what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults during 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine, According to New Government Survey|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm|work=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|publisher=National Institute for Health|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massage was the fifth most commonly use CAM in the [[United States]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Most Common CAM Therapies Among Adults - 2007 |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/2007/most-common-cam-therapies-among-adults |website=nccih.nih.gov |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques ===

* [[Myofascial]] Therapy targets the muscle and fascial systems, promotes flexibility and mobility of the body's connective tissues. It is said to mobilize adhesions and reduce severity/sensitivity of scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul van den Dolder, Paulo Ferreira, and Kathryn Refshauge|title=Is soft tissue massage an effective treatment for mechanical shoulder pain? A study protocol|pmc=3103116|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=US National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical analysis finds that the relevance of fascia to therapy doubtful.&lt;ref name=fascia&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingraham |first1=Paul |title=Does Fascia Matter? |url=https://www.painscience.com/articles/does-fascia-matter.php |website=painscience.com |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Massage]] may be used as part of a treatment. Proponents claim this may reduce inflammation. Science writer Paul Ingraham notes that there is no evidence to support the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingraham |first1=Paul |title=Massage does not reduce inflammation and promote mitochondria |url=https://www.painscience.com/articles/research-crane.php |website=painscience.com |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friction massage is said to increase mobilization of adhesions between fascial layers, muscles, compartments and other soft tissues. They are thought to create an inflammatory response and instigate focus to injured areas. A 2012 systematic review found that no additional benefit was incurred from the inclusion of deep tissue friction massage in a therapeutic regime, although the conclusions were limited by the small sample sizes in available randomized clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Brosseau Casimiro Milne Welch p. "&gt;{{cite | last=Brosseau | first=Lucie | last2=Casimiro | first2=Lynn | last3=Milne | first3=Sarah | last4=Welch | first4=Vivian | last5=Shea | first5=Beverley | last6=Tugwell | first6=Peter | last7=Wells | first7=George A | editor-last=Brosseau | editor-first=Lucie | title=Deep transverse friction massage for treating tendinitis | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | publication-place=Chichester, UK | date=21 October 2002 | doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003528 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Soft Tissue Technique]] is firm, direct pressure to relax hypertonic muscles and stretch tight fascial structures. A 2015 review concluded that the Technique is ineffective for [[Low back pain|lower back pain]], and the quality of research testing its effectiveness is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Muscle energy technique for non-specific low-back pain |vauthors=Franke H, Fryer G, Ostelo R, Kamper S |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009852.pub2 |url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009852.pub2/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trigger Point techniques claim to address [[Myofascial]] [[Trigger points]], though the explanation of how this works is controversial&lt;ref name=fascia/&gt; and reviews in 2008 and 2009 call into question whether trigger points are a valid diagnosis at all given the small amounts of poor quality evidence available.&lt;ref name="pmid19158550"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lucas N, Macaskill P, Irwig L, Moran R, Bogduk N| title=Reliability of physical examination for diagnosis of myofascial trigger points: a systematic review of the literature. | journal=Clin J Pain | year= 2009 | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 80-9 | pmid=19158550 | doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31817e13b6 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19158550  }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18503816"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Myburgh C, Larsen AH, Hartvigsen J| title=A systematic, critical review of manual palpation for identifying myofascial trigger points: evidence and clinical significance. | journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil | year= 2008 | volume= 89 | issue= 6 | pages= 1169-76 | pmid=18503816 | doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.12.033 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18503816  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretching ===
{{Main|Stretching}}

From the main article's effectiveness section:
*[[evidence-based medicine|Medical evidence]] has shown stretching has no meaningful benefit in preventing muscle soreness.&lt;ref name=coch&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert RD, de Noronha M, Kamper SJ |title=Stretching to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=7 |pages=CD004577 |year=2011 |pmid=21735398 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004577.pub3 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Apart from before running, stretching does not appear to reduce risk of injury during exercise.&lt;ref name=behm&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behm DG, Blazevich AJ, Kay AD, McHugh M |title=Acute effects of muscle stretching on physical performance, range of motion, and injury incidence in healthy active individuals: a systematic review |journal=Appl Physiol Nutr Metab |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2016 |pmid=26642915 |doi=10.1139/apnm-2015-0235 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some evidence shows that pre-exercise stretching may increase range of movement.&lt;ref name=behm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Current concepts in muscle stretching for exercise and rehabilitation |journal=International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy | pmc=3273886 | pmid=22319684 |volume=7 |year=2012 |pages=109–19 |author=Page P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Mayo Clinic]] advises against bouncing, and to hold for thirty seconds. They suggest warming up before stretching or stretching post-exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20047931|title=Stretching is not a warm up! Find out why|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
{{Main|Elastic therapeutic tape}}

Manual therapy practitioners often use therapeutic taping to relieve pressure on injured soft tissue, alter muscle firing patterns or prevent re-injury.  Some techniques are designed to enhance [[lymphatic fluid]] exchange. After a soft tissue injury to muscles or tendons from sports activities, over exertion or [[repetitive strain injury]] swelling may impede blood flood to the area and slow healing.  Elastic taping methods may relieve pressure from swollen tissue and enhance circulation to the injured area.

According to the [[medical]] and [[skeptical]] community there is no known benefit from this technique and it is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=SBM2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|authorlink1=Steven Novella|title=Olympic Pseudoscience|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/olympic-pseudoscience/|website=Sciencebasedmedicine.org|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234517/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/olympic-pseudoscience/|archivedate=13 March 2018|date=25 July 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SBM2018&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Clay|title=A Miscellany of Medical Malarkey Episode 3: The Revengening|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-miscellany-of-medical-malarkey-episode-3-the-revengening/|website=ScienceBasedMedicine.org|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313003054/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-miscellany-of-medical-malarkey-episode-3-the-revengening/|archivedate=13 March 2018|date=9 March 2018|dead-url=no}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinesio Tape for Athletes: A Big Help, or Hype?|url=https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/kinesio-tape-athletes-help-hype#1|website=WebMD.com|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312235007/https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/kinesio-tape-athletes-help-hype#1|archivedate=13 March 2018||dead-url=no}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles of manual therapy ==

There are many different styles of manual therapy. It is a fundamental feature of [[ayurvedic]] medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and some forms of [[New Age]] [[alternative medicine]] as well as being used by mainstream medical practitioners. Hands-on bodywork is a feature of therapeutic interactions in traditional cultures around the world.

In India, Tamil traditional Medicinal system is present since centuries ago called "Siddha Maruthuvam"("Siddha Medicine").
In Siddha system of medicine, "Thokkanam and Varmam" are the external therapeutic modalities.It is present in the medical syllabus of siddha medicine which is now followed by syllabus committee members in The Tamilnadu Dr. M. G. R. Medical university, Guindy, Tamilnadu.People should be aware of the Siddha system which offers manual therapy too.

'''Multiple-classification ripple-down rules (MCRDR)''' is an incremental [[knowledge acquisition]] technique which preserves the benefits and essential strategy of [[ripple-down rules]] (RDR) in handling the multiple classifications. MCRDR, the extension of RDR, is based on the assumption that the knowledge an expert provides is essentially a justification for a conclusion in a particular context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=B.Kang, P. Compton and P.Preston | title=Multiple classification ripple down rules: evaluation and possibilities | booktitle=In The 9th Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge Based Systems Workshop | year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''N''-body units''' are a completely self-contained [[Systems of measurement|system of units]] used for [[N-body simulation]]s of self-gravitating systems in astrophysics. In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the total mass, ''M'', the [[gravitational constant]], ''G'', and the [[Virial theorem#Virial radius|virial radius]], ''R'', are normalized. The underlying assumption is that the system of ''N'' objects (stars) satisfies the [[virial theorem]]. The consequence of standard N-body units is that the velocity dispersion of the system, ''v'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; and that the dynamical or crossing time, ''t'', is &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle 2\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of standard N-body units was advocated by [[Michel Hénon]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hénon | first = Michel | authorlink = Michel Hénon

"The '''normalization''' principle means making available to all [[people with disabilities]] patterns of life and conditions of everyday living which are as close as possible to the regular circumstances and ways of life or society."&lt;ref&gt;''The basis and logic of the normalisatioprinciple'', Bengt Nirje, Sixth International Congress of IASSMD, Toronto, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization is a rigorous theory of human services that can be applied to disability services.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Glenn, L. (1973). "Program Analysis of Service Systems (PASS): A Method for the Quantitative Evaluation of Human Services". Vol. 1. Handbook. Volume II. Field Manual. Downsview, Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization theory arose in the early 1970s, towards the end of the institutionalisation period in the US; it is one of the strongest and long lasting integration theories for people with severe disabilities.

== Definition==
Normalization involves the acceptance of  some people with disabilities, with their disabilities, offering them the same conditions as are offered to other citizens. It involves an awareness of the normal rhythm of life – including the normal rhythm of a day, a week, a year, and the life-cycle itself (e.g., celebration of holidays; workday and weekends). It involves the normal conditions of life – housing, schooling, employment, exercise, recreation and freedom of choice previously denied to individuals with severe, profound, or significant disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, Bengt as cited in S. Cohen &amp; C. Gothelf. (1988). A Preservice Trining Curriculum for Administrators for Community-Based Residential Programs Service People with Developmental Disabilities. NY, NY: City University of New York, Hunter College.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfensberger's definition is based on a concept of cultural normativeness: "Utilization of a means which are as culturally normative as possible, in order to establish and/or maintain personal behaviors and characteristics that are as culturally normative as possible." Thus, for example, "medical procedures" such as shock treatment or restraints, are not just punitive, but also not "culturally normative" in society. His principle is based upon social and physical integration, which later became popularized, implemented and studied in services as [[community integration]] encompassing areas from work to recreation and living arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientation Manual on Mental Retardation'', Pt. 1. Downsview, Ontario: National Institute on Mental Retardation, Kinsmen NIMR Building, pp. 41-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical foundations===
This theory includes "the [[dignity of risk]]", rather than an emphasis on "protection"&lt;ref&gt;''Misconceptions on the principle of normalisation'', Bank-Mikkelsen, Address to IASSMD Conference, Washington, D.C., 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based upon the concept of integration in community life. The theory is one of the first to examine comprehensively both the individual and the service systems, similar to theories of human ecology which were competitive in the same period.

The theory undergirds the deinstitutionalization and community integration movements, and forms the legal basis for affirming rights to education, work, community living, medical care and citizenship. In addition, self-determination theory could not develop without this conceptual academic base to build upon and critique.&lt;ref&gt;Allard, M., Howard, A., Vorderer, L. &amp; Wells, A. (1999). "Ahead of His Time: Selected Speeches of Gunnar Dybwad." Washington, DC: American Association on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[social role valorization]] is closely related to the principle of normalization&lt;ref&gt;Nirje, B. (1985). The basis and logic of the normalization principle. ''Australian and New Zealand Journal of Developmental Disabilities'', 11(2): 65-68.&lt;/ref&gt; having been developed with normalization as a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1983). Social role valorization: A proposed new term for the principle of normalization. ''Mental Retardation, 21'', 234-9.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory retains most aspects of normalization concentrating on socially valued roles and means, in socially valued contexts to achieve integration and other core quality of life values.

== History ==
The principle of normalization was developed in [[Scandinavia]] during the sixties and articulated by [[Bengt Nirje]] of the Swedish Association for Retarded Children with the US human service system a product of [[Wolf Wolfensberger]] formulation of normalization and evaluations of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The normalisation principle and its human management implications, in R. Kugel &amp; W. Wolfensberger (Eds.) ''Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded'', Washington, D.C: President’s Committee on Mental Retardation, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1972). ''The Principle of Normalization in Human Services''. Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the history taught in the 1970s, although the "exact origins are not clear", the names Bank-Mikkelson (who moved the principle to Danish law), Grunewald, and Nirje from Scandinavia (later Ministry of Community and Social Services in Toronto, Canada) are associated with early work on this principle. Wolfensberger is credited with authoring the first textbook as a "well-known scholar, leader, and scientist" and Rutherford H. (Rud) Turnbull III reports that integration principles are incorporated in US laws.

===Academe===
The principle was developed and taught at the university level and in field education during the seventies, especially by [[Wolf Wolfensberger]] of the United States, one of the first clinical psychologists in the field of mental retardation, through the support of [[Canada]] and the [[National Institute on Mental Retardation]] (NIMR) and Syracuse University in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolfensberger, W. (1972). The Principle of Normalization in Human Services'' Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt; PASS and PASSING marked the quantification of service evaluations based on normalization, and in 1991 a report was issued on the quality of institutional and community programs in the US and Canada based on a sample of 213 programs in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R. J., LaPointe, N., Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Thomas, S. (1991, July 19). Quality of Institutional and Community Human Service Programs in Canada and the United States. ""Journal of Psychiatry and Neurosciences"", 16(3): 146-153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance in structuring service systems===
Normalization has had a significant effect on the way services for people with disabilities have been structured throughout the UK, Europe, especially Scandinavia, North America, Israel, Australasia (e.g., New Zealand) and increasingly, other parts of the world. It has led to a new conceptualisation of disability as not simply being a medical issue (the [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] which saw the person as indistinguishable from the disorder, though Wolfensberger continued to use the term into the 2000s,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Associates. (2001). "The 19th Century "Moral Treatment" Approach to Human Services, Especially to the Treatment of Mental Disorder, and Lessons for Services for Our Own Day". Syracuse, NY: Training Institute for Human Services Planning, Leadership and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt; but as a [[Social model of disability|social situation]] as described in [[social role valorization]].

Government reports began from the 1970s to reflect this changing view of disability (Wolfensberger uses the term devalued people), e.g. the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board report of 1981 made recommendations on "the rights of people with intellectual handicaps to receive appropriate services, to assert their rights to independent living so far as this is possible, and to pursue the principle of normalization." The New York State Quality of Care Commission also recommended education based upon principles of normalization and social role valorization addressing "deep-seated negative beliefs of and about people with disabilities".&lt;ref&gt;Cashen, J. (1989, Nov-Dec). The need for value-enhancement training and informal support systems. ''Quality of Care'', Issue 42: 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfensberger's work was part of a major systems reform in the US and Europe of how individuals with disabilities whould be served, resulting in the growth in community services in support of homes, families and community living.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R.J. &amp; Nitsch, K.E. (1980). ''Normalization, Social Integration and Community Services''. (pp. 117-129). Baltimore, MD; Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. Bogdan, R. &amp; Racino, J. (1991). ''Life in the Community: Case Studies of Organizations Supporting People with Disabilities''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical ideology of human services===
Normalization is often described in articles and education texts that reflect deinstitutionalization, family care or community living as the ideology of human services.&lt;ref&gt;Landesman, S. &amp; Butterfield, E. (1987, August). Normalization and deinstitutionalization of mentally retarded individuals: Controversy and facts. "American Psychologist", 42: 809-816.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruininks, R.H. &amp; Lakin, K.C. (1985). Living and Learning in the Least Restrictive Environment". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots are European-American, and as discussed in education fields in the 1990s, reflect a traditional gender relationship-position (Racino, 2000), among similar diversity critiques of the period (i.e., multiculturalism).&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (2000). "Personnel Preparation in Disability: Toward Universal Approaches to Support". Binghamton, NY: Charles C. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Normalization has undergone extensive reviews and critiques, thus increasing its stature through the decades often equating it with school mainstreaming, life success and normalization,and deinstitutionalization.&lt;ref&gt;Zipperlin, H. (1975). Normalization. In: J. Wortis (Ed.), "Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, VII". NY, NY: Brumer Mazel Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, A. (1992). Towards a sociological critique of normalisation principle. "Disability, Handicap and Society", 7(1): 35-51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, L. (1977). "Normalization" and related concepts: Words and ambiguities. ''Child Welfare'', 56(5): 301-310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, M.J. (1992). "Try Harder": The experience of disability and dilemmas of normalization. aina; ap. Ferguson, D. Ferguson, &amp; S. Taylor (Eds), ''Interpreting Disability: A Qualitative Reader''. NY &amp; London: Teachers College, Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In contemporary society==
{{essay|section|date=April 2015}}
In the United States, large public institutions housing adults with developmental disabilities began to be phased out as a primary means of delivering services in the early 1970s and the statistics have been documented until the present day (2015) by David Braddock and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Braddock, D., Hemp, R., Fujiura, G., Bachelder, L., &amp; Mitchell, D. (1990). "The State of the States in Developmental Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the late 1960s, the normalization principle was described to change the pattern of residential services, as exposes occurred in the US and reform initiatives began in Europe. These proposed changes were described in the leading text by the President's Committee on Mental Retardation (PCMR) titled: "Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded" with leaders Burton Blatt, Wolf Wolfensberger, Bengt Nirje, Bank-Mikkelson, Jack Tizard, Seymour Sarason, Gunnar Dybwad, Karl Gruenwald, Robert Kugel, and lesser known colleagues Earl Butterfield, Robert E. Cooke, David Norris, H. Michael Klaber, and Lloyd Dunn.&lt;ref&gt;Kugel, R.H. &amp; Wolfensberger, W. (1969). Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded." Washington, DC: President's Committee on Mental Retardation"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deinstitutionalization and community development===
The impetus for this mass deinstitutionalization was typically complaints of systematic abuse of the patients by staff and others responsible for the care and treatment of this traditionally vulnerable population with media and political exposes and hearings.&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, B. &amp; Kaplan, F. (1974). "Christmas in Purgatory: A Photographic Essay on Mental Retardation". Syracuse, NY: Human Policy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These complaints, accompanied by judicial oversight and legislative reform, resulted in major changes in the education of personnel and the development of principles for conversion models from institutions to communities, known later as the community paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. (1999). Policy, Program Evaluation and Research in Disability: Community Support For All". London: Haworth Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, B., Bogdan, R., Biklen, D. &amp; Taylor, S. (1977). From institution to community - A conversion model - Educational programming for the severely/profoundly handicapped. In: E. Sontag, J. Smith, &amp; N. Certo (Eds)., "Educational Programming for the Severely and Profoundly Handicapped" (pp. 40-52). Reston, VA: Council for Exceptional Children.&lt;/ref&gt; In many states the recent process of deinstitutionalization has taken 10–15 years due to a lack of community supports in place to assist individuals in achieving the greatest degree of independence and community integration as possible. Yet, many early recommendations from 1969 still hold such as financial aid to keep children at home, establishment of foster care services, leisure and recreation, and opportunities for adults to leave home and attain employment (Bank-Mikkelsen, p.&amp;nbsp;234-236, in Kugel &amp; Wolfensberger, 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Bank-Mikkelsen, N. (1969). Ch. 10: A metropolitan area in Denmark, Copenhagen. In:  R.B. Kugel &amp; W. Wolfensberger, ''Changing Patterns of Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded'' (now Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2015). Washington, DC: President's Committee on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community supports and community integration===
A significant obstacle in developing community supports has been ignorance and resistance on the part of "typically developed" community members who have been taught by contemporary culture that "those people" are somehow fundamentally different and flawed and it is in everyone's best interest if they are removed from society (this developing out of 19th Century ideas about health, morality, and contagion). Part of the normalization process has been returning people to the community and supporting them in attaining as "normal" as life as possible, but another part has been broadening the category of "normal" (sometimes taught as "regular" in community integration, or below as "typical") to include all human beings. In part, the word "normal" continues to be used in contrast to "abnormal", a term also for differentness or out of the norm or accepted routine (e.g., middle class).&lt;ref&gt;Traustadottir, R. (1995). A mother's work is never done: Constructing a "normal" family life. In: S. Taylor, R. Bogdan &amp; Z.M. Lutfiyya, ''The Variety of Community Experiences: Qualitative Studies of Family and Community Life''. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J. &amp; Rogan, P. (1990). ''RCE/SPE 636: Community Services and Systems Change: Syllabi''. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University, Division of Special Education and Rehabilitation, School of Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary services and workforces===
In 2015, public views and attitudes continue to be critical both because personnel are sought from the broader society for fields such as mental health&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, W., Cohen, M., Farkas, M. &amp; Gagne, C. (2002). "Psychiatric Rehabilitation". Boston, MA: Boston University, Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation.&lt;/ref&gt; and contemporary community services continue to include models such as the international "emblem of the group home" for individuals with significant disabilities moving to the community.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. &amp; Traustadottir, R. (2005). "Deinstitutionalization and People with Intellectual Disabilities". London: Jessica Kingsley Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the US direct support workforce, associated with the University of Minnesota, School of Education, Institute on [[Community Integration]]&lt;ref&gt;Larson, S., Sedlezky, L., &amp; Hewitt, A. &amp; Blakeway, C. (2012/14). US direct support workforce. In: J. Racino, ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. NY, NY: CRC Press, Francis and Taylor.&lt;/ref&gt; can trace its roots to a normalization base which reflected their own education and training at the next generation levels.

People with disabilities are not to be viewed as sick, ill, abnormal, subhuman, or unformed, but as people who require significant supports in certain (but not all) areas of their life from daily routines in the home to participation in local community life.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, P. &amp; Rogan, P. (2007). "Making the Day Matter: Promoting Typical Lifestyles for Adults with Disabilities". Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt; With this comes an understanding that all people require supports at certain times or in certain areas of their life, but that most people acquire these supports informally or through socially acceptable avenues. The key issue of support typically comes down to productivity and self-sufficiency, two values that are central to society's definition of self-worth. If we as a society were able to broaden this concept of self-worth perhaps fewer people would be labeled as "disabled."

=== Contemporary Views on Disability ===
{{POV section|date=May 2018}}

During the mid to late 20th century people with disabilities where met with fear, stigma, and pity. Their opportunities for a full productive life where minimal at best and often emphasis was placed more on personal characterizes that could be enhanced so the attention was taken from their disability &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Groomes  &amp; Linkowski|first=D. A. G., &amp;  D.

Bogdan and Taylor's (1993)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; acceptance of sociology, which states that a person need not be defined by personal characterizes alone, has become influential in helping persons with disabilities to refuse to accept exclusion from mainstream society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to some disability scholar’s, disabilities are created by oppressive relations with society, this has been called the social creationist view of disability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vehmas|first=Simo|date=2004|title=Dimensions of Disability|url=|journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|volume=13 |issue=1|pages=34–40|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, it is important to grasp the difference between physical impairment and disability. In the article The Mountain written by Eli Clare, Michael Oliver defines impairment as lacking part of or all of a limb, or having a defective limb, organism or mechanism of the body and the societal construct of disability; Oliver defines disability as the disadvantage or restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization which takes no or little account of people who have physical (and/or cognitive/developmental/mental) impairments and thus excludes them from the mainstream of society.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Clare: The Mountain&lt;/ref&gt; In society, language helps to construct reality, for instance, societies way of defining disability which implies that a disabled person lacks a certain ability, or possibility, that could contribute to her personal well-being and enable her to be a contributing member of society versus abilities and possibilities that are considered to be good and useful .&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Society needs to destruct the language that is used and build a new one that does not place those with disabilities in the “other” category.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Personal wounds, quality of life and social role valorization===
However, the perspective of Wolfensberger, who served as associated faculty with the Rehabiltation Research and Training Center on Community Integration (despite concerns of federal funds), is that people he has known in institutions have "suffered deep wounds". This view, reflected in his early overheads of PASS ratings, is similar to other literature that has reflected the need for hope in situations where aspirations and expectations for quality of life had previously been very low (e.g., brain injury, [[independent living]]).  Normalization advocates were among the first to develop models of residential services, and to support contemporary practices in recognizing families and supporting employment.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W., Thomas, S., &amp; Caruso, G. (1996). Because of the universal "good things in life" which the implementation of social role valorization can be expected to make more accessible to devalued people. "International Social Role Valorization Journal", 2: 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfensberger himself found the new term social role valorization&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1985). Social role valorization: A new inight, and a new term, for normalization. ''Australian Association for the Mentally Retarded Journal'', 9(1): 4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; to better convey his theories (and his German Professorial temperament, family life and beliefs)than the constant "misunderstandings" of the term normalization!

===Related theories and development===
Related theories on integration in the subsequent decades have been termed [[community integration]], self-determination or empowerment theory, support and empowerment paradigms, community building, functional-competency, family support, often not independent living (supportive living),and in 2015, the principle of inclusion which also has roots in service fields in the 1980s.

== Misconceptions ==
Normalization is so common in the fields of disability, especially intellectual and developmental disabilities, that articles will critique normalization without ever referencing one of three international leaders: Wolfensberger, Nirje, and Bank Mikkelson or any of the women educators (e.g., Wolfensberger's Susan Thomas; Syracuse University colleagues Taylor, Biklen or Bogdan; established women academics (e.g., Sari Biklen); or emerging women academics, Traustadottir, Shoultz or Racino in national research and education centers (e.g., Hillyer, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Hillyer, B. (1993). ''Feminism and Disability''. Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is important to discuss common misconceptions about the principle of normalization and its implications among the provider-academic sectors:

*a) '''Normalization does not mean making people "normal" – forcing them to conform to societal norms'''.
Wolfensberger himself, in 1980, suggested "Normalizing measures can be offered in some circumstances, and imposed in others."&lt;ref&gt;''The definition of normalisation: update, problems, disagreements and misunderstandings'', Wolfensberger, W. (1980) In R.J. Flynn &amp; K.E. Nitsch (Eds). Normalization, social integration and human services. Baltimore: University Park Press&lt;/ref&gt; This view is not accepted by most people in the field, including Nirje. Advocates emphasize that the ''environment'', not the ''person'', is what is normalized, or as known for decades a person-environment interaction.

Normalization is very complex theoretically, and Wolf Wolfensberger's educators explain his positions such as the conservatism corollary, deviancy unmaking, the developmental model (see below) and social competency, and relevance of social imagery, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Tullman, S. (1982). A brief outline of the principle of normalization. "Rehabilitation Psychology", 27(3): 131-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

*b) '''Normalization does not support "dumping" people into the community or into schools without support'''.
Normalization has been blamed for the closure of services (such as institutions) leading to a lack of support for children and adults with disabilities. Indeed, normalization personnel are often affiliated with human rights groups. Normalization is not deinstitutionalization, though institutions have been found to not "pass" in service evaluations and to be the subject of exposes. Normalization was described early as alternative special education by leaders of the deinstitutionalization movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. (1977). The principle of normalization. In: B. Blatt, D. Biklen, &amp; R. Bogdan, "An Alternative Textbook in Special Education: People, Schools and Other Institutions". Denver, CO: Love Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

However support services which facilitate normal life opportunities for people with disabilities – such as special education services, housing support, employment support and advocacy – are not incompatible with normalization, although some particular services (such as special schools) may actually detract from rather than enhance normal living bearing in mind the concept of normal 'rhythms' of life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

* c) '''Normalization supports [[community integration]], but the principles vary significantly on matters such as gender and disability with community integration directly tackling services in the context of race, ethnicity, class, income and gender'''.
Some misconceptions and confusions about normalization are removed by understanding a context for this principle. There has been a general belief that 'special' people are best served if society keeps them apart, puts them together with 'their own kind, and keep them occupied. The principle of normalization is intended to refute this idea, rather than to deal with subtlety around the question of 'what is normal?' The principle of normalization is congruent in many of its features with "[[community integration]]" and as been described by educators as supporting early mainstreaming in community life.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, J. (1979). The Principle of Normalization, Guidelines for Tours, and Guidelines for Administrative Inquiries". Syracuse, NY: Training Institute on Human Services Planning and Change Agentry.&lt;/ref&gt;

* d) '''Normalization supports adult services by age range, not "mental age", and appropriate services across the lifespan'''.
Arguments about choice and individuality, in connection with normalization, should also take into account whether society, perhaps through paid support staff, has encouraged them into certain behaviours. For example, in referring to normalization, a discussion about an adult's choice to carry a doll with them must be influenced by a recognition that they have previously been encouraged in childish behaviours, and that society currently expects them to behave childishly. Most people who find normalization to be a useful principle would hope to find a middle way - in this case, an adult's interest in dolls being valued, but with them being actively encouraged to express it in an age-appropriate way (e.g., viewing museums and doll collections), with awareness of gender in toy selection (e.g., see cars and motorsports), and discouraged from behaving childishly and thus accorded the rights and routines only of a "perpetual child". However, the principle of normalization is intended also to refer to the means by which a person is supported, so that (in this example) any encouragement or discouragement offered in a patronising or directive manner is itself seen to be inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

*e) '''Normalization is a set of values, and early on (1970s)was validated through quantitative measures (PASS, PASSING)'''.
Normalization principles were designed to be measured and ranked on all aspects through the development of measures related to homes, facilities, programs, location (i.e. community development), service activities, and life routines, among others. These service evaluations have been used for training community services personnel, both in institutions and in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Glenn, L. (1975). ""PASS 3: A Method for Quantitative Evaluation of the Human Services Field. Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation"".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfensberger, W. &amp; Thomas, S. (1983). ""PASSING: Program Analysis of Service Systems Implementation of Normalization Goals"". Toronto, Canada: National Institute on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, R.J. &amp; Heal, L.W. (1981). A short form of PASS 3: A study of its structure, interrater reliability, and validity for assessing normalization. ""Evaluation Review"", 5(3): 357-376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demaine, G.C., Silverstein, A.B. &amp; Mayeda, T. (1980, June). Validation of PASS 3: A first step in service evaluation through environmental assessments. ''Mental Retardation'', 18: 131-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normalization as the basis for education of community personnel in Great Britain is reflected in a 1990s reader, highlighting Wolf Wolfensberger's moral concerns as a Christian, right activist, side-by-side ("How to Function with Personal Model Coherency in a Dysfunctional (Human Service) World") with the common form of normalization training for evaluations of programs.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, P. &amp; Wainwright, T. (1992). Normalisation training: Conversion or commitment? In: H. Brown &amp; H. Smith (Eds), "Normalisation: A Reader for the Nineties". London: Tavistock/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Community educators and leaders in Great Britain and the US of different political persuasions include John O'Brien and Connie Lyle O'Brien, Paul Williams and Alan Tyne, Guy Caruso and Joe Osborn, Jim Mansell and Linda Ward, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, P. &amp; Tyne, A.

Towell (Ed.), "An Ordinary Life in Practice: Developing Comprehensive Community-Based Services for People with Learning Disabilities". (pp. 23–31). London: King Edward's Hospital Fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''O2 Global Network''' ('''O2 International Network for Sustainable Design''', stylized as '''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Global Network''') is an [[international]] network for people interested in [[sustainable design]]. The [[Social network|network]] is made up of the O2 Global Network foundation, [[regional]] hubs, local groups, [[wikt:liaison|liaison]]s and individuals (called O2's). It has currently more than 70 country contacts.

==History==
O2 ("[[Oxygen]]") was founded in 1988 in [[Milan]] by Niels Peter Flint, Thierry Kazazian, Jorgi Scheicher, Jeremy Quinn and others. O2 Groups in [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]] followed.
Six years later (5 July 1994), [[Iris de Graaf]] and [[Willem Hanhart]] founded the O2 Global Network foundation, or in short, the O2 Global Network. O2GN, as it became to be known, was set up as an independent organization. Its first home page appeared in November that year, and by August 1995, the network had hosted their first [[World Wide Web|web]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]], live from [[Rotterdam]].

==Objective==
For nearly two decades, O2 has pioneered solutions to a central problem of the made environment: ''how to foster sustainability while having a good quality of life''. The people in this forum have been wrestling with the problems of a throw-away culture, formulating non-[[polluting]] [[Manufacturing|production]] methods, sourcing non-toxic, sustainably managed [[Chemical susbtance|materials]], innovative sustainable product services, sustainable [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], [[behavior]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—and, most importantly, passing on that [[knowledge]].

The basic idea of the O2 Global Network is ''"global thinking and local action"''. Global information and knowledge is exchanged and discussed. Local groups, mostly [[non-governmental organization]]s, or O2 individuals organize lectures, projects and workshops as well as distributing newsletters to promote, educate and implement design for [[sustainability]], with all of its facets in mind.

==Members==
The network involves people with a background in [[design]], [[industrial design]], [[architecture]], [[packaging design]], [[graphic design]], [[art]]s, [[fashion]], and [[innovation]], as well as people from [[academies]], [[universities]], public authorities, [[companies]] or knowledge centers. The O2 Global Network's primary method of communication is by means of electronic media such as the home page and an [[electronic mailing list]] where information and knowledge can be exchanged. O2 Hubs, O2 groups and O2 liaisons can be found worldwide.

'''Power posing''' is a discredited hypothesis in [[psychology]] that claims that by assuming a "powerful" [[Posture (psychology)|posture]], subjects can induce positive hormonal and behavioral changes. It was introduced in a 2010 paper by Dana Carney, [[Amy Cuddy]], and Andy Yap.&lt;ref&gt;Carney DR, Cuddy AJ, Yap AJ, "Power posing: brief nonverbal displays affect neuroendocrine levels and risk tolerance" ''Psychol Sci.'' 2010 Oct;21(10):1363-8''. doi: 10.1177/0956797610383437.&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea has been referred to as pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2017/06/14/calling-out-pseudoscience-radically-changing-the-conversation-about-amy-cuddys-power-posing-paper/|title=Calling out pseudoscience, radically changing the conversation about Amy Cuddy's power posing paper|work=Mind the Brain|date=June 14, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have reported being unable to replicate power posing effects in follow-up studies.&lt;ref name="Ranehill_2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016" /&gt; In 2017 alone, 11 studies were published that were unable to reproduce the effect found by Cuddy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Tracy |title=Sajid Javid and the strange science behind power poses |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/may/01/sajid-javid-and-the-strange-science-behind-power-poses |website=the Guardian |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=en |date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been described as an example of the [[replication crisis]] in psychology, in which initially seductive theories could not be replicated on follow-up tests.&lt;ref name="Ioannidis 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ioannidis|first1=John P.

Dana Carney, the lead author of the original article, issued a statement in 2016 abandoning the theory: "I do not believe that 'power pose effects' are real...the evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable", while Cuddy has continued work on it.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carney_nd_Myposition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response" /&gt;

In 2018 Cuddy, with two other authors, published additional research; the paper had been submitted in August 2016, a revised version was submitted in November 2017, and the paper published online on April 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuddy|first1=Amy J.

== Initial claims ==
The initial research on power posing was published in 2010. The authors claimed that high-power poses "produce power". The study included 42 participants, who were coached by researchers to assume a physical position of power. Hormone levels were measured before and after, and the authors stated that they found an increase in [[testosterone]] and a decrease in [[cortisol]] after posing.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=doi_2010_sage&gt;{{cite journal |title=Power Posing: Brief Nonverbal Displays Affect Neuroendocrine Levels and Risk Tolerance |first1=Dana R. |last1=Carney |first2=Amy J.C. |last2=Cuddy |first3=Andy J. |last3=Yap |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4679/power.poses_.PS_.2010.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Science |volume=21 |number=10 |pages=1363–1368|doi=10.1177/0956797610383437 |date=January 10, 2010 |quote="These findings suggest that, in some situations requiring power, people have the ability to "fake it 'til they make it." Over time and in aggregate, these minimal postural changes and their outcomes potentially could improve a person's general health and well-being. This potential benefit is particularly important when considering people who are or who feel chronically powerless because of lack of resources, low hierarchical rank in an organization, or membership in a low-power social group."}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Replication failure ==
A 2015 article, published in ''Psychological Science'' by Ranehill et al. refuted findings in Carney et al. (2010).&lt;ref name="Ranehill_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ranehill |first1=Eva |last2=Dreber |first2=Anna |last3=Johannesson |first3=Magnus |last4=Leiberg |first4=Susanne |last5=Sul |first5=Sunhae |last6=Weber |first6=Roberto A. |date=May 26, 2015 |title=Assessing the Robustness of Power Posing: No Effect on Hormones and Risk Tolerance in a Large Sample of Men and Women |journal=Psychological Science |pmid=25810452 |doi=10.1177/0956797614553946 |volume=26 |number=5 |pages=653-6 |url=http://datacolada.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5110-Ranehill-Dreber-Johannesson-Leiberg-Sul-Weber-PS-2015-Assessing-the-robustness-of-power-posing-no-effect-on-hormones-and-risk-rolerance-in-a-large-sample-of-men-and-women.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carney strongly favored the publication of the Ranehill case of failed replication in her review of the article.&lt;ref name=Carney_nd_Myposition/&gt;

The statistical methods that may have led to the original erroneous findings were reviewed by noted researchers including [[Uri Simonsohn]] and Joseph P. Simmons of the [[Wharton School]] in their 2016 paper and concluded that previous research failed to "suggest the existence of an effect once we account for [[selective reporting]]".&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Power Posing: P-Curving the Evidence |series=Psychological Science (forthcoming) |date=June 10, 2016 |first1=Joseph P. |last1=Simmons |work=Data Colada |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2791272 |access-date=October 19, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Another failed replication"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Gelman|title=Another failed replication of power pose|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2016/10/22/30294/|website=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond "power pose""&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelman|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Gelman|title= Beyond "power pose": Using replication failures and a better understanding of data collection and analysis to do better science |url=http://andrewgelman.com/2017/10/18/beyond-power-pose-using-replication-failures-better-understanding-data-collection-analysis-better-science/|website=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the years that followed, attempts were made by various research groups to apply power posing manipulation in different contexts. The results did not support the assumptions made by Cuddy et al. In a 2016 study by Garrison et al. the effect of posture manipulation was combined with dominant vs. submissive gaze. Despite a large sample size, no effect was found on risk taking and, in contrast to original expectations, adopting an expansive pose reduced feelings of power.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, K. E., Tang, D., &amp; Schmeichel, B. J. (2016).

(2016) investigated the effect of cognitive role taking and Cuddy's power posing manipulation in the [[Trier Social Stress Test]]; although role taking had an influence on the cortisol and testosterone response after stress, the posture manipulation had no effect on hormonal, behavioral or subjective measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deuter |first1=Christian Eric|last2=Schächinger|first2=Hartmut|last3=Best|first3=Daniel|last4=Neumann|first4=Roland|date=September 2016 |title=Effects of two dominance manipulations on the stress response: Cognitive and embodied influences |journal=Biological Psychology |pmid=27381928|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.06.004 |volume=119|number= |pages=184-189 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051116301958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where influences on hormones were found, these were sometimes opposite to the predicted direction. In a study conducted by Smith et al. in 2017, participants had to compete in a challenging task while the had to assume high or low power poses. The authors report no main effect of pose type on testosterone, cortisol, risk or feelings of power. However, they found an interaction between pose type and competition outcome on testosterone: while winners assigned to a high-power pose had small rise in testosterone levels. Yet, losers had a reduction in testosterone after holding high-power poses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X1630023X|title=Winners, losers, and posers: The effect of power poses on testosterone and risk-taking following competition|first1=Kristopher|last1=Smith|first2=Coren |last2=Apicella|year=2017|publisher=|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=92|via=|pmid=27840104|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other scientists have attempted to come up with an explanation for how the effect could have been found, by excluding factors such as gender-based differences in hormone levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00009/full|title=The Essential Implications of Gender in Human Behavioral Endocrinology Studies|first=Steven J.|last=Stanton|year=2017|publisher=|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=5|via=Frontiers|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Carney published a statement on the University of California, Berkeley website, stating that she no longer believed the effect was valid.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html |title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy |first=Susan |last=Dominus |date=October 18, 2017 |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carney_nd_Myposition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/dana_carney/pdf_my%20position%20on%20power%20poses.pdf |format=PDF |title=My position on "Power Poses" |first=Dana R. |last=Carney |access-date=October 19, 2017 |date=nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal co-author"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title='Power Posing' Co-author: 'I Do Not Believe That 'Power Pose' Effects Are Real'|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/power-poses-co-author-i-dont-think-power-poses-are-real.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|last2=Dahl|first2=Melissa|title=Here Is Amy Cuddy's Response to Critiques of Her Power-Posing Research|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/09/read-amy-cuddys-response-to-power-posing-critiques.html|website=New York magazine|accessdate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Cesario, an associate professor of psychology at [[Michigan State University]], who co-edits ''Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology'', arranged a special issue on power posing that published in June 2017; the issue included eleven new studies, along with a meta-analyses, which found that the effect of power posing on power behaviors was not replicated.&lt;ref name="Simonsohn_Simmons_2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/02/power-poses-research-false/ |title='Power Poses' Researcher Dana Carney Now Says Effects are "Undeniably" False |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=October 2, 2016  |first=David Z. |last=Morris }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time_2017"&gt;{{cite news |title='Power Poses' Don't Actually Work.

==Public attention==
The concept gained attention after a [[TED talk]] given by Cuddy in 2012, where she demonstrated the posture and argued for its benefits.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TEDGlobal|url=http://conferences.ted.com/TEDGlobal2012/program/speakers.php|work=Program Speakers, 2012|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] and [[Oprah]] discussed "power posing".&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt; By 2017, Cuddy's 2012 TED talk on had become "TED's second-most popular" and had been viewed by about 47 million viewers.&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy"/&gt;  Cuddy said that she felt that the idea appealed to her given her experience of recovering from head trauma in a car accident, which she said helped develop her interest in "studying how people can become their aspirational selves...How can you become a self that you are not now?"&lt;ref name="NYT_2017_Cuddy" /&gt;  

An extensive series of articles on power posing replication was published by [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] by Jesse Singal and other contributors in its ''Science of Us'' section.&lt;ref name="Singal Dahl Amy Cuddy's Response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Singal co-author" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Interesting House-of-Cards Element to the Fall of Power Poses" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Why People Love(d) Power Posing: A Science of Us Conversation" /&gt;

[[File:Superbia (mosaic, Basilique Notre-Dame de Fourvière).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Superbia'': the [[Latin]] word for ''pride'']]
{{emotion}}
'''Pride''' is an inwardly directed [[emotion]] that carries two antithetical meanings. With a negative [[connotation]] ''pride'' refers to a foolishly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hubris|title=Definition of HUBRIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134932/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hubris|archivedate=2016-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, [[social status|status]] or accomplishments, used [[synonym]]ously with [[hubris]]. With a positive connotation, ''pride'' refers to a [[Humility|humble]] and content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole [[social group|group of people]], and is a product of [[praise]], independent [[self-reflection]], and a fulfilled feeling of [[belongingness|belonging]].

In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil.

[[Philosopher]]s and [[social psychology|social psychologists]] have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a [[sense of self]] and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = GB | year = 2007 | title = Wittgenstein and the grammar of pride: The relevance of philosophy to studies of self-evaluative emotions | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = 3| pages = 233–252 | doi = 10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status.&lt;ref name="Shariff"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19803585 | doi=10.1037/a0017089 | volume=9 | title=Knowing who''''s boss: implicit perceptions of status from the nonverbal expression of pride | date=October 2009 | journal=Emotion | pages=631–9 | last1 = Shariff | first1 = AF | last2 = Tracy | first2 = JL}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, pride could also be defined as a lowly disagreement with the truth. One definition of pride in the former sense comes from [[St. Augustine]]: "the love of one's own excellence".&lt;ref&gt;"Est autem superbia amor proprie excellentie, et fuit initium peccati superbia."{{cite web |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/angus.graham/DeAmore4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105090845/http://freespace.virgin.net/angus.graham/DeAmore4.htm |archivedate=2008-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition comes from [[Meher Baba]]: "Pride is the specific feeling through which egoism manifests."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses''. '''2'''. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 72. {{ISBN|978-1880619094}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a [[vice]], sometimes as proper or as a [[virtue]]. While some philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] (and [[George Bernard Shaw]]) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world [[religion]]s consider pride's fraudulent form a [[sin]], such as is expressed in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 11:2 of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or [[magnanimity]], but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-[[idolatry]], sadistic contempt, [[vanity]] or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's [[nation]] (national pride) and [[ethnicity]] (ethnic pride).

==Etymology==
''Proud'' comes from late [[Old English]] ''prut'', probably from [[Old French]] ''prud'' "brave, valiant" (11th century) (which became ''preux'' in French), from [[Late Latin]] term ''prodis'' "useful", which is compared with the Latin ''prodesse'' "be of use".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proud Article from Free Online Dictionary], accessed 9 Nov. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of "having a high opinion of oneself", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves "proud".&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud Article from Online Etymology Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606194147/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud |date=2014-06-06 }}, accessed 20 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical views ==

=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===
[[Aristotle]] identified pride (''megalopsuchia'', variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBoqmEvavawC&amp;pg=PA93 |title=The Nicomachean Ethics By Aristotle, James Alexander, Kerr Thomson, Hugh Tredennick, Jonathan Barnes translators |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility, thus:
{{quote|Now the man is thought to be '''proud''' who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for he who does so beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is foolish or silly. The proud man, then, is the man we have described. For he who is worthy of little and thinks himself worthy of little is '''temperate''', but not proud; for pride implies greatness, as beauty implies a goodsized body, and little people may be neat and well-proportioned but cannot be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/english/levine/Aristotle.htm Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 4.3]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207075303/http://www.bu.edu/english/levine/Aristotle.htm |date=December 7, 2008 }}; also available here [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/nico/nico037.htm Sacred Texts – Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907021331/http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ari/nico/nico037.htm |date=2008-09-07 }}; and here [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054;query=bekker%20page%3D%2363;layout=;loc=1123a%201 alternate translation at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He concludes then that
{{quote|Pride, then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them more powerful, and it is not found without them. Therefore it is hard to be truly proud; for it is impossible without nobility and goodness of character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/english/levine/Aristotle.htm Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 4.3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228155719/http://www.bu.edu/english/levine/Aristotle.htm |date=December 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkrq8TypPmcC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=great+souled+man+pride&amp;source=web&amp;ots=axS3sFa3dk&amp;sig=kZ8QBaW2KVeA0DFBTpVLfYrhaqk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result |title=Understanding Philosophy for AS Level AQA, by Christopher Hamilton (Google Books) |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of [[hubris]] as follows:
{{quote|to cause shame to the victim, not in order that anything may happen to you, nor because anything has happened to you, but merely for your own gratification. Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] ''Rhetoric'' 1378b (Greek text and English translation available at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.2.1 Perseus Project]).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride.

== Psychological views ==

=== As an emotion ===
In psychological terms, positive pride is "a pleasant, sometimes exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = M. | last2 = Takai-Kawakami | first2 = K. | last3 = Kawakami | first3 = K. | last4 = Sullivan | first4 = M. W. | year = 2010 | title = Cultural differences in emotional responses to success and failure | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 53–61 | doi = 10.1177/0165025409348559 | pmc = 2811375 | pmid=20161610}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was added by Tracy et al. to the University of California, Davis, Set of Emotion Expressions (UCDSEE) in 2009, as one of three "self-conscious" emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with [[embarrassment]] and [[shame]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tracy | first1 = J. L. | last2 = Robins | first2 = R. W. | last3 = Schriber | first3 = R. A. | year = 2009 | title = Development of a FACS-verified set of basic and self-conscious emotion expressions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 554–559| doi = 10.1037/a0015766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "fiero" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity.&lt;ref&gt;Lazzaro, N. (2004). Why We Play Games: Four Keys to More Emotion Without Story. Retrieved from www.xeodesign.com/xeodesign_whyweplaygames.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Language |first=Body |url=http://www.bodylanguagesuccess.com/2010/10/fiero-feels-good-mirror-neurons.html |title=Sincerity Secret # 20: Fiero Feels Good – Mirror Neurons |publisher=Body Language Success |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2012-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426091428/http://www.bodylanguagesuccess.com/2010/10/fiero-feels-good-mirror-neurons.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group.&lt;ref name="Shariff"/&gt;

Behaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy &amp; Matsumoto, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Positive outcomes ===
A common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals; for example, Weiner et al. have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone. Moreover, Oveis et al. conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oveis | first1 = C. | last2 = Horberg | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Keltner | first3 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Compassion, pride, and social intuitions of self-other similarity | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 618–630 | doi = 10.1037/a0017628 | pmid=20307133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It is related to "more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud" (Weiner, 1985). Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion. Along with hope, it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended (Fredrickson, 2001). According to Bagozzi et al., pride can have the positive benefits of enhancing creativity, productivity, and altruism. For instance, it has been found that in terms of school achievement, pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Byrd | first1 = C.

=== In economic psychology ===
In the field of [[economic psychology]], pride is conceptualized in a spectrum ranging from "proper pride", associated with genuine achievements, and "false pride", which can be maladaptive or even pathological. Lea et al. have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lea | first1 = S. E. G. | last2 = Webley | first2 = P. | year = 1996 | title = Pride in economic psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 323–340 | doi=10.1016/s0167-4870(97)00011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understood in this way, pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short term they would appear irrational.

=== Sin and self-acceptance ===
{{See also|Self-esteem#Contingent vs. non-contingent}}
[[File:Pride, Jacob Matham.png|thumb|180px|''Pride, from the Seven Deadly Sins'' by [[Jacob Matham]] c. 1592.]]

Exaggerated self-esteem is called "pride".&lt;ref&gt;"pride, n.1". OED Online. December 2014. Oxford University Press. http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/151185?rskey=L7lc4z&amp;result=1 (accessed December 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Christian theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and thus high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human problem, but beginning in the 20th century, "[[humanistic psychology]]" diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one's "true worth". [[Carl Rogers]] observed that most people "regard themselves as worthless and unlovable." Thus, they lack self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Terry D. Cooper, ''Sin, Pride &amp; Self-Acceptance: The Problem of Identity in Theology &amp; Psychology'' (InterVar sity, 2003), 40, 87, 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terry Cooper (writer)|Terry Cooper]] conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important paradigm in describing the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the [[humanistic psychology]] position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, T. D. (2003). Sin, pride &amp; self-acceptance: the problem of identity in theology &amp; psychology. Chicago: InterVarsity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

He considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely [[Karen Horney]], offers promise in dealing with what he calls a "deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self" (Cooper, 112–3).
Cooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The "idealized self," the "tyranny of the should," the "pride system" and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem. (Cooper, 112–3).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, [[hubris]], which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the committer of pride feels deeply down.

In the [[King James Bible]], those people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the somewhat archaic term, [[:wikt:haughty|"Haughty"]].

=== Hubris and group pride ===
{{Main|Hubris}}{{See also|Group narcissism}}
Hubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999). As one might expect, Hubris is not necessarily associated with high [[self-esteem]] but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Several studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket about group pride, have shown that groups that boast, gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Study is currently in revision&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting that "hubristic, pompous displays of group pride might actually be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength," she states that those that express pride by being filled with [[humility]] whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.

=== Germany ===
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}
In [[Germany]], "national pride" ("Nationalstolz") is often associated with the former [[Nazism|Nazi regime]]. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German [[patriotism]]. The [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the [[Germany national football team|team]] progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, G. B. (2009). Germany during the 2006 World Cup: The role of television in creating a national narrative of pride and "party patriotism". In Castelló, E., Dhoest, A. &amp; O'Donnell, H. (Eds.), The Nation on Screen, Discourses of the National in Global Television. Cambridge Scholars Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the semi-final against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] came around, the level of national pride and unity was at its highest throughout the tournament, and the hosting of the World Cup is seen to have been a great success for Germany as a nation. After the World Cup, however, the subject of patriotism became again as difficult as it had been before.

{{Main|Asian pride}}
Asian pride in modern slang refers mostly to those of [[East Asian]] descent, though it can include anyone of [[Asian people|Asian]] descent.  Asian pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have had long conflicts with each other, examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs of their individual superiority.  Asian pride emerged prominently during European [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=Gerd&gt;Langguth, Gerd. German Foreign Affairs Review. "Dawn of the 'Pacific' Century?" 1996. June 30, 2007. {{cite web|url=http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610190612/http://www.gerd-langguth.de/fremdsprachtext/asian_values.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At one time, Europeans controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations.&lt;ref name=Gerd /&gt;  Today, some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion.&lt;ref name=Gerd /&gt; In contrast, Asian [[empire]]s are prominent and are proudly remembered by adherents to Asian Pride.

There is an emerging discourse of Chinese pride which unfolds complex histories and maps of privileges and empowerments. In a deeper sense, it is a strategic positioning, aligned with approaches such as "Asia as method",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chen, K. H. (2010). Asia as method: Toward deimperialization. Durham &amp; London: Duke University Press|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to invite more diverse resistances in language, culture, and practices, in challenging colonial, imperial dominations, and being critical of Eurocentric epistemologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Y|date=2014|title=Radical Feelings in the 'Liberation Zone': Active Chinese Canadian Citizenship in Richmond, BC|url=http://ejournals.ok.ubc.ca/index.php/CERJ/article/view/2|journal=Citizenship Education Research Journal|volume=4|issue=1|pages=13–28|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308120816/http://ejournals.ok.ubc.ca/index.php/CERJ/article/view/2|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more specific cases, it examines the Sinophone circulations of power relations connecting the transnational to the local, for example, a particular set of Chinese-Canadian relations between China's increasing industrial materiality and output in which pride becomes an expansionist reach and mobilization of capital, Canada's active interests in tapping into Asian and Chinese labours, markets, and industrial productions, and the intersected cultural politics of 'Chinese-ness' in an East Pacific British Columbia city where 'Chinese' has been tagged as a majority-minority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Gay pride]]'' refers to a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) individuals should be proud of their [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]].

The word ''pride'' is used in this case an antonym for ''[[shame]]''. ''Pride'' in this sense is an affirmation of one's self and the community as a whole. The modern "gay pride" movement began after the [[Stonewall riots]] of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the first [[pride parade]] in the United States commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of Stonewall Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = WGBH American Experience - Inside American Experience|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/blog/2011/06/09/pride-parade/|website = American Experience|access-date = 2016-02-16|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160422105803/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/blog/2011/06/09/pride-parade/|archivedate = 2016-04-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vanity ==
{{Main|Vanity}}
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch Table of the Mortal Sins (Superbia).jpg|thumb|Detail of "Pride" in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
In conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one's personal appearance, attractiveness and dress and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness ''in the eyes of others'' and may in so far be compared to pride. The term Vanity originates from the Latin word ''[[vanitas]]'' meaning ''emptiness'', ''untruthfulness'', ''futility'', ''foolishness'' and ''empty pride''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=vanitas|title=William Whitaker's Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''empty pride'' means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.

In many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-[[idolatry]], in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own [[image]], and thereby becomes divorced from the [[Divine grace|grace]]s of [[God]]. The stories of [[Lucifer]] and [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] (who gave us the term [[narcissism]]), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity. In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a [[peacock]], and in [[Bible|Biblical]] terms, by the [[Whore of Babylon]]. During the [[Renaissance]], vanity was invariably represented as a naked [[woman]], sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a [[demon]] or a [[putto]].  Other symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of [[death]] himself.

[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"All Is Vanity" by [[C. Allan Gilbert]], evoking the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward death]]
Often we find an inscription on a scroll that reads ''Omnia Vanitas'' ("All is Vanity"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]].&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''Dictionary of Subjects &amp; Symbols in Art'' (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974), 318.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although that phrase, itself depicted in a type of still life, [[vanitas]], originally referred not to obsession with one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.

"The artist invites us to pay [[lip service (disambiguation)|lip-service]] to condemning her", writes [[Edwin Mullins]], "while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Mullins]], ''The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, Inc., 1985), 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining [[Venus (god)|Venus]].

In his table of the [[seven deadly sins]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]] depicts a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to [[Nicolas Tournier]], which hangs in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is ''An Allegory of Justice and Vanity''. A young woman holds a [[Beam balance|balance]], symbolizing [[justice]]; she does not look at the mirror or the [[human skull|skull]] on the table before her. [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer's]] famous painting ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/cat_about/necklace.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175732/http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/cat_about/necklace.htm |archivedate=2007-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''All is Vanity'', by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An [[optical illusion]], the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror.
Such artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of [[death]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">'''Product stewardship''' is where environmental, health, and safety protection centers on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epr/ The United States Environment Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;  For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro The National Chemical Emergency Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528102118/http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro/ |date=2007-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]] and the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict [[service economy]] interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.

The most familiar example is the [[container-deposit legislation]].  A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or [[recycling]].  If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for [[landfill]] or [[litter]] control measures.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among [[homeless]] people in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.

However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to [[paint]] and [[automobile]] parts such as [[tire]]s.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the [[toxic waste]] they become.  In some countries, such as [[Germany]], [[law]] requires attention to the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[European Union|EU]] generally.  In the [[United States]], the issue has been confronted via [[class action suit|class action lawsuits]] that attempt to hold companies [[Legal liability|liable]] for the environmental impact of their products.  Thus far, such as [[litigation]] or proposed [[accounting reform]]s such as [[full cost accounting]] have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of [[academe]] and corporate [[public relations]] (derisively referred to as [[greenwashing]]). 

The [[Demand|demand-side]] approach [[ethical consumerism]], supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.

== Extended producer responsibility ==

Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with [[Extended producer responsibility]], a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used. 

While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html Waste to Wealth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes not only the manufacturers, but also the retailers, consumers and recyclers as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4418">In [[algebraic topology]], the '''pushforward''' of a [[continuous function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; between two [[topological space]]s is a [[homomorphism]]  &lt;math&gt;f_{*}:H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; between the [[homology group]]s for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Homology is a [[functor]] which converts a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into a sequence of homology groups &lt;math&gt;H_{n}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;. (Often, the collection of all such groups is referred to using the notation &lt;math&gt;H_{*}\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt;; this collection has the structure of a [[graded ring]].) In any [[category (mathematics)|category]], a functor must induce a corresponding [[morphism]]. The pushforward is the morphism corresponding to the homology functor.

== Definition for singular and simplicial homology ==

We build the pushforward homomorphism as follows (for singular or simplicial homology):

First we have an induced homomorphism between the singular or simplicial [[chain complex]]   &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined by composing each singular n-[[simplex]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a singular n-simplex of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sigma_X\right) = f\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;\Delta^n\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;. Then we extend &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; linearly via &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\left(\sum_tn_t\sigma_t\right) = \sum_tn_tf_{\#}\left(\sigma_t\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;C_n\left(X\right)\rightarrow C_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; is the [[boundary operator]] between chain groups, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''[[chain complex#Chain maps|chain map]]'''.

&lt;!-- We have a diagram
&lt;math&gt;
\[
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(X\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(X\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\\
 &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}} &amp;  &amp; \downarrow{\scriptstyle f_{\#}}\\
\dots &amp; \rightarrow &amp; C_{n+1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n}\left(Y\right) &amp; \overset{\partial}{\rightarrow} &amp; C_{n-1}\left(Y\right) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \dots\end{array}\]
&lt;/math&gt; 
such that in each square &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}\partial = \partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; defines a '''chain map'''.
--&gt;

We have that &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes cycles to cycles, since &lt;math&gt;\partial \alpha = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\partial f_{\#}\left( \alpha \right) = f_{\#}\left(\partial \alpha \right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Also &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; takes boundaries to boundaries since &lt;math&gt; f_{\#}\left(\partial \beta \right) = \partial f_{\#}\left(\beta \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence &lt;math&gt;f_{\#}&lt;/math&gt; induces a homomorphism between the homology groups &lt;math&gt;f_{*} : H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\geq0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties and homotopy invariance ==

{{Main|Singular homology#Homotopy invariance}}

Two basic properties of the push-forward are:

# &lt;math&gt;\left( f\circ g\right)_{*} = f_{*}\circ g_{*}&lt;/math&gt; for the composition of maps &lt;math&gt;X\overset{f}{\rightarrow}Y\overset{g}{\rightarrow}Z&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\left( \text{id}_X \right)_{*} = \text{id}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\text{id}_X&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; refers to identity function of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\text{id}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(X\right)&lt;/math&gt; refers to the identity isomorphism of homology groups.

&lt;br /&gt;
A main result about the push-forward is the '''homotopy invariance''': if two maps &lt;math&gt;f,g\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are homotopic, then they induce the same homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f_{*} = g_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

This immediately implies that the homology groups of homotopy equivalent spaces are isomorphic:

The maps &lt;math&gt;f_{*}\colon H_n\left(X\right) \rightarrow H_n\left(Y\right)&lt;/math&gt; induced by a homotopy equivalence &lt;math&gt;f\colon X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; are isomorphisms for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Reaction–diffusion systems''' are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena: the most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local [[chemical reaction]]s in which the substances are transformed into each other, and [[diffusion]] which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.

Reaction–diffusion systems are naturally applied in [[chemistry]]. However, the system can also describe dynamical processes of non-chemical nature. Examples are found in [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[physics]] (neutron diffusion theory) and [[ecology]]. Mathematically, reaction–diffusion systems take the form of semi-linear [[parabolic partial differential equation]]s. They can be represented in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \boldsymbol{q} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{D}}} \,\nabla^2 \boldsymbol{q} + \boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{q}), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''q'''''('''''x''''', ''t'')}} represents the unknown vector function, {{math|{{uuline|'''''D'''''}}}} is a [[diagonal matrix]] of [[diffusion coefficient]]s, and {{math|'''''R'''''}} accounts for all local reactions. The solutions of reaction–diffusion equations display a wide range of behaviours, including the formation of [[travelling wave]]s and wave-like phenomena as well as other [[Self-organization|self-organized]] [[pattern formation|patterns]] like stripes, hexagons or more intricate structure like [[dissipative soliton]]s. Such patterns have been dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Wooley, T. E., Baker, R. E. [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''. In {{cite book |author-link1 = Jack Copeland|last1 = Copeland | first1=B. Jack | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | last2=Bowen | first2=Jonathan P. | authorlink3=Robin Wilson (mathematician)| last3=Wilson | first3=Robin | | last4=Sprevak | first4=Mark | title=[[The Turing Guide]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each function, for which a reaction diffusion differential equation holds, represents in fact a ''concentration variable''.

==One-component reaction–diffusion equations==
The simplest reaction–diffusion equation is in one spatial dimension in plane geometry,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u = D \partial^2_x u + R(u),&lt;/math&gt;

is also referred to as the [[Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Kolmogorov et al., Moscow Univ. Bull. Math. A 1 (1937): 1{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the reaction term vanishes, then the equation represents a pure diffusion process. The corresponding equation is [[Fick's law|Fick's second law]]. The choice {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u'')}} yields [[Fisher's equation]] that was originally used to describe the spreading of biological [[population]]s,&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Fisher, Ann. Eug. 7 (1937): 355&lt;/ref&gt; the Newell–Whitehead-Segel equation with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} to describe [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]],&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Newell and J. A. Whitehead, J. Fluid Mech. 38 (1969): 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Segel, J. Fluid Mech. 38 (1969): 203&lt;/ref&gt; the more general [[Zeldovich]] equation with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''(1 − ''u'')(''u'' − ''α'')}} and {{math|0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; 1}} that arises in [[combustion]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Y. B. Zeldovich and D. A. Frank-Kamenetsky, Acta Physicochim. 9 (1938): 341&lt;/ref&gt; and its particular degenerate case with {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} that is sometimes referred to as the Zeldovich equation as well.&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Gilding and R. Kersner, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tdIACAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Travelling Waves in Nonlinear Diffusion Convection Reaction], Birkhäuser (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of one-component systems is subject to certain restrictions as the evolution equation can also be written in the variational form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u=-\frac{\delta\mathfrak L}{\delta u}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore describes a permanent decrease of the "free energy" &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak L&lt;/math&gt; given by the functional

:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak L=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[\tfrac{D}{2} \left (\partial_xu \right )^2-V(u)\right]\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

with a potential {{math|''V''(''u'')}} such that {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} {{sfrac|d''V''(''u'')|d''u''}}.}}

[[Image:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A travelling wave front solution for Fisher's equation.]]  
In systems with more than one stationary homogeneous solution, a typical solution is given by travelling fronts connecting the homogeneous states. These solutions move with constant speed without changing their shape and are of the form {{math|''u''(''x'', ''t'') {{=}} ''û''(''ξ'')}} with {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} ''x'' − ''ct''}}, where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of the travelling wave. Note that while travelling waves are generically stable structures, all non-monotonous stationary solutions (e.g. localized domains composed of a front-antifront pair) are unstable. For {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, there is a simple proof for this statement:&lt;ref name="fife"&gt;P. C. Fife, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJXsCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathematical Aspects of Reacting and Diffusing Systems], Springer (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; if {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a stationary solution and {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') + ''ũ''(''x'', ''t'')}} is an infinitesimally perturbed solution, linear stability analysis yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t \tilde{u}=D\partial_x^2 \tilde{u}-U(x)\tilde{u},\qquad U(x) = -R^{\prime}(u)|_{u=u_0(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz {{math|''ũ'' {{=}} ''ψ''(''x'')exp(−''λt'')}} we arrive at the eigenvalue problem

:&lt;math&gt; \hat H\psi=\lambda\psi, \qquad \hat H=-D\partial_x^2+U(x),&lt;/math&gt;

of [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger type]] where negative eigenvalues result in the instability of the solution. Due to translational invariance {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a neutral [[eigenfunction]] with the [[eigenvalue]] {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}}, and all other eigenfunctions can be sorted according to an increasing number of knots with the magnitude of the corresponding real eigenvalue increases  monotonically with the number of zeros. The eigenfunction {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} should have at least one zero, and for a non-monotonic stationary solution the corresponding eigenvalue {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} cannot be the lowest one, thereby implying instability.

To determine the velocity {{mvar|c}} of a moving front, one may go to a moving coordinate system and look at stationary solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;D \partial^2_{\xi}\hat{u}(\xi)+ c\partial_{\xi} \hat{u}(\xi)+R(\hat{u}(\xi))=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has a nice mechanical analogue as the motion of a mass {{mvar|D}} with position {{math|''û''}} in the course of the "time" {{mvar|ξ}} under the force {{mvar|R}} with the damping coefficient c which allows for a rather illustrative access to the construction of different types of solutions and the determination of {{mvar|c}}.

When going from one to more space dimensions, a number of statements from one-dimensional systems can still be applied. Planar or curved wave fronts are typical structures, and a new effect arises as the local velocity of a curved front becomes dependent on the local [[curvature|radius of curvature]] (this can be seen by going to [[polar coordinates]]). This phenomenon leads to the so-called curvature-driven instability.&lt;ref name="mikhailov"&gt;A. S. Mikhailov, Foundations of Synergetics I. Distributed Active Systems, Springer (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-component reaction–diffusion equations==
Two-component systems allow for a much larger range of possible phenomena than their one-component counterparts. An important idea that was first proposed by [[Alan Turing]] is that a state that is stable in the local system can become unstable in the presence of [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Turing, Phil. Transact. Royal Soc. B 237 (1952): 37&lt;/ref&gt;

A linear stability analysis however shows that when linearizing the general two-component system

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \partial_t u \\ \partial_t v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} D_u &amp;0 \\0&amp;D_v \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_{xx} u\\ \partial_{xx} v \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} F(u,v)\\G(u,v)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

a [[plane wave]] perturbation

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\boldsymbol{q}}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{x},t) = \begin{pmatrix} \tilde{u}(t)\\\tilde{v}(t) \end{pmatrix} e^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}} &lt;/math&gt;

of the stationary homogeneous solution will satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \partial_t \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ \partial_t \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} = -k^2\begin{pmatrix} D_u \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ D_v\tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} + \boldsymbol{R}^{\prime} \begin{pmatrix}\tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \\ \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Turing's idea can only be realized in four [[equivalence class]]es of systems characterized by the signs of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] {{math|'''''R'''''′}} of the reaction function. In particular, if a finite wave vector {{math|'''''k'''''}} is supposed to be the most unstable one, the Jacobian must have the signs

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;-\\+&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;+\\-&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} -&amp;+\\-&amp;+\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\begin{pmatrix} -&amp;-\\+&amp;+\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This class of systems is named ''activator-inhibitor system'' after its first representative: close to the ground state, one component stimulates the production of both components while the other one inhibits their growth. Its most prominent representative is the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\partial_t u &amp;= d_u^2 \,\nabla^2 u + f(u) - \sigma v, \\
\tau \partial_t v &amp;= d_v^2 \,\nabla^2 v + u - v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''u'') {{=}} ''λu'' − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''κ''}} which describes how an [[action potential]] travels through a nerve.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;R. FitzHugh, Biophys. J. 1 (1961): 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Nagumo et al., Proc. Inst. Radio Engin. Electr. 50 (1962): 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Here, {{math|''d&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''τ'', ''σ''}} and {{math|''λ''}} are positive constants.

When an activator-inhibitor system undergoes a change of parameters, one may pass from conditions under which a homogeneous ground state is stable to conditions under which it is linearly unstable. The corresponding [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] may be either a [[Hopf bifurcation]] to a globally oscillating homogeneous state with a dominant wave number {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} or a ''Turing bifurcation'' to a globally patterned state with a dominant finite wave number. The latter in two spatial dimensions typically leads to stripe or hexagonal patterns.

&lt;gallery caption="Subcritical Turing bifurcation: formation of a hexagonal pattern from noisy initial conditions in the above two-component reaction-diffusion system of Fitzhugh-Nagumo type." widths="257" heights="235" perrow="3"&gt;

Image:Turing_bifurcation_3.gif| Almost converged state at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For the Fitzhugh-Nagumo example, the neutral stability curves marking the boundary of the linearly stable region for the Turing and Hopf bifurcation are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q_{\text{n}}^H(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{1}{\tau} + \left  (d_u^2 + \frac{1}{\tau} d_v^2 \right )k^2 &amp; =f^{\prime}(u_{h}),\\[6pt]
q_{\text{n}}^T(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{\kappa}{1 + d_v^2 k^2}+ d_u^2 k^2 &amp; = f^{\prime}(u_{h}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the bifurcation is subcritical, often localized structures ([[dissipative solitons]]) can be observed in the [[Hysteresis|hysteretic]] region where the pattern coexists with the ground state. Other frequently encountered structures comprise pulse trains (also known as [[periodic travelling wave]]s), spiral waves and target patterns. These three solution types are also generic features of two- (or more-) component reaction-diffusion equations in which the local dynamics have a stable limit cycle&lt;ref&gt;N. Kopell and L.N. Howard, Stud. Appl. Math. 52 (1973): 291&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Three- and more-component reaction–diffusion equations==
For a variety of systems, reaction-diffusion equations with more than two components have been proposed, e.g. as models for the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Vanag and I. R. Epstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004): 128301&lt;/ref&gt; for [[blood clotting]]&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Lobanova
and F. I. Ataullakhanov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004): 098303&lt;/ref&gt; or planar [[gas discharge]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;H.-G. Purwins et al. in: Dissipative Solitons, Lectures Notes in Physics, Ed. N. Akhmediev and A. Ankiewicz, Springer (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that systems with more components allow for a variety of phenomena not possible in systems with one or two components (e.g. stable running pulses in more than one spatial dimension without global feedback),.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Schenk et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997): 3781&lt;/ref&gt; An introduction and systematic overview of the possible phenomena in dependence on the properties of the underlying system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Liehr: ''Dissipative Solitons in Reaction Diffusion Systems. Mechanism, Dynamics, Interaction.'' Volume 70 of Springer Series in Synergetics, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg 2013, {{isbn|978-3-642-31250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and universality==
In recent times, reaction–diffusion systems have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons) can be found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an essential basis for processes connected to [[morphogenesis]] in biology&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Harrison, Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern, Cambridge University Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Meinhardt, Models of Biological Pattern Formation, Academic Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions,&lt;ref&gt;E.E. Holmes et al, Ecology 75 (1994): 17&lt;/ref&gt; spread of epidemics,&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Murray et al, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 229 (1986: 111&lt;/ref&gt; tumour growth&lt;ref&gt;M.A.J. Chaplain J. Bio. Systems 3 (1995): 929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and M.A. Nowak, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 248 (1992): 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Gatenby and E.T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res. 56 (1996): 5745&lt;/ref&gt; and wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and J.D. Murray, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 241 (1990): 29&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.&lt;ref name="fife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mikhailov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Grindrod, Patterns and Waves: The Theory and Applications of Reaction-Diffusion Equations, Clarendon Press (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

== Experiments ==
Well-controllable experiments in chemical reaction-diffusion systems have up to now been realized in three ways. First, gel reactors&lt;ref&gt;K.-J.

Second, [[temperature]] pulses on [[Catalytic converter|catalytic surfaces]] have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Rotermund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 (1991): 3083&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Graham et al., J. Phys. Chem. 97 (1993): 7564&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the propagation of running nerve pulses is modelled using reaction-diffusion systems.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley, J. Physiol. 117 (1952): 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these generic examples, it has turned out that under appropriate circumstances electric transport systems like plasmas&lt;ref&gt;M. Bode and H.-G. Purwins, Physica D 86 (1995): 53&lt;/ref&gt; or semiconductors&lt;ref&gt;E. Schöll, Nonlinear Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Chaos in Semiconductors, Cambridge University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; can be described in a reaction-diffusion approach. For these systems various experiments on pattern formation have been carried out.

==Numerical treatments==
A reaction-diffusion system can be solved by using methods of [[numerical mathematics]]. There are existing several numerical treatments in research literature.&lt;ref&gt;S.Tang et al., J.Austral.Math.Soc. Ser.B 35(1993): 223-243&lt;/ref&gt; Also for complex [[geometry|geometries]] numerical solution methods are proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Isaacson | first1 = Samuel A. | last2 = Peskin | first2 = Charles S.| title = Incorporating Diffusion in Complex Geometries into Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Simulations | journal = SIAM J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1959">In mathematics ([[differential geometry]]) by a '''ribbon''' (or strip) &lt;math&gt;(X,U)&lt;/math&gt; is meant a smooth space [[curve]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given by a three-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;X(s)&lt;/math&gt;, depending continuously on the curve [[Arc length|arc-length]] &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;a\leq s \leq b&lt;/math&gt;), together with a smoothly varying unit vector &lt;math&gt;U(s)&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; at each point (Blaschke 1950).

The ribbon &lt;math&gt;(X,U)&lt;/math&gt; is called ''simple'' and ''closed'' if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is simple (i.e. without self-intersections) and closed and if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and all its derivatives agree at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. 
For any simple closed ribbon the curves &lt;math&gt;X+\varepsilon U&lt;/math&gt; given parametrically by &lt;math&gt;X(s)+\varepsilon U(s)&lt;/math&gt; are, for all sufficiently small positive &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, simple closed curves disjoint from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The ribbon concept plays an important role in the Cǎlugǎreǎnu-White-Fuller 
formula (Fuller 1971), that states that

:&lt;math&gt;Lk = Wr + Tw \;,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Lk&lt;/math&gt; is the asymptotic (Gauss) [[linking number]] (a topological quantity), &lt;math&gt;Wr&lt;/math&gt; denotes the total writhing number (or simply [[writhe]]) and &lt;math&gt;Tw&lt;/math&gt; is the total twist number (or simply [[Twist (mathematics)|twist]]).

[[Ribbon theory]] investigates geometric and topological aspects of a mathematical reference ribbon associated with physical and biological properties, such as those arising in [[topological fluid dynamics]], [[DNA]] modeling and in [[material science]].

In the [[mathematical]] field of [[differential geometry]], the '''Riemann curvature tensor''' or '''Riemann–Christoffel tensor''' (after [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]]) is the most common method used to express the [[curvature of Riemannian manifolds]].  It assigns a [[tensor]] to each point of a [[Riemannian manifold]] (i.e., it is a [[tensor field]]), that measures the extent to which the [[metric tensor]] is not locally isometric to that of Euclidean space.  The curvature tensor can also be defined for any [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]], or indeed any manifold equipped with an [[affine connection]].

It is a central mathematical tool in the theory of [[general relativity]], the modern theory of [[gravity]], and the curvature of [[spacetime]] is in principle observable via the [[geodesic deviation equation]].  The curvature tensor represents the [[tidal force]] experienced by a rigid body moving along a [[geodesic]] in a sense made precise by the [[Jacobi field|Jacobi equation]].

The curvature tensor is given in terms of the [[Levi-Civita connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; by the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w=\nabla_u\nabla_v w - \nabla_v \nabla_u w - \nabla_{[u,v]} w&lt;/math&gt;

where [''u'',''v''] is the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]].  For each pair of tangent vectors ''u'', ''v'',  ''R''(''u'',''v'') is a linear transformation of the tangent space of the manifold.  It is linear in ''u'' and ''v'', and so defines a tensor.  Occasionally, the curvature tensor is defined with the opposite sign.

If &lt;math&gt;u=\partial/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v=\partial/\partial x^j&lt;/math&gt; are coordinate vector fields then &lt;math&gt;[u,v]=0&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the formula simplifies to  
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w=\nabla_u\nabla_v w - \nabla_v \nabla_u w .&lt;/math&gt;
The curvature tensor measures ''noncommutativity of the covariant derivative'', and as such is the [[integrability condition|integrability obstruction]] for the existence of an isometry with Euclidean space (called, in this context, ''flat'' space).  The linear transformation &lt;math&gt;w\mapsto R(u,v)w&lt;/math&gt; is also called the '''curvature transformation''' or '''endomorphism'''.

The curvature formula can also be expressed in terms of the [[second covariant derivative]] defined as:&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawson |first1=H. Blaine, Jr. |last2=Michelsohn |first2=Marie-Louise |author2-link=Marie-Louise Michelsohn |title=Spin Geometry |year=1989 |page=154 |publisher=Princeton U Press |isbn=0-691-08542-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla^2_{u,v} w = \nabla_u\nabla_v w - \nabla_{\nabla_u v} w &lt;/math&gt;

which is linear in ''u'' and ''v''. Then:

: &lt;math&gt;R(u,v)=\nabla^2_{u,v} - \nabla^2_{v,u} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus in the general case of non-coordinate vectors ''u'' and ''v'', the curvature tensor measures the noncommutativity of the second covariant derivative.

==Geometric meaning==
[[File:Riemann_curvature_motivation_shpere.gif|thumbnail|An illustration of the motivation of Riemann curvature on a [[sphere]]-like manifold. The fact that this transport may define two different vectors at the start point gives rise to Riemann curvature tensor. The [[right angle]] symbol denotes that the [[inner product]] (given by the [[metric tensor]]) between transported vectors (or tangent vectors of the curves) is 0.]]

===Informally===
One can see the effects of curved space by comparing a tennis court and the Earth. Start at the lower right corner of the tennis court, with a racket held out towards north. Then while walking around the outline of the court, at each step make sure the tennis racket is maintained in the same orientation, parallel to its previous positions. Once the loop is complete the tennis racket will be parallel to its initial starting position. This is because tennis courts are built so the surface is flat. On the other hand, the surface of the Earth is curved: we can complete a loop on the surface of the Earth. Starting at the equator, point a tennis racket north along the surface of the Earth.  Once again the tennis racket should always remain parallel to its previous position, using the local plane of the horizon as a reference. For this path, first walk to the north pole, then turn 90 degrees and walk down to the equator, and finally turn 90 degrees and walk back to the start. 
However now the tennis racket will be pointing backwards (towards the east). This process is akin to [[parallel transport]]ing a vector along the path and the difference identifies how lines which appear "straight" are only "straight" locally. Each time a loop is completed the tennis racket will be deflected further from its initial position by an amount depending on the distance and the curvature of the surface. It is possible to identify paths along a curved surface where parallel transport works as it does on flat space. These are the [[geodesic]] of the space, for example any segment of a great circle of a sphere.

The concept of a curved space in mathematics differs from conversational usage. For example, if the above process was completed on a cylinder one would find that it is not curved overall as the curvature around the cylinder cancels with the flatness along the cylinder, this is a consequence of [[Gaussian curvature]] and the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. A familiar example of this is a floppy pizza slice which will remain rigid along its length if it is curved along its width.

The Riemann curvature tensor is a way to capture a measure of the intrinsic curvature. When you write it down in terms of its components (like writing down the components of a vector), it consists of a multi-dimensional array of sums and products of partial derivatives (some of those partial derivatives can be thought of as akin to capturing the curvature imposed upon someone walking in straight lines on a curved surface).

===Formally===
When a vector in a Euclidean space is [[parallel transport]]ed around a loop, it will again point in the initial direction after returning to its original position. However, this property does not hold in the general case. The Riemann curvature tensor directly measures the failure of this in a general [[Riemannian manifold]]. This failure is known as the non-[[holonomy]] of the manifold.

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; be a curve in a Riemannian manifold ''M''.  Denote by τ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; : T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' → T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' the parallel transport map along ''x''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;.  The parallel transport maps are related to the [[covariant derivative]] by
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\dot{x}_0} Y = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{1}{h}\left(Y_{x_0}-\tau^{-1}_{x_h}(Y_{x_h})\right) = \left.\frac{d}{dt}(\tau_{x_t}Y)\right|_{t=0}&lt;/math&gt;
for each [[vector field]] ''Y'' defined along the curve.

Suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are a pair of commuting vector fields.  Each of these fields generates a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms in a neighborhood of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Denote by τ&lt;sub&gt;tX&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sub&gt;tY&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, the parallel transports along the flows of ''X'' and ''Y'' for time ''t''.  Parallel transport of a vector ''Z'' ∈ T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M'' around the quadrilateral with sides ''tY'', ''sX'', &amp;minus;''tY'', &amp;minus;''sX'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_{sX}^{-1}\tau_{tY}^{-1}\tau_{sX}\tau_{tY}Z.&lt;/math&gt;
This measures the failure of parallel transport to return ''Z'' to its original position in the tangent space T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''M''.  Shrinking the loop by sending ''s'', ''t'' → 0 gives the infinitesimal description of this deviation:
:&lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{d}{ds}\frac{d}{dt}\tau_{sX}^{-1}\tau_{tY}^{-1}\tau_{sX}\tau_{tY}Z\right|_{s=t=0} = (\nabla_X\nabla_Y - \nabla_Y\nabla_X - \nabla_{[X,Y]})Z = R(X,Y)Z&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R'' is the Riemann curvature tensor.

==Coordinate expression==
Converting to the [[tensor index notation]], the Riemann curvature tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = dx^\rho(R(\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu})\partial_{\sigma})&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu} = \partial/\partial x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinate vector fields. The above expression can be written using [[Christoffel symbols]]:
:&lt;math&gt;R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\sigma}
    - \partial_\nu\Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\sigma}
    + \Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\sigma}
    - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

(see also the [[list of formulas in Riemannian geometry]]).

The Riemann curvature tensor is also the [[commutator]] of the covariant derivative of an arbitrary covector &lt;math&gt;A_{\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with itself:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Synge J.L., Schild A. |title=Tensor Calculus |publisher=first Dover Publications 1978 edition |pages=83; 107 |year=  1949
|isbn=978-0-486-63612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P. A. M. Dirac| title=General Theory of Relativity| publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | year=1996| isbn=0-691-01146-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\nu ; \rho \sigma} - A_{\nu ; \sigma \rho} = A_{\beta} R^{\beta}{}_{\nu \rho \sigma} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
since the [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt; is torsionless, which means that the [[torsion tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu}-\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt; vanishes.

This formula is often called the ''Ricci identity''.&lt;ref name="lovelockrund"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lovelock | first1=David |last2=Rund |first2=Hanno |authorlink2=Hanno Rund | title=Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles | year=1989 | origyear=1975 |page=84,109 | publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-65840-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the classical method used by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|Ricci]] and [[Tullio Levi-Civita|Levi-Civita]] to obtain an expression for the Riemann curvature tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications|last=Ricci|first=Gregorio|author-link=Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|last2=Levi-Civita|first2=Tullio |journal=Mathematische Annalen |publisher=Springer |volume=54 |issue=1–2 |date=March 1900 |pages=125–201|doi=10.1007/BF01454201|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u21237446l22rgg7/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the tensor character of the set of quantities &lt;math&gt;R^{\beta}{}_{\nu \rho \sigma}\,&lt;/math&gt; is proved.

This identity can be generalized to get the commutators for two covariant derivatives of arbitrary tensors as follows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sandberg, Vernon D |date=1978 |title=Tensor spherical harmonics on S 2 and S 3 as eigenvalue problems |url=http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.523649 |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Physics]], |volume=19 |issue=12 |pages=2441-2446 |doi=10.1063/1.523649  |access-date=20 April 2018 |bibcode=1978JMP....19.2441S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\nabla_\delta \nabla_\gamma T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s } - \nabla_\gamma \nabla_\delta T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} = \, &amp; - R^{\alpha_1}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\rho \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} - \cdots - R^{\alpha_r}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \rho}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
&amp; + \, R^\sigma{}_{\beta_1 \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\sigma \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s} + \cdots + R^\sigma{}_{\beta_s \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \sigma} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This formula also applies to [[tensor density|tensor densities]] without alteration, because for the Levi-Civita (''not generic'') connection one gets:&lt;ref name="lovelockrund"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mu}(\sqrt{g}\,)\equiv (\sqrt{g}\,)_{;\mu}=0 \, , 
\quad {\mathrm{where}} \quad {g}=|{\mathrm{det}}(g_{\mu\nu})|\, .&lt;/math&gt;

It is sometimes convenient to also define the purely covariant version by
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\rho\sigma\mu\nu} = g_{\rho \zeta} R^\zeta{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Symmetries and identities==
The Riemann curvature tensor has the following symmetries:
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)=-R(v,u)^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle R(u,v)w,z \rangle=-\langle R(u,v)z,w \rangle^{}_{}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(u,v)w+R(v,w)u+R(w,u)v=0 ^{}_{}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the bracket &lt;math&gt;\langle,\rangle&lt;/math&gt; refers to the inner product on the tangent space induced by the [[metric tensor]]. The last identity was discovered by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro|Ricci]], but is often called the '''first Bianchi identity''' or '''algebraic Bianchi identity''', because it looks similar to the [[Luigi Bianchi|Bianchi]] identity below. (Also, if there is nonzero [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], the first Bianchi identity becomes a differential identity of the [[torsion tensor]].)
These three identities form a complete list of symmetries of the curvature tensor, i.e. given any tensor which satisfies the identities above, one can find a Riemannian manifold with such a curvature tensor at some point. Simple calculations show that such a tensor has &lt;math&gt;n^2(n^2-1)/12&lt;/math&gt; independent components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergmann P.G. |title=Introduction to the Theory of Relativity |publisher=Dover |pages=172-174 |year= 1976|isbn= 978-0-486-63282-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another useful identity follows from these three:
:&lt;math&gt;\langle R(u,v)w,z \rangle=\langle R(w,z)u,v \rangle^{}_{}.&lt;/math&gt;

On a Riemannian manifold one has the covariant derivative &lt;math&gt; \nabla_u R &lt;/math&gt; and the [[Bianchi identity]] (often called the second Bianchi identity or differential Bianchi identity) takes the form: 
    
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla_uR)(v,w)+(\nabla_vR)(w,u)+(\nabla_w R)(u,v) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Given any [[coordinate chart]] about some point on the manifold, the above identities may be written in terms of the components of the Riemann tensor at this point as:

;Skew symmetry
::&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=-R_{bacd}=-R_{abdc}&lt;/math&gt;

;Interchange symmetry
::&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=R_{cdab}&lt;/math&gt;

;First (algebraic) Bianchi identity
::&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}+R_{acdb}+R_{adbc}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:This is often written
::&lt;math&gt;R_{a[bcd]}^{}=0,&lt;/math&gt;
:where the brackets denote the [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric part]] on the indicated indices.  This is equivalent to the previous version of the identity because the Riemann tensor is already skew on its last two indices.

;Second (differential) Bianchi identity
::&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd;e}^{}+R_{abde;c}^{}+R_{abec;d}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:The semi-colon denotes a covariant derivative. Equivalently,
::&lt;math&gt;R_{ab[cd;e]}^{}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:again using the antisymmetry on the last two indices of ''R''.

The algebraic symmetries are also equivalent to saying that ''R'' belongs to the image of the [[Young symmetrizer]] corresponding to the partition 2+2.

==Ricci curvature==
The [[Ricci curvature]] tensor is the contraction of the first and third indices of the Riemann tensor.
:&lt;math&gt; \underbrace{\operatorname{R}_{ab}}_{\text{Ricci}}
\equiv \underbrace{\operatorname{R}^c{}_{acb}}_{\text{Riemann}}
= g^{cd} \underbrace{\operatorname{R}_{cadb}}_{\text{Riemann}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==
;Surfaces
For a two-dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]], the Bianchi identities imply that the Riemann tensor has only one independent component which means the Ricci scalar completely determines the Riemann tensor. There is only one valid expression for the Riemann tensor which fits the required symmetries:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}= f(R) (g_{ac}g_{db}- g_{ad}g_{cb}) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and by contracting with the metric twice we find the explicit form:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=K(g_{ac}g_{db}- g_{ad}g_{cb}) \, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor]] and &lt;math&gt;K = R/2&lt;/math&gt; is a function called the [[Gaussian curvature]] and ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' take values either 1 or&amp;nbsp;2. The Riemann tensor has only one functionally independent component. The Gaussian curvature coincides with the [[sectional curvature]] of the surface.  It is also exactly half the [[scalar curvature]] of the 2-manifold, while the [[Ricci curvature]] tensor of the surface is simply given by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{R}_{ab} = Kg_{ab}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

;Space forms
A Riemannian manifold is a [[space form]] if its [[sectional curvature]] is equal to a constant ''K''.  The Riemann tensor of a space form is given by

:&lt;math&gt;R_{abcd}^{}=K(g_{ac}g_{db}-g_{ad}g_{cb}).&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, except in dimension 2, if the curvature of a Riemannian manifold has this form for some function ''K'', then the Bianchi identities imply that ''K'' is constant and thus that the manifold is (locally) a space form.

'''Sam Ely and Lynn Harris''' are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as [[Per Hüttner]], [[Lisa Lefeuvre]], [[Apolonija Šušteršič]], Simon Morris, [[Dallas Seitz]] and [[Denise Hawyrsio]]. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations. They are currently developing volume 4 for their online research/curatorial project [[Unrealised Projects]].&lt;ref&gt;Jablonskiene, Lolita, October 2008, Printed Project, Issue 10, 'The Art of Living with Strangers', p132, ISSN 1649-4075.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secret law in the United States ==

Since about 2015 the branches of the United States federal government have accused one another of creating secret law.  Journalists, scholars, and anti-secrecy activists have also made similar allegations.  Scholarly analysis has shown that secret law is present in all three branches.  One scholar, Professor Dakota Rudesill, recommends that the country affirmatively decide whether to tolerate secret law, and proposes principles for governing it, including: public law’s supremacy over secret law; no secret criminal law; public notification of creation of secret law; presumptive sunset and publication dates; and availability of all secret law to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudesill|first1=Dakota|title=Coming to Terms With Secret Law|journal=Harvard National Security Journal|date=2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=241–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title =The new era secret law | work = | date =18 October 2016 | url = https://www.brennancenter.org/publication/new-era-secret-law| accessdate = 15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret regulations in UK public places==
In Britain many open places freely accessible by the public are actually [[privately owned public space]]s (POPS). Information on ownership is considered confidential, and not provided either by the owners, or by [[Local government in England|local councils]] that have the information. As in any private property the owner may require visitors to abide by specified rules; but people freely accessing the place are not informed of the rules, which may nevertheless be enforced by security guards. Typical prohibitions which do not apply to genuinely public spaces include protesting, and photography.

Councils mostly refused to provide information on existing and planned pseudo-public spaces. They also refused to say how information could be obtained, or to provide information on private restrictions on exercising the other rights people have on genuinely public land. Councils were criticised for being under the influence of property developers and corporate owners. A member of the London Assembly said "Being able to know what rules you are being governed by, and how to challenge them, is a fundamental part of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space#comment-105829422 |title='It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 September 2017  |author= |accessdate= 26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admonitions Scroll Scene 11.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A lady seated by herself|This penultimate scene of the ''[[Admonitions Scroll]]'' shows a palace lady sitting in quiet contemplation, presumably following the admonitions in the accompanying lines:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=McCausland | first=Shane | year=2003 | title=First Masterpiece of Chinese Painting: The Admonitions Scroll | publisher=[[British Museum Press]] | page=78 | isbn=978-0-7141-2417-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Therefore I say: Be cautious and circumspect in all you do, and from this good fortune will arise.

'''Human self-reflection''' is the capacity of [[human]]s to exercise [[introspection]] and the willingness to learn more about their fundamental nature, purpose and [[essence]]. The earliest historical records demonstrate the great interest which humanity has had in itself.

Human self-reflection is related to the [[philosophy]] of consciousness, the topic of [[awareness]], [[consciousness]] in general and the [[philosophy of mind]]. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==

===Prehistoric times===
Prehistoric notions about the status of humanity may be guessed by the etymology of ancient words for man. [[Latin]] ''homo'' ([[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*dʰǵʰm̥mō'') means "of the earth, earthling", probably in opposition to "celestial" beings. [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἂνθρωπος}} ([[mycenaean language|mycenaean]] ''*anthropos'') means "low-eyed", again probably contrasting with a divine perspective.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Ancient Orient===
From the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd-millennium]] [[Old Kingdom of Egypt]], belief in the eternal afterlife of the human [[Egyptian soul|ka]] is documented. From the earliest times, man made out a claim of dominance of humanity alongside radical [[pessimism]] because of the frailty and brevity of human [[life]] (in the [[Hebrew Bible]], for example, dominion of man is promised in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:28, but the author of [[Ecclesiastes]] bewails the vanity of all human effort).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Classical antiquity===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Diogenes of Sinope]] --&gt;
[[Protagoras]] made the famous claim that ''"Man is the measure of all things; of what is, that it is; of what is not, that it is not"''. [[Socrates]] advocated for all humans to "[[know thyself]]", and gave the (doubtlessly tongue-in-cheek) definition of humans as "featherless bipeds" ([[Plato]], ''Politicus''). More serious is [[Aristotle]]'s description of man as the "communal animal" (ζῶον πολιτικόν), i.e., emphasizing society-building as a central trait of human nature, and [[rational animal|"thought bearer animal"]] ({{lang|grc|ζῶον λόγον ἔχον}}, ''animal rationale''),{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} a term that also inspired the species' taxonomy, ''Homo sapiens''.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Middle Ages===
The dominant world-view of medieval Europe, as directed by the [[Catholic Church]], was that human existence is essentially good and created in "original grace", but because of concupiscence, is marred  by [[sin]], and that its aim should be to focus on the beatific vision after [[death]]. The 13th century pope [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] wrote about the essential misery of earthly existence in his ''"On the misery of the human condition"'' &amp;ndash; a view that was disputed by, for example, [[Giannozzo Manetti]] in his treatise ''"On human dignity."''{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Renaissance===
{{see also|Renaissance humanism}}
A famous quote of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]] (II, ii, 115-117), expressing the contrast of human physical beauty, intellectual faculty, and ephemeral nature:
:''What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?''

[[René Descartes]] famously and succinctly proposed: ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''&lt;ref&gt;Descartes, René; ''[[Principles of Philosophy|Principia Philosophiae]]'' (1644), Part 1, article 7:"''Ac proinde hæc cognitio, ego cogito, ergo sum, est omnium prima &amp; certissima, quæ cuilibet ordine philosophanti occurrat.''"&lt;/ref&gt;  (French: "''Je pense donc je suis''"; English: "''I think, therefore I am''").

===Modern era===
The [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was driven by a renewed conviction, that, in the words of [[Immanuel Kant]], ''"Man is distinguished above all animals by his self-consciousness, by which he is a 'rational animal'."'' In the 19th century,  [[Karl Marx]] defined man as "labouring animal" (''animal laborans'') in conscious opposition to this tradition. In the early 20th century, [[Sigmund Freud]] dealt a serious blow to [[positivism]] by postulating that human behaviour is to a large part controlled by the [[unconscious mind]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Comparison to other species ==
Various attempts have been made to identify a single behavioural characteristic that distinguishes humans from all other animals. Many [[anthropologist]]s think that readily observable characteristics ([[tool]]-making and [[language]]) are based on less easily observable [[mental process]]es that might be unique among humans: the ability to think [[symbol]]ically, in the abstract or [[logic]]ally, although several species have demonstrated some abilities in these areas. Nor is it clear at what point exactly in human evolution these traits became prevalent. They may not be restricted to the species ''Homo sapiens'', as the extinct species of the genus ''Homo'' (e.g. ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'') are believed to also have been adept tool makers and may also have had linguistic skills.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In learning environments reflection is an important part of the loop to go through in order to maximise the utility of having experiences. Rather than moving on to the next 'task' we can review the process and outcome of the task and – with the benefit of a little distance (lapsed time) we can reconsider what the value of  experience might be for us and for the context of which it was a part. {{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">A '''sunshine list''' is a listing of salary, benefit and severance information.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"&gt;[http://www.calgarysun.com/2014/03/20/alberta-premier-alison-redford-leaves-mixed-legacy-behind "Alberta Premier Alison Redford Leaves Mixed Legacy Behind]&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the list is commonly used for example by provincial or municipal governments to identify any publicly employed person making $100,000 salary or higher.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-top-public-earners-list-released-1.2590152 CBC News "Sunshine List 2014: Ontario's Top Public Earners List Released"]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the list is to provide accountability and transparency, requiring "organizations that receive public funding from the Province of Ontario to disclose annually the names, positions, salaries and total taxable benefits of employees paid $100,000 or more in a calendar year."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/ Government of Ottawa Salary Disclosure Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Alberta===
Alberta first started publishing a sunshine list in 2014 following the 2012 election of [[Alison Redford]]. The introduction of the list followed public debate about the severance awarded to Redford's former chief of staff.&lt;ref name="calgarysun.com"/&gt; In Alberta, the policy applies to deputy ministers, senior officials, political staff appointed under the Executive Assistant Order and employees defined under the Public Service Act who work for the offices of ministers and associate ministers, and who make an annual base salary of at least $100,000. The government began disclosing base salaries, benefit and severance amounts, and details of contract and termination agreements beginning on 31 January 2014. Information was to be posted online twice annually no later than 30 June and 31 December and included all staff employed as of 23 April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140819012327/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/news-views/news/sunshine-list-11654/ FFWD weekly article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario===
Ontario introduced the sunshine list in 1996 under the [[Mike Harris]] government.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

==Uses==
While intended as an accountability tool, the lists have been used for other purposes. ''[[Maclean's]]'' magazine, for example, has used the list to examine employment equity in academia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/knocking-on-the-glass-ceiling/ "Knocking on the Glass Ceiling"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flaw==
In 2011, Chris Mazza, President and CEO of [[Ornge]], managed to stay off the sunshine list while making $1.4 million per year in a controversial scandal.&lt;ref name="Star22Dec11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1105806--ornge-president-was-paid-1-4-million-per-year|title = ORNGE president was paid $1.4 million per year|accessdate = 2 February 2012|last = Donovan|first = Kevin|date = 22 December 2011| work = [[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweatshop Free. Made in USA.|work=Americanapparel.ne|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a famous American clothing brand, which means coercion-free, fair-compensation for the garment workers who manufacture their products. The aim of sweatshop-free wish to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and products are made in good working conditions. Sweatshop-free standards include the right to collective bargaining, non-poverty wages, safe workplaces, back wages, and non-harassment. It has been heavily featured in American Apparel’s advertisements and become a common term in the garment industry.[[File:Sweatshopfree.jpg|thumb|right]]

==Versus sweatshop==

===Sweatshop===
A sweatshop is a factory or workplace, especially in the garment industry, where workers are employed at very low wages for long hours and under poor working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jOaTCNNtbIC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=sweatshop&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=93FTVMy0BY_g7QbshoH4Dg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop&amp;f=false|title=Making Sweatshops|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sweatshop factories in developing countries such as India, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh employ low-pay worker or even child labour around 10–14 years old to work in their factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/NLC_childlabor.html|title=Children Found Sewing Clothing For Wal-Mart, Hanes &amp; Other U.S. &amp; European Companies  - National Labor Committee|work=Harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These workers are forced to work up to 16 hours a day seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/sweatshops-in-bangladesh|title=Sweatshops in Bangladesh|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not receive any basic employee benefits such as health care, maternity leave, sick pay and holiday pay from their employers. They sometime make the female workers to take birth control and take regular pregnancy test to stop maternity leave. And these workers only earn 25p an hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/sweatshops-and-plantations/china-sweatshops|title=Sweatshops in China|work=War On Want|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is much lower than the legal national [[minimum wage]]. Even labours work long hours everyday, their salaries are usually just enough to cover their basic living cost.

Besides, sweatshop factories usually have harsh working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05sweatshop.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=In Chinese Factories, Lost Fingers and Low Pay |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, no rest break, no air-conditioning and workers have to stand for their entire shift. Some workers even had to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions which may causes working injuries or even fatal factory incidents. Take China as an example, in 2009 alone, approximately one million workers were injured at work and about 20,000 suffered from diseases due to their occupation. The reason for this is that the sweatshop factories did not provide any safety guidance for their employees. Lots of sweatshop workers are also suffering from labour abuse, sexual harassment and discrimination in their workplaces. To avoid labours organising protests or any campaign against unfair labour practise, many sweatshop factories find ways to prevent the establishment of the trade unions.

===Sweatshop-free===
In sweatshop, labours have to work for long hours but receive very low salary which is only half or even less than the legal [[minimum wage]] under a harsh working condition. The aim of sweatshop-free wish to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and products are made in good working conditions. Sweatshop-free standards include the right to collective bargaining, non-poverty wages, safe workplaces, back wages, and non-harassment.

Take American Apparel as an example, they provide all employees and their families lots of employee benefits including health insurance, parking, subsidised public transport, subsidised lunches, free on site massages, a bike lending program, a program of paid days off as well as opening an onside medical clinic for their employees.&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt; American Apparel make sure that their workers are treated fairly and working in a good working conditions. They pay average skilled-sewers 25,000 US dollar per year and 12 US dollar per hour&lt;ref name="americanapparel.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C73D94TwNYC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=sweatshop+free&amp;hl=zh-TW&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWZTVOeiFsOu7AbSzYCwBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sweatshop%20free&amp;f=false|title=Fashion Brands|work=Google.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that twice the national [[minimum wage]], which is in big contrast to 25p per hour wage commonly found in sweatshop factories abroad.

===Sweatshop-free clothing===
There are a few ways to know that you are buying sweatshop-free clothing:
* Look at the garment label. For example, Unite is an international union which makes sweatshop free clothing.
* Many organisations, for example Green America, publish ethical consumer guides which list their recommendations for sources of sweatshop free clothing.
* The price of sweatshop-free clothing is relatively higher than sweatshop products.

==Sweatshop scandals==

===Apple Inc.===

[[File:Iphonee5ss.jpg|thumb|right|The "S" is for Sweatshop]]
[[Apple Inc]]  the world's most valuable technology multinational corporation has been accused that their contractors are forcing workers to do overtime involuntarily at sweatshop working conditions and employing underage workers in its factories. Some labourers are forced to work 24 hours at a time and others are forced to stand for their entire shift. And some workers even had to work at unsafe and hazardous condition. In December 2011, 61 workers in the Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory were injured in a gas explosion whilst trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html|title=Revealed: Inside Apple's Chinese 'sweatshop' factory where workers are paid just £1.12 per hour|work=Mail Online|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the pressurised working conditions, in 2009, 18 workers who work in Foxconn factory, one of the Apple manufacturer, committed suicide after losing an iPhone prototype.&lt;ref name="dailymail.co.uk"/&gt; Over next two years, at least 18 other Apple workers try to commit suicide. Besides, undercover Inspectors have been monitoring Pegatron factory, one of the Apple contractor in Taiwan, for five months and found Apple supplier broke 86 laws and regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-2381182/Apple-accused-sweatshop-conditions-Far-Eastern-factories.html|title=Apple accused of sweatshop conditions at Far-Eastern factories - This is Money|work=This is Money|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; including workers are forced to work up to 70 hours per week as well as hiring more than 100,000 underage labour to work on the production lines. These sweatshop scandals strongly affected the reputation of the company.

[[File:Portestorr.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters stand outside the Primark shop on Oxford St with SWEATSHOP SHAME banner]]

===Primark===
[[Primark]], a leading high street fashion chain, has been blamed that three of its Indian suppliers are using child labour in their factories. After BBC Panorama’s six months undercover investigation, they discovered the Indian suppliers were sub-contracting middlemen who employed children at Bhavanisagar refugee camp. Investigators found a 9-year-old boy who is working in the refugee camp sweatshop “Sometimes we get major orders in and we have to work double quick. I get paid a few rupees for finishing each garment, but in a good day I can make 40 rupees (60p)” and “The beads we sew are very small and when we work late at night we have to work by candle - the electricity in the camp is poor.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/exposed-primarks-sweatshops-that-pay-children-just-60p-a-day-6875294.html|title=Exposed: Primark's sweatshops that pay children just 60p a day|work=The Evening Standard|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primark sub-contractors hired young children to work under poor working conditions, paying them as little as 13p an hour and they have to work up to 48 hours a week.  After BBC Panorama investigation discovered that the Indian suppliers had used child labour to carry out embroidery and sequin work, Primark then fired the Indian suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7824291.stm|title=BBC News - Primark linked to UK sweatshops|work=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC also reported that TNS Knitwear,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nosweat.org.uk/story/2009/01/12/primark-clothes-made-sweatshop-labour-uk-factory|title=Primark: clothes made by sweatshop labour in UK factory|work=Nosweat.org.uk|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Manchester-based supplier that provide Primark with about 20,000 garment a week, was not only employing illegal immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, but also paying them as little as £3 per hour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/872736/primark-linked-manchester-sweatshop/ |title=Primark linked with Manchester sweatshop |publisher=Managementtoday.co.uk |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is well below than the legal [[minimum wage]] but the company has denied all the allegations.

==Sweatshop-free legislation and activism==
In October 2008, the City of Portland, Oregon passed the "City of Portland Sweatshop Free Procuremenat Policy” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=264837|title=ADM-1.17 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy Administrative Rules|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the pacific northwest’s first city to adopt this policy. Portland Sweatshop-Free Purchasing Policy requires the local apparel manufacturers to guarantee their garments were produced in workplaces free of sweatshop conditions. Local apparel manufacturers have to disclose their manufacturing facility locations and meet ethical souring practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2008/10/20/newscolumn1.html?page=all|title=Portland city officials adopt sweatshop-free policy|work=Portland Business Journal|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from monitoring the local apparel manufacturers, the city also participate and collaborate with public agencies and other non- profit organisation to promote sweatshop free procurement practices &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=26882&amp;a=218021|title=ADM-1.16 - Sweatshop Free Procurement Policy and Code of Conduct for Apparel Contractors|date=30 January 2013|work=Portlandonline.com|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is institutionalizing meaningful change. A not-for-profit organisation called SweatsHope &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweatshope.org|title=SweatsHope|work=SweatsHope.org|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to produce ethical factories in Kolkata, India to stop human trafficking (women and children), we also aim to create an ethical place of work for the victims of abuse, freeing them from sex trade. This workplace will become a place of refuge, education, childcare and provide a decent wage. They believe Shutting down one sweatshop, will only create less jobs for people who are already struggling with employment, or that another sweatshop will just open up next door. Retailers are always trying to get cheaper manufacturing costs, this is why we need to stand up and demand ethical treatment and wages for staff. If the consumers demand this, and demand an ‘open book’ of their suppliers, we will create a sweatshop free world.

'''''The Nature of the Judicial Process''''' is a legal classic written by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court]], and [[New York Court of Appeals]] [[Chief Justice]] [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] in 1921.  It was compiled from [[The Storrs Lectures]] delivered at [[Yale Law School]] earlier that year.

==Summary==

The central question of ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' is how judges should decide cases. Cardozo’s answer is that judges should do what they have always done in the Anglo-American legal tradition, namely, follow and apply the law in easy cases, and make new law in hard cases by balancing competing considerations, including the paramount value of social welfare. Cardozo identifies four leading methods of legal analysis: (1) the method of logic (or “analogy,” or “philosophy”), which seeks to extend legal principles in ways that preserve logical consistency; (2) the method of history (or “evolution”), which adverts to the historical origins of the legal rule or concept; (3) the method of custom (or “tradition”), which views social customs as helpful guides to community values and settled expectations; and (4) the method of sociology, which looks to considerations of reason, justice, utility, and social welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin N. Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1921, pp. 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these methods may have their “preponderating value”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular cases. No simple test or rigid formula can decide which method should prevail in a given case.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; But in difficult cases where a legal rule is outmoded or the law contains “gaps” that must be filled, judges should frankly play the role of legislators and let “the welfare of society fix the path.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardozo admits that there are risks in judicial lawmaking. To minimize these, he points to a number of factors that significantly limit judicial discretion. First, judges may make new law only “interstitially,” that is, when the law contains gaps or a legal rule is clearly obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, judges in their exercise of judicial review should never strike down a law unless it is “so plainly arbitrary and oppressive that right-minded men and women could not reasonably regard”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; it otherwise. Finally, when judges invoke norms such as “reason,” “justice,” or “social advantage” when employing the method of sociology, they should look to community standards rather than to their own personal values.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglo-American system of law, Cardozo remarks, a judge “is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In the final balance, a judge’s freedom to innovate is insignificant “compared with the bulk and pressure of the rules that hedge him on every side.”&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 136-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

In claiming that judges do and must make law, Cardozo was siding with [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], [[Roscoe Pound]], [[John Chipman Gray]], and other American “proto-realists” of his day who were challenging the traditional “oracular” or “mechanical” or “formalist” view of judicial reasoning. On that view, judges never make law, they simply discover pre-existing law and apply it. According to strict formalists, there are no hard cases where the law is silent, or ambiguous, or vague, or contradictory, or couched in broad generalities. Rather, the law is clear, consistent, and complete; all legal questions have a single correct answer; and judges are (in Blackstone's phrase) “living oracles” who deduce inexorable legal conclusions from indisputable legal axioms.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Samuel Summers, ''Instrumentalism and American Legal Theory''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982, pp. 138-59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formalism was not Cardozo’s only target in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''. He also attacked radical critics of formalism, such as John Chipman Gray, who claimed that judges have immense freedom and rejected the very idea of law as a set of binding rules. Gray and other proto-realists of the time tried to demystify law and view it with hard-headed pragmatism. They argued that since judges are the ultimate arbiters of law, “law” in the final analysis is whatever judges say it is (or what they predictably will say it is in the future). Cardozo argued that this isn’t an “analysis” of law, but a denial that any true law exists. The proto-realists confuse right with power. Judges may have the power to ignore settle legal standards, but they do not have the right. Moreover, the attempt to identify law with judicial rulings ignores the fact that the great majority of legal questions have clear, uncontroversial answers that guide everyday conduct and are never litigated in courts.&lt;ref&gt;Cardozo, ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'', pp. 126-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and influence==

''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' established Cardozo “as one of the leading jurists of his time”&lt;ref&gt;G. Edward White, ''The American Judicial tradition: Profiles of Leading American Judges.'' Expanded ed. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; and “has become a classic of legal education."&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Its continuing appeal is due, in part, to its self-effacing tone, its lapidary prose, and its attempt to strike a happy medium between legal formalism and radical realist theories that wholly reject traditional views of law, legal reasoning, judicial restraint, and the rule of law.

The great success of Cardozo’s ''The Nature of the Judicial Process'' created demand for further reflections on the law.&lt;ref&gt;White, ''The American Judicial Tradition'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; In two later works, ''The Growth of Law'' (1924) and ''The Paradoxes of Legal Science'' (1927), Cardozo refined, deepened, and to some extent modified the views of law laid out in ''The Nature of the Judicial Process''.

==Notable quotations==

* The great generalities of the constitution have a content and a significance that vary from age to age. (17)

* Nothing is stable. Nothing absolute. All is fluid and changeable. There is an endless “becoming.” We are back with Heraclitus. (28)

* The final cause of law is the welfare of society. (66)

* A constitution states or ought to state not rules for the passing hour, but principles for an expanding future. (83)

* The great ideals of liberty and equality are preserved against the assaults of opportunism, the expediency of the passing hour, the erosion of small encroachments, the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles, by enshrining them in constitutions, and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders. (92)

* The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. (141)

* We shall have to feel our way here as elsewhere in the law. Somewhere between worship of the past and exaltation of the present, the path of safety will be found. (160)

* I was much troubled in spirit, in my first years upon the bench, to find how trackless was the ocean on which I had embarked. I sought for certainty. I was oppressed and disheartened when I found that the quest for it was futile. I was trying to reach land, the solid land of fixed and settled rules, the paradise of a justice that would declare itself by tokens plainer and more commanding than its pale and glimmering reflections in my own vacillating mind and conscience. (166)

* The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by. (168)

* The future . . . is yours. We have been called to do our parts in an ageless process. Long after I am dead and gone, and my little part in it is forgotten, you will be here to do your share, and to carry the torch forward. I know that the flame will burn bright while the torch is in your keeping. (179-80)

'''Topfreedom''' is a [[cultural movement|cultural]] and [[political movement]] seeking changes in laws to allow women to be [[toplessness|topless]] in public places where men are permitted to be [[barechested]], as a form of [[gender equality]]. Specifically, the movement seeks the repeal or overturning of laws which restrict a woman's right not to have her chest covered at all times in public.

In addition, topfreedom advocates seek allowing nursing mothers to openly [[breastfeeding in public|breastfeed in public]], and women to [[bathe]] topless.

==Social and legal attitudes==
{{See also|Indecent exposure|Public indecency}}

Many societies{{which|date=September 2015}} consider women who expose their nipples and areolae as [[modesty|immodest]] and contrary to [[social norms]]. In many jurisdictions{{which|date=September 2015}} a topless woman may be socially or officially harassed or cited for [[Lascivious|public lewdness]], [[indecent exposure]], [[public indecency]] or [[disorderly conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/toplessness004.html|title=Topfreedom: The Fundamental Right of Women|author=Suzanne MacNevin|date=|website=The Feminist eZine|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topfreedom advocates seek to change community attitudes to breasts as sex objects or indecent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.007b.com/topfreedom.php |title=What is Topfreedom? |publisher=007b.com |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=12 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120232359/http://www.007b.com/topfreedom.php |archive-date=20 January 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries in [[Europe]] have decriminalised non-sexual toplessness. Topless swimming and sunbathing on beaches has become acceptable in many parts of Europe, though the practice remains controversial in many places, and not common in most places. Many public swimming pools in Europe are owned by municipalities, which are treated as private organisations and allowed to set their [[dress code]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Breastfeeding===
{{main|Breastfeeding in public}}
In many countries around the world, [[breastfeeding in public]] is not unusual. During 2006–2010 and earlier, a number of news reports in the United States cited incidents where women were refused service or harassed for breastfeeding in public. In response, a majority of U.S. states have passed laws explicitly permitting nursing in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/IssuesResearch/Health/BreastfeedingLaws/tabid/14389/Default.aspx |title=Breastfeeding Laws |author= |date=March 2010 |website=Breastfeeding State Laws |publisher=NCSL |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,200615,00.html |publisher=FOXNews.com |title=Indecent Exposure|first=Lis|last=Wiehl | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/lv/lvjunjul05p51.html|title=Breastfeeding Legislation in the United States: A General Overview and Implications for Helping Mothers|author=|date=|website=|publisher=La Leche League International|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331220518/http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVJunJul05p51.html|archivedate=2007-03-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States federal government enacted a law in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ058.106 |title=Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act, 2000|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which specifically provides that "a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location."

The women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to [[Civil Court]]. Their first hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest.&lt;ref name="wyborcza"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,5558277,W_obronie_topless_pojdzie_nawet_do_Strasburga.html | title=W obronie topless pójdzie nawet do Strasburga | publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]], [[Szczecin]] | website=Artykuły | date=August 6, 2008 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | author=Andrzej Kulej | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2008, judge Szczepańska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited in Poland, the judge sentenced them to pay a fine of 230 [[zloty]] (150 zloty by different source,&lt;ref name="france24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081107-polish-court-reprimands-topless-sunbathers |title=Polish court reprimands topless sunbathers |publisher=France 24 (after AFP News Briefs) |date=January 10, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2012 |author=AFP |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110125209/http://www.france24.com/en/20081107-polish-court-reprimands-topless-sunbathers |archivedate=January 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[euro|€]]40, [[dollar|$]]55) for breaking the rules of conduct.

The appellate court declared both women to be innocent,&lt;ref name="wyborcza.pl-2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,76842,6232762,Topless_jest_legalny.html | title=Topless jest legalny | publisher=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]], Szczecin | date=April 2, 2009 | accessdate=July 22, 2012 | author=Adam Zadworny | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their toplessness, and no complaint was ever reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the recreation area against what is otherwise legal.&lt;ref name="france24"/&gt; The appellate court's decision was binding, but it also created an aura of ambivalence, with topless sunbathing in public declared acceptable only if nobody else including families with children formally objects to it.&lt;ref name="pardon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="polandian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://polandian.wordpress.com/2009/02/05/topless-women-soften-polish-court/ | title=Topless women soften Polish court (entertainment, photo credit: Getty Images) | publisher=''Polandian''.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, toplessness is not illegal. However, private or public establishments are permitted to establish [[dress code]]s which may require women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. In September 2007, "[[Bara Bröst]]" (a pun meaning both "Just Breasts" and "Bare Breasts") appeared to promote topless equality in these semi-public facilities. The group staged several events in public swim baths in September and October 2007, starting in [[Uppsala]] from which they were evicted several times, before succeeding in [[Sundsvall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/76183-swedes-fight-for-topless-rights |publisher=Metro.co.uk|date=November 19, 2007|title=Swedes fight for topless rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/9599/20080108/ Victory for topless bathers] Article from The Local&lt;/ref&gt;

The group scored a victory in June 2009 when the [[Malmö]] city's sports and recreation committee approved new rules that, while requiring everybody to wear bathing suits at indoor public swimming pools, did not require women to cover their breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20250/20090624/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |date=24 June 2009 |title=Malmö win for topless Swedish bathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/27519/swedish-city-legalizes-topless-bathingat-public-swimming-pools/ |title=Swedish city legalizes topless bathing at public swimming pools |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We don't define what bathing suits men should wear so it doesn't make much sense to do it for women. And besides, it's not unusual for men to have large breasts that resemble women's breasts", said a council spokesman.&lt;ref name="Inquisitr.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/27519/swedish-city-legalizes-topless-bathingat-public-swimming-pools/ |title=Swedish city legalizes topless bathing....at public swimming pools |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by Gwen Jacob in [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency. Part of her defence was the [[double standard]]s between men and women. Although she was convicted, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case determined that being topless is not indecent under the meaning of the Criminal Code. However it did not establish any constitutional right of equality. This case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in [[British Columbia]] and [[Saskatchewan]] who faced similar charges. Although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases, the Ontario case has proven influential. Since the matter has not been determined by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in Canada, but interpretation of moral law in Canada has become increasingly liberalized.&lt;ref&gt;Valverde, Mariana (1999). [http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Law/The%20harms%20of%20sex%20and%20the%20risks%20of%20of%20breasts%20Valverde%20Social%20Leg%20Stud%201999%208%282%29%20181-197.pdf "The Harms of Sex and the Risks of Breasts: Obscenity and Indecency in Canadian Law"]. ''Social Legal Studies'' (8): 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There do not appear to have been any further women charged in Canada since these cases were determined.

=== United States ===
In the United States, states have primary jurisdiction in matters of public morality. The topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws on the basis of [[sex discrimination]] or [[equal protection]], arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his. Other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest, or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent (or similar terminology).

Laws and ordinances barring female toplessness are being challenged in federal courts around the nation. Each lawsuit, if it prevails at the appellate level, will legalize topfreedom in the following U.S. circuits of appeal (from west to east): 9 (California), 10 (Colorado), 8 (Missouri) and 4 (Maryland). A federal lawsuit in the 7th Circuit (Illinois), was lost at the appellate level and the petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

==== Colorado ====
On February 22, 2017, U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson granted a [[preliminary injunction]] against a Fort Collins ordinance banning female toplessness saying it likely violates the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] due to gender-based discrimination. Britt Hoagland, Samantha Six and Free the Nipple - Fort Collins brought the case in May 2016. The judge wrote: ''the naked female breast is seen as disorderly or dangerous because society, from Renaissance paintings to Victoria's Secret commercials, has conflated female breasts with genitalia and stereotyped them as such. The irony is that by forcing women to cover up their bodies, society has made naked women's breasts something to see.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4252844/Judge-blocks-Colorado-college-town-s-ban-topless-women.html |title=Judge in Colorado blocks town's ban on topless women calling it unconstitutional |date= February 23, 2017 |publisher= Daily Mail.com |accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fort Collins is appealing the district court's ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/news/free-the-nipple-topless-order-being-fought-by-fort-collins-8903249 |title=Fighting Free the Nipple Topless Order Will Cost Fort Collins $250K, Attorney Says |date= March 23, 2017 |publisher= Westword.com |accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2018, a three-judge panel of the 10th Circuit heard Fort Collins' appeal of the preliminary injunction ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2018/01/17/free-nipple-apppeal/1040824001// |title=Appeals court hears Fort Collins topless ban arguments |date= January 17, 2018 |publisher= USA Today Network |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the district court's ruling is upheld on appeal, discriminatory anti-topless laws in the territory of the Tenth Circuit (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma) will be unenforceable.

==== Florida ====
A Florida statute about indecent exposure prohibits the vulgar or indecent exposure of sexual organs but does not specify if female breasts are included as sexual organs. The right to breastfeed in public is expressly protected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Florida Legislature|title=Lewdness; Indecent Exposure – Sec. 800.03 Fla.

State, 766 So. 2d 1067 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Supreme Court of Florida held that a separate statute about disorderly conduct can be used to prosecute female toplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett v. State, 340 So. 2d 1155 (Fla. 1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  Courts have rejected equal protection arguments.

The right of a woman to ''protest'' topless has been held to be a freedom of expression and not an equal protection issue.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For example, in 2007, a Florida court acquitted a woman of indecent exposure for being topless on [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] because of the political nature of her stand, under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gotopless.org/news.php?item.8.1|title=On Sept 25, 2007, Daytona Beach, FL loses topless case|first=|last=|date=25 September 2007 |website=GoTopless}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is only one known public place throughout the state where female toplessness is officially allowed (a [[nude beach]] located at [[Haulover Park]], in [[Bal Harbour]]), topless bathing is tolerated on [[South Beach]], along with a number of hotel pools in [[Miami Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muench-Pace|first=Dawn|title=Topless and Nude Beaches in Miami|url=http://gomiami.about.com/od/naturebeachesparks/a/ToplessBeaches.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Neill|first=Natalie|title=Topless Protesters on South Beach|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2008-09-04/news/topless-protesters-on-south-beach/|accessdate=24 August 2017|newspaper=Miami New Times|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She would not pay the  $816 fine, telling Judge George Pappas, "I refuse to pay the fines for an act that is legal for a man, but not legal for a woman." The judge sentenced her to 16 days but she was released after only eight for good behavior. Ron Taft, a Manhattan attorney, offered to pay her fine but Coccaro refused, desiring to make a point. She went on a hunger strike. The GoTopless group organized a protest outside the jail where Coccaro was held,&lt;ref name=bodner/&gt; but only two individuals attended.

==== New Mexico ====
The [[City of Albuquerque]] has an anti-topless ordinance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==== New York ====
In 1986, seven women who picnicked topless were charged in [[Rochester, New York]] with baring "that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola".&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Penal Law|Penal Law]] § 245.01 has since been amended. For the [http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0245.01_245.01.html present version]: &lt;br&gt;A person is guilty of exposure if he appears in a public place in such a manner that the private or intimate parts of his body are unclothed or exposed. For purposes of this section, the private or intimate parts of a female person shall include that portion of the breast which is below the top of the areola. This section shall not apply to the breastfeeding of infants or to any person entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; That law had originally been enacted to discourage 'topless' waitresses. The women were initially convicted, but on appeal two of the women's charges were reversed by the New York State Court of Appeals in 1992 on equal protection grounds in ''Santorelli's'' case.&lt;ref name=Santorelli&gt;{{cite web|title=NY v Santorelli|url=http://naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/State_Supreme_Courts/NY_v_Santorelli/ny_v_santorelli.html|publisher=Naturist Education Foundation|accessdate=12 February 2012|date=July 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=The People &amp;C., Respondent, ''V''.

Jill Coccaro, aka Phoenix Feeley,&lt;ref name=durante/&gt; of New York City, was arrested in 2005 in New York City for walking along a street without wearing a shirt. She sued the city for violating a New York State Supreme Court ruling in ''Santorelli's'' case which had declared that women can go topless in public.&lt;ref name=Santorelli /&gt; The city finally paid $29,000 to settle her lawsuit. The [[Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society]] has since 2011 organized regular gatherings around New York City of women who read books in public while topless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Co-ed Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/co-ed-topless-pulp-fiction-reading-naked_n_952510.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=8 February 2012|date=Sep 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the group, besides enjoying the sun and book reading, is to create awareness that New York law allows toplessness in public and to change social attitudes to the exposure of breasts. Although participation has been very small, there has been no harassment of the participants either by the police or the public. The Topless New York series, created by an anonymous New York City photographer in 2007, is another effort to raise awareness of women's topless rights in New York State, and normalize the exercise of those rights, by publishing photographs of women topless in public all over New York City and other areas of New York State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Topless New York|url=https://twitter.com/ToplessNewYork|publisher=Topless New York|accessdate=14 November 2016|date=2007–2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holly Van Voast]], a Bronx photographer and performance artist, was detained, arrested or issued summonses 10 times during 2011 and 2012. Among other places, she went topless on the [[Staten Island Ferry]],&lt;ref name=flegenheimer/&gt; at the Oyster Bar in [[Grand Central Terminal]], in front of an elementary school, on a train, and outside a [[Hooters|Hooters restaurant]].&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; After her arrest in front of the Hooters, police officers took her to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. On October 11, 2011, she appeared in the Midtown Community Court and promptly removed her top, baring her breasts, in front of the judge.&lt;ref name=flegenheimer&gt;{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=In Court for Disrobing, and Doing It Again|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/nyregion/answering-a-summons-on-disrobing-and-disrobing-in-court.html|accessdate=25 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the charges were dismissed.

In February 2013, the New York City Police Department issued a command to all its officers through their daily roll call. It reminded officers that they are not to cite or arrest a woman for public lewdness, indecent exposure or any other section of the [[New York Penal Law|Penal Law]] for "simply exposing their breasts in public."&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt;

====Oregon====
Oregon's indecent exposure law criminalizes only nudity that is intended to sexually arouse the public. The cities of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and [[Happy Valley, Oregon|Happy Valley]] all have local ordinances against exposing genitalia, but not against exposing female breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women can bare it all in the Rose City|url=http://psuvanguard.com/women-can-bare-it-all-in-the-rose-city/|publisher=Vanguard|accessdate=4 September 2017|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Public nudity in Oregon: Where you can and can't legally be naked in the open|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=June 29, 2015|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817172139/http://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/public_nudity_in_oregon.html/|archive-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Pennsylvania laws do not directly address the issue, are ambiguous and have been used to prosecute female toplessness under open lewdness, indecent exposure or disorderly conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ydr.com/story/news/2017/06/13/topl/391833001/ |title=Topless women in Pa.: Against the law? |date= June 13, 2017 |publisher= York Daily Record |accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Texas ====
In 1972, the Texas [[State Equal Rights Amendments|Equal Rights Amendment]] was passed into law, which communities in [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville, TX]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Toplessness-A-Right.html| title=Toplessness: A Right All Women Deserve|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth, TX]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  have used to strike down gendered ordinances, including toplessness.

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area, so technically both male and female toplessness is legal. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|publisher=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbake topless without fuss.&lt;ref name=Lifehackerau&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Breastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1984]], no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman. Women can still breastfeed even if no other food/drink is allowed in the area. If a special baby care room is available for breastfeeding, women are not required to use it unless they wish to. If someone abuses a beastfeeding woman or forces her to leave, this may come under state/territory harassment laws. These protections also include women who are expressing breast milk for their baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|url=https://www.breastfeeding.asn.au/bf-info/breastfeeding-and-law/legalright|title=Breastfeeding in public - your legal rights|date=Aug 2016|access-date=12 Nov 2018|publisher=Australian Breastfeeding Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
In [[New Zealand]], there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude ''and'' also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[High Court of New Zealand]] has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However in practice, the likelyhood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach is low, providing the person keeps to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.freebeaches.org.nz/legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a woman swam topless on [[Opunake]] beach. The police were called, but informed the callers that toplessness was not an offence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/news/6321828/Nudity-not-necessarily-an-offence&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, nudists used the beach at [[Tauranga]], which causes consternation among some residents. However, the local council said there were no bylaws dealing with the issue, and that nudity was not an offence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nzherald.co.nz/front-page-top-stories/news/article.cfm?c_id=698&amp;objectid=11824550&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40886">The existence of a '''wood economy''', or more broadly, a '''forest economy''' (since in many countries a [[bamboo economy]] predominates), is a prominent matter in many [[developing countries]] as well as in many other nations with temperate climate and especially in those with [[Boreal climate|low temperatures]]. These are generally the countries with greater [[forest]]ed areas. The uses of wood in furniture, buildings, bridges, and as a source of energy are widely known. Additionally, wood from [[tree]]s and [[Shrub|bushes]], can be employed in a wide variety, including those produced from [[wood pulp]], as [[cellulose]] in paper, [[celluloid]] in early [[photographic]] film, [[cellophane]], and [[rayon]] (a substitute for silk).

At the end of their normal usage, wood products can be burnt to obtain [[thermal energy]], or can be used as a [[fertilizer]]. The potential environmental damage that a wood economy could occasion include (problems of reduction the [[biodiversity]] due to [[monoculture]] forestry—the intensive cultivation of very few types of trees); and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. However, forests can aid in reduction of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and therefore decrease [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestadaptation2008.net/home/en/|title=Adaptation of Forests and Forest Management to Changing Climate with Emphasis on Forest Health: a Review of Science, Policies, and Practices.

== Introduction ==

=== History of use of wood ===
The wood economy is historically the starting point of the [[civilization]]s worldwide, since eras preceding the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Neolithic]]. It necessarily preceded [[Bronze Age|ages of metals]] by many millenia, as the melting of metals was possible only through the discovery of techniques to light [[fire]] (usually obtained by the scraping of two very dry wooden rods) and the building of many [[simple machine]]s and rudimentary tools, as canes, club handles, [[Bow (weapon)|bows]], [[arrow]]s, [[lance]]s. One of the most ancient handmade articles ever found is one smoothed pricked of wood (Clacton Spear) 250,000 years old (third interglacial period), that was buried under sediments in England, at [[Clacton-on-Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Tecnologia Dalle Origini al 2000, pag. 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Clacton Spear |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 |archivedate=October 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive civilizations such as the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Sumer|Sumerians]] built sophisticated [[Furniture|objects of furniture]]. Many types of furniture in [[ivory]] and valuable woods have survived to our time practically intact, because secluded in inviolated secret tombs, they were protected from decay also by the dry environment of desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |title=History of Egyptian Furniture |date=27 October 2009 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027112058/http://geocities.com/gpkillen/history.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings and parts of these (above all roofs) contained elements in wood (often of [[oak]]) forming structural supports and covering; means of transport such as boats, ships; and later (with the invention of the [[wheel]]) wagons and carriages, winches, flour mills powered by water, etc.

=== Dimensions and geography ===
The main source of the lumber used in the world is [[forest]]s, which can be classified as [[Virgin forest|virgin]], [[Semivirgin forests|semivirgin]] and [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]]. Much [[timber]] is removed for [[firewood]] by local populations in many countries, especially in the [[third world]], but this amount can only be estimated, with wide margins of uncertainty.

In 1998, the worldwide production of "roundwood" (officially counted wood not used as firewood), was about {{convert|1,500,000,000|m3|cuyd}}, amounting to around 45% of the wood cultivated in the world. Cut logs and branches destined to become elements for building construction accounted for approximately 55% of the world's [[wood industry|industrial]] [[wood production]]. 25% became [[wood pulp]] (including wood powder and truccioli) mainly destined for the production of [[paper]] and [[paperboard]], and approximately 20% became panels in [[plywood]] and valuable wood for furnitures and objects of common use (FAO 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 FAO 1998] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724193223/http://www.unece.org/trade/timber/mis/energy/output.htm#2007 |date=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest producer and consumer of officially accounted wood is the United States, although the country that possesses the greatest area of forest is Russia.

In the 1970s, the countries with the largest forest area were: [[Soviet Union]] (approximately 8,800,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Brazil]] (5,150,000&amp;nbsp;km²), Canada (4,400,000&amp;nbsp;km²), United States (3,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²), [[Indonesia]] (1,200,000&amp;nbsp;km²) and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²). Other countries with important production and consumption of wood usually have a low [[density of population]] in relation to their territorial extension, here we can include countries as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Finland]], [[Poland]], Sweden, [[Ukraine]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

By 2001 the [[rainforest]] areas of Brazil were [[Deforestation in Brazil|reduced by a fifth]] (respect of 1970), to around 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;km²; the ground cleared was mainly destined for cattle [[pasture]]—Brazil is the world's largest exporter of [[beef]] with almost 200,000,000 head of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0625-amazon_beef.html|title=Brazil seizes cattle illegally grazing on Amazon forest lands|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The booming Brazilian [[ethanol economy]] based upon [[sugar cane]] cultivation, is likewise reducing forests area. Canadian forest was reduced by almost 30% to 3,101,340&amp;nbsp;km² over the same period.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com/canadian_forests_quick_facts.htm|title=Canadian Forests - Quick Facts|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance in fighting greenhouse effect ===
Regarding the problem of climate change, it is known that burning forests increase CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in atmosphere, while intact virgin forest or plantations act as sinks for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for these reasons wood economy fights [[greenhouse effect]]. The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorbed depends on the type of trees, lands and the climate of the place where trees naturally grow or are planted. Moreover, by night plants do not [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]], and produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, eliminated the successive day. Paradoxically in summer [[oxygen]] created by photosynthesis in forests near to cities and urban parks, interacts with urban [[air pollution]] (from cars, etc.) and is transformed by solar beams in [[ozone]] (molecule of three oxygen atoms), that while in high atmosphere constitutes a filter against [[ultraviolet]] beams, in the low atmosphere is a pollutant, able to provoke respiratory disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/maps/ozone/welcome|title=Air quality levels in Europe — European Environment Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlunghealth.org/healthy_living/pollution/outdoor/effects|title=YourLungHealth.org - The Effects of Ozone Pollution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[low-carbon economy]], forestry operations will be focused on low-impact practices and regrowth.  Forest managers will make sure that they do not disturb soil based carbon reserves too much. Specialized tree farms will be the main source of material for many products.  Quick maturing tree varieties will be grown on short rotations in order to maximize output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm Trees and their role in carbon management for land and business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190041/http://www.woodland-trust.org.uk/campaigns/briefingsmore/carbonmgt.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}, The Woodland Trust.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Per nation/continental area ==

=== In Australia ===
* [[Eucalyptus]]: these are seven hundred tree species from Australia, that grow very fast in tropical, sub-tropical and semi-arid climates, and are very resistant to forest fires (with their tree cortex) and drought. Its [[essential oil]] is used in pharmacology, its wood for building, and the small branches as firewood and pulpwood.

=== In Brazil ===
[[Brazil]] has a long tradition in the harvesting of several types of trees with specific uses. Since the 1960s, imported species of pine tree and eucalyptus have been grown mostly for the [[plywood]] and [[pulp and paper industry|paper pulp industries]]. Currently high-level research is being conducted, to apply the enzymes of [[sugar cane]] fermentation to cellulose in wood, in order to obtain [[methanol]], but the cost is much higher when compared with ethanol derived from [[maize|corn]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8280/54|title=Brazzil Mag - Trying to understand Brazil since 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazilwood]]: has a dense, orange-red heartwood that takes a high red shine (brasa=ember), and it is the premier wood used for making bows for string instruments from the [[violin]] family. These trees soon became the biggest source of [[red]] [[dye]], and they were such a large part of the economy and export of that country, that slowly it was known as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forestryencyclopedia.jot.com/WikiHome/Harvesting%20Wood%20in%20Brazil|title=Harvesting wood in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hevea brasiliensis]]: is the biggest source of the best [[latex]], that is used to manufacture many objects in [[rubber]],  as an example [[gloves]], [[condom]]s, anti-allergic [[mattress]]es and [[tires]] (vulcanized rubber). Latex has the ability to adjust to the exact shape of the body part, an advantage over [[polyurethane]] or [[polyethylene]] gloves.

=== In Canada and the US ===
There is a close relation in the forestry economy between these countries; they have many tree genera in common, and Canada is the main producer of wood and wooden items destined to the US, the biggest consumer of wood and its byproducts in the world. The water systems of the [[Great Lakes]], [[Erie Canal]], [[Hudson River]] and [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] to the east coast and the [[Mississippi River]] to the central plains and [[Louisiana]] allows transportation of logs at very low costs. On the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]], the basin of the [[Columbia River]] has plenty of forests with excellent timber.

==== Canada ====
The agency Canada Wood  Council calculates that in the year 2005 in Canada, the forest sector employed 930,000 workers (1 job in every 17), making around $108 billion of value in goods and services. For many years products derived from trees in Canadian forests had been the most important export items of the country. In 2011, exports around the world totaled some $64.3 billion – the single largest contributor to Canadian trade balance.&lt;ref name="Canadian Forests - Quick Facts" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wood-works.org|title=Wood-Works - Program of the Canadian Wood Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the world leader in [[sustainable forest management]] practices. Only {{convert|120000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} (28% of Canadian forests) are currently managed for timber production while an estimated {{convert|32000000|ha|km2 sqmi|-1}} are protected from harvesting by the current legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-forests.com|title=Canadian Forests Website - Home Page|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Cherry]]: a [[hardwood]] prized for its high quality in grain, width, color, and rich warm glow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greendesigns.com/index.html?about/cherry_wood|title=Classic American Furniture for the Home and Office from Green Design Furniture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trees were carried to the lands surrounding [[Rome]] ([[Latium]]) from [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Vegetable Kingdom -  Page 334&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, most cherry trees are grown in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[West Virginia]], [[California]] and [[Oregon]].&lt;ref name=NASS&gt;[http://www.usda.gov/nass/PUBS/TODAYRPT/cher0608.txt Cherry Production] National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA, Retrieved on August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cedrus|Cedar]]: this genus is a group of [[conifer]]s of the [[Pinaceae]] family, originating from high mountain areas from the [[Carpathians]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Turkey]] to the [[Himalayas]]. Their scented wood make them suitable for chests and closet lining. Cedar oil and wood is known to be a natural repellent to moths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~nodice/new/magazine/cedar/cedar.htm|title=Cedarwood Oils|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually are planted in western and southern US, mostly for ornamental purposes, but also for the production of [[pencil]]s (specially [[incense-cedar]]).
* [[Douglas fir]]: a native tree of the United States [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] and [[Mountain States|mountain states]], with records in fast growth and high statures in brief time. The [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] grows in coastal regions up to altitudes of about 1,800 meters; the [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]] grows farther inland, at altitudes ranging from 800 m to 3,000 m or higher. The wood is used for construction, for [[homebuilt aircraft]], for paper pulp, and also as [[firewood]].
* [[Hybrid poplar]] is being investigated by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Tennessee]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioenergy.ornl.gov/papers/misc/trees.html|title=Biofuels from Trees: Renewable Energy Research Branches Out|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/5051|title=A National Assessment of Promising Areas for Switchgrass, Hybrid Poplar, or Willow Energy Crop Production|first1=R.

* [[Walnut]]: a prized furniture and carving hardwood because of its colour, hardness, grain and durability. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutcouncil.org|title=Walnut Council--Growing Walnut and Other Fine Hardwoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the Caribbean and Central America ===
* [[Mahogany]]: has a straight grain, usually free of voids and pockets. The most prized species come from [[Cuba]] and [[Honduras]]. It has a reddish-brown color, which darkens over time, and displays a beautiful reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, is available in big boards, and is very durable. Mahogany is used in the making of many musical instruments, as [[drum]]s, acoustic and electric [[guitar]]s' back and side, and luxury [[headphone]]s.

=== In Europe ===

==== Italy ====
The species that are ideal for the many uses in this type of economy are those employed by [[arboriculture]], that are very well known for their features and the need for certain types of ground and climates.
* [[Fraxinus]]: being a lightweight wood is easy to transport, as firewood burns easily, grows in damp environments like those present in river flooding areas, stands pollution of water and air.
* [[Larix]]: in Italy it grows at high altitudes around mountain tops, its timber stand sudden climatic change, from icy winds to high temperatures in sunny afternoon summers, it is excellent for use in the building of exposed structures as bridges, roofs, etc.
* [[Stone pine]]: "Mediterranean pine" could be the noble emblem of many coastal areas in Italy, originally giant forests of pines extended from the mouth of the [[Tiber]] river until [[Liguria]] and [[Provence]] in France, over soils with high [[salinity]], not very apt for agriculture. Its trees produce a vast amount of dry branches that can be burnt, [[Pine cone|cones]] (used for Christmas decoration) and needle-like foliage that can be burnt, or used as [[mulch]]. Oils and resins can be used in [[scent]]s and [[ointments]]. The [[pinoli]] are useful elements in Italian cooking (along with [[basil]] are tritured to make [[pesto]] sauce). Currently, "progress" has brought to a severe reduction of this magnificent tree extensions, and in many places cheap beach buildings, car-parking and semi-abandoned areas have taken their place.
* [[Populus|Poplar]]: in Italy is the most important species for tree plantations, is used for several purposes as [[plywood]] manufacture, packing boxes, paper, [[match]]es, etc. It needs good quality grounds with good drainage, but can be used to protect the cultivations if disposed in [[windbreak]] lines. More than 70% of Italian poplar cultivations are located in the [[pianura Padana]]. Constantly the extension of the cultivation is being reduced, from 650&amp;nbsp;km² in the 1980s to current 350&amp;nbsp;km². The yield of poplars is about 1,500 t/km² of wood every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042,1043|title=Federlegno - Italian federation of wood producers and industry|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production from poplars is around 45–50% of the total Italian wood production.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte:http://www.federlegno.it/tool/home.php?s=0,1,29,37,417,1042&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the [[history of art]] poplar was the wood of choice for painting surfaces as panels, as in [[Renaissance]] (The [[Mona Lisa]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]). Because of this reason, many of the products with the highest [[added value]], extremely expensive, are made with wood from the humble but durable poplar.
** Because of the presence of [[tannic acid]], poplar cortex was often used in Europe for the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of [[leather]].

==== Portugal ====
* [[Cork oak|Oak]] for [[Cork (material)|cork]]: are trees with a slow growth, but long life, are cultivated in warm hill areas (min. temp. &gt; -5°Celsius) in all the west area of [[Mediterranean]] shores. Cork is popular as a material for [[bulletin board]]s. Even if the production as [[Stopper (plug)|stopper]]s for wine bottles is diminishing in favor of [[nylon]] stoppers, in the sake of energy saving granules of cork can be mixed into [[concrete]]. These composites have low thermal conductivity, low density and good energy absorption (earthquake resistant). Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³), compressive strength (1–26 MPa) and flexural strength (0.5–4.0&amp;nbsp;MPa).&lt;ref&gt;Karade SR. 2003. An Investigation of Cork Cement Composites. PhD Thesis. BCUC. Brunel University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this cork can be used as [[Thermal conductivity|thermal isolation]] in buildings (as well in its natural form and as a mixture), useful also as [[sound insulation]]. In the [[shoe]] industry cork is used for [[Shoe#Sole|sole]]s and [[insole]]s. In the world there are 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² of cork oak plantations, and every year are extracted around 300,000 tons of cork, 50% in [[Portugal]], 15,000 in Italy (12,000 in the island of [[Sardinia]]). The advantage of this natural industry is that the extraction of cork from layers outer to the [[cortex (botany)|cortex]] does not kill the tree.

=== In Scandinavia and Russia ===
In Sweden, Finland and to an extent Norway, much of the land area is forested, the pulp and paper industry is one of the most significant industrial sectors. Chemical pulping produces an excess of energy, since the organic matter in [[black liquor]], mostly [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] breakdown products, is burned in the [[recovery boiler]]. Thus, these countries have high proportions of renewable energy use (25% in Finland, for instance). Considerable effort is directed towards increasing the value and usage of forest products by companies and by government projects.

* [[Scots pine]] and [[Norway spruce]]: These species comprise most of boreal forest, and together as a softwood mixture they are converted chemical pulp for paper.
* [[Birch]]: is a genus with many species of trees from [[Scandinavia]] and Russia, excellent for acid grounds. They act as [[pioneer species]] in the frozen border between [[taiga]] and [[tundra]], are very resistant to periods of [[drought]] and [[icy condition]]s. The species [[Betula nana]] has been identified as the ideal tree for the acid grounds of the sides of sloped mountains, also in southern Europe, with soils poor in nutrients, where these trees can be used to restrain [[landslide]]s. [[Dissolving pulp]] is produced from birch. [[Xylitol]] can be produced by hydrogenation of [[xylose]], which is a byproduct of chemical pulping of birch.

&lt;!--
Nessuna di queste specie sottrae terreni pregiati o particolarmente fertili all'agricoltura, ma, al contrario, contribuiscono a proteggere i suoli coltivati dall'erosione e dai venti. Nonostante questa caratteristica positiva in Italia, da secoli si assiste alla progressiva riduzione della presenza degli alberi nei terreni circostanti le colture con la conseguenza che l'eccesso di acqua meteorica non viene adeguatemente trattenuto e si possano verificare, quando succedono piogge abbondanti, catastrofiche [[alluvioni]].

== Uses of wood ==
{{Further information|Wood#Uses}}

== Combustion ==
{{main article|Wood fuel}}
The [[combustion|burning]] of wood is currently the largest use of [[energy]] derived from a [[solid fuel]] [[biomass]]. Wood fuel may be available as [[firewood]] (e.g. logs, bolts, blocks), [[charcoal]], chips, sheets, [[wood pellets|pellets]] and [[sawdust]]. Wood fuel can be used for [[cooking]] and [[heating]] through [[stove]]s and [[fireplace]]s, and occasionally for fueling [[steam engine]]s and steam [[turbines]] that [[electricity generation|generate electricity]]. For many centuries many types of traditional [[oven]]s were used in order to benefit from the heat generated by wood combustion. Now, more efficient and clean solutions have been developed: advanced [[fireplace]]s (with [[heat exchanger]]s), [[wood-fired oven]]s,  [[wood-burning stove]]s and [[pellet stove]]s, that are able to filter and separate pollutants (centrifuging [[wood ash|ash]]es with rotative filters), thus eliminating many emissions, also allowing to recover a higher quantity of heat that escaped with the [[chimney]] fumes.

Mean [[energy density]] of [[Wood]], was calculated at around 6–17 [[Megajoule]]/[[Kilogram]], depending on species and moisture content.

Combustion of wood is, however, linked to the production of micro-environmental pollutants, as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) (an invisible gas able to provoke irreversible saturation of [[blood]]'s [[hemoglobine]]), as well as [[nanoparticles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olivares G, Ström J, Johansson C, Gidhagen L |title=Estimates of black carbon and size-resolved particle number emission factors from residential wood burning based on ambient monitoring and model simulations |journal=J Air Waste Manag Assoc |volume=58 |issue=6 |pages=838–48 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18581814 |doi=10.3155/1047-3289.58.6.838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy [[Populus|poplar]] has been proposed as a tree cultivated to be transformed into [[biofuel]]s, because of the excellent ratio of energy extracted from its wood because of poplar's fast growing and capture of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the small amount of energy needed to cultivate, cut and transport the trees. ''Populus x canadensis'' 'I-214', grows so fast that is able to reach {{convert|14|in|cm}} in diameter and heights of {{convert|100|ft|m}} in ten years.

=== Charcoal ===
{{main article|Charcoal}}
Charcoal is the dark grey residue consisting of impure [[carbon]] obtained by removing water and other volatile constituents from [[animal]] and [[vegetation]] substances.  Charcoal is usually produced by slow [[pyrolysis]], the heating of [[wood]] or other substances in the absence of [[oxygen]]. Charcoal can then be used as a fuel with a higher combustion temperature.

=== Wood gasogen ===
[[Wood gas generator]] (gasogen): is a bulky and heavy device (but technically simple) that transforms burning wood in a mix of molecular [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). This gas mixture, known as "[[wood gas]]", "poor gas" or "[[syngas]]" is obtained after the [[combustion]] of dry wood in a [[redox|reductive environment]] (low in [[oxygen]]) with a limited amount of atmospheric air, at temperatures of 900° Celsius, and can fuel an [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/dspace/bitstream/1957/1569/1/FPL_1463ocr.pdf Gasogens Report] (Original report dated 1944): now in the possession of the University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|300px|A car built in the 1940s by [[Ilario Bandini]], with a wood gas generator device.]]

In the time between World War I and [[World War II]] included, because of the lack of [[oil]], in many countries, like Italy, France, [[Great Britain]] and Sweden, several [[gasoline]]-powered cars were modified, with the addition of a [[wood gas generator]] (a "''gasogen''"), a device powered by wood, coal, or burnable waste, able to produce (and purify) gas that immediately, in the same vehicle, could power a slightly modified [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] [[engine]] of a standard car (low-compression engine). [[Carburetor]] had to be changed with an air-gas [[Mixer (engine)|mixer]]). There were several setbacks, as the great reduction of maximum speed and the need to drive using low [[gear]]s and wisely dosing the amount of air. In modern cars, modified with a wood gas generator, gas emissions (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NOx) are lower to those of the same vehicle running with gasoline (keeping the same [[catalytic converter]]).

===Methanol===
{{Main article|Methanol economy}}
[[Methanol]] (the simplest [[alcohol]]) behaves as a liquid at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, is toxic and  corrosive, and in [[organic chemistry]] basic books is often called "the spirit of wood", since it can be obtained from wood [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. Rarely, when unwise [[wine]]-makers mix small chunks of wood and leaves with grapes, methanol can be found as a pollutant of the blend of water, [[ethanol]] and other substances derived from [[grape]]'s fermentation.

The best way to obtain methanol from wood is through [[syngas]] (CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[anhydrous]] [[pyrolysis]] of wood, a method discovered by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.

Methanol can be used as an oxygen-rich additive for [[gasoline]]. However, it is usually much cheaper to produce methanol from [[methane]] or from syngas.  Methanol is the most important base material for industrial chemistry, where it is often used to make more complex molecules through reactions of [[halogenation]] and chemical [[addition reaction]].

===Gas turbine===

====Tanks====
The American [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]] is powered by a [[gas turbine]] of {{convert|1500|hp|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |title=AGT1500 Turbine Technology on Honeywell.com |publisher= |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909103204/http://www51.honeywell.com/aero/common/documents/myaerospacecatalog-documents/SurfaceSystems/AGT1500_Turbine_Technology.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is able to function also with a mix at 50% of wood powder and [[biodiesel]], [[diesel fuel]] or [[kerosene]]. Its advantages over [[Turbocharger|turbo]]-[[diesel engine]], are the small size and light weight, the lack of a [[radiator]] (which gives an advantage against the effect of gun and cannon shots and missile strikes suffered in battle). A setback is the high fuel consumption, since the turbine engine has not the ability to work at a low revolutions per minute rate, much lower than ideal, and during the march this engine consumes twice as much fuel as a modern turbo-diesel engine with [[intercooler]] and [[Fuel injection|direct injection]].

==Construction==
{{main article|Lumber}}
Wood is relatively light in weight, because its [[specific weight]] is less than 500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, this is an advantage,  when compared against 2,000-2,500&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[armed concrete]] or 7,800&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ for [[steel]].

Wood is strong, because the efficiency of wood for structural purposes has qualities that are similar to steel.

===Bridges, levees, microhydro, piers===
Wood is used to build bridges (as the [[Magere Brug|Magere bridge]] in [[Amsterdam]]), as well as water and air mills, and [[microhydro]] generators for electricity.

===Housing===
[[Hardwood]] is used as a material in [[lumber|wooden]] [[house]]s, and other structures with a broad range of dimensions. In traditional homes wood is preferred for [[ceiling]]s, [[door]]s, [[flooring]]s and [[window]]s. Wooden [[Framing (construction)|frame]]s were traditionally used for home ceilings, but they risk collapse during fires.

The development of [[Efficient energy use|energy efficient]] houses including the "[[passive house]]" has revamped the importance of wood in construction, because wood provides acoustic and thermal [[Building insulation|insulation]], with much better results than concrete.

====Earthquake resistant buildings====
In Japan, ancient buildings, of relatively high elevation, like [[pagoda]]s, historically had shown to be able to resist [[earthquake]]s of high [[Seismic scale|intensity]], thanks to the traditional building techniques, employing elastic [[Kinematic pair|joint]]s, and to the excellent ability of wooden frames to elastically deform and absorb severe [[peak ground acceleration|acceleration]]s and [[compression (physical)|compressive]] shocks.

In 2006, Italian scientists from [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] patented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.girodivite.it/Terremoti-dal-Cnr-arriva-il.html|title=Girodivite: Terremoti: dal Cnr arriva il palazzo antisismico|first=|last=Girodivite.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a building system that they called "[[SOFIE]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.progettosofie.it PROGETTOSOFIE: Edificio Antisismico in Legno]&lt;/ref&gt; a seven-[[storey]] wooden building, 24 meters high, built by the "Istituto per la valorizzazione del legno e delle specie arboree" (Ivalsa) of [[San Michele all'Adige]]. In 2007 it was tested with the hardest Japanese [[Earthquake engineering|antiseismic]] test for civil structures: the simulation of [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe's earthquake]] (7.2 [[Richter scale]]), with the building placed over an enormous oscillating platform belonging to the NIED-Institute, located in [[Tsukuba]] science park, near the city of [[Miki, Hyogo|Miki]] in Japan. This Italian project, employed very thin and flexible panels in [[glued laminated timber]], and according to CNR researchers could brought to the construction of much more safe houses in seismic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/SoleOnLine4/Italia/2009/04/cnr-progetto-casa-legno-anti-sisma.shtml?uuid=222999a2-241a-11de-bdf4-e9c9b14e9445&amp;DocRulesView=Libero|title=Dalla ricerca italiana la casa &amp;nbsp;di legno che resiste al terremoto - Il Sole 24 ORE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shipbuilding ===
One of the most enduring materials is the lumber from [[virginia]]n [[Quercus virginiana|southern live oak]] and [[white oak]], specially live oak is 60% stronger than white oak and more resistant to moisture. As an example, the main component in the structure of battle ship [[USS Constitution]], the world's oldest commissioned naval vessel afloat (launched in 1797) is white oak.&lt;ref name="Victory"&gt;{{cite web

== History of crisis in wood economies ==

===Classical Greece===
One of the most famous [[crisis]] of a wood-based economy is what happened in [[Classical Greece]], where trees began to disappear specially in the areas of [[Attica]], [[Boeotia]] and [[Peloponnesus]] where indiscriminate cutting of trees for several uses, associated to drought and [[wildfire]]s led to a severe lack of timber in order to build lances, shields, ships, etc. and to a slow but progressive weakening in military and naval power of the peninsular kingdoms in Greece, that were overwhelmed by [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and by the [[Kingdom of Macedon]], much more fertile lands because of their rainy winters. This process arrived to the apex with the conquest of Greece by [[Phillip II of Macedon]].

The secret weapon of the [[Sarissaphoros]] soldiers (supported by [[peltast]] javelineers), commanded by Philipp II in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]] and in those that followed fought by [[Alexander the Great]] (which brought to the conquest of [[Lesser Asia]], [[Babylon]], [[Persia]] and [[Egypt]]), was the [[sarissa]], a type of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]], longer and stronger (5–7 m.) than the other Greek [[lance]]s, obtained from the heavy and strong [[European Cornel|cornel wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardeavalpometto.org/parco_boschi.html|title=Parco Naturale Valpometto - I boschi di casa nostra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapa Nui===
{{Dispute|date=July 2017}}
[[History of Easter Island#Pre-European society|Rapa Nui]], best known as "Easter Island", is a typical example of [[malthusianism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27864/1/WP117.pdf|title=Why Easter Island Collapsed: An Answer for an Enduring Question|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically how the [[exponential growth]] of a populace leads to the end of a [[renewable resource]]. At a certain point, the compelling societal need forces exploitation of the resource above and beyond the resource's natural rate of renewal.

It has been calculated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/eterms/qt/easter_island.htm|title=What Has Science Learned about the People Who Settled Easter Island?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that after the year 1000, around 10 million [[palmtree]]s were cut in Rapa Nui, resulting in the [[erosion]] of the fertile land, and eventually to a [[desertification]] around the 15th century. (This deforestation may have also been aggravated and/or caused by a rat [[infestation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-12-05-easter-island_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Did Easter Island get 'ratted' out?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This provoked a population reduction from 15,000 to 2,500 individuals. Without palmtree wood, no boats, or lances could be constructed. Without palm fibers, construction of ropes and fishing nets halted.  This led to a decrease in the local fish harvest, which in turn led to a decrease in the quantity of dietary protein available to the island's inhabitants.  At the end, the society became an easy prey for [[hunger]] and [[civil war]].  From 1600 to 1700, the people became superstitious in a fanatical way. In the last moments, there was a disintegration of [[society]] and total chaos. The destruction of the traditional symbols followed, leading to the eventual extinction of the [[Moai]]s [[civilization]] and [[culture]], even if there was not any external human enemy.
