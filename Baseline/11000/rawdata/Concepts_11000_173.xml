'''Andrew Norman Wilson''' (born 27 October 1950)&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/A-N-Wilson Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; is an English writer and newspaper columnist known for his critical biographies, novels and works of popular history. He is an occasional columnist for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and a former columnist for the ''[[London Evening Standard]]''. He has been an occasional contributor to ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', ''[[New Statesman]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]''.

==Life and work==
Wilson was born in [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] in [[Staffordshire]]&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; to a father who became the managing director of [[Wedgwood]], the pottery company.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Hunter|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-in-bed-with-a-n-wilson-he-may-be-sick-but-he-hasnt-lost-his-sense-of-humour-a-s-byatt-the-1478063.html|title=Interview: In Bed With A.N. Wilson|work=The Independent|date=12 January 1993|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Hillstone School, Great Malvern in Worcestershire, and [[Rugby School]] from the age of 13, where he read Mao and Marx in his spare time. While at Rugby, he wrote an article for the school magazine arguing that public schools should be abolished. The national press became interested in the story, with the ''[[Daily Express]]'' headlining its account "Red rebel in Tom Brown's school".&lt;ref name="Leith"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leith|first=William|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/interview-messing-with-the-messiah-william-leith-meets-a-n-wilson-the-man-of-letters-who-upset-the-1551051.html|title=Interview: Messing with the Messiah|work=The Independent|date=12 September 1992|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Reporters arrived at the school gates, wanting to interview me, but my housemaster, wisely, would not let me talk to them," Wilson told [[Hunter Davies]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt; After [[New College, Oxford]], he taught English at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood]] for two years and then spent seven years as a lecturer in medieval literature at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's College]] and New College, Oxford. He married the Shakespearean scholar [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] in 1971. They had two daughters, [[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] (born 1971) and [[Bee Wilson|Beatrice "Bee" Wilson]] (born 1974), and divorced in 1990.

A prolific journalist and author of non-fiction, Wilson has also written over twenty works of fiction, for which he has won the [[Somerset Maugham Prize]] and the [[John Llewellyn Rhys Prize]]. His novels also include such historical works as ''[[The Potter’s Hand]]'' (a study of the family life of [[Josiah Wedgwood]]), ''[[Resolution (A. N. Wilson novel)|Resolution]]'', a fictional account of Captain James Cook’s second voyage, and ''[[Scandal (Wilson novel)|Scandal]]'' about the Profumo affair. His 2007 novel ''[[Winnie and Wolf]]'', about the relationship between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Richard Wagner]]'s English daughter-in-law, was long-listed for the [[Man Booker Prize]]. Novels set in the present include ''[[The Vicar of Sorrows]]'', about a clergyman who has lost his faith dealing with the death of his mother, and ''[[Dream Children]]'' about paedophilia. 

In the early 1990s, in the wake of the Fatwah against Salman Rushdie and the continuing troubles in Northern Ireland, Wilson published a pamphlet, ''[[Against Religion]]'', in the [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] CounterBlasts series. He wrote biographies of Jesus and St Paul, and a history of atheism in the 19th century entitled ''[[God's Funeral]]'', describing its growth as due to influences ranging from [[David Hume]] to [[Sigmund Freud]]. These and many other of his books such as those on [[Leo Tolstoy]] ([[Whitbread Award]] for best biography of 1988), [[C. S. Lewis]], [[Hilaire Belloc]] are simultaneously sympathetic to religious belief and critical of it.

In August 2006, Wilson's biography of [[John Betjeman]] was published. It was later discovered that another biographer, [[Bevis Hillier]], had sent him a forged letter which was included in the book.&lt;ref name="wilson reply"&gt;{{cite news

In 2001 Wilson published ''[[Dante in Love]]'' (2011) presenting a study of the great Italian poet, [[Dante Alighieri]], as an artist and philosopher, also depicting an in-depth portrait of medieval [[Florence]] to help readers understand the literary and cultural background which engendered the Tuscan's masterpiece, ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

In addition to his many biographies, Wilson has written three books covering entire eras, ''[[The Victorians]]'' (2002), ''[[After the Victorians]]'' (2005), and ''[[The Elizabethans]]'' (2011).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} 

===Critiques of Wilson's work===
&lt;!--Add material referred to in Criticism section--&gt;
The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said that "Wilson's forte is the character and he brilliantly conveys Betjeman's odd mixture of introspection and sociability, gaiety and melancholia, exhibition and self-disgust..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3654881/Lucky-to-have-him.html|title=Lucky to Have him: Lynn Barber reviews Betjeman by A N Wilson|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' (London) called his book ''[[Resolution (A. N. Wilson)|Resolution]]'' ‘a work of genius’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/resolution-a-novel-of-captain-cooks-adventures-of-discovery-to-australia-new-zealand-and-hawaii-through-the-eyes-of-george-forster-the-botanist-on-board-his-ship-by-an-wilson-gghjndmt5|title=Resolution by AN Wilson Reviewed by James Marriott|website=www.thetimes.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathryn Hughes]] wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' of Wilson’s biography of [[Queen Victoria]], ''[[Victoria: A Life]]'', ‘Subtle, thoughtful ... a shimmering and rather wonderful biography.’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/04/victoria-a-life-a-n-wilson-review-queen|title=Victoria: A Life Review by Kathryn Hughes|website=www.theguardian.com|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daisy Godwin in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' review stated that, ‘This won't be the last biography of Victoria but it is certainly the most interesting and original in a long time’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Victoria: A Life by AN Wilson Review by Daisy Godwin|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/victoria-a-life-by-an-wilson-6zl7vt6chkx|website=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's ''[[Hitler: A Short Biography]]'' was criticised by the historian [[Richard J. Evans]] in a review in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' for factual inaccuracies, lack of original research and analysis, and personal biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|title=Hitler: A Short Biography|work=New Statesman|date=12 March 2012|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2012/03/hitler-wilson-german-british|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's biography ''Charles Darwin, Victorian Mythmaker'', (2017), was criticised by [[John van Wyhe]] in the ''New Scientist'' for confusing [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] with [[Lamarckism]] at one point, as well as other scientific, historical and editorial errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2144643-radical-new-biography-of-darwin-is-unreliable-and-inaccurate/|title=‘Radical’ new biography of Darwin is unreliable and inaccurate|last=van Wyhe|first=John|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Hughes in ''[[The Guardian]]'' described it as a "cheap attempt to ruffle feathers", with a dubious grasp of science and attempted [[character assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/30/charles-darwin-victorian-mythmaker-an-wilson-review|title=Charles Darwin by AN Wilson review – how wrong can a biography be?|last=Hughes|first=Kathryn|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 August 2017|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', Adrian Woolfson says that "..while for the greater part a lucid, elegantly written and thought-provoking social and intellectual history" Wilson's "speculations on evolutionary theory," produce a book that is "fatally flawed, mischievous, and ultimately misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/charles-darwin-victorian-mythmaker-by-an-wilson-review-a3619306.html|title=Charles Darwin Victorian Mythmaker by A.N.

'''Aerobic granular reactor''' is a type of waste treatment facility.

==Overview==
[[Sewage treatment]] plants (STP) based on [[activated sludge]] often cover large surface areas, necessitated mainly by the large [[settling tank]]s. To build compact STP’s, [[biomass]] can be grown as [[biofilms]] on a carrier material, or as fast settling [[Aerobic granulation|aerobic granular sludge]] without a carrier.  Recent research showed the advantages of a discontinuously fed system, in which it is possible to grow stable granulated sludge under aerobic conditions.

Simultaneous [[Chemical oxygen demand]], and [[Nitrogen]] and [[Phosphorus]] removal, can be easily integrated in a discontinuous fed system.  Because of the high settling capacity of the granules, the use of a traditional settler is unnecessary.  Therefore the installation can be built very compact, needing only 20% of the surface area of conventional activated sludge systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">In mathematics and more precisely in [[functional analysis]], the '''Aluthge transformation''' is an operation defined on the set of [[bounded operators]] of a [[Hilbert space]]. It was introduced by [[Ariyadasa Aluthge]] to study [[P-hyponormal operators|p-hyponormal]] [[linear operator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aluthge|first=Ariyadasa|date=1990|title=On p-hyponormal operators for 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1|url=|journal=Integral Equations Operator Theory|volume=13|pages=307–315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Let  &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Hilbert space]] and let  &lt;math&gt;B(H)&lt;/math&gt; be the algebra of linear operators from &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[polar decomposition]] theorem, there exists an unique [[partial isometry]]  &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;T=U|T|&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\ker(U)\supset\ker(T)&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;|T|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Square root of a matrix|square root of the operator]]  &lt;math&gt; T^*T&lt;/math&gt;.  If  &lt;math&gt;T\in B(H)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T=U|T|&lt;/math&gt; is its polar decomposition, the Aluthge transform of  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta(T)&lt;/math&gt; defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta(T)=|T|^{\frac12}U|T|^{\frac12}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any real number &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-Aluthge transformation is defined as 
: &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\lambda(T):=|T|^{\lambda}U|T|^{1-\lambda}\in B(H).&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
For vectors &lt;math&gt;x,y \in H&lt;/math&gt;, let  &lt;math&gt;x\otimes y&lt;/math&gt; denote the operator defined as 
: &lt;math&gt;\forall z\in H\quad x\otimes y(z)=\langle z,y\rangle x.&lt;/math&gt;

An elementary calculation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chabbabi |first1=Fadil |last2=Mbekhta |first2=Mostafa |title=Jordan product maps commuting with the λ-Aluthge transform |journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications |date=June 2017 |volume=450 |issue=1 |pages=293–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that if &lt;math&gt;y\ne0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\lambda(x\otimes y)=\Delta(x\otimes y)=\frac{\langle x,y\rangle}{\lVert y \rVert^2} y\otimes y.&lt;/math&gt;

Born in [[New York City]], Coulter was raised in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]]. She deepened her conservative interests while studying history at [[Cornell University]], where she helped found ''[[The Cornell Review]]''. She subsequently embarked on a career as a law clerk before rising to prominence in the 1990s as an outspoken critic of the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].

==Early life==
[[File:Ann Coulter HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Coulter as a senior in high school, 1980]]
Ann Hart Coulter was born on December 8, 1961, in New York City, to John Vincent Coulter (1926–2008), an FBI agent of Irish–German heritage,&lt;ref name=hufpost1&gt;Smolenyak, Megan. {{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/ann-coulters-immigrant-an_b_8332212.html |title=Ann Coulter's Immigrant Ancestors |work=The Huffington Post |access-date=October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a native of [[Albany, New York]]; and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin; 1928–2009), a native of [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2008-01-09.html|title=Ann Coulter – January 9, 2008 – John Vincent Coulter|publisher=anncoulter.com}}&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.humanevents.com/2009/04/22/nell-husbands-martin-coulter/ "Nell Husbands Nartin CoulterLL"]. humanevents.com. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Her family later moved to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holson|first1=Laura M.|title=Outflanked on Right, Coulter Seeks New Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/fashion/10coulter.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=January 27, 2018|date=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was brought up in a conservative household in Connecticut by Republican parents, with a father who idolized [[Joseph McCarthy]]. Coulter says that she has identified as a conservative since [[kindergarten]]. To prepare for arguments, she read books like ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' by [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/ann-coulter-is-a-human-being|title=Ann Coulter Is a Human Being|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age 14, Coulter visited her older brother in New York City, where he attended law school. While he was in class, he had his little sister read books by [[Milton Friedman]] and [[William E. Simon]]. When he got home from class, he quizzed Coulter. As a reward, he and his friends took her out to bars on the Upper East Side. Reading Republican books made Coulter dream about working as a writer.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt; She graduated from [[New Canaan High School]] in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002, while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Lloyd Grove]] cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]]. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later purportedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="Grove_Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Mystery of the Ages|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 6, 2002|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2002/09/06/the-reliable-source/dc20d57b-0508-45e7-a7f1-7a93d293f840/|access-date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After law school, Coulter served as a [[law clerk]], in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], for [[Pasco Bowman&amp;nbsp;II]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite news|title=Liberals, conservatives duke it out on paper |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20031005/ai_n11424888 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820063927/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20031005/ai_n11424888 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 20, 2013 |last=Lythgoe |first=Dennis |date=October 5, 2003 |publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] |page=E1}}; {{cite news |title=Op-Ed: Congress Goes Fishing |last=Hentoff |first=Nat |date=December 5, 1998|work=The Washington Post |page=A23}}; Coulter herself says it was Bowman.

In 2000, Coulter considered running for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in [[Connecticut]] on the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://articles.courant.com/1999-01-29/news/9901290415_1_congressional-seat-caucus-chairman-democrats| title = News And Views From The Hallways Of Government| publisher = Hartford Courant| date = January 29, 1999| access-date = March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serve as a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] in order to throw the seat to the Democratic candidate and see that Republican Congressman [[Christopher Shays]] failed to gain re-election, as a punishment for Shays' vote against Clinton's [[impeachment]]. The leadership of the [[Libertarian Party of Connecticut]], after meeting with Coulter, declined to endorse her. As a result, her self-described "total sham, media-intensive, third-party [[Jesse Ventura]] campaign" did not take place.&lt;ref name = "arm candy"&gt;Lehman, Susan.

Coulter's career is highlighted by the publication of twelve books, as well as the weekly syndicated [[newspaper]] column that she publishes. She is particularly known for her polemical style,&lt;ref name="coulter_style"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1203281,00.html|title=What Would Ann Coulter Do?|last=Schmidt|first=Tracy Samantha|date=June 12, 2006|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes herself as someone who likes to "stir up the pot.

She has been compared to [[Clare Boothe Luce]], one of her idols, for her satirical style.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Courtwright, ''No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2010, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; She also makes numerous public appearances, speaking on television and radio [[talk show]]s, as well as on [[college]] [[campus]]es, receiving both praise and protest.

Coulter is the author of twelve books, many of which have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], with a combined 3 million copies sold {{as of|2009|May|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="depasquale"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/LisaDePasquale/2009/05/06/being_ann|title=Being Ann|last=De Pasquale|first=Lisa|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's first book, ''[[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton]]'', was published by [[Regnery Publishing]] in 1998 and made the New York Times Bestseller list.&lt;ref name="Howard Kurtz" /&gt; It details Coulter's case for the [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment]] of [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]].

In her third book, ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]]'', also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the [[Cold War]]—including the career of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]], the [[Whittaker Chambers]]-[[Alger Hiss]] affair, and [[Ronald Reagan]]'s challenge to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to "[[tear down this wall]]"—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1200/article_detail.asp |title=Tailgunner Ann |author=William F.

She also argues that the correct identification of [[Annie Lee Moss]], among others, as [[communist]]s was misreported by the liberal media.&lt;ref&gt;

Crown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, ''[[How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)|How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

On June 7, 2011, [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] published her eighth book ''[[Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America]]''. Coulter said she based this book heavily on the work of [[France|French]] [[social psychologist]] [[Gustave Le Bon]], who wrote on mass psychology, and in it she argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;"Why liberals behave the way they do" by Ann Coulter, ''The Dailer Caller'', August 15, 2012, [http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/15/why-liberals-behave-the-way-they-do/ Retrieved 2012-08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her ninth book, published September 25, 2012, is ''[[Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama]]''.

===Columns===
In the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) [[Print syndication|syndicated]] column for [[Universal Press Syndicate]] began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: ''[[Human Events|Human Events Online]]'', [[WorldNetDaily]], [[Townhall.com]], [[VDARE]], ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', ''[[Jewish World Review]]'' and her own website. Her syndicator says, "Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers".&lt;ref name="EP_mitchell-astor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714162642/http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |title=Newspaper Clients, and Syndicate, Stick With Coulter |date=June 16, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=June 28, 2009 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Coulter worked as a regular [[columnist]] for ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="arm candy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribute-to-john"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uexpress.com/anncoulter/index.html?uc_full_date=19990728|title=A Republican Tribute to John|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 28, 1999|publisher=uexpress.com|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]''. In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, [[Constitution]]al issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the [[executive branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/author/ann-coulter/|title=Ann Coulter's Articles |work=Human Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for ''[[National Review Online]]'' (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the national television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', Coulter accused ''NRO'' of [[censorship]] and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship. [[Jonah Goldberg]], editor-at-large of ''NRO'', said, "We did not 'fire' Ann for what she wrote... we ended the relationship because she behaved with a total lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty [concerning the editing disagreement]."&lt;ref name="goldbergjonah"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |title=L'Affaire Coulter |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |date=October 2, 2001 |work=[[National Review]] |access-date=November 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901162828/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/220676/laffaire-coulter/jonah-goldberg |archivedate=September 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter contracted with ''[[USA Today]]'' to cover the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. She wrote one article that began, "Here at the Spawn of [[Satan]] convention in [[Boston]]&amp;nbsp;..." and referred to some unspecified female attendees as "[[corn-fed (disambiguation)|corn-fed]], no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, [[hirsutism|hirsute]], somewhat fragrant [[hippie]] chick pie wagons". The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over "basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable". An explanatory article by the paper went on to say "Coulter told the online edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine that {{'}}''USA Today'' doesn't like my "tone", humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'" ''USA Today'' replaced Coulter with [[Jonah Goldberg]], and Coulter published it instead on her website.&lt;ref name="speakerscage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39644|title=Put the speakers in a cage|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[World Net Daily]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/26/politics/main631949.shtml|title=USA Today Drops Ann Coulter|last=Collins|first=Dan|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatodaydrops2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/2004-07-26-coulter-column_x.htm|title=Coulter column canceled after editing dispute|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=July 26, 2004|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' dropped Coulter's syndicated column, citing reader complaints: "Many readers find her shrill, bombastic, and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives".&lt;ref name="AZDailyStar"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050925074100/http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php |archivedate=September 25, 2005 |title=Opinion pages get a makeover|last=Stoeffler|first=David|date=August 28, 2005|publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|access-date=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, ''[[Godless: The Church of Liberalism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/another-newspaper-decides-to-drop-ann-coulter-s-column/|title=Another Newspaper Decides to Drop Ann Coulter's Column |website=editorandpublisher.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'' dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained: "it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |title=Augusta Editor Explains Why He Dropped Coulter Column |date=July 24, 2006 |work=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]] |access-date=July 26, 2006 |author1=Astor, Dave |author2=Mitchell, Greg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404200542/http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146 |archivedate=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also stated that "pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around".

===Television and radio===

Coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network [[MSNBC]] as a legal correspondent.

She then mocked "the message of Jesus... according to liberals", summarizing it as "something along the lines of 'be nice to people{{'"}}, which, in turn, she said "is, in fact, one of the incidental tenets of Christianity."&lt;ref name="Passion-of-the-Liberal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter|first=Ann|title=The Passion of the Liberal|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2004/03/04/the_passion_of_the_liberal|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=Townhall.com|date=March 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter endorsed the period of [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–2007)|NSA warrantless surveillance from 2001 to 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2006-08-23.html|title=August 23, 2006 - WHAT PART OF THE WAR ON TERRORISM DO THEY SUPPORT?|website=www.anncoulter.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 2011 appearance on [[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]], she said "[[PATRIOT Act]], fantastic, [[Gitmo]], fantastic, [[waterboarding]], not bad, though [[torture]] would've been better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/19/ann-coulter-said-anti-war-dems-were-traitors-now-she-says-war-is-like-crack-for-trump|title=Ann Coulter Said Anti-War Dems Were 'Traitors.'

;Hate crimes
Coulter opposes [[hate crime laws]], calling them "unconstitutional". She also stated that "Hate-crime provisions seem vaguely directed at capturing a sense of cold-bloodedness, but the law can do that without elevating some victims over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter011000.asp|title=Ann Coulter|website=www.jewishworldreview.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
Coulter has criticized former president [[George W. Bush]]'s immigration proposals, saying they led to "amnesty". In a 2007 column, she claimed that the current immigration system was set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:&lt;ref name="roachmotel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |title=Bush's America: Roach Motel |last=Coulter |first=Ann |date=June 6, 2007 |publisher=anncoulter.com |access-date=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102051234/http://anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188 |archivedate=January 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In 1960, whites were 90 percent of the country. The Census Bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than two-thirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050. Other estimates put that day much sooner.

One may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been. If this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide. Yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population.}}

Coulter strongly opposes the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2007-06-06.html|title=June 6, 2007 - BUSH'S AMERICA: ROACH MOTEL|website=www.anncoulter.com|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding illegal immigration, she strongly opposed [[amnesty]] for [[undocumented immigration|undocumented immigrants]], and at the 2013 CPAC said she has now become "a single-issue voter against amnesty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Becomes a Single Issue Voter|url=http://barelyablog.com/ann-coulter-becomes-a-single-issue-voter/|access-date=January 31, 2013|publisher=barelyablog.com|date=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, during the controversy caused by the [[Trump administration family separation policy]], Coulter dismissed immigrant children as "child actors weeping and crying" and urged Trump not to "fall for it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thomsen |first1=Jacqueline |title=Ann Coulter calls immigrant children 'child actors' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/392774-ann-coulter-calls-immigrant-children-child-actors |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;;LGBT conservatism

Since the 1990s, Coulter has had many acquaintances in the LGBT community. She considers herself "the [[Judy Garland]] of the Right". In the last few years,{{vague|date=August 2018}} she has attracted many LGBT fans, namely gay men and [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="broadly.vice.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/queen-of-the-hill-the-worlds-best-hillary-impersonator-is-ready-for-2016|title=Queen of the Hill: The World's Best Hillary Impersonator Is Ready for 2016|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/video/shooting-guns-with-ann-coulter|title=Shooting Guns With Ann Coulter|website=Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], Coulter said, "I do want to point out one thing that has been driving me crazy with the media—how they keep describing [[Mitt Romney]]'s position as being pro-gays, and that's going to upset the right wingers", and "Well, you know, screw you! I'm not anti-gay. We're against gay marriage. I don't want gays to be discriminated against." She added, "I don't know why all gays aren't Republican. I think we have the pro-gay positions, which is anti-crime and for tax cuts. Gays make a lot of money and they're victims of crime. No, they are! They should be with us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter under fire for anti-gay slur |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/04/coulter.edwards/|access-date=May 3, 2013|publisher=CNN|date= March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Coulter's 2007 book ''[[If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans]]'', in the chapter "Gays: No Gay Left Behind!", she argued that Republican policies were more pro-gay than Democratic policies. Coulter attended the 2010 HomoCon of [[GOProud]], where she commented that same-sex marriage "is not a civil right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter Loves the Gays? Inside a Surprising Culture War|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/ann-coulter-goproud-speech-092710|access-date=January 31, 2013|newspaper=Esquire|date= September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2011, in a column, she described the national [[Log Cabin Republicans]] as "ridiculous" and "not conservative at all". She did however describe the Texas branch of Log Cabin Republicans, for whom she's been signing books for years, as "{{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} real conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2011-02-09.html|author=Ann Coulter |date= February 9, 2011 |title= Dear Mainstream Media Reporter Who Wasted My Time ...|website=anncoulter.com|access-date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]], during her question-and-answer segment, Coulter was asked about GOProud and the controversy over their inclusion at the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should be on our side", and "Gays are natural conservatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter Says 'Gays Are Natural Conservatives' – To Cheers From CPAC Crowd |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |access-date=January 31, 2013 |newspaper=[[Metro Weekly]] |date=February 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922134505/http://metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/02/coulter-says-gays-are-natural.html |archivedate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she joined advisory board for GOProud. On [[Logos]] [[The A-List: Dallas]] she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that "The gays have got to be pro-life", and "As soon as they find the [[gay gene]], guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ann Coulter On 'A List: Dallas': Liberals Would Abort Gay Babies (video) |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/08/ann-coulter-liberals-gay-abortions_n_1137277.html|access-date=January 31, 2013|newspaper=[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]|date= December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities and commentary==
{{update|date=March 2018}}
Ann Coulter has described herself as a "[[polemics|polemicist]]" who likes to "stir up the pot" and does not "pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do".&lt;ref name="polemicist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430010955/http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 30, 2006 |title=Conservative pundit Ann Coulter '84 to speak May 7 |last=Aloi |first=Daniel |date=April 17, 2006 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |access-date=September 27, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President [[Bill Clinton]] as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], sometimes creating [[controversy]] ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. ''Time'' magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter "likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote".&lt;ref name="msright" /&gt; This was in reference to her statement that "it would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted."&lt;ref name="appmagic" /&gt; Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the ''[[New York Observer]]'', Coulter said:&lt;ref name="Gurley_George"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurley|first=George|title=Coulter Culture|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|access-date=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112214238/http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|archivedate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president. It's kind of a pipe dream, it's a personal fantasy of mine, but I don't think it's going to happen. And it is a good way of making the point that women are voting so stupidly, at least single women.

It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it. I mean, you do see it's the party of women and 'We'll pay for health care and tuition and day care—and here, what else can we give you, soccer moms?'}}
In addition to questioning whether women's right to vote is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court, and the Distortion of American Elections|last=Hasen|first=Richard L.|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780300212457|location=New Haven, CT|page=66|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a viewpoint widely shared by members of the Republican Party.

===Paula Jones – Bill Clinton case===
Coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing [[Paula Jones]] in her [[sexual harassment]] suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for ''[[Human Events]]'', was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.

Coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to [[legal settlement|settle]], if a favorable settlement could be negotiated.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=conason /&gt; From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Daphne. "[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm Jones would have been happy with an apology]". ''[[Irish Examiner]]''. September 23, 1998. Retrieved July 10, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812211212/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm |date=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in [[extortion|extorting]] money from the President.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;

David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' recounted what followed:

{{quote|Coulter played one particularly key role in keeping the Jones case alive. In ''Newsweek'' reporter Michael Isikoff's new book ''Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'', Coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of Clinton's "distinguishing characteristic"—his reportedly bent penis that Jones said she could recognize and describe—to the news media. Her hope was to foster mistrust between the Clinton and Jones camps and forestall a settlement ... I thought if I leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations. [Clinton lawyer] Bob Bennett would think Jones had leaked it. Cammaratta would know he himself hadn't leaked it and would get mad at Bennett. It might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to [Jones adviser] Susan Carpenter-McMillan to tell her that I thought settling would hurt Paula, that this would ruin her reputation, and that there were other lawyers working for her. Then 36 hours later, she returned my phone call. I just wanted to help Paula. I really think Paula Jones is a hero. I don't think I could have taken the abuse she came under. She's this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man she's ever met hitting on her sexually, then denying it and smearing her as president. And she never did anything tacky. It's not like she was going on TV or trying to make a buck out of it."&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;}}

In his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: "We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President."&lt;ref name=conason&gt;Conason, Joe; Lyons, Gene. "[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/04/willey/print.html Impeachment's little elves]". ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''. March 4, 2000. Retrieved July 10, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212222059/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/04/willey/print.html |date=February 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:

{{quote|The only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that [Isikoff] gives in his book is my self-parodying remark that "it would humiliate the president" and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president ... I suppose you could take the position, as [Isikoff] does, that we were working for Jones because we thought Clinton was a lecherous, lying scumbag, but this argument gets a bit circular. You could also say that Juanita Broaddrick's secret motive in accusing Clinton of rape is that she hates Clinton because he raped her. The whole reason we didn't much like Clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a low-level government employee like Paula to his hotel room, drop his pants, and say, "Kiss it." You know: Everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial. It's not like we secretly disliked Clinton because of his administration's position on California's citrus cartels or something, and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our Mata Hari.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann (May 1999). "Spikey and me". [[George (magazine)|''George''.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via [[summary judgment]]. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, "... plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment." The ruling was [[appeal]]ed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky sex scandal]].

In October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, "I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund."&lt;ref name=larryking&gt;Jones, Paula.

Coulter wrote:

"Ann Coulter's use of this anti-gay slur is vile and unacceptable," said Neil G.

[[John McCain]], a Republican presidential candidate, called Coulter's comments "wildly inappropriate".&lt;ref name="CNN_edwards_faggot_comment" /&gt;

As the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named [[Duncan Hunter]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, highlighting his views on immigration and specifically his anti-abortion credentials, saying "[t]his is a winning issue for us, protecting little babies".&lt;ref&gt;''Good Morning America'', ABC: [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3312795 What's Wrong With The Republicans?] June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2008, Coulter began endorsing Governor [[Mitt Romney]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican nomination, saying he is "manifestly the best candidate" (contrasting Romney with Republican candidates [[John McCain]], [[Mike Huckabee]], and [[Rudy Giuliani]]).&lt;ref name="Coulter_endorses_Romney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Coulter |first=Ann |title=The Elephant in the Room |url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |date=January 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927112540/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=230 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Coulter was critical of eventual Republican nominee [[John McCain]]. On the January 31, 2008, broadcast of ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for [[Hillary Clinton]], stating, "[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain."&lt;ref name="Parker_Jennifer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker |first=Jennifer |title=Coulter: I Will Vote for Hillary Over McCain |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |access-date=September 27, 2011 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=February 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110092504/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/ |archivedate=January 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding then-presidential-candidate [[Barack Obama]] in an April 2, 2008, column, she characterized his book ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' as a "dimestore ''[[Mein Kampf]]''{{-"}}. Coulter writes, "He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]].

===Comments on Islam, Arabs, and terrorism===
On September 14, 2001, three days after the [[September 11 attacks]] (in which her friend [[Barbara Olson]] had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:
{{quote|Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to Muslim hijackers. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now. We should invade ''their'' countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010914225811/http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archivedate=September 14, 2001 |title=This Is War |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=September 14, 2001 |access-date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comment resulted in Coulter's being fired as a columnist by the ''National Review'', which she subsequently referred to as "squeamish girly-boys".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rough sailing for the new darling on the racial right. (2002). ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,'' (34), 44. Via ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] remarked in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' that before September 11, Coulter "would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues", but "now it's accepted as legitimate commentary".&lt;ref&gt;Jim Ritter, "Muslims see a growing media bias", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', September 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

One day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:
{{quote|Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.&lt;ref name="Future widows"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp |author=Coulter, Ann |title= Future widows of America: Write your congressman |work=Jewish World Review |access-date=April 16, 2007 |date=September 28, 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070416152942/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp| archivedate=April 16, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter was highly critical in 2002 of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and especially its then-secretary [[Norman Mineta]]. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use [[racial profiling]] as a component of airport screening.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann. "[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter022802.asp Mineta's Bataan death march]", ''Jewish World Review''. February 28, 2002. Retrieved July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of Muslims was expelled from a [[US Airways]] flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the [[Flying Imams controversy|ejection from a flight of six imams]], Coulter wrote:
{{quote|If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |title=What can I do to make your flight more uncomfortable? |author=Coulter, Ann |date=November 22, 2006 |access-date=April 17, 2007 |publisher=AnnCoulter.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326071242/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |archivedate=March 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Coulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower [[Coleen Rowley]], who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a [[search warrant]] for 9-11 conspirator [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French Intelligence Service]] had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that [[probable cause]] existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for [[Osama bin Laden]] she asserted "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that {{"'}}probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England". Coulter says the poll was "by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''", actually it was by Sunrise, an "[[British Asian|Asian]]" (therefore an Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling", they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. "The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of [[political correctness]]. What more do liberals want?"&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

Coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the [[civil rights]] lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected Arabs to the most "egregious discrimination" so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann.

In a May 2007 article looking back at the life of then recently deceased evangelical Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]], Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that "the [[paganism|pagans]], and the [[abortion]]ists, and the [[feminist]]s, and the [[Homosexuality|gays]] and the [[lesbian]]s who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen."

After the election, in which [[Barack Obama]] won, Ann Coulter wrote a column titled "Romney Was Not the Problem".

Coulter was reportedly invited by UC Berkeley student organization Berkeley Patriot to participate in an event headed by [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], scheduled for [[2017 Berkeley protests#September 24-27 (Free Speech Week)|September 24–27]].

== Controversies ==
=== Anti-semitism accusations ===
Coulter was accused of [[Antisemitism|anti-semitism]] in an October 8, 2007, interview with [[Donny Deutsch]] on ''[[The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch|The Big Idea]]''. During the interview, Coulter stated that the United States is a Christian nation, and said that she wants "Jews to be perfected, as they say" (referring to them being converted to Christianity).&lt;ref name="perfected_jews"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter: We Want Jews To Be "Perfected"|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/national/main3358373.shtml|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=February 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsch, a practicing Jew, implied that this was an anti-semitic remark, but Coulter said she didn't consider it to be a hateful comment.&lt;ref name="Perfected_Jews_FOX"&gt;{{cite news|title=Columnist Ann Coulter Shocks Cable TV Show, Declaring 'Jews Need to be Perfected by Becoming Christians'|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=October 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007220454/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,301216,00.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch_response"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter draws fire over remarks about Jews|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21257498/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/coulter-draws-fire-over-remarks-about-jews/|access-date=September 27, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter's comments on the show were condemned by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[Bradley Burston]],&lt;ref&gt;Burston, B.

Didn't need to hear applause lines about them all night."&lt;ref name=debate /&gt;

=== Plagiarism accusations ===
In October 2001, Coulter was accused of plagiarism in her 1998 book ''High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' by Michael Chapman, a columnist for the journal ''Human Events'' who claims that passages were taken from a supplement he wrote for the journal in 1997 titled "A Case for Impeachment".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On the July 5, 2006, episode of ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' on [[MSNBC]], guest John Barrie, the CEO of iParadigms, offered his professional opinion that Coulter plagiarized in her book ''Godless'' as well as in her columns over the previous year.&lt;ref name="Dietz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dietz|first=Rob|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2006/07/06/olbermann-hosted-plagiarism-expert-to-spell-out/136106|title=Olbermann hosted plagiarism expert to spell out allegations against Coulter|work=Media Matters for America|date=July 6, 2006|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrie ran "Godless" through iThenticate, his company's machine which is able to scan works and compare them to existing texts. He points to a 25 word section of the text that exactly matches a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and a 33 word section almost duplicating a 1999 article from the ''Portland Press'' as some examples of evidence.&lt;ref name="Dietz"/&gt;

[[Media Matters for America]] has appealed to Random House publishing to further investigate Coulter's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/07/07/media-matters-asks-random-house-to-investigate/136111|title=Media Matters asks Random House to investigate Coulter plagiarism allegations|date=October 10, 2007|newspaper=Media Matters for America|access-date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The syndicator of her columns cleared her of the plagiarism charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2006-07-11-0607110267-story.html|title=Sorry, harpies--syndicator sees no Coulter plagiarism|last=Bowles|first=Cheryl|date=July 11, 2006|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Press Syndicate and Crown Books also defended Coulter against the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2006/07/11/Syndicate-supports-Ann-Coulter/90741152652128/?sl=3|title=Syndicate supports Ann Coulter|last=|first=|date=July 11, 2006|work=United Press International|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Columnist Bill Nemitz from the ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'' accused Coulter of plagiarizing a very specific sentence from his newspaper in her book ''Godless'', but he also acknowledged that one sentence is insufficient grounds for filing suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lib.umich.edu/articles/details/FETCH-proquest_newspapers_2773031853|title=Wonder how Ann Coulter fills her books?|last=Nemitz|first=Bill|date=July 23, 2006|work=Portland Press Herald|access-date=November 29, 2016|via=lib.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prehistoric monument of [[Stonehenge]] has long been studied for its possible connections with ancient astronomy. The site is aligned in the direction of the sunrise of the summer solstice and the sunset of the winter solstice. [[archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomers]] have made a range of further claims about the site’s connection to astronomy, its meaning, and its use.

==Early work==
Stonehenge has an opening in the henge earthwork facing northeast, and suggestions that particular significance was placed by its builders on the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points have followed. For example, the summer solstice sun rose close to the Heel Stone, and the sun’s first rays shone into the centre of the monument between the horseshoe arrangement. While it is possible that such an alignment could be coincidental, this astronomical orientation had been acknowledged since [[William Stukeley]] drew the site and first identified its axis along the midsummer sunrise in 1720.&lt;ref&gt;William Stukeley, [http://newensign.christsassembly.com/Stonehenge_Stuckley.pdf ''Stonehenge, A Temple Restor’d to the British Druids''], W Innys &amp; R Manby, London (1740), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley noticed that the Heel Stone was not precisely aligned on the sunrise. The drifting of the position of the sunrise due to the change in the obliquity of the [[ecliptic]] since the monument’s erection does not account for this imprecision. Recently, evidence has been found for a neighbour to the [[Heel Stone]], no longer extant. The second stone may have instead been one side of a ‘solar corridor’ used to frame the sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stonehenge: Circles of the Season | url = http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080427012558/http://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/xpeditions/activities/07/popup/stonehenge.html| archivedate= 27 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Ruggles | first = Clive | author2 = Hoskin, Michael | title = Astronomy Before History | encyclopedia = The Cambridge Concise History of Astronomy | editor-last = Hoskin | editor-first = Michael |volume=| pages = 6 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | date = 1999 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4nmjGztzfZwC&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=heel+stone+companion+discovered#PPR5,M1 | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | isbn = 0-521-57600-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stukeley and the renowned astronomer [[Edmund Halley]] attempted what amounted to the first scientific attempt to date a prehistoric monument. Stukeley concluded the Stonehenge had been set up “by the use of a magnetic compass to lay out the works, the needle varying so much, at that time, from true north.” He attempted to calculate the change in magnetic variation between the observed and theoretical (ideal) Stonehenge sunrise, which he imagined would relate to the date of construction.  Their calculations returned three dates, the earliest of which, 460&amp;nbsp;BC, was accepted by Stukeley. That was incorrect, but this early exercise in dating is a landmark in field archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony. (2008). ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early efforts to date Stonehenge exploited changes in astronomical declinations and led to efforts such as H.&amp;nbsp;Broome’s 1864 theory that the monument was built in 977&amp;nbsp;BC, when the star [[Sirius]] would have risen over Stonehenge’s [[Avenue (archaeology)|Avenue]]. Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Norman Lockyer]] proposed a date of 1680 BC based entirely on an incorrect sunrise [[azimuth]] for the Avenue, aligning it on a nearby [[Ordnance Survey]] [[trig point]], a modern feature. Petrie preferred a later date of 730&amp;nbsp;AD. The relevant stones were leaning considerably during his survey, and it was not considered accurate.

An archaeoastronomy debate was triggered by the 1963 publication of ''Stonehenge Decoded'', by [[Gerald Hawkins]] an American astronomer. Hawkins claimed to observe numerous alignments, both lunar and solar.  He argued that Stonehenge could have been used to predict eclipses. Hawkins’ book received wide publicity, in part because he used a computer in his calculations, then a novelty. Archaeologists were suspicious in the face of further contributions to the debate coming from British astronomer C.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;‘Peter’ Newham and Sir&amp;nbsp;[[Fred Hoyle]], the famous Cambridge cosmologist, as well as by [[Alexander Thom]], a retired professor of engineering, who had been studying stone circles for more than 20&amp;nbsp;years. Their theories have faced criticism in recent decades from [[Richard J. C. Atkinson]] and others who have suggested impracticalities in the ‘Stone Age calculator’ interpretation.

==Gerald Hawkins’ work==
[[Image:Stonehenge back wide.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Stonehenge in 2004]]
Gerald Hawkins’ work on Stonehenge was first published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1963 following analyses he had carried out using the Harvard-Smithsonian IBM computer. Hawkins found not one or two alignments but dozens. He had studied 165&amp;nbsp;significant features at the monument and used the computer to check every alignment between them against every rising and setting point for the sun, moon, planets, and bright stars in the positions they would have been in 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE. Thirteen solar and eleven lunar correlations were very precise in relation to the early features at the site but precision was less for later features of the monument. Hawkins also proposed a method for using the [[Aubrey holes]] to predict lunar eclipses by moving markers from hole to hole. In 1965 Hawkins and J.B.&amp;nbsp;White wrote ''[[Stonehenge Decoded]]'', which detailed his findings and proposed that the monument was a ‘Neolithic computer’.

Atkinson replied with his article “Moonshine on Stonehenge” in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' in 1966, pointing out that some of the pits which Hawkins had used for his sight lines were more likely to have been natural depressions, and that he had allowed a margin of error of up to 2&amp;nbsp;degrees in his alignments. Atkinson found that the probability of so many alignments being visible from 165&amp;nbsp;points to be close to 0.5 (or rather 50:50) rather that the “one in a million” possibility which  Hawkins had claimed. That the Station Stones stood on top of the earlier Aubrey Holes meant that many of Hawkins’ alignments between the two features were illusory. The same article by Atkinson contains further criticisms of the interpretation of [[Aubrey Holes]] as astronomical markers, and of Fred Hoyle’s work.

A question exists over whether the English climate would have permitted accurate observation of  astronomical events. Modern researchers were looking for alignments with phenomena they already knew existed; the prehistoric users of the site did not have this advantage.

==Newham and the Station Stones==
In 1966, C. A. ‘Peter’ Newham described an alignment for the equinoxes by drawing a line between one of the [[Station Stones]] with a posthole next to the Heel Stone. He also identified a lunar alignment; the long sides of the rectangle created by the four station stones matched the moon rise and moonset at the [[major standstill]]. Newham also suggested that the postholes near the entrance were used for observing the [[Saros (astronomy)|saros cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-vWrImYK8K0C&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=peter+Newham+and+the+Station+Stones#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20Newham%20and%20the%20Station%20Stones&amp;f=false | title = Stonehenge | isbn = 1847650759 | author1 = Hill | first1 = Rosemary | date = 2010-12-09 | pmid = 17830710 | volume = 133 | issue = 3460 | pages = 1216–22 | doi = 10.1126/science.133.3460.1216 | journal = Science|bibcode = 1961Sci...133.1216H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Station Stones are damaged and although their positions would create an approximate rectangle, their date and thus their relationship with the other features at the site is uncertain. Stonehenge’s latitude (&amp;nbsp;51°&amp;nbsp;10′&amp;nbsp;44″&amp;nbsp;N&amp;nbsp;) is unusual in that only at this approximate latitude (within about 50&amp;nbsp;km) do the lunar and solar alignments mentioned above occur at right angles to one another. More than 50&amp;nbsp;km north or south of the [[latitude]] of Stonehenge, the station stones could not be set out as a rectangle.

==Alexander Thom’s work==
[[Alexander Thom]] had been examining stone circles since the 1950s in search of astronomical alignments and the [[megalithic yard]].  It was not until 1973 that he turned his attention to Stonehenge. Thom chose to ignore alignments between features within the monument, considering them to be too close together to be reliable. He looked for landscape features that could have marked lunar and solar events. However, one of Thom’s key sites – Peter’s Mound – turned out to be a twentieth-century rubbish dump.

==Later theories==
Although Stonehenge has become an increasingly popular destination during the summer solstice, with 20,000&amp;nbsp;people visiting in 2005, scholars have developed growing evidence that indicates prehistoric people visited the site only during the winter solstice. The only megalithic monuments in the British Isles to contain a clear, compelling solar alignment are [[Newgrange]] and [[Maeshowe]], which both famously face the winter solstice sunrise.

The most recent evidence supporting the theory of winter visits includes bones and teeth from pigs which were slaughtered at nearby [[Durrington Walls]]. Their age at death indicating that they were slaughtered either in December or January every year. Mike Parker Pearson of the [[University of Sheffield]] has said, “We have no evidence that anyone was in the landscape in summer.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stonehenge druids ‘mark wrong solstice’ | author = Clover, Charles | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1492482/Stonehenge-druids-mark-wrong-solstice.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12 | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=2005-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Barometer''''' is a 2013 [[sculpture]] by Devin Laurence Field, to be installed at the newly constructed [[Hillsboro Ballpark]] in Oregon, United States. The [[stainless steel]] sculpture, commissioned by the City of Hillsboro, stands {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} tall at the stadium's entry plaza. Installation of the work began on June 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Theen|first=Andrew|title=Hillsboro Hops news: 'Barometer' public art piece starting to take shape, team signage goes up|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/hillsboro/index.ssf/2013/06/hillsboro_hops_news_public_art.html#incart_river|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=The Oregonian|date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Barometer'', commissioned by the City of Hillsboro for the newly constructed [[Hillsboro Ballpark]], was designed by Northwest sculpture Devin Laurence Field. Field's design was chosen from twenty qualified candidates by an artist, design team, the [[Hillsboro Arts &amp; Culture Council]], and the Parks and Recreation Department. The [[stainless steel]] sculpture stands {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} tall at the stadium's entry plaza. According to Fields, "the piece takes the overall triangular form of the baseball diamond held aloft by columns and illuminated with color changing, sound activated LED lights. The laser-cut skin of the diamond form is adorned with intricate patterns of baseball bats and balls [and other sports equipment]. Around the sculpture are various 'instruments' people can play, a giant horn, a rattle roller, drum sets and chimes that together form a symphony of sounds. When no one is at the park there is no colored light, when there is noise it lights up — the louder the noise, the brighter the light. The art is a veritable Barometer of excitement for the ballpark."&lt;ref name=Redden&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://portlandtribune.com/ht/117-hillsboro-tribune-news/129203-new-hillsboro-baseball-stadium-adds-artistic-barometer|title= New Hillsboro baseball stadium adds artistic 'Barometer'|first=Jim|last=Redden|accessdate=May 15, 2013|date=February 28, 2013|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cassette adapter''' allows another source of music to be played through sound systems with a tape player.&lt;ref name="cassette_adapter_patent"&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=US4734897 A |status=application |pdate=1988-03-29 |gdate=1986-07-25 |pridate=1985-11-13 |inventor=Larry Schotz |assign1=Recoton Corporation |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US4734897}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for vehicles without auxiliary (aux) ports or CD players.

==Usage==
Patented on March 29, 1988, a cassette tape adapter is a device that allows the use of [[portable audio players]] in older [[cassette deck]]s. Originally designed to connect portable [[CD players]] to car stereos that only had cassette players, the cassette tape adapter has become popular with [[portable media player]]s even on cars that have CD players built in. Today, it is primarily used for vehicles without auxiliary ports built into their stereo systems.&lt;ref name="autotechcast_macworld_study"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Peter|title=Study: Two thirds of iPod owners use them in cars|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1052160/harris.html|website=Macworld|publisher=IDG Communications, Inc.|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autotechcast_site"&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoTECHCAST|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/services/autotechcast.asp|website=Harris Interactive|publisher=Harris Interactive|accessdate=13 April 2017|date=21 August 2006|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821213358/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/services/autotechcast.asp|archivedate=21 August 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For vehicles with AM/FM systems but no cassette playback, [[FM transmitter (personal device)|FM transmitter]]s are recommended.

A typical cassette adapter uses a single-sided writing tape head (similar to the [[recording head]] on a traditional tape deck) connected to a stereo minijack connector with a cord.  The cord is connected to the device's output (or headphones) port and the electrical signal is converted into a magnetic signal by the head.  This magnetic signal is then received by the tape deck's reading head, converted back into an electrical signal, and amplified by the sound system.  Because most cassette adapters use a single-sided head, they only work in one direction.  There are, however, some cassette adapters that have double-sided heads that work in either direction.

A newer type of adapter is a type of [[MP3 player]] shaped like a cassette tape,&lt;ref name="cnet_mp3_cdeck"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Nicole|title=Retro stylin': A cassette tape MP3 player|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/retro-stylin-a-cassette-tape-mp3-player/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chinavasion_mp3_cdeck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wholesale Cassette MP3 Player - Stand Alone or Car Cassette Player From China|url=https://www.chinavasion.com/china/wholesale/Electronic_Gadgets/Car_Gadgets/Cassette_MP3_Player-Stand_Alone_or_Car_Cassette_Player|website=Chinavasion|accessdate=13 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used as a stand-alone MP3 player with headphones or inserted as a cassette into the cassette player, where it can be used with a remote control. These usually have a double sided head which means they can work in both directions.

A common alternative to cassette adapters is FM transmitters.  These devices often require external power and convert the device's electrical signal into radio waves which are then transmitted over an unused FM frequency to a nearby FM tuner.  The cassette adapter is usually considered superior as it is much less prone to interference.

==Applications==
:''See also: [[FM transmitter (personal device)#Applications]], this section has examples that apply here too.''
A cassette adapter could also be used with other audio equipment, such as a [[microphone]], [[handheld game console]], or [[laptop computer]]. It can also be used in a home tape deck to play sound from any equipment, such as a [[personal computer]], when computer speakers are in short supply.

==Mechanism==
A cassette adapter is shaped like a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]].  However, instead of having reels of tape inside, it has a transmitting head where the tape is normally read by the reading head.  This transmitting head is connected to the input cord, which connects the head to the audio source.  A cassette adapter must also include a mechanism that simulates tape movement.  Modern cassette players monitor tape movement to detect when the tape ends.  This is done using a rolling wheel that rides against the tape.  To simulate tape movement, a system of gears or a drive belt connects the tape player's drive motor (via the take-up spindle) to a wheel inside the adapter.  This wheel rides against the detection wheel to simulate tape movement.  Because the wheel never stops spinning, the deck never senses an end-of-tape and never tries to reverse the tape. Some adapters contain a one way locking mechanism, to stop the detection wheel if the tape is played in the wrong direction (and thus reading the wrong side of the head). The stopped wheel then would cause the cassette player to either stop the tape, or reverse the direction if the player supports it.

The practical and functional opposite of using a cassette adapter, is using a cassette player on an AUX input of a stereo that doesn't have a built-in cassette deck, which can be useful in some cases.

{{Descartes}}
'''{{lang|la|Cogito, ergo sum}}'''{{efn|name="capitalization and punctuation"}} is a [[Latin]] [[philosophy|philosophical]] [[proposition]] by [[René Descartes]] usually translated into English as "'''I think, therefore I am'''".{{efn|name= "better translation" | Some sources offer “I am thinking, therefore I am” as a 'better' translation. (See [[Cogito, ergo sum#Translation|§ Translation]].)}} The phrase originally appeared in [[French language|French]] as {{nowrap|'''{{lang|fr|je pense}}}}, {{nowrap|{{lang|fr|donc je suis}}}}''' in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = William E. | last = Burns | title = The scientific revolution: an encyclopedia| publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87436-875-8 | page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in Latin in his later ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''. As Descartes explained, "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt...." A fuller version, articulated by [[Antoine Léonard Thomas]], aptly captures Descartes’s intent: {{lang|la|dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum}} ("I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am").{{efn|The {{lang|la|dubito}} is often mistakenly attributed to Descartes. (See [[Cogito ergo sum#Other forms|Other forms]].)}}{{efn|In the posthumously published work cited in the first footnote above, Descartes wrote “'''''dubito, ergo sum''''', vel, quod idem est, '''''cogito, ergo sum'''''" ("'''''I doubt, therefore I am''''' — or what is the same — '''''I think, therefore I am'''''"). (See [[Cogito, ergo sum#The Search for Truth|''The Search for Truth'']].)}} The concept is also sometimes known as '''the cogito'''.&lt;ref&gt;"

This proposition became a fundamental element of [[Western philosophy]], as it purported to form a secure [[epistemology|foundation for knowledge]] in the face of [[radical doubt]]. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served—at minimum—as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a [[Consciousness|thinking entity]]—in this case the [[self]]—for there to be a thought.

==In Descartes's writings==
Descartes first wrote the phrase in French in his 1637 ''[[Discourse on the Method]]''. He referred to it in Latin without explicitly stating the familiar form of the phrase in his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. The earliest written record of the phrase in Latin is in his 1644 ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', where, in a margin note (see below), he provides a clear explanation of his intent: "[W]e cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt". Fuller forms of the phrase are attributable to other authors.

===''Discourse on the Method''===
The phrase first appeared (in French) in Descartes's 1637 ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' in the first paragraph of its fourth part:

{{quote|(French:) {{lang|fr|Ainsi, à cause que nos sens nous trompent quelquefois, je voulus supposer qu'il n'y avoit aucune chose qui fût telle qu'ils nous la font imaginer; Et parce qu'il y a des hommes qui se méprennent en raisonnant, même touchant les plus simples matières de Géométrie, et y font des Paralogismes, jugeant que j'étois sujet à faillir autant qu'aucun autre, je rejetai comme fausses toutes les raisons que j'avois prises auparavant pour Démonstrations; Et enfin, considérant que toutes les mêmes pensées que nous avons étant éveillés nous peuvent aussi venir quand nous dormons, sans qu'il y en ait aucune pour lors qui soit vraie, je me résolus de feindre que toutes les choses qui m'étoient jamais entrées en l'esprit n'étoient non plus vraies que les illusions de mes songes. Mais aussitôt après je pris garde que, pendant que je voulois ainsi penser que tout étoit faux, il falloit nécessairement que moi qui le pensois fusse quelque chose; Et remarquant que cette vérité, '''''{{nowrap|je pense,}} {{nowrap|donc je suis}}''''',{{efn|name="formatting"}} étoit si ferme et si assurée, que toutes les plus extravagantes suppositions des Sceptiques n'étoient pas capables de l'ébranler, je jugeai que je pouvois la recevoir sans scrupule pour le premier principe de la Philosophie que je cherchais.|italic=unset}}{{efn|name="formatting2”|Formatting note: Capitalization as in original.}}{{efn|1=See original ''Discours'' manuscript [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f37.item.zoom here].}}}}

{{quote|(English:) Accordingly, seeing that our senses sometimes deceive us, I was willing to suppose that there existed nothing really such as they presented to us; And because some men err in reasoning, and fall into Paralogisms, even on the simplest matters of Geometry, I, convinced that I was as open to error as any other, rejected as false all the reasonings I had hitherto taken for Demonstrations; And finally, when I considered that the very same thoughts (presentations) which we experience when awake may also be experienced when we are asleep, while there is at that time not one of them true, I supposed that all the objects (presentations) that had ever entered into my mind when awake, had in them no more truth than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately upon this I observed that, whilst I thus wished to think that all was false, it was absolutely necessary that I, who thus thought, should be something; And as I observed that this truth, '''''{{nowrap|I think,}} {{nowrap|therefore I am}}''''',{{efn|name="formatting"}} was so certain and of such evidence that no ground of doubt, however extravagant, could be alleged by the Sceptics capable of shaking it, I concluded that I might, without scruple, accept it as the [[first principle]] of the philosophy of which I was in search.{{efn|This translation, by Veitch in 1850,&lt;ref name="Veitch1850"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[John Veitch (poet)|Veitch, John]] | title=Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences, by Descartes | publisher=Sutherland and Knox | year=1850 | location=Edinburgh | page=74-5 | url = https://archive.org/stream/Descartes1637DiscourseOnTheMethodTrVeitch1850/Descartes%201637%20Discourse%20tr%20Veitch%201850#page/n77/mode/2up/search/Therefore+I+am}}&lt;/ref&gt; is modified here as follows: Veitch's "I think, hence I am” is changed to the form by which it is currently best known in English, "I think, therefore I am", which appeared in the Haldane and Ross 1911 translation,&lt;ref name=Haldane1911/&gt; and as an isolated attributed phrase previously, e.g., in Sullivan (1794);&lt;ref name=Sullivan1794&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Richard Joseph Sullivan]] | title=A View of Nature, in Letters to a Traveller among the Alps, with Reflections on Atheistical Philosophy now exemplified in France | year = 1794 | page=129 | url=

===''Meditations on First Philosophy''===
In 1641, Descartes published (in Latin) ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]'' in which he referred to the proposition, though not explicitly as "cogito, ergo sum" in Meditation II:

{{quote|(Latin:) {{lang|la|hoc pronuntiatum: '''ego sum, ego existo''',{{efn|name="formatting"}} quoties a me profertur, vel mente concipitur, necessario esse verum.|italic=unset}}{{efn|1=See original ''Meditiations'' manuscript [https://books.google.com/books?id=r0APAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=descartes+1642+meditations&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc-vvr6cXeAhUtrlkKHSI-C2sQ6AEIKDAA#v=snippet&amp;q=%22ego%20fum%2C%20ego%20exifto%22&amp;f=false here].}}}}

===''Principles of Philosophy''===
In 1644, Descartes published (in Latin) his ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' where the phrase "ego cogito, ergo sum" appears in Part 1, article 7:

{{quote|(Latin:) {{lang|la|Sic autem rejicientes illa omnia, de quibus aliquo modo possumus dubitare, ac etiam, falsa esse fingentes, facilè quidem, supponimus nullum esse Deum, nullum coelum, nulla corpora; nosque etiam ipsos, non habere manus, nec pedes, nec denique ullum corpus, non autem ideò nos qui talia cogitamus nihil esse: repugnat enim ut putemus id quod cogitat eo ipso tempore quo cogitat non existere.

{{quote|(English:) While we thus reject all of which we can entertain the smallest doubt, and even imagine that it is false, we easily indeed suppose that there is neither God, nor sky, nor bodies, and that we ourselves even have neither hands nor feet, nor, finally, a body; but we cannot in the same way suppose that we are not while we doubt of the truth of these things; for there is a repugnance in conceiving that what thinks does not exist at the very time when it thinks.

===Other forms===
The proposition is sometimes given as {{lang|la|dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum}}. This fuller form was penned by the eloquent French literary critic, [[Antoine Léonard Thomas]], in an award-winning 1765 essay in praise of Descartes, where it appeared as {{lang|fr|"Puisque je doute, je pense; puisque je pense, j'existe."}} In English, this is "Since I doubt, I think; since I think, I exist"; with rearrangement and compaction, "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am", or in Latin, "dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum".{{efn|The 1765 work, ''Éloge de René Descartes'',&lt;ref name=Thomas1765/&gt; by Antoine Léonard Thomas, was awarded the 1765 Le Prix De L'académie Française and republished in the 1826 compilation of Descartes's work, ''Oeuvres de Descartes''&lt;ref name=Cousin1824/&gt; by [[Victor Cousin]].

A further expansion, {{lang|la|dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum—res cogitans}} ("…—a thinking thing") extends the ''cogito'' with Descartes's statement in the subsequent Meditation, {{lang|la|"Ego sum res cogitans, id est dubitans, affirmans, negans, pauca intelligens, multa ignorans, volens, nolens, imaginans etiam et sentiens …"}}, or, in English, "I am a thinking (conscious) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many …".{{efn | This translation by [[John Veitch (poet)|Veitch]]&lt;ref name="Veitch1880"&gt;{{cite book | author=[[John Veitch (poet)|Veitch, John]] | title=The Method, Meditations and Selections from the Principles of René Descartes | publisher=William Blackwood and Sons | year=1880 | location=Edinburgh | edition=7th | pages=115 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TjYCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first English translation from Descartes as "I am a thinking thing".}} This has been referred to as "the expanded ''cogito''".&lt;ref name=Kline1967/&gt;{{efn|[[Martin Schoock]], who in the 1642–43 controversy between Descartes and [[Gisbertus Voetius]], fiercely attacked Descartes and his philosophy in an essay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite | last = Schoockius | first = Martinus | title = Admiranda Methodus Novae Philosophiae Renati Des Cartes | year = 1643 | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Admiranda_Methodus_Novae_Philosophiae_Re.html?id=1PQGAAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
As put compactly by Prof. Krauth (1872), "That cannot doubt which does not think, and that cannot think which does not exist. I doubt, I think, I exist."&lt;ref name=Krauth/&gt;

The phrase ''cogito, ergo sum'' is not used in Descartes's ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' but the term "the ''cogito''" is used to refer to an argument from it.  In the ''Meditations'', Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as "that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind." (''Meditation'' II)

At the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt—his argument from the existence of a deceiving god—Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists.  Even if there were a deceiving god (or an [[evil demon]]), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for there is no way one could be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies.  Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me.  In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something.  So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, ''I am, I exist,'' is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16–17{{efn|name= "abbreviations"}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of ''his own'' existence from the first-person point of view — he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that ''if he thinks'', then necessarily he exists (see the [[instantiation principle]]). Third, this proposition "I am, I exist" is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition. Descartes does not use this first certainty, the ''cogito'', as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to discover further truths&lt;ref&gt;''Self, Reason, and Freedom: A New Light on Descartes' Metaphysics'' Andrea Christofidou; chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;  As he puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16){{efn|name= "abbreviations"}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to many Descartes specialists, including [[Étienne Gilson]], the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion — the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions — to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes's thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the ''cogito'' — a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see — but on using the ''cogito'' as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence.
[[Baruch Spinoza]] in "''[[Principia philosophiae cartesianae]]''" at its ''Prolegomenon'' identified "cogito ergo sum" the "''ego sum cogitans''" (I am a thinking being) as the thinking [[substance theory|substance]] with his [[ontology|ontological]] interpretation. It can also be considered that ''Cogito ergo sum'' is needed before any living being can go further in life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Nicholas | last =Vesey | title = Developing Consciousness| publisher = O-Books | location = United Kingdom | year = 2011| isbn = 978-1-84694-461-1 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=The Vesey citation does not include this material; a proper source is needed.|date=May 2014}}

==Predecessors==
Although the idea expressed in ''cogito, ergo sum'' is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. [[Plato]] spoke about the "knowledge of knowledge" (Greek νόησις νοήσεως ''nóesis noéseos'') and [[Aristotle]] explains the idea in full length:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if life itself is good and pleasant (...) and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', 1170a25 ff.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in ''[[City of God (book)|De Civitate Dei]]'' writes ''Si […] fallor, sum'' ("If I am mistaken, I am") (book XI, 26), and also anticipates modern refutations of the concept.  Furthermore, in the ''[[Enchiridion of Augustine|Enchiridion]]'' Augustine attempts to refute [[skepticism]] by stating, "[B]y not positively affirming that they are alive, the skeptics ward off the appearance of error in themselves, yet they do make errors simply by showing themselves alive; one cannot err who is not alive. That we live is therefore not only true, but it is altogether certain as well" (Chapter 7 section 20). In 1640 correspondence, Descartes thanked two colleagues for drawing his attention to Augustine and notes similarity and difference. (See CSMK III 159, 161.)

Another predecessor was [[Avicenna]]'s "[[Floating man|Floating Man]]" [[thought experiment]] on human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Leaman&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Nasr, Seyyed Hossein]] and [[Oliver Leaman|Leaman, Oliver]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', Routledge, p. 315, {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8th century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara]] wrote in a similar fashion, No one thinks, 'I am not', arguing that one's existence cannot be doubted, as there must be someone there to doubt.&lt;ref name=Radhakrishnan.S&gt;Radhakrishnan, S. (1948), ''Indian Philosophy, vol II'', p. 476, [[George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd]],&lt;/ref&gt; . The central idea of ''cogito, ergo sum'' is also the topic of [[Mandukya Upanishad]]. 

Spanish philosopher [[Gómez Pereira]] in his 1554 work ''De Inmortalitate Animae'', published in 1749, wrote "''nosco me aliquid noscere, &amp; quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''" ("I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist").&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Pereira, ''Antoniana Margarita'': "De Immortalitate Animae", 1749 [1554], p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santos López, Modesto (1986). "Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
===Use of "I"===
In ''Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry'', [[Bernard Williams]] provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. Apparently, the first scholar who raised the "I" problem was [[Pierre Gassendi]]. He "points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. Were we to move from the observation that there is thinking occurring to the attribution of this thinking to a particular agent, we would simply assume what we set out to prove, namely, that there exists a particular person endowed with the capacity for thought". In other words, "the only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gassendi/|title=Pierre Gassendi|author=Fisher, Saul|date=2005|accessdate=1 December 2014}} from [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The objection, as presented by [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg|Georg Lichtenberg]], is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: "thinking is occurring." That is, whatever the force of the ''cogito'', Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the "I," is more than the ''cogito'' can justify. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an "I", that there is such an activity as "thinking", and that "I" know what "thinking" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be "it thinks" wherein the "it" could be an impersonal subject as in the sentence "It is raining."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aporia.byu.edu/pdfs/monte-Sum_ergo_cogito.pdf|title=Sum, Ergo Cogito: Nietzsche Re-orders Decartes|last=Monte|first=Jonas|date=2015|website=Aporia.byu.edu|publisher=BYU|access-date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kierkegaard's critique===
The Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] calls the phrase a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]] in his ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the ''cogito'' already presupposes the existence of "I", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise "I think" into the premises "'x' thinks" and "I am that 'x'", where "x" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the "I" from the thinking thing.&lt;ref&gt;Schönbaumsfeld, Genia. ''A Confusion of the Spheres''. Oxford, 2007. p.168-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the ''cogito'' has already assumed the "I"'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely "developing the content of a concept", namely that the "I", which already exists, thinks.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Philosophical Fragments''. Trans. Hong, Princeton, 1985. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Archie, Lee C., "Søren Kierkegaard, ''God's Existence Cannot Be Proved''". Philosophy of Religion. Lander Philosophy, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Williams' critique===
Bernard Williams claims that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say "I am thinking," is something conceivable from a [[Grammatical person|third-person]] perspective; namely objective "thought-events" in the former case, and an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of "there is thinking" without relativizing it to ''something.''  However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through [[introspection]], or our experience of [[consciousness]], we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Heidegger's critique===
As a critic of Cartesian subjectivity, Heidegger sought to ground human subjectivity in death as that certainty which individualizes and authenticates our being. As he wrote in 1927:

"This certainty, that "I myself am in that I will die," is the basic certainty of Dasein itself. It is a genuine statement of Dasein, while ''cogito sum'' is only the semblance of such a statement. If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be ''sum moribundus'' [I am in dying], ''moribundus'' not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am ''moribundus''. The ''MORIBUNDUS'' first gives the ''SUM'' its sense."

===John Macmurray's critique===
The Scottish philosopher [[John Macmurray]] rejects the ''cogito'' outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitles the Form of the Personal. "We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality." &lt;ref&gt;Macmurray, John. ''The Self as Agent''. Humanity books, 1991. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the [[:wikt:unity|unity]] of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves, and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate ''cogito'', Macmurray proposes the substitution of "I do" for "I think",  ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation.

The '''Concerned Officers Movement''' (COM) was an organization of mainly junior officers formed within the U.S. military in the early 1970s whose principal purpose was opposition to the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="EVW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1647C|title=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War, A Political, Social, and Military History, Second Edition 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly, however, it also found itself fighting for [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights within the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Antiwar Officers See Retaliation|date=1970-10-23|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area by [[commissioned officers]] who were also [[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam Veterans]],&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/6596/rec/38|title=Concerned Officers' Movement newsletter: GI Press Collection|website=content.wisconsinhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rapidly expanded throughout all branches and many bases of the U.S. military, ultimately playing an influential role in the [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Franklin NYT 1970-09-27"&gt;{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=Ben|date=1970-09-27|title=Vietnam War Policy Denounced by 28 Armed Service Officers|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|The cite does not prove the assertion|date=September 2017}}

==Founding==
[[File:COM First Leaflet 14Mar1970.jpg|thumb|Concerned Officers Movement first leaflet issued for GI Rally for Peace and Justice in Washington, DC March 14, 1970]]COMs genesis sprang from the participation of Marine Captain Bob Brugger in the November 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|March on Washington]] against the Vietnam War. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' carried an article about Bob and his wife that caused his superior officers to enter an unsatisfactory mark for loyalty in his fitness report and generated supportive phone calls from other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MacPherson|first=Myra|date=1969-11-15|title=Marine Captain: Mobilization Marshal|work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmberg|first=David|date=1970-06-01|title=Officers Form Unit as Outlet for Dissent|work=The Evening Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brugger's opposition to "blind patriotism" and his stand against racism at home and in Vietnam had struck a chord with other officers who read the article.

Over several months a group of officers agreed to work together and on March 14, 1970, they participated as ''Officers' Resistance'' in a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Rally for Peace and Justice in [[Washington, D.C.]] By the end of March 1970 they had changed their name to the '''Concerned Officers Movement'''.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt; Early members who signed the first published newsletter were LT Jim Crawford, USN, CPT Ed Fox, USA, CPT Gerry Giovaniello, USAR, LTJG Tono Hixon, USNR, LTJG Phil Lehman, USNR, LTJG Randy Thomas, USNR; CAPT Larry Wasser, USMC, and CPT Bob Gaines, USAR.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt; Other early members were 1LT Louis Font, a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] honor graduate, who received extensive national media coverage for his stand against the war and CAPT Mike Mullen, USMCR who was one of the contacts on the organization's first leaflet (see image to right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Charlton|first=Linda|date=1970-03-17|title=West Point Graduate Seeking Discharge Over Vietnam Issue|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM's first newsletter, published in April 1970, described the organization's political views:

{{quote|The Concerned Officers' Movement was formed by a group of active duty and reserve officers who could no longer continue to be passive, unquestioning agents of military and national policies they found untenable.

Paramount in the program of COM is a fervent opposition to the continuing military effort in Vietnam. COM decries the military policies that turned an internal political struggle into a nation-destroying bloodbath. The application of American military power in Vietnam was as unnecessary as it was unworkable.

COM further abhors the military mentality that promotes absurd measures like the body count; that leads to the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent civilians; that destroys land and villages and calls it victory.}}

While stating they were "loyal, responsible military officers", they supported "a cease-fire and the rapid disengagement of American troops from [[Southeast Asia]]", opposed the "preponderant share of national resources devoted to the military", and called for the "free expression of dissenting opinion" within the military.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

==Media coverage and growth==
The fact that military officers had formed a group openly speaking out against the war and the U.S. military was unprecedented and quickly reached the national media. On June 3, 1970, ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced that the "antiwar movement has reached the United States military officers corps." "Calling themselves the Concerned Officers Movement, about 25 officers based in Washington, most of them Navy men, have banded together to provide a forum for what they say is growing disillusionment among their ranks with the Indochina war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1970-06-03|title=Military Officers Join Drive Against the War|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM continued to grow and on September 26, 1970, 28 members representing about 250 others on active duty from the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Marines|Marine Corps]] held a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] to announce "their intention to speak against the war in Vietnam" and "to encourage other officers to express antiwar opinions". Font told the press, "I reject this war....I have asked myself time and again: 'When the law becomes a crime, consensus and conformity becomes a crime, am I to condone it?' My answer is no." Major Albert Braverman, a physician at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, stated that COM had active chapters at the Marine base at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], NC, at Navy and Marine bases in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], VA, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], FL and [[San Diego]], at Army bases at [[Fort Bragg]], NC, and [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], SC, at the Air Force base in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks, ND]], and in [[Iceland]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="Franklin NYT 1970-09-27" /&gt; They also read an open letter to Secretary of Defense [[Melvin Laird]] demanding an immediate withdrawal from the war written by LTJG John Kent, USN, an [[United States Naval Academy|Annapolis]] graduate, all-American wrestler and jet fighter pilot, and signed by 29 officers of the [[San Diego]] chapter of COM ranging in rank from [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]] to [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]].&lt;ref name="retaliation"&gt;{{cite news |last=Franklin |first=Ben |date=1970-10-23 |title=Antiwar Officers See Retaliation |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="COMLATimes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sell |first=Ted |date=1970-10-26 |title=Navy Officers Unite to From Antiwar Group |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:John_Kent_Letter_to_the_Secretary_of_Defense_25Sep1970.pdf|title=English: Letter written by LTJG John Kent and signed by 28 other officers to the Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird demanding an immediate withdrawal from the Vietnam War.|first=|last=JohnKent|date=25 September 1970|publisher=|via=Wikimedia Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COM carried out a variety of antiwar activities throughout 1970 and 1971. It published a newsletter, which by the fourth issue was called ''COMmon Sense'', distributing it throughout the armed services.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt; It bought newspaper ads calling for an immediate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam, wrote leaflets, printed posters and held press conferences. COM's Norfolk Naval Base chapter paid for a billboard outside the base that read '''Peace Now''' &lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;

== Military retaliation ==

Initially, many COM members wanted to stay within the military and felt they had a right to express dissenting views. In fact, their third newsletter argued that responsible dissent "can and must be allowed to exist in the military, if it is to keep pace with the times in which we live." "We believe that such expressions of our convictions are within our rights, and that in expressing them, we are following our obligations as officers to defend the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]." The organization felt the armed forces were an insular and hidebound world and explored ways to establish the right of free speech for active duty servicemen, both officers and [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]].&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

The military, however, disagreed and in many cases reprimanded, discharged and transferred COM members soon after their participation became known. Within three weeks of their September 26, 1970 press conference many COM members were facing retaliation. One Navy doctor in the [[San Diego]] chapter was discharged on 48 hours' notice after making his membership known. Official military spokespeople blamed budget cutbacks or force reductions, but COM members were told privately they were being discharged due to their membership. ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted a Pentagon spokesman who denied the existence of a "purge" of antiwar officers, but then went on to admit the military did get concerned when these officers "go public". He argued that public statements "[d]raw the radicals to them like bees to honey", making them "duck soup for radicals" and raising "questions about the officers' reliability." Ironically, some members who did want to get out were forced to stay in the military against their will and given orders transferring them to remote military bases like [[Adak, Alaska]] or even [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="retaliation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kondracke|first=Morton|date=1970-07-13 |title=Anti-War Officers Fight Discharge |work=Washington Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakin|first=Jim |date=1970-11-19|title=Navy punishes anti-war advocates|work=San Diego Independent }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=David|date=2005|title=Soldiers In Revolt|url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt|location=Chicago, IL|publisher=Haymarket Books|page=109|isbn=1931859272|author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, COM had a high turnover rate as the military discharged or transferred its members.&lt;ref name="EVW"/&gt; This, combined with its focus on active duty officers, meant the national organization was relatively short-lived, tapering off considerably by the end of 1971.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter"/&gt;

==Controversial activity==
In early 1971 COM created quite a stir by holding press conferences on both coasts calling for an investigation into the military's top brass for possible war crimes. Under the auspices of The National Committee for a Citizens Commission of Inquiry on U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam [[Citizens Commission of Inquiry|(Citizens Commission of Inquiry)]], COM held press conferences on January 12 in [[Washington, D.C.]] and January 20 in [[Los Angeles]] calling for an investigation into the "responsibility for war crimes of key military figures", including Generals [[William Westmoreland]] and [[Creighton Abrams]], and Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]]. While formally they were only calling for an investigation, they presented evidence of war crimes and catastrophic environmental damage, leaving the impression they were accusing their own commanders of war crimes. The [[Washington, D.C.]] COM members involved were CPT Robert Master, USA, CPT Grier Merwin, USA, Fox, Font and LTJG Peter Dunkelberger, USN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Neil|date=1971-01-13|title=Five Officers Say They Seek Formal War Crimes Inquiries|url=http://www.veteranscholar.com/docu21.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Los Angeles]] were LT Norman Banks, USAF, LTJG Ted Shallcross, USN, LT James Skelly, USN, and Kent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-01-21|title=4 More Officers Seek U.S. War Crimes Inquiry|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-01-21|title=Military Leader Inquiry Is Urged|work=Independent Press-Telegram}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cortright|first=David|date=2005|title=Soldiers In Revolt |url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt|location=Chicago |publisher=Haymarket Books|page=110|isbn=1931859272|author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year COM members used the military's own practice of encouraging the wearing of uniforms to religious services to conduct antiwar demonstrations in uniform, a prohibited activity under military regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133401p.pdf], DoD Directive 1334.1, "Wearing of the Uniform".&lt;/ref&gt; On April 23, 1971, ignoring warnings from higher ups that their actions would be considered a political demonstration, COM organized a memorial service at [[Washington National Cathedral|Washington's National Cathedral]] involving more than 250 officers in uniform honoring all the war dead, on both sides of the war.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers:GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=89 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt; On May 2, 45 officers and enlisted men from the [[San Diego]] Chapter wore their uniforms to a similar antiwar "religious" event in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in Los Angeles led by a prominent antiwar Episcopal minister, [[George F. Regas|George Regas]].&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/1620/rec/1892|title=Liberty call (San Diego Concerned Officers Movement) :: GI Press Collection|website=content.wisconsinhistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the men who participated later recalled in his memoir: "Thus, with one of our men playing the haunting lament on his bugle that is heard at military funerals, we marched with [a] coffin draped with the flags of the Viet Cong, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the United States."&lt;ref name="Skelly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skelly |first=James |date=2017 |title=The Sarcophagus of Identity: Tribalism, Nationalism, and the Transcendence of the Self |location=Stuttgart |publisher=ibidem Verlag |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one was ever reprimanded or punished for these actions, probably because the military decided it would be better to ignore the whole thing and pretend it never happened.&lt;ref name="COMNewsletter" /&gt;

== The San Diego Chapter ==

The San Diego COM, located in the principal homeport of the Pacific Fleet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/port-san-diego/], Naval Base San Diego&lt;/ref&gt; may have been the most active chapter and was certainly the longest lasting, continuing actively until late 1973.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall1973"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/1625/rec/1891], Liberty Call, Concerned Military Newsletter 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Chapter was initiated by Kent and local antiwar activist Jeannie Boyle and formally founded in July 1970 by Kent, LT Harold Appel, USN, Skelly and Shallcross.&lt;ref name ="COMLATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/45211/rec/1889],
 San Diego COM Leaflet Announcing Formation&lt;/ref&gt; Very quickly it broadened its outreach to include enlisted men and women and by 1972 had changed its name to Concerned Military.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LibertyCall1973"/&gt; On May 15, 1971, which they called ''Armed Farces Day'', they hosted the touring [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] "political vaudeville" antiwar show, known to most G.I.'s as the "Fuck The Army" Show, featuring [[Jane Fonda]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Peter Boyle]], [[Dick Gregory]], and [[Country Joe McDonald]]. The show, held in the auditorium of [[San Diego High School]], was a tremendous success with a capacity crowd of over 2,400 enthusiastic sailors and marines, and contributed to the growth and reputation of the chapter.&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"/&gt;

===Efforts to stop an aircraft carrier===

[[File:Connstellation Vote Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster used for the Constellation Vote]]

They also joined with other antiwar activists in major efforts to mobilize opposition to the departure for Vietnam of several aircraft carriers. The first of these projects attracted antiwar activists from all over California and was aimed at trying to keep the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|USS ''Constellation'']] from sailing. The project was initiated by a group called '''San Diego Nonviolent Action''', which united with COM to focus on the role of aircraft carriers. They had the initial goal of stopping the ''Constellation'' from returning to Vietnam through education and non-violent activity like a blockade or by preventing military personnel from getting to the naval base. Very quickly, this effort expanded into a multi-faceted campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:San_Diego_Nonviolent_Action_Harbor_Project_Initial_Statement_April_1971.jpg], ''San Diego Nonviolent Action'' Anti-Aircraft Carrier Initial Statement; accessed December 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constellation Vote===
As veteran antiwar activists, including [[Joan Baez]] and [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], became involved, Harris suggested organizing a citywide referendum on whether the Constellation should set sail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/dg760vz2991 Joan Baez Wearing Stay Home For Peace T-Shirt], Joan Baez Prior to Singing at a Constellation Vote Rally&lt;/ref&gt; This '''Constellation Vote''' became a major antiwar campaign over several months that led to a citywide straw vote in late September 1971 with 54,721 votes counted. Over 82% of voters elected to keep the ship home, including 73% of the military personnel who voted. While not a "real" vote, the impact on public opinion was appreciable.&lt;ref name="War Foes"&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-09-19 |title=WAR FOES FIGHTING CARRIER'S RETURN; San Diego Poll Being Taken on Constellation's Future|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=1971-09-26|title=Protest Vote Fails To Bar the Sailing Of Carrier to Asia|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LibertyCall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/19335/rec/2] Constellation Vote Poster&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/browse/the-connie-vote-the-uss-constellation-and-the-peace-movement-in-san-diego-1971 The Connie Vote: The USS Constellation and the Peace Movement in San Diego, 1971], The Bob Fitch Photography Archive at Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; Even an unsympathetic observer deemed the overall effort to stop the Constellation "an impressive campaign", and the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet was quoted as saying "never was there such a concerted effort to entice American servicemen from their posts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guttridge|first=Leonard|date=1992|title=Mutiny: A History of Naval Insurrection |url=https://www.usni.org/store/books/bluejacket-books/mutiny|location=Annapolis, MD|publisher=Naval Institute Press|pages=255–56|isbn=0870212818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A considerable amount of research was conducted into the role of aircraft carriers in modern warfare by Professor William Watson of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] who was then a visiting Professor of History at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/wbwatson/www/|title=MIT History|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in a widely distributed pamphlet that aircraft carriers had become weapons "used to crush popular uprisings and to bully the weaker and poorer countries of the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10318752], ''Attack Carrier: The Constellation Papers'', September 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative protest methods===
The involvement of large numbers of antiwar officers and enlisted men created significant debate in the traditionally pro-military town. It also permitted creative methods not normally available to other antiwar groups, such as the CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE banner frequently seen being towed over the city by recently retired navy flight instructor LT John Huyler, and the Constellation Vote stickers found everywhere on board the USS ''Constellation'', including in the captain's personal bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/cj188gr6022|title=Plane flying over San Diego with banner "CONSTELLATION STAY HOME FOR PEACE"|last=Fitch|first=Bob|date=1971|quote=John Huyler flying with banner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/qn860wq8461 Constellation Vote Logo], Constellation Vote Logo Used on Stickers and Flyers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skelly"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-598566010/praxis-underground-newspaper-v1-no7-october-6#fullscreen Praxis Underground Newspaper V.1 No.7, October 6, 1971 p.9], "Stay Home For Peace Stickers" Land GI in Brig&lt;/ref&gt; Bathroom stickers weren't the only complication the Captain had to deal with. Over 1,300 of the ship's sailors signed a petition requesting the [[Free The Army tour|FTA]] Show be allowed onboard. The captain refused this request but then got himself in hot water by intercepting and destroying 2,500 pieces of U.S. mail sent by antiwar activists to crewmembers. Faced with a possible court of inquiry and health problems, the captain was removed from command before the ship sailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-06-07 |title=Inquiry Asked in Navy Antiwar Material Case|work=The San Diego Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="War Foes"/&gt;

===Connie 9===
When the ''Constellation'' actually did sail for Vietnam, no visible blockade occurred but nine of its crew publicly refused to go and took sanctuary in a local Catholic church, [https://www.ctksandiego.org Christ the King], with the support of COM members and other activists. The "Connie 9" as they were quickly dubbed, were soon arrested in an early morning raid by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] and flown back to the ship, but within weeks were honorably discharged from the navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-10-03 |title=9 Constellation Sailors Seized, Flown to Ship|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1971-12-08 |title='We've Won,' 8 Sailors Say on Discharge|work=The San Diego Union }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitty Litter"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/98297/rec/12], Kitty Litter (USS Kitty Hawk Newsletter) 1972&lt;/ref&gt; This action led to other [[Stop Our Ship (SOS)]] campaigns in [[San Diego]] and other California ports in a wider effort to prevent navy ships from heading to Southeast Asia. "A strong resistance movement within the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] was led by COM and its local chapter."&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kitty Litter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/14339/rec/11], Stop Our Ship Leaflet (USS Coral Sea)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/81191/rec/45], Stop Our Ship Petition (USS Coral Sea)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://exhibits.stanford.edu/fitch/catalog/qx316ms0992|title=Cindy O'Hara leaflets cars entering Naval base with newsletter|last=Fitch|first=Bob|date=1971|quote=Cindy O'Hare, Stop the Hawk activist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
At its height, COM had as many as 28 chapters in all the military branches and has been estimated to have "had approximately 3,000 members, including many supporters from the enlisted ranks." At one point it even had a chapter in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EVW" /&gt; It had no formal leadership, although various people stepped forward at different times to play central roles.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} COM did not attract the media attention as dramatically as its more well-known partner and ally, [[Vietnam Veterans Against the War]], but it played a key and underappreciated role in the antiwar movement of the early 1970s. The fact that officers not only resisted the war, but spoke out publicly and formed a significant organization, speaks to the depth of the anti-Vietnam War and anti-U.S. military sentiment in the U.S. at the time.

The '''Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women''' ('''CEDAW''') is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].
Described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women, it was instituted on 3 September 1981 and has been ratified by 189 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|author=|date=|website=un.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over fifty countries that have ratified the Convention have done so subject to certain declarations, reservations, and objections, including 38 countries who rejected the enforcement article 29, which addresses means of settlement for disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |title=Declarations, Reservations and Objections to CEDAW |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222104936/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/reservations-country.htm |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's declaration noted the limitations on central government power resulting from its federal constitutional system. The [[United States]] and [[Palau]] have signed, but not ratified the treaty. The [[Holy See]], [[Iran]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], and [[Tonga]] are not signatories to CEDAW.

The CEDAW Chairperson position is currently held by Dalia Leinarte.

==The Convention==

=== Summary ===

==CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820==
[[File:Map5.1Discrepant Behavior compressed.jpg|right|400px|thumb| A world map showing countries by CEDAW enforcement, 2010.]]
'''Resolutions 1325 10th anniversary events highlight use of CEDAW mechanisms&lt;ref name="gnwp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501140626/http://www.gnwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Cedaw-1325-1820-synergy2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-01 |title=Ensuring Accountability to UNSCR 1325 and 1820 using CEDAW reporting mechanisms |date=November 2010 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders |accessdate=5 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

The 10th anniversary of Resolution 1325 in October 2010 highlighted the increasing demand for accountability to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. Many expressed concern about the fact that only 22 Member States out of 192 have adopted national action plans. Women are still underrepresented, if not totally absent, in most official peace negotiations and sexual violence in peacetime and in conflict continue to increase.

These realities emphasized the need to use external legal mechanisms to strengthen the implementation of SCR 1325, particularly CEDAW. The well-established mechanisms of CEDAW – the Member States compliance report and the civil society shadow reporting process were cited as possible instruments to ensure accountability.

Several regional and international meetings including the High Level Seminar "1325 in 2020: Looking Forward…Looking Back," organized by the African Center for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes, and the "Stockholm International Conference 10 years with 1325 – What now?" called for the use of CEDAW to improve 1325 implementation.

'''Intersection between SCR 1325 and CEDAW
'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723130833/http://www.gnwp.org/written-statement-submitted-to-cedaw-on-the-occasion-of-the-general-discussion-on-women-in-conflict-and-post-conflict-situations |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 July 2011 |title=Written Statement submitted to CEDAW on the occasion of the General Discussion on Women in Conflict and Post-conflict Situations |author=GNWP-ICAN |date=18 July 2011 |website=gnwp.org |publisher=Global Network of Women Peacebuilders (GNWP) – International Civil society Action Network (ICAN) |accessdate=25 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While CEDAW and UN Security Council Resolutions 1325 and 1820 on Women, Peace and Security are important international instruments on their own, there is also an intersection among the three standards that can be used to enhance their implementation and impact.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820 broaden the scope of CEDAW application by clarifying its relevance to all parties in conflict, whereas CEDAW provides concrete strategic guidance for actions to be taken on the broad commitments outlined in the two Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=UNIFEM |title=CEDAW and Security Council Resolution 1325: A Quick Guide |url=http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |journal=Women, Peace &amp; Security |location= |publisher= |date=2006 |accessdate=25 August 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120303/http://www.unrol.org/files/CEDAWandUNSCR1325_eng.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEDAW is a global human rights treaty that should be incorporated into national law as the highest standard for women's rights. It requires the UN Member States that have ratified it (185 to date) to set in place mechanisms to fully realize [[women's rights]].

Resolution 1325 is an international law unanimously adopted by the Security Council that mandates the UN Member States to engage women in all aspects of peacebuilding including ensuring women's participation on all levels of decision–making on peace and security issues.

Resolution 1820 links sexual violence as a tactic of war with the maintenance of international peace and security. It also demands a comprehensive report from the UN Secretary-General on implementation and strategies for improving information flow to the Security Council; and the adoption of concrete protection and prevention measures to end sexual violence.

Resolutions 1325 and 1820, and CEDAW share the following agenda on women's human rights and [[gender equality]]:&lt;ref name="gnwp" /&gt;

# Demand women’s participation in [[decision-making]] at all levels
# Rejection of violence against women as it impedes the advancement of women and maintains their subordinate status
# Equality of women and men under the law; protection of women and girls through the [[rule of law]]
# Demand security forces and systems to protect women and girls from [[gender-based violence]]
# Recognition of the fact that distinct experiences and burdens of women and girls come from systemic discrimination
# Ensure that women’s experiences, needs and perspectives are incorporated into the political, legal and social decisions that determine the achievement of just and lasting peace

A General Comment from the CEDAW committee could strengthen women’s advocacy for the full implementation of Resolutions 1325 and 1820 at the country and community levels. Conversely, CEDAW’s relevance to conflict-affected areas will be underscored further by the two Resolutions.  In other words, all three international instruments will reinforce each other and be much more effective if used together in leveraging women’s human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 CEDAW with UNSCR 1325 and 1820 « Global Network of Women Peacebuilders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414214651/http://www.gnwp.org/what-we-do/local-legislative-advocacy/cedaw-with-unscr-1325-and-1820 |date=14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and ratification==
{{Main|List of parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women}}
The six UN member states that have not ratified or acceded to the convention are [[Iran]], [[Palau]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Tonga]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title='Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women' |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823144158/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Non-member states|UN non-member state]] that had not acceded to the convention is the [[Holy See]]/[[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Note:'' See New Zealand No 47 Declarations and Reservations New Zealand has signed this treaty on behalf of Niue.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reservations ==
Many [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] have been entered against certain articles of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Reservations to CEDAW: An Analysis for UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |website=www.unicef.org |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004104944/http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/Reservations_to_CEDAW-an_Analysis_for_UNICEF.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some reservations that are not specific to an article within the Convention but rather a general reservation to all aspects of the Convention that would violate a stated principle. For example, [[Mauritania]] made a reservation stating it approved the Convention "in each and every one of its parts which are not contrary to [[Sharia|Islamic Sharia]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A number these reservations, especially those entered by Islamic states parties, are subject to much debate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human Rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 28 of the Convention states that "a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] incompatible with the object and purpose of the present Convention shall not be permitted."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, many states parties have entered objections to the reservations of other states parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human rights |last=Henkin |first=Louis |publisher=Foundation Press |year=2009 |isbn= |location= |pages=822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, many Nordic states parties were concerned that some of the reservations were "undermining the integrity of the text."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title=The Vienna Convention Reservations Regime and the Convention on the Discrimination Against Women |last=Clark |first=Belinda |date=1991 |journal=The American Journal of International Law |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, some states parties have withdrawn their reservations.

As of May 2015, sixty-two states parties have entered reservations against some part of the Convention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Declarations and Reservations |date=2015 |accessdate= |website=United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906035454/https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-four states parties have entered objections to at least one of these reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most reserved article is Article 29, concerning dispute resolution and interpretation of the Convention, with thirty-nine reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Because reservations to Article 29 are expressly allowed by the Convention itself, these reservations were not very controversial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Article 16, concerning the equality of women in marriage and family life is subject to twenty-three reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Committee, in General Recommendation No. 28, specifically stated that reservations to Article 2, concerning general non-discrimination, are impermissible.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, Article 2 has seventeen reservations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women==
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is the United Nations (U.N.) treaty body that oversees the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). The formation of this committee was outlined in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article17 Article 17] of the CEDAW, which also established the rules, purpose, and operating procedures of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |last=U.N.

Over time the practices of the committee have evolved due to an increased focus on [[women's rights]] issues.

===History of the committee===
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women was formed on 3 September 1981 after the CEDAW received the 20 [[ratification]]s required for it to enter into force. Article 17 of the CEDAW established the committee in order to ensure that the provisions of the CEDAW were followed by the countries that had signed and agreed to be bound by it.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The first regular session of the committee was held from 18–22 October 1982. In this session the first officers of the committee were elected by simple majority, with Ms. L. Ider of [[Mongolia]] becoming chairperson.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW"&gt;{{cite book |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=The Work of CEDAW: Reports of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against  Women |year=1989 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |isbn=9211301327 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other officers elected were three vice-chairpersons: M.&amp;nbsp;Caron of Canada, Z.&amp;nbsp;Ilic of [[Yugoslavia]] and L.&amp;nbsp;Mukayiranga of [[Rwanda]]. The final officer elected was D.&amp;nbsp;P. Bernard of [[Guyana]] as [[rapporteur]] of the committee. During this session, the committee also unanimously approved to adopt its [[rules of procedure]].&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Reports===
Under [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article18 article 18] of the CEDAW states must report to the committee on the progress they have made in implementing the CEDAW within their state.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; As most of the information the committee works with comes from these reports, guidelines have been developed to help states prepare accurate and useful reports.&lt;ref name=Methods&gt;{{cite web |last=United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women |title=Overview of the current working methods of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022084310/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/wk-methods/Overview-English.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial reports discussing the current picture of discrimination against women in the reporting states are required to specifically deal with each article of the CEDAW, and consist of no more than one-hundred pages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States are required to prepare and present these initial reports within one year of ratifying the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Periodic reports detailing the state's progress in adhering to the articles of the CEDAW should be no more than seventy-five pages in length and should focus on the specific period of time since the state's last report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; States party to the CEDAW are typically required to provide periodic reports every four years, but if the committee is concerned about the situation in that state they can request a report at any time.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The committee chooses which reports addressing by considering factors such as the amount of time the report has been pending, whether the report is initial or periodic (with more priority given to initial reports), and from which region the report originates.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Eight states are invited to give their reports during each session and it is required a representative from the state is in attendance when the report is presented.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The committee focuses on constructive dialogue when a report is presented and appreciates careful time management on the part of the state presenting its report.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Due to the high backlog of overdue reports the committee has encouraged states to combine all of their outstanding reports into one document and sends reminders to states who have reports that are five years overdue.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The CEDAW also requires that the committee provide an annual report that includes its activities, comments relating to the reports provided by states, information relating to the Optional Protocol of the CEDAW, and any other general suggestions or recommendations the committee has made.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; This report is given to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] through the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]].&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All reports, agendas and other official documents pertaining to the committee, including the reports provided by the states, are provided to the public unless otherwise decided by the committee.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

===General Recommendations===

Along with issuing its annual report and offering advice to reporting states, the committee has the ability to issue general recommendations that elaborate on its views of the obligations imposed by CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; To date, the committee has issued thirty-two general recommendations, the latest dealing with the gender related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women |title=General recommendation No. 32 on the gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality and statelessness of women |url=https://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |website=undocs.org |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=21 March 2017 |date=14 November 2014 |id=CEDAW/C/GC/32 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014914/http://undocs.org/CEDAW/C/GC/32 |archivedate=22 March 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendations issued by the committee in its first decade were short and dealt mainly with the content of states’ reports and reservations to the convention.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; Since 1991, however, recommendations have been focused on guiding states’ application of the CEDAW in specific situations.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The formulation of a general recommendation begins with dialogue between the committee on the topic in the recommendation with various non-governmental organizations and other U.N. bodies.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt; The recommendation is then drafted by a member of the committee and discussed and revised in the next session, and finally adopted in the following session.&lt;ref name=Methods /&gt;

Currently the Committee is working on the '''General Recommendation''' Trafficking in women and girls in the context of global migration.

===Changes in the committee===

For the first ten years the committee operated significantly differently from now. The only form of [[censure]] given to the committee by the CEDAW was their general recommendations and concluding comments following a report.&lt;ref name=Reilly&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Niamh |title=Women's human rights : seeking gender justice in a globalizing age |year=2009 |publisher=[[Polity Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780745637006 |pages=62 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the emergence of the Global Campaign for Women's Human Rights in 1991 more attention was given to the CEDAW, reviving the committee.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee made changes to the CEDAW that allowed it to meet more than once a year, and have taken advantage of this by meeting at least twice a year since 1997.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt; The committee originally only met for two weeks in its annual sessions, but that has now been changed to meeting multiple times a year in eighteen-day sessions.&lt;ref name=Report /&gt; CEDAW also gained new complaint and inquiry proceedings allowing the committee to initiate inquiry proceedings if it believes a state is in severe violation of the articles of the CEDAW.&lt;ref name=Reilly /&gt;

===Recommendations for improvement===
Despite evolving since the committee was first formed, members believe there are ways in which the committee can better meet the goals outlined in the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; One of the committee's main goals moving forward is expanding its information base, allowing it to more effectively deal with issues that arise concerning the CEDAW.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; The committee is authorized in [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm#article22 Article 22] of the CEDAW to invite specialized U.N. agencies such as the [[United Nations Development Programme]] to deliver reports discussing women's rights issues in the state under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Another method for gathering information is requesting reports from non-governmental organizations dealing with discrimination against women that are operating in the country under discussion.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; This is recommended to insure that the committee is receiving the full, unbiased picture of affairs within the reporting state.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Another recommendation for improvement involves interpreting and clarifying the language used in the CEDAW in order to make the document as useful as it can be.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A third improvement that has been suggested is improving the efficiency of the committee.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; Due to the backlog in reports faced by the committee it has been suggested that the government officials who prepare reports presented to the committee should be trained, in order to make all reports uniform and more easily processed.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; A final suggestion for improvement is the implementation of a right of petition in the CEDAW, allowing the committee to hear complaints from citizens of a state against the state, increasing the committee's strength and direct impact on the problem of discrimination against women.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

===Languages===
The official languages of the committee are [[English language|English]], [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with any statement made in one of the official languages translated into the other four.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; A speaker who does not speak one of the official languages provides a translator.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; All formal decisions and documents issued by the committee are provided in each of the official languages.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The original rules of procedure adopted by the committee did not include Arabic as an official language, but the rule was amended in the committees second session to include Arabic.&lt;ref name="The Work Of CEDAW" /&gt;

===Members and Officers of the Committee===
Twenty-three members serve on the committee, described as experts for their experience and expertise in women's issues.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Merry |first=Sally Engle |title=Human rights and gender violence : translating international law into local justice |year=2006 |publisher=[[Univ. of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago [u.a.] |isbn=0226520730 |pages=82 |edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members are nominated by their national governments and elected through a secret ballot by states party to the convention.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Upon winning the election and taking up their responsibilities the members of the committee recite the following statement, known as the solemn declaration, "I solemnly declare that I shall perform my duties and exercise powers as a member of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women honourably, faithfully, impartially and conscientiously".&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; The members come from a wide range of occupations including doctors, lawyers, diplomats and educators, providing various viewpoints to the committee due to their diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Many members continue to hold full-time jobs outside the committee and receive little monetary payment for their work on the committee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

To insure that the nationality of members encompasses all the diverse states who have signed the CEDAW, members are elected according to regions divided into [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Western Europe]], and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The members of the committee differ from those of other treaty bodies of the United Nations in that they have all been women with only one exception.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt; In the event a member of the committee is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term is up the state that had nominated the resigning member shall nominate another expert from their country to fill in her seat.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; Committee members and experts also attend an annual luncheon, hosted by the [[NGO Committee on the Status of Women, New York|NGO Committee on the Status of Women, NY]] (NGO CSW/NY), where key issues are discusses and the efforts of the committee are honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |title=NGO CSW, NY / About / How We Work |publisher=Ngocsw.org |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011010921/http://www.ngocsw.org/about/how-we-work |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the chairperson fails to designate a vice-chairperson prior to her absence then the vice-chairperson with the first name in English alphabetical order takes over.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt; In the event an officer is unable to continue serving on the committee before her term expires a new officer from the same region as the original officer shall be nominated, elected and will take over the vacated office.&lt;ref name=Rules /&gt;

==Optional Protocol==
The [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] is a side-agreement to the Convention which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to consider complaints from individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509170959/http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cedawopprot-2000.html |date=9 May 2008 }}, Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 6 October 1999 and entered into force on 22 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |title=Optional Protocol to Women's Convention Comes into Force |date=21 December 2000 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907212930/http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/protocol/wom1242.htm |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it has 80 signatories and 109 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women |publisher=UN OHCHR |accessdate=2009-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520040105/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=20 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Controversy around CEDAW comes from two opposite directions: social and religious [[conservative]]s which claim that CEDAW is seeking to impose a [[Liberalism|liberal]], [[Progressivism|progressive]], [[Feminism|feminist]] standard on countries, in detriment of [[traditional values]]; and [[radical feminists]], who are skeptical of the power, or even desire, of CEDAW to radically transform societies and truly liberate women, and claim that CEDAW adheres to a form of weak [[liberal feminism]] similar to other mainstream organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/10/2/512/666068/Gender-and-democratic-citizenship-the-impact-of&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511154106/http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=iclc_papers |archivedate=11 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015119/http://femequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-Does-the-CEDAW-Address-the-Problem-of-Culture-and-Tradition.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dance criticism''' in the United States is the act of producing a written or spoken review of a [[performance dance|dance]] performance (often [[ballet]], [[modern dance]], or [[contemporary dance]]). The term may also refer to the report itself, which may act as an archived review, critique, or highlight. As with other topics, dance criticism may employ its own [[technical language]], and may also reflect the critic's opinions. Major newspapers cover the arts in some form and dance criticism may be included.  Dance criticism is available in other types of media as well, such as online publishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1236568/decoding-the-phantasmagoria-of-wayne-mcgregors-tree-of-codes|title=Decoding the phantasmagoria of Wayne McGregor's 'Tree of Codes'|last=Daris|first=Gabriella|date=15 September 2015|work=Blouin Artinfo|access-date=March 3, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, through blogs, websites, and online videos. 

==Current dance critics==
Throughout the 20th century dance critiques were primarily available through newspaper and magazine writing.  With the improvement of technology criticism has become increasingly available through social media platforms and blogs.  This has heavily influenced the way the general public views dance art forms.

'''Digital Life''' is a research and educational program about radically rethinking of the [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interactive experience]]. It integrates [[digital world]] (information &amp; services) and physical world (physical objects/environment). It makes interfaces more responsive and proactive (objects &amp; environments monitor user and (proactively) present information &amp; services relevant to user’s current needs/interests)

The program is to use [[information technology]] to augment physical environments and objects around the people that can draw attention. When one is walking around town, for example, the system points out buildings/places of particular interest to a user. The program is also to augment reality in order to provide a composite view for the participants: a mix of a real scene with the virtual scene that augments the digital environment with interactive information.

The Program was originally initiated by [[MIT Media Lab]] as: Digital Life is a multi-sponsor, Lab-wide research consortium that conducts basic research on technologies and techniques that spur expression as well as social and economic activity. They first explore the design and scalability of agile, grassroots communications systems that incorporate a growing understanding of emergent social behaviors in a [[digital world]]; the second considers a cognitive architecture that can support many features of “human intelligent thinking” and its expressive and economic use; and the third extends the idea of inclusive design to immersive, affective, and biological interfaces and actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8936">In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[partial differential equations]], '''Duhamel's principle''' is a general method for obtaining solutions to [[homogeneous differential equation|inhomogeneous]] linear evolution equations like the [[heat equation]], [[wave equation]], and [[vibrating plate]] equation. It is named after [[Jean-Marie Duhamel]] who first applied the principle to the inhomogeneous heat equation that models, for instance, the distribution of heat in a thin plate which is heated from beneath. For linear evolution equations without spatial dependency, such as a [[harmonic oscillator]], Duhamel's principle reduces to the method of [[variation of parameters]] technique for solving linear inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritz John, "Partial Differential Equations', New York, Springer-Verlag, 1982, 4th ed., 0387906096&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy underlying Duhamel's principle is that it is possible to go from solutions of the [[Cauchy problem]] (or initial value problem) to solutions of the inhomogeneous problem. Consider, for instance, the example of the heat equation modeling the distribution of heat energy ''u'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The initial value problem is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) - \Delta u(x,t) = 0 &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = g(x) &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the initial heat distribution. By contrast, the inhomogeneous problem for the heat equation is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -\Delta u(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in \mathbf{R}^n\times (0,\infty)\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in \mathbf{R}^n
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
corresponds to adding an external heat energy ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'',''t'')''dt'' at each point. Intuitively, one can think of the inhomogeneous problem as a set of homogeneous problems each starting afresh at a different time slice ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. By linearity, one can add up (integrate) the resulting solutions through time ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and obtain the solution for the inhomogeneous problem. This is the essence of Duhamel's principle.

==General considerations==
Formally, consider a linear inhomogeneous evolution equation for a function 
:&lt;math&gt;u:D\times(0,\infty)\to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;
with spatial domain ''D'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t(x,t) -Lu(x,t) = f(x,t) &amp;(x,t)\in D\times (0,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,0) = 0 &amp; x\in D,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''L'' is a linear differential operator that involves no time derivatives.

Duhamel's principle is, formally, that the solution to this problem is
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \int_0^t (P^sf)(x,t)\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;fnof;'' is the solution of the problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
u_t - Lu = 0 &amp; (x,t)\in D\times (s,\infty)\\
u|_{\partial D} = 0 &amp;\\
u(x,s) = f(x,s) &amp; x\in D.
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
The integrand is the retarded solution &lt;math&gt;P^sf&lt;/math&gt;, evaluated at time ''t'', representing the effect, at the later time ''t'', of an infinitesimal force &lt;math&gt;f(x,s)\,ds&lt;/math&gt; applied at time ''s''.

Duhamel's principle also holds for linear systems (with vector-valued functions ''u''), and this in turn furnishes a generalization to higher ''t'' derivatives, such as those appearing in the wave equation (see below). Validity of the principle depends on being able to solve the homogeneous problem in an appropriate function space and that the solution should exhibit reasonable dependence on parameters so that the integral is well-defined. Precise analytic conditions on ''u'' and ''f'' depend on the particular application.

==Examples==

===Wave equation===
The linear wave equation models the displacement ''u'' of an idealized dispersionless one-dimensional string, in terms of derivatives with respect to time ''t'' and space ''x'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=f(x,t).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f''(''x'',''t''), in natural units, represents an external force applied to string at the position (''x'',''t'').  In order to be a suitable physical model for nature, it should be possible to solve it for any initial state that the string is in, specified by its initial displacement and velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,0)=u_0(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,0)=v_0(x).&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, we should be able to solve the equation with data specified on any ''t'' = ''constant'' slice:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,T)=u_T(x),\qquad \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,T)=v_T(x).&lt;/math&gt;

To evolve a solution from any given time slice ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'', the contribution of the force must be added to the solution.  That contribution comes from changing the velocity of the string by ''f''(''x'',''T'')''dT''.  That is, to get the solution at time ''T''+''dT'' from the solution at time ''T'', we must add to it a new (forward) solution of the ''homogeneous'' (no external forces) wave equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}-c^2\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial x^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

with the initial conditions

:&lt;math&gt;U(x,T)=0,\qquad \frac{\partial U}{\partial t}(x,T)=f(x,T)dT.&lt;/math&gt;

A solution to this equation is achieved by straightforward integration:

:&lt;math&gt; U(x,t) = \left(\frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\right)\,dT&lt;/math&gt;

(The expression in parenthesis is just &lt;math&gt;P^Tf(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; in the notation of the general method above.) So a solution of the original initial value problem is obtained by starting with a solution to the problem with the same prescribed initial values problem but with ''zero'' external force, and adding to that (integrating) the contributions from the added force in the time intervals from ''T'' to ''T''+''dT'':

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[u_0(x+ct)+ u_0(x-ct)\right]+ \frac{1}{2c}\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} v_0(y) dy + \frac{1}{2c}\int_0^t\int_{x-c(t-T)}^{x+c(t-T)} f(\xi,T)\,d\xi\,dT.&lt;/math&gt;

===Constant-coefficient linear ODE===
Duhamel's principle is the result that the solution to an inhomogeneous, linear, partial differential equation can be solved by first finding the solution for a step input, and then superposing using [[Duhamel's integral]].
Suppose we have a constant coefficient, m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order inhomogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]].

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)u(t) = F(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t^j u(0) = 0, \; 0 \leq j \leq m-1 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) := a_m \partial_t^m + \cdots + a_1 \partial_t + a_0,\; a_m \neq 0. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First let ''G'' solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t)G = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0) = 0, \quad 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt; H = G \chi_{[0,\infty)} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\chi_{[0,\infty)}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] of the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t) H = \delta &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; u(t) = (H \ast F)(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau)F(t-\tau)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau)F(\tau)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the ODE.

===Constant-coefficient linear PDE===
More generally, suppose we have a constant coefficient inhomogeneous [[partial differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,D_x)u(t,x) = F(t,x) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; D_x = \frac{1}{i} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce this to the solution of a homogeneous ODE using the following method. All steps are done formally, ignoring necessary requirements for the solution to be well defined.

First, taking the [[Fourier transform]] in ''x'' we have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)\hat u(t,\xi) = \hat F(t,\xi).&lt;/math&gt;

Assume that &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; is an m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order ODE in ''t''. Let &lt;math&gt;a_m &lt;/math&gt; be the coefficient of the highest order term of &lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt;.
Now for every &lt;math&gt;\xi &lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;G(t,\xi) &lt;/math&gt; solve

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi)G(t,\xi) = 0, \; \partial^j_t G(0,\xi) = 0 \; \mbox{ for } 0\leq j \leq m-2, \; \partial_t^{m-1} G(0,\xi) = 1/a_m. &lt;/math&gt;

Define &lt;math&gt;H(t,\xi) = G(t,\xi) \chi_{[0,\infty)}(t) &lt;/math&gt;. We then have

:&lt;math&gt; P(\partial_t,\xi) H(t,\xi) = \delta(t) &lt;/math&gt;

in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]]. Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; \hat u(t,\xi) = (H(\cdot,\xi) \ast \hat F(\cdot,\xi))(t) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_0^\infty G(\tau,\xi)F(t-\tau,\xi)\,d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^t G(t-\tau,\xi)F(\tau,\xi)\, d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

solves the PDE (after transforming back to ''x'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4725">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic topology]], the '''Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms''' are properties that [[homology theory|homology theories]] of [[topological space]]s have in common. The quintessential example of a homology theory satisfying the axioms is [[singular homology]], developed by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] and [[Norman Steenrod]].

One can define a homology theory as a [[sequence]] of [[functor]]s satisfying the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. The axiomatic approach, which was developed in 1945, allows one to prove results, such as the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]], that are common to all homology theories satisfying the axioms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.uiuc.edu/K-theory/0245/survey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

If one omits the dimension axiom (described below), then the remaining axioms define what is called an [[extraordinary homology theory]]. Extraordinary cohomology theories first arose in [[K-theory]] and [[cobordism theory|cobordism]].

==Formal definition==

The Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms apply to a sequence of functors &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[topological pair|pairs]] (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') of topological spaces to the category of abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, together with a [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;\partial : H_{i}(X, A) \to H_{i-1}(A)&lt;/math&gt; called the '''boundary map''' (here ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is a shorthand for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'',∅)). The axioms are:

# '''Homotopy''': Homotopic maps induce the same map in homology. That is, if  &lt;math&gt;g:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt; is [[homotopic]] to &lt;math&gt;h:(X, A) \rightarrow (Y,B)&lt;/math&gt;, then their induced [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] are the same.
# '''[[Excision theorem|Excision]]''': If (''X'',&amp;nbsp;''A'') is a pair and ''U'' is a subset of ''X'' such that the closure of ''U'' is contained in the interior of ''A'', then the inclusion map &lt;math&gt;i : (X-U, A-U) \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt; induces an [[isomorphism]] in homology.
# '''Dimension''': Let ''P'' be the one-point space; then &lt;math&gt;H_n(P) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Additivity''': If &lt;math&gt;X = \coprod_{\alpha}{X_{\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;, the disjoint union of a family of topological spaces &lt;math&gt;X_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H_n(X) \cong \bigoplus_{\alpha} H_n(X_{\alpha}).&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Exactness''': Each pair ''(X, A)'' induces a [[long exact sequence]] in homology, via the inclusions &lt;math&gt;i: A \to X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j: X \to (X, A)&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt; \cdots \to H_n(A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! i_*} H_n(X) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\! j_*} H_n (X,A) \to^{\!\!\!\!\!\!\partial} H_{n-1}(A) \to \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

If ''P'' is the one point space then  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'') is called the '''coefficient group'''. For example, singular homology (taken with integer coefficients, as is most common) has as coefficients the integers.

==Consequences==

Some facts about homology groups can be derived directly from the axioms, such as the fact that homotopically equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology groups.

The homology of some relatively simple spaces, such as ''n''-[[sphere]]s, can be calculated directly from the axioms. From this it can be easily shown that the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-sphere is not a [[retract]] of the ''n''-disk. This is used in a proof of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]].

==Dimension axiom==

A "homology-like" theory satisfying all of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms except the dimension axiom is called an '''[[extraordinary homology theory]]''' (dually, '''[[extraordinary cohomology theory]]'''). Important examples of these were found in the 1950s, such as [[topological K-theory]] and [[cobordism theory]], which are extraordinary ''co''homology theories, and come with homology theories dual to them.

In [[differential geometry]], the '''Einstein tensor''' (named after [[Albert Einstein]]; also known as the '''trace-reversed [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]]''') is used to express the [[curvature]] of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. In [[general relativity]], it occurs in the [[Einstein field equations]] for [[gravitation]] that describe [[spacetime]] curvature in a manner consistent with energy and momentum conservation.

== Definition ==
The Einstein tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tensor]] of order 2 defined over [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  In [[index-free notation]] it is defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{R}-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{g}R,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci tensor, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]]. In component form, the previous equation reads as

::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over2} g_{\mu\nu}R .&lt;/math&gt;

The Einstein tensor is symmetric
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = G_{\nu\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

and, like the [[stress–energy tensor]], divergenceless
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu G^{\mu\nu} = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

== Explicit form ==
The Ricci tensor depends only on the metric tensor, so the Einstein tensor can be defined directly with just the metric tensor. However, this  expression is complex and rarely quoted in textbooks.  The complexity of this expression can be shown using the formula for the Ricci tensor in terms of [[Christoffel symbols]]:

::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
G_{\alpha\beta} &amp;= R_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} R \\
&amp;= R_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} g^{\gamma\zeta} R_{\gamma\zeta} \\
&amp;= (\delta^\gamma_\alpha \delta^\zeta_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta}) R_{\gamma\zeta} \\
&amp;= (\delta^\gamma_\alpha \delta^\zeta_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta})(\Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\zeta,\epsilon} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\epsilon,\zeta} + \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\epsilon\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\gamma\zeta} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\zeta\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\epsilon\gamma}),  \\
G^{\alpha\beta} &amp;= (g^{\alpha\gamma} g^{\beta\zeta} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha\beta}g^{\gamma\zeta})(\Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\zeta,\epsilon} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\gamma\epsilon,\zeta} + \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\epsilon\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\gamma\zeta} - \Gamma^\epsilon{}_{\zeta\sigma} \Gamma^\sigma{}_{\epsilon\gamma}),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker tensor]] and the Christoffel symbol &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

::&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\alpha{}_{\beta\gamma} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha\epsilon}(g_{\beta\epsilon,\gamma} + g_{\gamma\epsilon,\beta} - g_{\beta\gamma,\epsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

Before cancellations, this formula results in &lt;math&gt;2 \times (6+6+9+9) = 60&lt;/math&gt; individual terms. Cancellations bring this number down somewhat. &lt;!-- exactly how much? --&gt;

In the special case of a locally [[inertial reference frame]] near a point, the first derivatives of the metric tensor vanish and the component form of the Einstein tensor is considerably simplified:

:: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}G_{\alpha\beta} &amp; = g^{\gamma\mu}\bigl[ g_{\gamma[\beta,\mu]\alpha} + g_{\alpha[\mu,\beta]\gamma} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha\beta} g^{\epsilon\sigma} (g_{\epsilon[\mu,\sigma]\gamma} + g_{\gamma[\sigma,\mu]\epsilon})\bigr] \\ &amp; = g^{\gamma\mu} (\delta^\epsilon_\alpha \delta^\sigma_\beta - \frac{1}{2} g^{\epsilon\sigma}g_{\alpha\beta})(g_{\epsilon[\mu,\sigma]\gamma} + g_{\gamma[\sigma,\mu]\epsilon}),\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where square brackets conventionally denote [[Antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]] over bracketed indices, i.e.

:: &lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha[\beta,\gamma]\epsilon} \, = \frac{1}{2} (g_{\alpha\beta,\gamma\epsilon} - g_{\alpha\gamma,\beta\epsilon}).&lt;/math&gt;

== Trace ==
The [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the Einstein tensor can be computed by [[Tensor contraction|contract]]ing the equation in the [[#Definition|definition]] with the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. In &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions (of arbitrary signature):

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}g^{\mu\nu}G_{\mu\nu} &amp;= g^{\mu\nu}R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over2} g^{\mu\nu}g_{\mu\nu}R \\ G &amp;= R - {1\over2} (nR) \\ G &amp;= {{2-n}\over2}R\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The special case of n = 4 dimensions in physics (3 space, 1 time) gives &lt;math&gt;G\,&lt;/math&gt;, the trace of the Einstein tensor, as the negative of &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Ricci tensor]]'s trace. Thus another name for the Einstein tensor is the ''trace-reversed Ricci tensor''.

== Use in general relativity ==

The Einstein tensor allows the [[Einstein field equations]] (without a [[cosmological constant]]) to be written in the concise form:
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

which becomes in [[geometrized units]] (i.e. ''c'' = [[Gravitational constant|''G'']] (i.e. the Newton's gravitational constant and not the trace of the Einstein tensor) = 1),
::&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = 8 \pi \, T_{\mu\nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

From the [[#Explicit form|explicit form of the Einstein tensor]], the Einstein tensor is a [[nonlinear]] function of the metric tensor, but is linear in the second [[partial derivative]]s of the metric. As a symmetric order-2 tensor, the Einstein tensor has 10 independent components in a 4-dimensional space. It follows that the Einstein field equations are a set of 10 [[Types of differential equations|quasilinear]] second-order partial differential equations for the metric tensor.

The [[contracted Bianchi identities]] can also be easily expressed with the aid of the Einstein tensor:
::&lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\mu} G^{\mu\nu} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The (contracted) Bianchi identities automatically ensure the covariant conservation of the [[stress–energy tensor]] in curved spacetimes:
::&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu\nu} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The physical significance of the Einstein tensor is highlighted by this identity. In terms of the densitized stress tensor contracted on a [[Killing vector]] &lt;math&gt;\xi^\mu&lt;/math&gt;, an ordinary conservation law holds:
::&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu}(\sqrt{-g} T^\mu{}_\nu \xi^\nu) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uniqueness==
[[David Lovelock]] has shown that, in a four-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]], the Einstein tensor is the only [[tensor]]ial and [[divergence]]-free function of the &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and at most their first and second partial derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''etheric plane''' (see also ''[[etheric body]]'') is a term introduced into [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant]] to represent the subtle part of the lower [[plane (cosmology)|plane]] of existence. It represents the fourth [higher] subplane of the [[physical plane]] (a [[hyperplane]]), the lower three being the states of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gaseous]] matter. The idea was later used by authors such as [[Alice Bailey]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Walter John Kilner]] and others.

The term '''aether''' (also written as "ether") was adopted from ancient [[Greek philosophy]] and science into Victorian physics (see [[Luminiferous aether]]) and utilised by [[Madame Blavatsky]] to correspond to [[akasha]], the fifth element ([[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]) of [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu metaphysics]]. 

The Greek word ''aither'' derives from an Indo-European [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''aith''- ("burn, shine"). Blavatsky also related the idea to the Hindu ''[[Prana]]'' principle,&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H.P., ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'', 1889&lt;/ref&gt; the [[vitalism|vital]], life-sustaining force of living beings, present in all natural processes of the universe. Prana was first expounded in the [[Upanishads]], where it is part of the worldly, physical realm, sustaining the body and the mind. Blavatsky also tended to use the word "astral" indiscriminately for these supposed subtle physical phenomena. The esoteric concepts of [[Adi (metaphysical plane)|Adi]], the [[Buddhic plane]], the [[causal plane]], and the [[monadic plane]] are also related to that of the etheric plane.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Leadbeater (1912 - 1937), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=H1H1ZLTmWPsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Textbook+of+Theosophy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLr7joy8jKAhXKnYMKHUniD00Q6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=plane&amp;f=false A Textbook of Theosophy]'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912 - 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadbeater and Besant&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie. ''Man's life in this and other worlds'', Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; (both belonging to the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar School of Theosophy]]) conceived that the etheric plane constituted four higher subplanes of the [[physical plane]]. According to the Theosophist Geoffrey A. Farthing, Leadbeater used the term, because of its resonance in the physical sciences, to describe his clairvoyant investigations of sub-atomic physics.&lt;ref&gt;Farthing, Geoffrey A., ''[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/metaphys/etheric.htm The Etheric Double:The Far-Reaching Effects of a false Assumption]'', from a booklet in private circulation dated June 1995, reprinted from ''Theosophy World''&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Christian Rosicrucians==

Similarly according to the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucian]] writings of American occultist and mystic [[Max Heindel]]&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter III: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rms/rmseng01.htm#Chapter_III The Visible and the Invisible Worlds])'', 1911, {{ISBN|0-911274-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is - in addition to the solids, liquids, and gases which compose the ''Chemical Region'' of the Physical World - a finer grade of [[matter]] called ether that permeates the [[subatomic|atomic]] structure of the earth and its [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It is disposed in four grades of [[density]] and is considered to be a kind of physical matter (the blue haze seen in mountain canyons is said to be in fact ether of the kind known to occult investigators as ''chemical ether''). Associated there is also a type of [[Clairvoyance|spiritual sight]], that man will eventually develop, called ''etheric vision''.&lt;ref&gt;A Student, ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/evw/evweng01.htm Etheric Vision and What It Reveals]'', {{ISBN|0-911274-59-6}}, 110 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Ether is reported to be of four kinds, or grades of density in our planet [[Earth]]; their names (from the lowest or most dense to the highest or most subtle one) and their relation to the human being, from the point of view of these [[Esoteric Christian]] teachings, is as following:&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''[[The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception]] (Chapter I.2, [http://www.rosicrucian.com/rcc/rcceng01.htm#part2 The Etheric Region of the Physical World])'', 1909, {{ISBN|0-911274-34-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the "Chemical Ether": both positive and negative in manifestation and it is related to the [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] and [[excretion]] processes;
* the "Life Ether": has also a positive and negative pole and it is related to the forces of [[biological reproduction|propagation]];
* the "Light Ether": the positive pole is related to forces which generate [[blood heat]] in the higher species of animal and in the human being and the negative is related to the forces which operate through the [[senses]] (passive functions of sight, hearing, feeling, tasting, and smelling);
* the "Reflective Ether": the medium through which [[Mental body|thought]] makes an impression upon the human [[brain]] and this ether contains pictures which work as reflections of the [[Akashic records|Memory of Nature]] found at the [[Mental plane|World of Thought]].

{{Descartes}}

The '''evil demon''', also known as '''malicious demon'''&lt;ref name="Cottingham 1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cottingham | first=John | title=René Descartes: Meditations on First Philosophy with Selections from the Objections and Replies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1996 | isbn=0-521-55818-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''evil genius''',&lt;ref name="Ariew et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ariew | first=Roger | last2=Cress | first2=Donald | title=René Descartes: Meditations, Objections, and Replies | publisher=Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. | location=Indianapolis/Cambridge | year=2006 | isbn=0-87220-798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[philosophy]]. In the [[first Meditation|first]] of his 1641 ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] imagines that an evil [[demon]], of "utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me." This evil demon is imagined to present a complete illusion of an external world, so that Descartes can say, "I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to ensnare my judgement. I shall consider myself as not having hands or eyes, or flesh, or blood or senses, but as falsely believing that I have all these things."

Some Cartesian scholars opine that the demon is also [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and thus capable of altering mathematics and the fundamentals of logic, though omnipotence of the evil demon would be contrary to Descartes' hypothesis, as he rebuked accusations of the evil demon having omnipotence.&lt;ref name=Musgrave&gt;{{cite book|title=Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge|author=Alan E. Musgrave|pages=202|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43625-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Janowski&gt;{{cite book|title=Cartesian Theodicy: Descartes' Quest for Certitude|author=Zbigniew Janowski|pages=62–68|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-6127-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of several methods of [[Cartesian doubt|systematic doubt]] that Descartes employs in the ''Meditations.''&lt;ref name=Musgrave /&gt;

==In context==
Prior to the Meditations proper, Descartes gives a synopsis of each Meditation and says of Meditation One that "reasons are provided which give us possible grounds for doubt about all things, especially material things" and that whilst the usefulness of such extensive doubt may not be immediately apparent, "its greatest benefit lies in 
*freeing us from all our preconceived opinions, and 
*providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses. 
The eventual result of this doubt is to 
*make it impossible for us to have any further doubts about what we subsequently discover to be true."

Descartes offers some standard reasons for doubting the reliability of the senses culminating in the dream argument and then extends this with the deceiving God argument. Descartes refers to "the long-standing opinion that there is an omnipotent God who made me the kind of creature that I am" and suggests that this God may have "brought it about that there is no earth, no sky, no extended thing, no shape, no size, no place, while at the same time ensuring that all these things appear to me to exist just as they do now?" Furthermore, this God may have "brought it about that I too go wrong every time I add two and three or count the sides of a square, or in some even simpler matter, if that is imaginable".

After the deceiving God argument Descartes concludes that he is "compelled to admit that there is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not properly be raised". {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It is only after arriving at this conclusion that Descartes introduces the evil demon.

Although Descartes has provided arguments for doubting all his former beliefs he notes that "my habitual opinions keep coming back". It is to deal with this problem that Descartes decides he must do more than just acknowledge that the beliefs are open to doubt and must deceive himself, "by pretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly false and imaginary" and that he shall do this "until the weight of preconceived opinion is counter-balanced and the distorting influence of habit no longer prevents my judgement from perceiving things correctly".

It is to achieve this state of denial that Descartes says he will suppose that "some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me".

The evil demon is also mentioned at the beginning of Meditation Two. Descartes says that if there is "a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me" then he himself must undoubtedly exist for the deceiver can "never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something". A little later he says, "But what shall I now say that I am, when I am supposing that there is some supremely powerful and, if it is permissible to say so, malicious deceiver, who is deliberately trying to trick me in every way he can?"

==The deceiving god==
Some writers, e.g. Williams&lt;ref name="Williams 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Williams | first=Bernard | title=Descartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry (Routledge Classics | publisher=Routledge | location=Cambridge | year=1996 | isbn=1-138-01918-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Musgrave,&lt;ref name="Musgrave 1993"&gt;{{cite book | last=Musgrave | first=Alan | title=Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1993 | isbn=0-521-43625-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; make no distinction between the deceiving God and evil demon arguments and regard anything said about the deceiving God as being equivalent to saying something about the evil demon.

Other writers acknowledge that Descartes makes mention of both but then claim they are 'epistemologically equivalent'. Kenny&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kenny | first=Anthony | title=Descartes A Study of his Philosophy | publisher=Random House | location=New York | year=1968 | isbn=0-394-30665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} says, "the two hypotheses do not differ in any respect of epistemological importance... The content of the two hypotheses is the same..." Newman &lt;ref name="Newman 2016"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Newman |first=Lex |editor-last= Zalta|editor-first= Edward|encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title= Descartes' Epistemology|url= https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/descartes-epistemology/|accessdate= 10 July 2017|edition= Winter 2016 |year= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; says, "Descartes' official position is that the Evil Genius Doubt is merely one among multiple hypotheses that can motivate the more general hyperbolic doubt... Even so, I regularly speak in terms of the evil genius... as a kind of mnemonic for the more general doubt about our cognitive nature."

If they are epistemologically equivalent then the question arises as to why Descartes temporarily shifted from the deceiving God to the evil demon. It is tempting to think it is because there is a relevant theological difference. In Meditation Three Descartes is going to establish not only that there is a God but that God is not a deceiver. When Descartes first introduces the evil demon he says, "I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon." Kenny says, "The hypothesis of the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} However, at least in Meditation One, Descartes doesn't have a problem in postulating a deceiving God and he rejects the objection that such deception is inconsistent with God's supreme goodness. He says, "if it were inconsistent with his goodness to have created me such that I am deceived all the time, it would seem equally foreign to his goodness to allow me to be deceived even occasionally; yet this last assertion cannot be made." This is consistent with what he writes in the ''Principles'' where he says, "we have been told that God who created us can do all that he desires, and we do not yet know whether he may not have willed to create us in such a way that we shall always be deceived even in the things that we think ourselves to know best."

Other writers insist that it is important to maintain the distinction between the deceiving God and the evil demon. Gouhier (quoted by Kenny) argues that the deceiving God is an intellectual scruple that will disappear when metaphysics demonstrates its falsity whilst the evil demon is a methodological procedure designed to make a certain experiment and it ceases with that experiment. He says, "Neither the purpose nor the content of the two hypotheses allow us to regard the one as a variant of the other."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

Vendler argues that literary form of the Meditations is heavily influenced by  St. Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises to which Descartes will have been exposed during his training at the Jesuit college of La Fleche. As such, "The demon in the First Meditation is not evoked to serve as an epistomological menace, but as a psychological device: following Loyola's advice ''age contra!'' (go against!), it provides a counterweight to our inordinate inclination to trust the senses."&lt;ref name="Vendler 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Zeno |last=Vendler |title=Descartes' Exercises |journal=Canadian Journal of Philosophy |volume=19 |issue=2| date=June 1989 |pages=193–224 |jstor=40231645}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} He adds, "the 'demon-argument' is not an argument at all. Descartes does not need another argument at this stage: the dream argument has already shown the unreliability of the senses and the deceiver-God argument the uncertainty of mathematics. For one thing, the demon does not even touch mathematics or geometry. Why should he? He is evoked by Descartes to cure his inordinate attachment to the senses; he does not complain (and would not) of a similar attachment to mathematics or geometry."&lt;ref name="Vendler 1989" /&gt;{{rp|204}} Hatfield takes a similar line saying, "Descartes adopts a common practice from the spiritual exercises upon which his metaphysical meditations are modelled, devising a program for training the will to keep the old beliefs at bay"&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hatfield | first=Gary | title=Descartes and the Meditations | publisher=Routledge | location=London | year=2003 | isbn=0-415-11193-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}} adding, "It seems likely that he chose to call his hypothetical deceiver a "malicious demon" in order to avoid having the meditator concentrate extensively on the thought that God could be a deceiver, a proposition he considered false and one he intended to refute later."&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003" /&gt;{{rp|88}}

==Omnipotence==
{{further|Theodicy|Dystheism}}
Among the accusations of [[blasphemy]] made against Descartes by [[Protestant]]s was that he was positing an omnipotent [[malevolent God]]. [[Voetius]] accused Descartes of blasphemy in 1643.  [[Jacques Triglandius]] and [[Jacobus Revius]], theologians at [[Leiden University]], made similar accusations in 1647, accusing Descartes of "hold[ing] God to be a deceiver", a position that they stated to be "contrary to the glory of God".  Descartes was threatened with having his views condemned by a [[synod]], but this was prevented by the intercession of the [[Prince of Orange]] (at the request of the French Ambassador [[Abel Servien|Servien]]).&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

The accusations referenced a passage in the ''First Meditation'' where Descartes stated that he supposed not an optimal God but rather an evil demon "[[wikt:summe|summe]] [[wikt:potens|potens]] &amp; [[wikt:callidus|callidus]]" (translated as "most highly powerful and cunning").  The accusers identified Descartes' concept of a ''deus deceptor'' with his concept of an evil demon, stating that only an omnipotent God is "summe potens" and that describing the evil demon as such thus demonstrated the identity. Descartes' response to the accusations was that in that passage he had been expressly distinguishing between "the supremely good God, the source of truth, on the one hand, and the malicious demon on the other".  He did not directly rebut the charge of implying that the evil demon was omnipotent, but asserted that simply describing something with "some attribute that in reality belongs only to God" does not mean that that something is being held to actually ''be'' a supreme God.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;

According to Janowski, "The alleged distinction between the respective powers of God and the evil genius that escaped the attention of the two theologians also escaped the attention of a host of distinguished Cartesian scholars ([[Ferdinand Alquié|Alquié]], Beck, [[Émile Bréhier|Brehier]], Chevalier, Frankfurt, [[Étienne Gilson|Gilson]], [[Anthony Kenny|Kenny]], Laporte, Kemp-Smith, Wilson), who, only seldom interested in interpreting Descartes' philosophy through the prism of doctrinal orthodoxy, also insist on the omnipotence of the evil genius." &lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|65}} He further claims that the reason for this is that there is progression through the ''First Meditation'', leading to the introduction of the concept of the evil genius "which crowns the process begun at the outset of the Meditations."&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|65}}

However, it is not quite so straightforward. For example, Wilson notes that "Gouhier has shown, the hypothesis of the malign spirit takes  over from that of the Deceiving God from the end of the First Meditation to the beginning of the Third—where the latter figure is resubstituted without comment or explanation. As Gouhier has also noted, the summary of 'doubts' in the concluding passage ... does not include mention of mathematical propositions—which are not again brought into discussion until the Third Meditation."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1960"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilson | first=Margaret | title=Descartes | publisher=Popular Prakashan Private Ltd | location=Bombay | year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} She adds in the accompanying footnote that, even if one has to concede that the text doesn't reveal any sharp distinction between the power hypothetically ascribed to the 'malignant spirit' and that genuinely attributable to God, "Gouhier's observation is essentially accurate, and useful in understanding the rhetoric and organization of the first three Meditations. It may also have some deeper significance, because of the association ... of the possibility of deception in mathematics with the doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths."&lt;ref name="Wilson 1960" /&gt;{{rp|226}}

Similarly, Kenny who does say the evil genius is substituted for that of the deceitful God "simply because it is less offensive and less patently incoherent. The content of the two hypotheses is the same, namely that an omnipotent deceiver is trying to deceive."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} goes on to note that, "If the two hypostheses differ at all, it is the first that is more skeptical than the second. God...may have made him go wrong in mathematics...the evil genius merely reinforces the doubt that the external world may be a dream."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|36}} When Kenny says the evil genius is simply a substitute for the deceitful God he is not trying to establish that, therefore, the evil genius was omnipotent, instead he is challenging the view that evil genius somehow progressed on from God and is rejecting the view that "the evil genius is to serve a more radically skeptical purpose than the hypothesis of the deceitful God."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

According to Janowski, the fact that the demon is not said to challenge mathematics, implies either that the evil demon is not omnipotent or that Descartes retracted Universal Doubt.  Janowski notes that in the ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (I, 15) Descartes states that [[Cartesian doubt|Universal Doubt]] applies even to "the demonstration of mathematics", and so concludes that either Descartes' ''Meditation'' is flawed, lacking a reason for doubting mathematics, or that the charges of blasphemy were well placed, and Descartes ''was'' supposing an omnipotent evil demon.&lt;ref name=Janowski /&gt;{{rp|67}}

However, this is only a problem if one assumes that Descartes was withdrawing the notion of a deceitful God and replacing it with the evil demon. More recent commentators take the argument to have reached its conclusion with the deceitful God. When Descartes says, "I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon ..."&lt;ref name="Cottingham 1996" /&gt;{{rp|15}} he is not rejecting the notion of a deceitful God on the grounds that God is not a deceiver for this is something he is not entitled to rely on because, as he says at the beginning of Meditation three, he doesn't "yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all". Instead, he is introducing an aid to the meditator who finds that, despite the arguments presented, "habitual opinions keep coming back". Kenny says, "The purpose of taking seriously the hypothesis of the evil genius is to counterbalance natural credulity and keep in mind the doubts raised by the supposition of the deceitful God."&lt;ref name="Kenny 1993" /&gt;{{rp|35}} When the role of the demon is understood this way the issue of the demon's omnipotence becomes unimportant.

==The brain in a vat==
{{Main|Brain in a vat}}
In 1968 James Cornman and Keith Lehrer suggested something they called the braino machine that "operates by influencing the brain of a subject who wears a special cap, called a "braino cap." When the braino cap is placed on a subject's head, the operator of the braino can affect his brain so as to produce any hallucination in the subject that the operator wishes. The braino is a hallucination-producing machine. The hallucinations produced by it may be as complete, systematic, and coherent as the operator of the braino desires to make them."&lt;ref name="Cornman et al. 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornman | first=James | last2=Lehrer | first2=Keith | title=Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction | publisher=The Macmillan Company | location=New York and London | year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} The braino argument was intended to show that, even if it is sometimes possible to tell when we are hallucinating, it is not possible to know that we are not hallucinating. If the braino is operated by an evil being (whom Cornman and Lehrer call Dr. O) then it would be possible for Dr. O to create in me experiences that are identical to the ones I am having now. If that were the case then the experiences so created would not constitute knowledge for the source of those experiences would be the machine and not the world. However, since they are indistinguishable from my current experiences it follows that my current experiences are also insufficient to generate knowledge.

In 1973 in the introduction to his book ''Thought'', Gilbert Harman said, "it might be suggested that you have not the slightest reason to believe that you are in the surroundings you suppose you are in ... various hypotheses could explain how things look and feel. You might be sound asleep and dreaming or a playful brain surgeon might be giving you these experiences by stimulating your cortex in a special way. You might really be stretched out on a table in his laboratory with wires running into your head from a large computer. Perhaps you have always been on that table. Perhaps you are quite a different person from what you seem..."&lt;ref name="Harman 1973"&gt;{{cite book | last=Harman | first=Gilbert | title=Thought | publisher=Princeton University Press | location=Princeton and London | year=1973 | isbn=0-69101-986-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Such scenarios had been used many times in science fiction but in philosophy it is now routine to refer to being like a 'brain in a vat' after Hilary Putnam produced an argument which, ironically, purported to show that "the supposition that we are actually brains in a vat, although it violates no physical law, and is perfectly consistent with everything we have experienced, cannot possibly be true. ''It cannot possibly be true'', because it is, in a certain way, self-refuting."&lt;ref name="Putnam 1981"&gt;{{cite book | last=Putnam | first=Hilary | title=Reason, Truth, and History | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=1981 | isbn=0-52129-776-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}

Putnam's argument notwithstanding, the brain in a vat scenario is usually presented as a sceptical argument and in many ways equivalent to Descartes' deceiving God and evil demon.

One crucial difference that prevents such scenarios being a direct substitute for the deceiving God and evil demon is that they generally presuppose that we have heads or bodies whereas it is important for Descartes to argue that he can doubt the existence of his body and that he can only be sure he is a 'thinking thing'.&lt;ref name="Musgrave 1993" /&gt;{{rp|205}}&lt;ref name="Hatfield 2003" /&gt;{{rp|81}} Harman's version of the story does, however, add the final thought that having a brain "might be just part of the myth you are being given".&lt;ref name="Harman 1973" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

'''Exoteric''' refers to knowledge that is outside, and independent from, a person's experience and can be ascertained by anyone (related to [[common sense]]). The word is derived from the comparative form of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἔξω ''eksô'', "from, out of, outside". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or [[universalism|universal]]. It is distinguished from internal [[esoteric]] knowledge. "Exoteric" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to [[secret]] or [[cabal]]istic.  It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.

== Philosophical context ==
Most philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of [[Plato]], a prominent alternate [[theory of knowledge]] insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: "All that we are arises with our thoughts"  ([[Dhammapada]] 1.1) is reminiscent of this.

In his book entitled ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', the Japanese swordsmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]] noted that when he teaches people martial arts, "since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric." &lt;ref&gt;Miyamoto Musashi. ''The Book of Five Rings.'' Translated by Thomas Cleary. Shambhala Library. Boston &amp; London. 2003. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious context ==
In the same way as the term "esoteric" is often associated with [[esotericism|esoteric spirituality]], the term "exoteric" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.

The term "exoteric" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered ''within'' the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.

==Government==
The exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of governance.

==Societies==
Many societies are divided into 2 sections—the ''exoteric'' or "public face" and the ''esoteric'' or "behind closed doors". Such are many [[fraternal organization]]s, such as [[Freemasonry]], which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cavron|first1=John T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9718">'''Feature integration theory''' is a theory of [[attention]] developed in 1980 by [[Anne Treisman]] and [[Garry Gelade]] that suggests that when perceiving a stimulus, features are "registered early, automatically, and in parallel, while objects are identified separately" and at a later stage in processing. The theory has been one of the most influential [[cognitive model|psychological model]]s of human visual [[attention]]. 

==Stages==
According to Treisman, the first stage of the feature integration theory is the preattentive stage.  During this stage, different parts of the brain automatically gather information about basic features (colors, shape, movement) that are found in the visual field. The idea that features are automatically separated appears to be counterintuitive; however, we are not aware of this process because it occurs early in perceptual processing, before we become conscious of the object.

The second stage of the feature integration theory is the focused attention stage, where the individual features of an object combine in order to perceive the whole object. In order to combine the individual features of an object, attention is required and selection of that object occurs within a "master map" of locations. The master map of locations contains all of the locations in which features have been detected, with each location in the master map having access to the multiple feature maps. When attention is focused at a particular location on the map, the features currently in that position are attended to and are stored in "object files". If the object is familiar, associations are made between the object and prior knowledge, which results in identification of that object. In support of this stage, researchers often refer to patients suffering from [[Balint's syndrome]]. Due to damage in the parietal lobe, these people are unable to focus attention on individual objects. Given a stimulus that requires combining features, people suffering from Balint's syndrome are unable to focus attention long enough to combine the features, providing support for this stage of the theory. 

[[File:FITstages.png|alt=The stages of feature integration theory|thumb|300px|The stages of feature integration theory]]

Treisman distinguishes between two kinds of visual search tasks, "feature search" and "conjunction search". Feature searches can be performed fast and pre-attentively for targets defined by only one feature, such as color, shape, perceived direction of lighting, movement, or orientation. Features should "pop out" during search and should be able to form [[illusory conjunctions]]. Conversely, conjunction searches occur with the combination of two or more features and are identified serially. Conjunction search is much slower than feature search and requires conscious attention and effort. In multiple experiments, some referenced in this article, Treisman concluded that [[color]], [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], and [[intensity (disambiguation)|intensity]] are features for which feature searches may be performed.

As a reaction to the feature integration theory, Wolfe (1994) proposed the Guided Search Model 2.0. According to this model, attention is directed to an object or location through a preattentive process. The preattentive process, as Wolfe explains, directs attention in both a bottom-up and top-down way. Information acquired through both bottom-up and top-down processing is ranked according to priority. The priority ranking ''guides'' visual search and makes the search more efficient. Whether the Guided Search Model 2.0 or the feature integration theory are "correct" theories of visual search is still a hotly debated topic.

==Experiments==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:fourshapesexp.png|thumb|alt=An example of four colored shapes and two black letters.|An example of the stimuli found in Treisman et al. (1982).]] --&gt;In order to test the notion that attention plays a vital role in visual perception, Treisman and Schmidt (1982) designed an experiment to show that features may exist independently of one another early in processing. Participants were shown a picture involving four objects hidden by two black numbers. The display was flashed for one-fifth of a second followed by a random-dot masking field that appeared on screen to eliminate "any residual perception that might remain after the stimuli were turned off".&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were to report the black numbers they saw at each location where the shapes had previously been. The results of this experiment verified Treisman and Schmidt's hypothesis. In 18% of trials, participants reported seeing shapes "made up of a combination of features from two different stimuli",&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive Psychology, E. Bruce Goldstein, P 105&lt;/ref&gt; even when the stimuli had great differences; this is often referred to as an [[illusory conjunction]]. Specifically, illusory conjunctions occur in various situations. For example, you may identify a passing person wearing a red shirt and yellow hat and very quickly transform him or her into one wearing a yellow shirt and red hat. The feature integration theory provides explanation for illusory conjunctions; because features exist independently of one another during early processing and are not associated with a specific object, they can easily be incorrectly combined both in laboratory settings, as well as in real life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Treisman, A. Cognitive Psychology 12, 97-136 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; 

As previously mentioned, Balint's syndrome patients have provided support for the feature integration theory. Particularly, Research participant R.M., a [[Bálint's syndrome]] sufferer who was unable to focus attention on individual objects, experiences illusory conjunctions when presented with simple stimuli such as a "blue O" or a "red T." In 23% of trials, even when able to view the stimulus for as long as 10 seconds, R.M. reported seeing a "red O" or a "blue T".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman-Hill et al., 1995; Robertson et al., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in accordance with feature integration theory's prediction of how one with a lack of focused attention would erroneously combine features.

[[File:treismanshapes.png|thumb|alt=The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively.|The stimuli resembling a carrot, lake and tire, respectively. Treisman et al.(1986).]]

If people use their prior knowledge or experience to perceive an object, they are less likely to make mistakes, or illusory conjunctions. In order to explain this phenomenon, Treisman and Souther (1986) conducted an experiment in which they presented three shapes to participants where illusory conjunctions could exist. Surprisingly, when she told participants that they were being shown a carrot, lake, and tire (in place of the orange triangle, blue oval, and black circle, respectively), illusory conjunctions did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Illusory words: The roles of attention and of top–down constraints in conjoining letters to form words.
By Treisman, Anne; Souther, Janet. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 12(1), Feb 1986, 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Treisman maintained that prior-knowledge played an important role in proper perception. Normally, bottom-up processing is used for identifying novel objects; but, once we recall prior knowledge, top-down processing is used. This explains why people are good at identifying familiar objects rather than unfamiliar.

==Reading==
When identifying letters while reading, not only are their shapes picked up but also other features like their colors and surrounding elements. Individual letters are processed serially when spatially conjoined with another letter. The locations of each feature of a letter are not known in advance, even while the letter is in front of the reader. Since the location of the letter's features and/or the location of the letter is unknown, feature interchanges can occur if one is not attentively focused. This is known as [[lateral masking]], which in this case, refers to a difficulty in separating a letter from the background.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Treisman and Garry Gelade (1980).

[[File:Purple_circle_100%25.svg|thumb| A purple circle is a symbol for gender neutrality, derived from the two [[gender symbols]]' colours mixed together, and without the distinguishing cross or arrow used in the gender symbols (♂ and ♀).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}]]

A '''gender-blind''' (or '''unisex''') person is someone who adheres to not distinguishing people by gender. Gender blind people generally advocate [[gender neutrality]] in society, such as activities undertaken and services provided without regard to the [[gender]] of those who participate. Those who identify as [[pansexual]] may also refer to themselves as 'gender-blind': however, pansexuality emphasizes gender-blindness in [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

== Choice of words ==
{{Main|Gender neutral language}}

''Unisex'' is an older term, and a [[misnomer]] meaning "one sex". It should not be confused with [[bisexuality]].
''Gender-blind'' however goes against most tenets of [[heteronormativity]] by not looking at gender at all.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== The National Student Genderblind Campaign ==

In 2006 the National Student Genderblind Campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genderblind.org|title=Khóa Học Kế Toán Thực Hành Uy Tín Tại TPHCM – Một trang web mới sử dụng WordPress|website=www.genderblind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a collaborative [[grassroots]] organization intended to educate [[college]] students, administrators, and others throughout the United States. The NSGC advocates for the implementation of gender-inclusive [[dormitory|dorm]] room and [[washroom|bathroom]] options.

==Mixed-gender hospital rooms==

The use of mixed-gender hospital rooms has proved controversial in both the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Miner, Shared room sparks rage,London Free Press, June 17, 2010, http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2010/06/16/14417821.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Manitoba's Health Minister, [[Theresa Oswald]], has campaigned actively against such rooms after receiving complaints from a Winnipeg patient, Ollie Ingram.&lt;ref name = Owen&gt;Bruce Owen, Oswald vows action to stop coed rooms in hospitals, Winnipeg Free Press, May 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Oswald said if humanity can "put somebody on the moon", it can find a way to honor gender requests without leading to delays for patients.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;  At the same time, some medical ethicists have been critical of efforts to return to single-sex rooms.&lt;ref name = Owen/&gt;   [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], an advocate for mixed rooms in the United States, has written that opposition to gender-mixed rooms stems from "old-fashioned prejudice" and argues that: "Because some people have been brought up to fear or dislike sharing a room with a person of the opposite sex, or blush at the prospect of catching a glimpse of an unwelcome body part when a robe slips open, we enshrine and perpetuate this prejudice in social policy."&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Appel, Are We Ready for Coed Hospital Rooms? ''Huffington Post'', June 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain has agreed to phase out such rooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Criticism==

Much as with [[Color blindness (race)|similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity]], not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=18|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal test of the "reasonable person" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that "a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McCammon,|editor1-first=Holly J.|editor2-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Verta|editor3-last=Reger|editor3-first=Jo|editor4-last=Einwohner|editor4-first=Rachel L.|title=The Oxford Handbook of U.S. Women's Social Movement Activism|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">'''Hamstringing''' is a method of crippling a person or animal so that they cannot walk properly by severing the [[hamstring]] [[tendons]] in the thigh of the individual. It is used as a method of [[torture]], or to incapacitate the victim.

==Use==
Hamstringing is used primarily to incapacitate a [[human]] or [[animal]] and render them incapable of effective movement. The severing of the hamstring muscles results not only in the crippling of the leg, but also in tremendous pain&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hamstringinjury.net/hamstring_injury_signs_and_symptoms.html Hamstring Injury.net, Hamstring Injury Relief and Help Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; common to heavy laceration.

==Method==
In humans, the [[hamstring]] extends between the hip and knee joints. The hamstring muscle group is made up of the [[biceps femoris]], [[semitendinosus muscle]], and the [[semimembranosus]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Wayne|last1=Hoskins|first2=Henry|last2=Pollard|title=Hamstring injury management—Part 2: Treatment|journal=Manual Therapy|volume=10|year=2005|pages=180–190|doi=10.1016/j.math.2005.05.001|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It facilitates both the flexing of the knee and hip extension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livestrong.com/article/151904-what-is-the-purpose-function-of-the-hamstring/ Brughelli, Matt. (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; making it a vital contributor to normal leg movement.  By severing these muscles or the tendons involved in this process, normal leg movement is disrupted. In addition to sustaining massive bleeding, the injured leg becomes useless and the victim is rendered lame. The severing of the hamstring is usually accomplished through use of a blade such as a knife or [[sword]].

==Medical treatment==
Due to a lack of research in the field of critical hamstring injuries, the current injury management is quite limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23288753 | doi=10.1055/s-0032-1324811 | volume=26 | title=Hamstring pain and muscle strains following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a prospective, randomized trial comparing hamstring graft harvest techniques | journal=J Knee Surg | pages=139-44 | last1 = D'Alessandro | first1 = P | last2 = Wake | first2 = G | last3 = Annear | first3 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Management of the injury is based solely "on clinical experience, anecdotal evidence and the knowledge of the biological basis of tissue repair."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  These injuries are difficult to control or repair, leading often to permanent injury or even death by [[exsanguination]].

==Historical usage==

Sources from [[late antiquity]] indicate that hamstringing was commonly used to incapacitate combatants and prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28587/28587-h/28587-h.htm|title=The Roman History of Ammianus Marcellinus|author=Ammianus Marcellinus|authorlink=Ammianus Marcellinus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use as metaphor==
Literally, to "hamstring" an individual is to sever the tissues of their hamstring. As a [[metaphor]] to be "hamstrung" suggests being limited, by external imposition or not, in a way that prevents full freedom of movement or utilization of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hamstring |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==

Rendering [[chariot]] [[horse]]s lame by hamstringing is mentioned in the [[Bible]], called "houghing" in the [[King James Version]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2011:9 Book of Joshua, Chapter 11, Verse 9 (King James Version)]&lt;/ref&gt; from an old spelling of ''[[hock (zoology)|hock]]''. In the Bible, this is seen as a positive{{fact|date=August 2018}} use of hamstringing because it prevents the horses from being used in warfare.

'''Holistic veterinary medicine''' is a type of [[veterinary medicine]] that uses [[alternative medicine]] in the treatment of animals.  The philosophy of a holistic veterinarian emphasizes empathy and minimal invasiveness. Alternative therapies offered by a holistic veterinarian may include, but are not limited to, [[Veterinary acupuncture|acupuncture]], [[Herbalism#Uses of herbal medicines by animals|herbal medicine]], [[Veterinary homeopathy|homeopathy]], [[Ethnoveterinary medicine|ethnomedicine]] and [[veterinary chiropractic|chiropractic]].

==Definition==

Many veterinarians use different terms to convey what is meant by ''holistic''. Alternative [[veterinary medicine]], complementary veterinary medicine, and integrative veterinary medicine may be used as synonyms.
All veterinary medicine may be considered ''holistic'' in that it considers all aspects of the animal patient in the context of its environment.  The task force for complementary and alternative veterinary medicine for the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] stresses that "There is only one veterinary medicine and only one standard by which it should be assessed. All treatments and modalities should be judged by the same criteria and held to the same standards.  Descriptive terms such as [[holistic]], [[conventional]], [[traditional medicine|traditional]], alternative, integrative, or [[complementary medicine|complementary]] do not enhance the quality of care provided and should not receive special consideration when judging the safety and efficacy of those treatments.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=An insight into the AVMA Guidelines for Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine |journal=J.

The usual meaning for ''holistic veterinarian'' is a veterinarian who specializes in one or more alternative or complementary treatments. In practice, holistic veterinary medicine incorporates, but is not limited to, [[acupuncture]], [[botanical medicine]], [[chiropractic]], [[homeopathy]], [[massage therapy]], and [[nutraceuticals]]. A veterinarian interested in alternative treatments may be a member of the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahvma.org/ American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; The modalities comprising holistic veterinary medicine vary in their evidence for effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veterinarywatch.com/Primer1.htm Veterinarywatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
According to the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association (AHVMA), [[holistic health|holistic medicine]] is humane. The techniques promoted in holistic medicine are minimally invasive, and incorporate patient well-being, lifestyle, and stress reduction. Holistic thinking is centered on love, empathy and respect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.ahvma.org/ AHVMA - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of blood tests, x-rays, and similar objective diagnostic techniques is minimalized in favor of sensitivity to the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123131731/http://viim.org/research/articles/kinesiology.asp?article=kinesiology 403 Forbidden&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every form of medicine and therapy used in [[alternative medicine]] for humans is also used in holistic veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ahvma.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=1 AHVMA - What is Holistic Medicine?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Horror Victorianorum''' (terror of the Victorian), coined by the philosopher [[David Stove]], is an extreme distaste or condemnation of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] culture, art and design. The term was used in Stove's book ''[[David Stove#The Plato Cult|The Plato Cult]]'' as part of his argument against [[Karl Popper]] and other philosophers whom he characterised as "[[modernism|modernist]]s". For Stove, Popper was influenced by the pervasive anti-Victorian mentality of the era, epitomised by [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s book ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', in which the absurdity of Victorian values is expressed by a parody of "Victorian" conceptions of the civilizing mission of imperialism, when the hero is finally trapped in the Amazonian jungle, forced eternally to read the works of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] to a [[tribal chief]].

For Stove, the ascription of absurdity to Victorian culture was essentially a matter of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]], but one so powerful and irrational that it possessed the intensity of religious faith. As a result, it produced a revulsion &amp;ndash; rather than a reasoned scepticism &amp;ndash; to writers such as the Victorian philosopher of science [[William Whewell]].

Following Stove's usage, the term was taken up by the design historian Shelagh Wilson to refer to modernist distaste for [[Victorian architecture]] and design. Wilson argued that "Palissyite" design, influenced by the methods of [[Bernard Palissy]], had been ridiculed and misunderstood by proponents of "Puginite" design, following the proto-modernist principles of [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]]. Wilson's argument formed part of a reaffirmation of the aesthetic principles of the [[grotesque]].

The argument that distaste for Victorian cultural values ('[[Anti-victorianism]]') is irrational has been adopted by other writers,{{ref|nation}}either following Stove's politically conservative attack on [[liberalism|liberal thought]], or Wilson's critique of modernism.

'''Thomasson''' or '''Hyperart Thomasson''' (Japanese: ''Tomason'' トマソン or ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' 超芸術トマソン) is a type of [[conceptual art]] named by the Japanese artist [[Akasegawa Genpei]] in the 1980s. It refers to a useless relic or structure that has been preserved as part of a building or the built environment, which has become a piece of art in itself. These objects, although having the appearance of pieces of conceptual art, were not created to be viewed as such. Akasegawa deemed them even more art-like than art itself, and named them "hyperart." In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Thomasson, especially since the publication of Akasegawa's work on the subject in English in 2010.&lt;ref name=fargo&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [http://kaya.com/books/hyperart-thomasson/ ''Hyperart: Thomasson,''] translated by Matt Fargo, Kaya Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Origin of the term==

The term Thomasson comes from the professional baseball player [[Gary Thomasson]], who was signed by the [[Yomiuri Giants]] for a record-breaking sum of money, and spent his final two seasons with the team (1981–1982) coming close to setting the league strikeout record before being benched.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rDGd7HDMFp4C&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=tomason%20art&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q=tomason%20art&amp;f=false ''The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life''], 2008 p. 397 n25&lt;/ref&gt; Akasegawa viewed Thomasson's useless position on the team as a fitting analogy for "an object, part of a building, that was maintained in good condition, but with no purpose, to the point of becoming a work of art." &lt;ref name="Akasegawa"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480021892/ ''Chōgeijutsu tomason,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese there is no differentiation between singular and plural versions of the noun ''Tomason'', therefore in English too, Thomasson can refer to one or many of these objects. In English, the term is sometimes spelled '''Tomason''', or '''Thomason'''.

==History==

Akasegawa discovered the first Thomasson in 1972, in [[Yotsuya]], [[Tokyo]] when he noticed a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]]. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the curved stone tray of the ticket window, where it had been worn through years of use. Minami Shindō, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in [[Ochanomizu]] that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition.

The artists gave these objects names such as "The pure staircase of Yotsuya," "The useless window of Ekoda" and "The useless gate of Ochanomizu" and referred to them collectively as "hyperart": their similar characteristics being "an object which, just like a piece of art, has no purpose in society, but also, just like a piece of art is preserved with care, to the point where it appears to be on display. However, these objects do not appear to have a creator, making them even more art-like than regular art."&lt;ref name="Akasegawa"/&gt; Hyperart cannot be created by an artist, but only found and recognized as such by an observer.

Those pieces of hyperart that were part of buildings or the built environment were given the name "Thomasson." The name was decided upon during a discussion between Akasegawa and his students during his class on "Modernology" (a concept created by [[Wajiro Kon]]). At that time, Gary Thomasson's strikeout record was at 132.

The concept of Thomasson was introduced to the general public in 1982, via a series of articles in the magazine ''Shashin Jidai'' (Photo Times), published by Byakuya-Shobō. The articles featured findings by Akasegawa's students from his "Modernology" class as well as photographs of those "objects" catalogued by Akasegawa himself, and those sent in by readers. The articles created a "Thomasson Boom" and the concept soon spread. The early Thomasson articles featured in ''Shashin Jidai'' were published by Byakuya-Shobō as a book entitled ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason''.&lt;ref name=byakuya&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, ''Chogeijutsu Tomason,'' Byakuya Shobō, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The complete series of articles was later published as a paperback by [[Chikuma Shobō]] in 1987, using the same title.

==Influence==

The Thomasson boom after the publication of articles in ''Shashin Jidai'' had a big effect on students and young people interested in arts and the avant-garde. The word Thomasson even spread to people who did not understand what it referred to, in a kind of social phenomenon. The cover of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' featured a lost neighborhood of Minato-ku in Tokyo, Tani-cho, which vanished due to land redevelopment. Whilst not directly related to Thomasson, the story of Tani embodied its spirit. Its use on the cover of the book had a large effect on the "Thomasson Boom." This case also showed the effects of the bubble economy on the city landscape.&lt;ref name=tanaka&gt;Jun Tanaka [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555803.2011.599125 "Decaying ‘swamp city’: the death of Shōwa and Tokyo"], Japan Forum, 23:2, 2011, 273-285&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Jordan Sand notes, cataloguing Thomasson was "a way of regaining some sense of the human imprint on the city in an era when that imprint was being rapidly erased."&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;

In 1983 the Thomasson Observation Center held an exhibition entitled "Cityscape in Anguish" at Gallery 612 in [[Shinjuku]], displaying Akasegawa's paintings and photographs of Thomasson by Akasegawa, his students, and those sent in by readers of the magazine.  Various tie-in events such as Thomasson bus tours, lectures by Akasegawa, as well as coverage on the Japanese national broadcaster [[NHK]], and the publication, in 1987 of the complete "Chōgeijutsu Tomason," were the peak of the Thomasson Boom.

Around the same time, other artists and intellectuals were pursuing similar projects. [[Terunobu Fujimori]]'s work on Architecture Detectives, Hayashi Jōji's work cataloguing manhole covers, Minami Shinbo's collections of paper stickers, Ichigi Tsutomu's work on architectural fragments and other such collections, led to Chikuma Shobō publishing a book entitled ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,'' or "Manual on Street Observation" in 1986.&lt;ref name="Street Observation"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, Minami Shinbō, Fujimori Terunobu (Editors) [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480028181/ ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside this, a Street Observation Society event was held to promote their work, along with a press conference.&lt;ref name=Daniell&gt;Daniell, Thomas “Just Looking: The Origins of the Street Observation Society”. [http://aabookshop.net/?wpsc-product=aa-files-64 ''AA Files'', no. 64], Architectural Association School of Architecture, 2012: 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Street Observation did appear to be something of a boom, it was not the same type of movement that had surrounded the activities of Akasegawa, his students, and their magazine articles.  After the arrival of the Street Observation Society, Thomasson disappeared from the public eye for a while, due in part to the fact that the Thomasson Observation Center, run by Akasegawa and his students, overwhelmed by press and public attention, stopped its activities soon after the boom reached its peak.

In the years immediately after the Thomasson boom, the concept was referenced in cinema and literature. In the film [[Patlabor: The Movie]] (1989) a scene featured the "Atom-bomb type" Thomasson. [[William Gibson]]'s 1993 SF novel [[Virtual Light]] also makes multiple references to Thomasson.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;William Gibson, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=HHYUGVbVUZYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=tomason%20%2B%20akasegawa&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Virtual Light,''] Bantam, 1993 pp. 70, 72, 136, 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apache&gt;Takayuki Tatsumi, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=0Dcxkm5u05YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Full%20Metal%20Apache%3A%20Transactions%20Between%20Cyberpunk%20Japan%20and%20Avant-Pop%20America&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=thomasson&amp;f=false ''Full Metal Apache: Transactions Between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America,''] Duke University Press, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==

In 2010 the Chikuma Shobō edition of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' was translated into English by Matt Fargo and published as ''Hyperart:Thomasson.''&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;  In 2012, the Thomasson Observation Center created a Facebook page, and started accepting posts on Thomasson via the internet. The posts were shared widely, and a special form was made available for download to fill out with details of newly discovered Thomasson. A new, internet-era Thomasson movement began. The book and concept have been covered by several English-language media outlets.&lt;ref name=citylab&gt;Citylab [http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/05/useless-and-defunct-city-objects-are-named-thomassons/2075/ Useless and Defunct City Objects Should Be Called... 'Thomassons'], August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=percent&gt;99% Invisible, [http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/thomassons/ Episode 129, ''Thomassons,''] August 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neojaponisme&gt;[http://neojaponisme.com/2008/01/28/roadside-observation/ Darryl Jingwen Wee, "Roadside Observation" ''Neojaponisme'' January 28th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Thomasson Observation Center held a Grand Thomasson Exhibition at a gallery in [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]] to celebrate the 31st anniversary of its founding.&lt;ref name=thomassonten&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/528018727281950/ Grand Thomasson Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of modern Japan Jordan Sand's 2013 work, ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,'' also discusses the Thomasson phenomenon in its third chapter, entitled "Deviant Properties: Street Observation Studies." &lt;ref name=sand&gt;Jordan Sand, [https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Tokyo_Vernacular.html?id=CZqygyfqnpkC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,''] University of California Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand also contributed an essay to the 2010 translation of ''Hyperart: Thomasson''.

In 2013 “La Poussière de soleils,” an exhibition in [[Brooklyn]] gallery Real Fine Arts, featured Thomasson in the form of a photocopy of Akasegawa's photograph of a door handle sticking out of a cement wall.&lt;ref name=artforum&gt;Lauren O'Neill-Butler, [https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201309&amp;id=43560 "La Poussière de soleils,"] Artforum international 52.3, Nov 2013, p.290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Thomasson==
Based on the categories in Chikuma Shobō's "Thomasson Illustrated Encyclopedia" (''Tomason Daizukan'' トマソン大図鑑)&lt;ref name=Daizukan&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032010/ ''Tomason daizukan: mu no maki,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1996; Akasegawa Genpei [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032027/ ''Tomason daizukan: kū no maki,']' Chikuma Shobō, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Useless Staircase===
(Japanese: ''Muyō kaidan'' 無用階段)

Also known as a Pure Staircase. A staircase that only goes up and down. Most used to have a door at the top. Some useless staircases exist that were useless right from completion, due to changes or mix-ups in the design.

===The Useless Doorway===
[[File:非常ドア (8401452825).jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Doorway]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō mon'' 無用門)

Even though it has been blocked up, a Useless Doorway still maintains the majesty of its original purpose. In other cases, a Useless Doorway exists in a place that has no need for it, with no wall or fence around it.

===The Hisashi===
(Japanese: ''Hisashi'' ヒサシ)

Hisashi is the word for "eaves" in Japanese. This refers to useless eaves: ones that no longer have a window or door underneath them to protect from the rain.

===The Useless Window===
(Japanese: ''Muyō mado'', 無用窓)

A blocked up window: one which is still beautiful due to the care taken in blocking it up.

===The Nurikabe===
(Japanese: ''Nurikabe'' ヌリカベ)

Nurikabe is the word for "plaster wall" in Japanese. This overlaps with the Useless Doorway and Useless Window categories. It refers to a door or window that was meant to be completely sealed up with concrete, but a difference can still be seen between it and the surrounding area.

===The A-bomb type===
[[File:Genbaku Type Thomasson in Suruga Word.JPG|thumb|Example of an A-bomb Type Thomasson]]
(Japanese: ''Genbaku taipu'' 原爆タイプ)

A 2-D Thomasson. The outline of a building that remains in silhouette on a wall. This can be seen when a section of a tightly packed row of buildings is torn down. Cases that appear due to water are known as '''Hydrogen bombs''' (''Suibaku'' 水爆). Cases that appear when a hoarding or sign is torn down are known as '''Neutron bombs''' (''Chūseishibakudan'' 中性子爆弾).

===The Elevated type===
(Japanese: ''Kōsho'' 高所)

These objects are normal themselves, but exist in a higher than normal place, therefore seeming strange. For example, a door with a handle on the second floor of a wall. These often appear when staircases are torn down. They can also appear when a winch or crane is kept inside the building, but a standard door is used on the outside.

===The Outie===
(Japanese: ''Debeso'' でべそ)

A protrudence from a sealed up wall, such as a door knob or tap.

===The Uyama===
(Japanese: ''Uyama'' ウヤマ)

A sign or hoarding with letters missing. The first example of this was a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, but the rest of the lettering was missing, hence the name.

===The Castella===
(Japanese: ''Kasutera'' カステラ)

A cuboid protuberance from a wall, named after [[Castella]], a Japanese sponge cake. For example, a blocked up window which sticks out from the wall. The opposite of this, a sunken blocked up section, is known as a '''Reverse Castella'''.

===The Atago===
(Japanese: ''Atago'' アタゴ)

An object sticking out at the side of the road, with no clear purpose, possibly used to stop cars parking. The first example of this was found by Akasegawa whilst walking from [[Shinbashi]] to [[Atago, Minato, Tokyo|Atago]], hence the name.

===The Live Burial===
(Japanese: ''Ikiume'' 生き埋め)

A roadside object which is partly submerged in concrete.

===The Geological layer===
(Japanese: ''Chisō'' 地層)

A patch of ground that is different in height from that around it, usually where multiple construction works have taken place.

===The Boundary===
(Japanese: ''Kyōkai'' 境界)

A guardrail, fence or wall whose purpose is not immediately clear.

===The Twist===
(Japanese: ''Nejire'' ねじれ)

A part of a building which is normally meant to be straight, but is slightly twisted. Often seen when an object that was created to be used straight is used at an angle.

===The Abe Sada===
(Japanese: ''Abe Sada'' 阿部定)

The remains of a telephone pole cut down. The name refers to the [[Abe Sada]] Incident; a famous case from 1930s Japan in which a woman strangled her lover and then severed his genitalia with a kitchen knife.

===The Devouring Tree===
(Japanese: ''Monokūki'' もの喰う木)

A tree which absorbs part of a fence or wire whilst still growing. However, this is not a particularly rare phenomenon, and occurs quite often. If there is no human involvement then it cannot be called a Thomasson, just a natural phenomenon. This is also known as the '''Stubborn Nature Type''' (''shizen kohashi taipu'' 自然強しタイプ).

===The Useless Bridge===
[[File:Nikaryo Futago 06c2902qs.jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Bridge]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō bashi'' 無用橋)

A bridge over a filled-in river, or a bridge that has become useless. In the case of some covered drains, a bridge is still necessary for cars or heavy vehicles to cross. In this case these could not be called Useless Bridges, as they only appear useless.

===The Pure type===
[[File:Tomason tunnel KaifuStation.JPG|thumb|Example of a Pure Tunnel]]
(Japanese: ''Junsui taipu'' 純粋タイプ)

An uncategorizable object whose use it is impossible to fathom. For example, the Pure Shutters, which open to reveal a blank wall, and the Pure Tunnel that exists without a surrounding hill. The Pure Staircase of Yotsuya belongs in this category.

===Evaporation===
(Japanese: ''Jōhatsu'' 蒸発)

The fading of color on a sign, or a monument with parts missing: an object whose meaning has become hard to work out. Cases often appear due to the long-lasting material of the object. This also often occurs when a sign's key phrases, painted in red for emphasis, disappear, leaving the rest of the sign hard to understand.

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

{{Jainism}}
[[Image:Kevalajnana.jpg|thumb|Kevala Jñāna of Mahavira]]
'''Kevala jñāna''' means [[omniscience]] in [[Jainism]] and is roughly translated as absolute knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharma|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; or supreme knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kumar|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevala jnana is believed to be an intrinsic quality of all souls. This quality is masked by karmic particles that surround the soul. Every soul has the potential to obtain omniscience by shedding off these karmic particles. Jain scriptures speak of twelve stages through which the soul achieves this goal. A soul who has attained kevala jnana is called a ''kevalin'' ({{lang|sa|केवलिन्}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jains, only kevalins can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of two sects of Jainism, [[Digambara]] and [[Śvētāmbara]] Jains differ on the subject of ''kevalins''. According to Digambaras, a kevalin does not experience hunger or thirst, whereas according to Svetambaras, a ''kevalin'' has normal human needs and he travels and preaches too. Digambara Jains believe that they do not act in the normal sense of the word, that they sit motionless in [[Lotus position|padmasana]], and that their bodies emit ''Divyadhvani,'' a sacred sound which is interpreted by their followers as the fundamental truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=45 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kabay|first=Paul|date=2013-05-09|title=Interpreting the Divyadhvani: On Why the Digambara Sect Is Right about the Nature of the Kevalin|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/506674|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=63|issue=2|pages=176–193|doi=10.1353/pew.2013.0020|issn=1529-1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to both traditions, the last ''kevalin'' was a disciple of one of the eleven chief disciples of the last ''[[tirthankara]]'', [[Mahāvīra]]; his name is recorded as [[Jambuswami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that no one after Jambuswami will have the ability to obtain kevala jnana.

==Literary sources==
The claim of existence of omniscience by Jains, who deny the existence of a creator god, is a unique phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|p=98 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sutrakritanga]] text of the Svetambara school, elaborates the concept as all-knowing and provides details of his other qualities.&lt;ref name="Dundas 2002 25"&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another text, the [[Kalpa Sūtra]], gives details of Mahavira's omniscience
{{quote|When the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira had become a [[Tirthankara|Jina]] and Arhat ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]), he was a Kevali, omniscient and comprehending all objects; he knew and saw all conditions of the world, of gods, men, and demons: whence they come, whither they go, whether they are born as men or animals or become gods or hell-beings (''upapada''), the ideas, the thoughts of their minds, the food, doings, desires, the open and secret deeds of all the living beings in the whole world; he the Arhat (Arihant), for whom there is no secret, knew and saw all conditions of all living beings in the world.:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini|2001|pp=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately after the death of Mahavira, his disciple [[Indrabhuti Gautama]] became a ''kevalin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the tradition, the teachings of the tirthankara were memorized and preserved over many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shah|2004|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second ''Upanga Agama'', the ''Rājapraśnīya'', there is a dialogue between Kesi, a disciple of [[Pārśva]], and [[Payasi]], a [[materialist]] king. In this dialogue, Kesi proves the existence of [[jiva]] and its ability to obtain kevala jñana to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jains have a long debate with [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and [[Buddhist]]s regarding omniscience. [[Bhikkhu]] [[Dharmakirti]] criticized the Jain notion of omniscience in his ''Pramanavartika''. The Hindu philosopher [[Kumarila]] argued that only [[Veda]] had the authority to define human moral values since they were "beginningless, authorless and of self-sufficient validity". In response, the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] [[Haribhadra]] (c. 8th century CE) wrote that humans already had knowledge of everything knowable. It only had to be illuminated or uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omniscience was, according to Haribhadra, inherent to living beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samantabhadra (Jain monk)|Samantabhadra]] was the first philosopher-monk in the history of Indian philosophy who tried to use inference as a method to establish the existence of omniscience&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his famous work, ''[[Aptamimamsa]]'', Samantabhadra asserts:{{quote|Objects that are minute (like atoms), past (like Lord Rama), and distant (like Mount Meru), being the objects of inference (''anumeya'' – and, therefore, also objects of knowledge – ''prameya''), must be perceivable directly by someone; like the fire on the hill is an object of inference for a distant person but is perceived directly by the one who is in its proximity. The one who perceives directly the objects of knowledge that are minute, past, and distant is the Omniscient (''sarvajña''); this way the existence of the Omniscient is truly and firmly established.|Āptamīmāṁsā (5){{sfn|Jain|2016|p=10}}}}

[[Akalanka]] (c. 720 760 CE) put forward the concept of ''suniscita-asambhavad-badhaka-pramana'' as a reason for the existence of omniscience. This concept is a well-known fact which is "we have no valid methods of knowing to deny the existence of omniscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemacandra]] (c. 1088 1173) combined Samantabhadra and Akalanka's ideas of ''sarvajña'' in his ''Pramanamimasa'' to establish the existence of omniscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jain epistemology==
{{Main article|Jain epistemology}}
In Jain epistemology, there are two kinds of valid methods of knowledge: ''pratyakṣa'' or "direct knowledge" and ''parokṣa'' or "indirect knowledge". Kevala-jñana is considered ''pratyaksa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flügel|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five ways of obtaining knowledge are defined: ''matijñana'' acquired through sensory perception; ''srutajñana'' acquired through understanding of verbal and written sentences; ''avadhijñana'', ''manhaparyaya jñana'' and kevala jñana.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with ''[[Anekantavada]]'', which can be explained through the parable of the "[[blind men and an elephant]]". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{cite book | title=The voice of Prophets | publisher=Lulu.com | last=Hughes | first=Marilynn | series=Volume 2 of 12 | year=2005 | location=Morrisville, North Carolina | pages=590–591 | isbn=1-4116-5121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the ''Kevalis''—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi | pages=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].

==Stages of spiritual development==
{{Main article|Gunasthana}}
According to Jain texts, there are fourteen stages (''gunasthana'') of spiritual development. The soul can gradually frees itself, firstly from the worst, then from the less bad and finally from all kinds of karma, and manifests the innate qualities of knowledge, belief and conduct in a more and more perfect form. The first four ''gunasthana'' are related to belief or rationality in perception. As and when the soul acquires rationality in perception it moves on to 4th ''gunasthana''. Stages 5 to 14 relate to conduct. The purity in conduct determines the gunasthana from 5th stage onwards. Those who have taken the ''anuvratas'' {minor vows} may reach up to the 5th Gunasthana. The 6th to 14th Gunasthanas can only be attained by those who have taken the ''[[Mahavrata]]s'' (major vows) of [[Jain ascetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|2001|pp=186–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following are the stages of spiritual development:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jaini1998|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tatia|1994|pp=274–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Modern synthesis (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Modern Synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Several major ideas about [[evolution]] came together in the [[population genetics]] of the early 20th century to form the modern synthesis, including [[genetic variation]], [[natural selection]], and particulate ([[Mendelian genetics|Mendelian]]) inheritance.&lt;ref name="Gould216"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] and supplanted a variety of [[alternatives to Darwinism|non-Darwinian theories of evolution]].]]
{{Evolutionary biology}}

The '''modern synthesis'''{{efn|Also known variously as the '''new synthesis''', the '''modern evolutionary synthesis''', the '''evolutionary synthesis''', and the '''neo-Darwinian synthesis'''. These alternative terms are ambiguous as they could possibly include later syntheses, so this article uses [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1942 "modern synthesis"{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} throughout.}} was the early 20th-century synthesis reconciling [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s ideas on heredity in a joint mathematical framework. [[Julian Huxley]] coined the term in his 1942 book, ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.

The 19th century ideas of [[natural selection]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] were put together with [[population genetics]], early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed the relationship between the broad-scale changes of [[macroevolution]] seen by [[paleontology|palaeontologists]] and the small-scale [[microevolution]] of local [[population]]s of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1959, [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] in 1966 and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included [[E. B. Ford]], [[Bernhard Rensch]], [[Ivan Schmalhausen]], and [[George Gaylord Simpson]]. An early event in the modern synthesis was [[R. A. Fisher]]'s 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but [[William Bateson]], and separately [[Udny Yule]], were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.

Different syntheses followed, accompanying the gradual breakup of the early 20th century synthesis, including with [[social behaviour]] in [[E. O. Wilson]]'s [[sociobiology]] in 1975, [[evolutionary developmental biology]]'s integration of [[embryology]] with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and [[Massimo Pigliucci]]'s proposed [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] of 2007. In the view of the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in [[molecular biology]], the study of [[prokaryote]]s and the resulting [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]], and [[genomics]].&lt;ref name=Koonin2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink=Eugene Koonin |title=The Origin at 150: is a new evolutionary synthesis in sight? |journal=Trends in Genetics |date=November 2009 |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=473–475 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2009.09.007 |pmid=19836100 |pmc=2784144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's evolution by natural selection, 1859===
{{main|Evolution|Natural selection}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was successful in convincing most biologists that [[evolution]] had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that [[natural selection]] was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of [[Lamarckism]] (inheritance of acquired characteristics), [[orthogenesis]] (progressive evolution), [[saltationism]] (evolution by jumps) and [[mutationism]] (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] advocated a selectionist version of evolution, and unlike Darwin completely rejected Lamarckism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kutschera |first=Ulrich |authorlink=Ulrich Kutschera |date=December 2003 |title=A comparative analysis of the Darwin-Wallace papers and the development of the concept of natural selection |journal=Theory in Biosciences |location=Jena; Berlin &amp; Heidelberg |publisher=Urban &amp; Fischer; [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |volume=122 |issue=4 |pages=343–359 |doi=10.1007/s12064-003-0063-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, Wallace's view was labelled [[neo-Darwinism]] by Samuel Butler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Samuel |authorlink1=Samuel Butler (novelist)|title=Unconscious Memory |date=1880 |publisher=David Bogue |page=280 |url=https://archive.org/details/unconsciousmemo00hartgoog |quote=I may predict with some certainty that before long we shall find the original Darwinism of Dr. [[Erasmus Darwin]] … generally accepted instead of the neo-Darwinism of to-day, and that the variations whose accumulation results in species will be recognised as due to the wants and endeavours of the living forms in which they appear, instead of being ascribed to chance, or, in other words, to unknown causes, as by Mr. Charles Darwin's system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wallacefund.info/terms-darwinism-and-neo-darwinism |title=On the Terms "Darwinism" and "Neo-Darwinism" |last=Beccaloni |first=George |date=2013 |website=A.

[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Blending inheritance]], implied by pangenesis, causes the [[mean|averaging out]] of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, would make evolution by [[natural selection]] impossible.]]

===The eclipse of Darwinism, 1880s onwards===
{{main|The eclipse of Darwinism}}

From the 1880s onwards, there was a widespread belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This [[eclipse of Darwinism]] (in [[Julian Huxley]]'s phrase) grew out of the weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in [[blending inheritance]], which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] correctly noted in 1868.&lt;ref name="Bowler196-250"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=196–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson105-129"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of [[pangenesis]], with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing from all parts of the body, actually implied Lamarckism as well as blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gayon, Jean |date=1998 |title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=2–3 |isbn=978-0-521-56250-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Darwin68"&gt;{{cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles | authorlink=Charles Darwin | year=1868 | title=The variation of animals and plants under domestication | publisher=John Murray | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F880.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | isbn=1-4191-8660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s and the [[gamete]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop]] afresh in each generation from the germ plasm.]]

===Weismann's germ plasm, 1892===
{{main|Germ plasm}}

[[August Weismann]]'s idea, set out in his 1892 book ''Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung'' (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |date=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |trans-title=The Germ Plasm: A theory of inheritance |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/weismann_keimplasma_1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that the hereditary material, which he called the [[germ plasm]], and the rest of the body (the [[Somatic (biology)|soma]]) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong, and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'.{{efn|Peter Gauthier has however argued that [[Weismann's experiment]] showed only that injury did not affect the germ plasm. It did not test the effect of Lamarckian use and disuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He argued strongly and dogmatically{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=248}} for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=253–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=247–253, 257}}

==Disputed beginnings==

===Genetics, mutationism and biometrics, 1900–1918===
{{main|Mutationism|Biostatistics}}
[[File:William Bateson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William Bateson]] championed [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelism]].]]

While carrying out breeding experiments to clarify the mechanism of inheritance in 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] and [[Carl Correns]] independently rediscovered [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. News of this reached [[William Bateson]] in [[England]], who reported on the paper during a presentation to the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in May 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/germplas/PISUM/ZGS4F.HTM |title=Mendel's Peas |last=Ambrose |first=Mike |publisher=Germplasm Resources Unit, [[John Innes Centre]]|location=Norwich, UK |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mendelian inheritance]], the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with the contribution of the other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round and wrinkled peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term [[allele]] for a variant form of an [[gene|inherited characteristic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reviewing Mendel's Laws |url=http://www.phschool.com/science/biology_place/biocoach/inheritance/laws.html |publisher=Pearson |accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bateson|1894}}: Mutations (as 'sports') and polymorphisms were well known long before the Mendelian recovery.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two schools were the Mendelians, such as Bateson and de Vries, who favoured mutationism&lt;!--cd overlink this--&gt;, evolution driven by mutation, based on genes whose alleles [[Particulate inheritance|segregated discretely]] like Mendel's peas;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=157–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]], led by [[Karl Pearson]] and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter Weldon]]. The biometricians argued vigorously against mutationism, saying that empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most organisms, not discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Provine|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Pearson, 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Pearson]] led the [[Biostatistics|biometric school]].]]

A traditional view is that the biometricians and the Mendelians rejected natural selection and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only resolved by the development of population genetics.&lt;ref name="grafen 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Grafen|Ridley|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olby |first1=Robert |title=The Dimensions of Scientific Controversy: The Biometric-Mendelian Debate |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=September 1989 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=299–320 |jstor=4026898 |doi=10.1017/s0007087400026170}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A more recent view is that Bateson, de Vries, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and [[Reginald Punnett]] had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the [[Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium]], the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gayon, J. | title=Darwinism's Struggle for Survival: Heredity and the Hypothesis of Natural Selection |year=1988 | publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoltzfus"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |last2=Cable |first2=Kele |title=Mendelian-Mutationism: The Forgotten Evolutionary Synthesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2014 |volume=47 |pages=501–546 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9383-2 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10739-014-9383-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that "If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected".&lt;ref name="BatesonSaunders1902"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bateson |first1=William |author1link=William Bateson |last2=Saunders |first2=E.

Reports to the Evolution Committee |date=1902 |url=http://post.queensu.ca/~forsdyke/bateson1.htm#Bateson%20&amp;%20Saunders%20(1902)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1902, the statistician [[Udny Yule]] showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's approach as confrontational,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yule | first1=G. Udny |authorlink=Udny Yule | title=Mendel's Laws and their probable relations to inter-racial heredity |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb06590.x/pdf |journal=New Phytologist |volume=1 |pages=226–227 |date=1902 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1902.tb07336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=81–82}}

===Castle's hooded rats, 1911===

Starting in 1906, [[William Ernest Castle|William Castle]] carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in [[rat]]s. The [[piebald]] or hooded pattern was [[recessive]] to the grey wild type. He crossed hooded rats with the black-backed Irish type, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found that it was possible to change the characteristics way beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation was caused by the environment and could not be inherited. By 1911 Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on heritable variation of a sufficient number of Mendelian genes.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=109–114}}

===Morgan's fruit flies, 1912===
{{main|Thomas Hunt Morgan}}

Thomas Hunt Morgan began his career in genetics as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''{{efn|Morgan's work with fruit flies helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] theory of inheritance, that the hereditary material was embodied in these bodies within the cell nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the supply of genetic variation in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=271–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.{{sfn|Provine|2001|pp=120–121}}

==An obstruction: Woodger's positivism, 1929==

{{further|Joseph Henry Woodger}}

The [[theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]] and [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] led the introduction of [[logical positivism|positivism]] into biology with his 1929 book ''Biological Principles''. He saw a mature [[science]] as being characterised by a framework of [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that could be verified by facts established by [[experiment]]s. He criticised the traditional [[natural history]] style of [[biology]], including the study of [[evolution]], as immature science, since it relied on [[narrative]].&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodger set out to play for biology the role of [[Robert Boyle]]'s 1661 ''[[Sceptical Chymist]]'', intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the [[Vienna Circle]] of logical positivists like [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[reductionism|to reduce]] biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis100/&gt; The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist [[William John Crozier]] told his students that evolution was not even a science: "You can't experiment with two million years!"&lt;ref name=Smocovitis114&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tide of opinion turned with the adoption of [[mathematical model]]ling and [[controlled experiment]]ation in population genetics, combining genetics, ecology and evolution in a framework acceptable to positivism.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis119&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=119–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events in the synthesis==
===Fisher and Haldane's mathematical population genetics, 1918–1930===
{{main|A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection}}

In 1918, R. A. Fisher wrote the paper "[[The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Ronald A. |authorlink=Ronald Fisher |date=January 1919 |title=XV.—The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |location=London |publisher=Robert Grant &amp; Son; [[Williams and Norgate|Williams &amp; Norgate]] |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=399–433 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800012163 |oclc=4981124}} "Paper read by J. Arthur Thomson on July 8, 1918 to the Royal Society of Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt; which showed mathematically how continuous variation could result from a number of discrete [[locus (genetics)|genetic loci]]. In this and subsequent papers culminating in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher showed how Mendelian genetics was consistent with the idea of evolution driven by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|pp=221–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Fisher also analysed [[sexual selection]] in his book, but his work was largely ignored, and Darwin's case for such selection misunderstood&lt;!--e.g. by Huxley--&gt;, so it formed no substantial part of the modern synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosken |first1=David J. |last2=House |first2=Clarissa M. |title=Sexual Selection |journal=Current Biology |date=25 January 2011 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=R62–R65 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 1920s, [[A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection|a series of papers]] by [[J. B. S.

The traditional view is that [[developmental biology]] played little part in the modern synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'', the evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated [[evolutionary developmental biology]]&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |authorlink=Lewis I.

As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ingo Brigandt |year=2006 |title=Homology and heterochrony: the evolutionary embryologist Gavin Rylands de Beer (1899-1972) |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]] |volume=306B |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21100 |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~brigandt/de_Beer.pdf |pmid=16506229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|[[Sewall Wright]] introduced the idea of a [[fitness landscape]] with local optima.]]
{{further information|Population genetics#History}}

The population geneticist [[Sewall Wright]] focused on combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, and the effects of [[inbreeding]] on small relatively isolated populations, which could be subject to [[genetic drift]]. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an [[Fitness landscape|adaptive landscape]] in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1932|pp=[http://www.esp.org/books/6th-congress/facsimile/contents/6th-cong-p356-wright.pdf 356–366]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming aware of the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations.&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt; The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Dobzhansky's evolutionary genetics, 1937===
{{further|Genetics and the Origin of Species}}
[[File:Drosophila pseudoobscura-Male.png|thumb|left|''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]'', the fruit fly which served as [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]]'s [[model organism]]]]

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], an emigrant from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States]], who had been a postdoctoral worker in Morgan's fruit fly lab, was one of the first to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with ''[[Drosophila pseudoobscura]]''. He says pointedly: "Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, there were other [[Russia]]n geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the [[Western world|West]]. His 1937 work ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; Further, Dobzhansky asserted that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the [[chromosome]]s, and [[genetic linkage|linked]] more or less strongly to each other according to their physical distances from each other on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky's "evolutionary genetics"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro- and macroevolution.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis122/&gt; His work emphasized that real world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models, and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of [[Sergei Chetverikov]], who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population before his work was shut down by the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Larson221-243"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339"/&gt; By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue  that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies. Thirdly, mechanisms like ecological or sexual isolation and hybrid sterility could fix the results of the earlier processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eldredge |first=Niles |title=Unfinished Synthesis: Biological Hierarchies and Modern Evolutionary Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEYdRMjhPC4C&amp;pg=PR9 |year=1985 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536513-9 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Fisher were correct.

===Schmalhausen's stabilizing selection, 1941===
{{further|Stabilizing selection}}

[[Ivan Schmalhausen]] developed the theory of [[stabilizing selection]], the idea that selection can preserve a trait at some value, publishing a paper in Russian titled "Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution" in 1941 and a monograph ''Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmalhausen|first1=Ivan I.|last2=Dordick|first2=Isadore (trans.)|authorlink1=Ivan Schmalhausen|editor1-last=Dobzhansky|editor1-first=Theodosius|editor1-link=Theodosius Dobzhansky|title=Factors of Evolution.

Baldwin's 1902 concept that changes induced by the environment will ultimately be replaced by hereditary changes (including the [[Baldwin effect]] on behaviour), following that theory's implications to their Darwinian conclusion, and bringing him into conflict with Lysenkoism. Schmalhausen observed that stabilizing selection would remove most variations from the norm, most mutations being harmful.&lt;ref name=Levit2006&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levit | first=Georgy S. |author2=Hossfeld, Uwe |author3=Olsson, Lennart | title=From the 'Modern Synthesis' to Cybernetics: Ivan Ivanovich Schmalhausen (1884–1963) and his Research Program for a Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Biology | journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology | volume=306B | issue=2006 | pages=89–106 | publisher=Wiley-Liss | year=2006 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.b.21087/abstract | pmid=16419076 | doi=10.1002/jez.b.21087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adams1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams, M.

===Huxley's popularising synthesis, 1942===
{{main|Evolution: The Modern Synthesis}}
[[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julian Huxley]] presented a serious but popularising version of the theory in his 1942 book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''.]]

In 1942, [[Julian Huxley]]'s serious but popularising&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lamm&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lamm |first1=Ehud |title=Review of: Julian Huxley, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis – The Definitive Edition, with a new forward by Massimo Pigliucci and Gerd B. Müller. MIT Press |url=http://www.ehudlamm.com/huxley.pdf |accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]''{{sfn|Huxley|2010}} introduced a name for the synthesis and intentionally set out to promote a "synthetic point of view" on the evolutionary process. He imagined a wide synthesis of many sciences: genetics, developmental physiology, ecology, systematics, palaeontology, cytology, and mathematical analysis of biology, and assumed that evolution would proceed differently in different groups of organisms according to how their genetic material was organised and their strategies for reproduction, leading to progressive but varying evolutionary trends.&lt;ref name=Lamm/&gt; His vision was of an "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; with a system of ethics and a meaningful place for "Man" in the world grounded in a unified theory of evolution which would demonstrate progress leading to man at its summit. Natural selection was in his view a "fact of nature capable of verification by observation and experiment", while the "period of synthesis" of the 1920s and 1930s had formed a "more unified science",&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt; rivalling physics and enabling the "rebirth of Darwinism".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=138–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the book was not the research text that it appeared to be. In the view of the philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]], and in Huxley's own opinion, Huxley was "a generalist, a synthesizer of ideas, rather than a specialist".&lt;ref name=Ruse&gt;{{harvnb|Ruse|1996|pp=328–338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning [[Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection]]. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful, and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating topics such as [[island biogeography]], [[speciation]], and competition. Huxley further showed that the appearance of long-term [[orthogenesis|orthogenetic trends]] – predictable directions for evolution – in the fossil record were readily explained as [[allometry|allometric growth]] (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as the end point, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution.&lt;ref name=Ruse/&gt; Huxley's belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about "the future of Mankind". Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard's 1955 book on orthogenesis, ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]''. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis138/&gt;

===Mayr's allopatric speciation, 1942===

[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ernst Mayr]] argued that [[allopatric speciation|geographic isolation]] was needed to provide sufficient [[reproductive isolation]] for [[speciation|new species to form]].]]

[[Ernst Mayr]]'s key contribution to the synthesis was ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species]]'', published in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted the importance of and set out to explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of [[Taxon|polytypic]] species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hey, Jody|author2=Fitch, Walter M.|author3=Ayala, Francisco J. |title=Systematics and the origin of species: An introduction |journal=PNAS |date=2005 |volume=102 |issue=supplement 1 |pages=6515–6519 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0501939102 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/102/suppl_1/6515.full|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.6515H |pmc=1131868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayr emphasized the importance of [[allopatric speciation]], where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that [[reproductive isolation]] occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of [[sympatric speciation]] believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the [[Species problem#Biological species concept|biological species concept]] that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|Provine|1998|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mayr|1982}} Before he left [[Germany]] for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist [[Bernhard Rensch]], who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rensch|1947}}; {{harvnb|Rensch|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/chronob/RENS1900.htm |title=Rensch, Bernhard (Carl Emmanuel) (Germany 1900-1990) |last=Smith |first=Charles H. |authorlink=Charles H.

He noted that any chosen line is one path in a complex branching tree, [[natural selection]] having no [[orthogenesis|imposed direction]].]]

===Simpson's palaeontology, 1944===

[[George Gaylord Simpson]] was responsible for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with palaeontology in his 1944 book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. Simpson's work was crucial because so many palaeontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, with the idea that natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the [[evolution of the horse]]) that earlier palaeontologists had used as support for [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the [[fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowler325-339" /&gt;

===The Society for the Study of Evolution, 1946===

During the [[World War II|war]], Mayr edited a series of bulletins of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, formed in 1943, reporting on discussions of a "synthetic attack" on the interdisciplinary problems of evolution. In 1946, the committee became the Society for the Study of Evolution, with Mayr, Dobzhansky and Sewall Wright the first of the signatories. Mayr became the editor of its journal, ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. From Mayr and Dobzhansky's point of view, suggests the historian of science Betty Smocovitis, Darwinism was reborn, evolutionary biology was legitimised, and genetics and evolution were synthesised into a newly unified science. Everything fitted in to the new framework, except "heretics" like [[Richard Goldschmidt]] who annoyed Mayr and Dobzhansky by insisting on the possibility of [[mutationism|speciation by macromutation]], creating "hopeful monsters". The result was "bitter controversy".&lt;ref name=Smocovitis153&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|pp=153–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stebbins's botany, 1950===

The botanist [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] extended the synthesis to encompass [[botany]]. He described the important effects on [[speciation]] of [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridization]] and [[polyploidy]] in plants in his 1950 book ''[[Variation and Evolution in Plants]]''. These permitted evolution to proceed rapidly at times, polyploidy in particular evidently being able to create new species effectively instantaneously.&lt;ref name="Larson221-243" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smocovitis2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Smocovitis | first1=V.

{{further|Inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}

In 1964, [[W. D. Hamilton]] published two papers on "The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour". These defined [[inclusive fitness]] as the number of offspring equivalents an individual rears, rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour. This was contrasted with personal reproductive fitness, the number of offspring that the individual directly begets. Hamilton, and others such as [[John Maynard Smith]], argued that a gene's success consisted in maximising the number of copies of itself, either by begetting them or by indirectly encouraging begetting by related individuals who shared the gene, the theory of [[kin selection]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maynard Smith |first=John |authorlink=John Maynard Smith |year=1964 |title=Group Selection and Kin Selection |journal=Nature |volume=201 |issue=4924 |pages=1145–1147 |doi=10.1038/2011145a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams]] published ''[[Adaptation and Natural Selection]]'', outlined a [[gene-centered view of evolution|gene-centred view of evolution]] following Hamilton's concepts, disputing the idea of [[evolutionary progress]], and attacking the then widespread theory of [[group selection]]. Williams argued that natural selection worked by changing the frequency of alleles, and could not work at the level of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven |authorlink=Steven Pinker |year=1994 |title=The Language Instinct |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=George C. |title=Adaptation and Natural Selection |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1966 |pages=307 |url=http://www.librarything.com/work/192870 |isbn=0-691-02615-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene-centred evolution was popularised by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' and developed in his more technical writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/population-genetics/ Okasha, Samir, "Population Genetics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2015 Edition), Edward N.

In 1975, [[E. O.

This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins and others.&lt;ref name=YudellDesalle2000/&gt; Critics such as [[Gerhard Lenski]] noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky's approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned.&lt;ref name=Lenski1976&gt;{{cite journal| last=Lenski| first=Gerhard| year=1976| title=Sociobiology.

{{main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}

In 1977, [[recombinant DNA]] technology enabled biologists to start to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] from 1978, when [[Edward B. Lewis]] discovered [[homeotic]] genes, showed that many so-called [[toolkit gene]]s act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the ''[[Pax6]]'' gene is involved in forming the [[eye]]s of mice and of fruit flies. Such [[deep homology]] provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2000&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S. F. |title=A New Evolutionary Synthesis |work=Developmental Biology |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10128/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later syntheses==

In 1982, a historical note on a series of evolutionary biology books{{efn|In a reissue of Dobzhansky's ''Genetics and the Origin of Species''.}} could state without qualification that evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. Smocovitis commented on this that "What the architects of the synthesis had worked to construct had by 1982 become a matter of fact", adding in a footnote that "the centrality of evolution had thus been rendered [[tacit knowledge]], part of the [[received wisdom]] of the profession".{{sfn|Smocovitis|1996|pp=186–187}}

By the late 20th century, however, the modern synthesis was showing its age, and fresh syntheses to remedy its defects and fill in its gaps were proposed from different directions. These have included such diverse fields as the [[sociology|study of society]],&lt;ref name=YudellDesalle2000/&gt; developmental biology,&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991/&gt; epigenetics,&lt;ref name=pigliucci/&gt; [[molecular biology]], [[microbiology]], [[genomics]],&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; [[symbiogenesis]], and [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt; The physiologist [[Denis Noble]] argues that these additions render neo-Darwinism in the sense of the early 20th century's modern synthesis "at the least, incomplete as a theory of evolution",&lt;ref name=Noble2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Denis |title=Neo-Darwinism, the Modern Synthesis and selfish genes: are they of use in physiology? |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=589 |issue=5 |year=2011 |pages=1007–1015 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201384|pmc=3060581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one that has been falsified by later biological research.&lt;ref name=Noble2011/&gt;

Michael Rose and Todd Oakley note that evolutionary biology, formerly divided and "[[Balkanization|Balkanized]]", has been brought together by genomics. It has in their view discarded at least five common assumptions from the modern synthesis, namely that the genome is always a well-organised set of genes; that each gene has a single function; that species are well adapted biochemically to their ecological niches; that species are the durable units of evolution, and  all levels from organism to organ, cell and molecule within the species are characteristic of it; and that the design of every organism and cell is efficient. They argue that the "new biology" integrates genomics, [[bioinformatics]], and evolutionary genetics into a general-purpose toolkit for a "Postmodern Synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=Michael R. |authorlink1=Michael R.

===Pigliucci's extended evolutionary synthesis, 2007===
{{main|Extended evolutionary synthesis}}

In 2007, more than half a century after the modern synthesis, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] called for an [[extended evolutionary synthesis]] to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wade | first1=Michael J. | year=2011 | title=The Neo-Modern Synthesis: The Confluence of New Data and Explanatory Concepts | url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/61/5/407.full | journal=BioScience | volume=61 | issue=5| pages=407–408 | doi=10.1525/bio.2011.61.5.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smee 2015"&gt;John Odling-Smee ''et al''.

===Koonin's 'post-modern' evolutionary synthesis, 2009===
[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|A 21st century [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] showing [[horizontal gene transfer]]s among [[prokaryote]]s and the saltational [[endosymbiosis]] events that created the [[eukaryote]]s, neither fitting into the 20th century's modern synthesis]]

In 2009, Darwin's 200th anniversary, the ''Origin of Species''{{'}} 150th, and the 200th of Lamarck's "early evolutionary synthesis",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; ''[[Philosophie Zoologique]]'', the evolutionary biologist [[Eugene Koonin]] stated that while "the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair",&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; a new 21st century synthesis could be glimpsed. Three interlocking revolutions had, he argued, taken place in evolutionary biology: molecular, microbiological, and genomic. The [[molecular biology|molecular revolution]] included the neutral theory, that most mutations are neutral and that purifying selection happens more often than the positive form, and that all current life evolved from [[Last Universal Common Ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. In microbiology, the synthesis has expanded to cover the [[prokaryote]]s, using [[ribosomal RNA]] to form a [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. Finally, [[genomics]] brought together the molecular and microbiological syntheses, noting that a molecular view shows that the tree of life is problematic.  In particular, [[horizontal gene transfer]] between [[bacteria]] means that prokaryotes freely share genes, challenging Mayr's foundational definition of [[species]]. Further, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and "momentous events" like [[endosymbiosis]] enable evolution to proceed in sudden jumps, ending the old gradualist-saltationist debate by showing that on this point Darwin's gradualism was wrong. The idea of [[progressionism|progress in biology]], too, is seen to be wrong, along with the modern synthesis belief in [[pan-adaptationism]], that everything is optimally adapted: genomes plainly are not.&lt;ref name=Koonin2009/&gt; Many of these points had already been made by other researchers such as Ulrich Kutschera and [[Karl J. Niklas]].&lt;ref name="Kutschera"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

===Towards a replacement synthesis===
[[File:Modern Synthesis Limits.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|Inputs to the modern synthesis, with other topics (inverted colours) such as developmental biology that were not joined with evolutionary biology until the turn of the 21st century]]

Biologists, alongside scholars of the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book ''Challenging the Modern Synthesis'' that numerous theorists had pointed out that the disciplines of embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They noted that all such arguments amounted to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that united "all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=72EwDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76 |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=76 (Chapter 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They observed further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first is that other modes such as [[epigenetic inheritance]], [[phenotypic plasticity]], the [[Baldwin effect]], and the [[maternal effect]] allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on, and for the genes to catch up with the new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a [[Developmental systems theory|developmental system]]: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huneman |first1=Philippe |last2=Walsh |first2=Denis M. |title=Challenging the Modern Synthesis: Adaptation, Development, and Inheritance  |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-068145-6 |pages=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiography==

Looking back at the conflicting accounts of the modern synthesis, the historian Betty Smocovitis notes in her 1996 book ''Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology'' that both historians and philosophers of biology have attempted to grasp its scientific meaning, but have found it "a moving target";&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; the only thing they agreed on was that it was a historical event.&lt;ref name=Smocovitis187/&gt; In her words "by the late 1980s the notoriety of the evolutionary synthesis was recognized . . . So notorious did 'the synthesis' become, that few serious historically minded analysts would touch the subject, let alone know where to begin to sort through the interpretive mess left behind by the numerous critics and commentators".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smocovitis|1996|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Human history}}
'''Modernity''', a topic in the humanities and social sciences, is both a historical period (the [[modern era]]), as well as the ensemble of particular socio-cultural [[norm (social)|norms]], attitudes and practices that arose in the wake of the [[Renaissance]]{{mdash}}in the "[[Age of Reason]]" of 17th-century thought and the 18th-century "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]". Some commentators consider the era of modernity to have ended by 1930, with [[World War II]] in 1945, or the 1980s or 1990s; the following era is called [[postmodernity]]. The term "[[contemporary history]]" is also used to refer to the post-1945 timeframe, without assigning it to either the modern or postmodern era.  (Thus "modern" may be used as a name of a particular era in the past, as opposed to meaning "the current era".)

Depending on the field, "modernity" may refer to different time periods or qualities.  In historiography, the 17th and 18th centuries are usually described as [[early modern]], while the [[long 19th century]] corresponds to "[[modern history]]" proper. While it includes a wide range of interrelated historical processes and cultural phenomena (from [[fashion]] to [[modern warfare]]), it can also refer to the subjective or existential experience of the conditions they produce, and their ongoing impact on human culture, institutions, and politics {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

As an analytical concept and [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] ideal, modernity is closely linked to the [[ethos]] of philosophical and aesthetic [[modernism]]; political and intellectual currents that intersect with the Enlightenment; and subsequent developments such as [[existentialism]], [[modern art]], the formal establishment of [[social science]], and contemporaneous antithetical developments such as [[Marxism]].  It also encompasses the social relations associated with the rise of capitalism, and shifts in attitudes associated with secularisation and post-industrial [[Personal life|life]] {{harv|Berman|2010|loc=15–36}}.

In the view of [[Michel Foucault|Michel]] {{harvtxt|Foucault|1975}} (classified as a proponent of [[postmodernism]] though he himself rejected the "postmodernism" label, considering his work as a "a critical history of modernity"{{mdash}}see, e.g., {{harvnb|Call|2002|loc=65}}), "modernity" as a historical category is marked by developments such as a questioning or rejection of [[tradition]]; the prioritization of [[individualism]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[equality before the law|formal equality]]; faith in inevitable social, scientific and technological [[progress (history)|progress]], [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and [[professionalization]], a movement from [[feudalism]] (or [[agrarianism]]) toward [[capitalism]] and the [[market economy]], [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[secularization]], the development of the [[nation-state]], [[representative democracy]], [[public education]] (etc.) {{harv|Foucault|1977|loc=170–77&lt;!--wrong for the Penguin edition, at any rate--&gt;}}.

In the context of [[art history]], "modernity" (''modernité'') has a more limited sense, "[[modern art]]" covering the period of c. 1860–1970. Use of the term in this sense is  attributed to [[Charles Baudelaire]], who in his 1864 essay "The Painter of Modern Life", designated the "fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis", and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. In this sense, the term refers to "a particular relationship to time, one characterized by intense historical discontinuity or rupture, openness to the novelty of the future, and a heightened sensitivity to what is unique about the present" {{harv|Kompridis|2006|loc=32–59}}.

==Etymology==
The [[Late Latin]] adjective ''[[:wikt:modernus#Latin|modernus]]'', a derivation from the adverb ''[[:wikt:modo#Latin|modo]]'' "presently, just now", is attested from the 5th century, at first in the context of distinguishing the [[Ancient Roman Christianity|Christian era]] from the [[Decline of Greco-Roman paganism|pagan era]]. 
In the 6th century, [[Cassiodorus]] appears to have been the first writer to use ''modernus'' "modern" regularly to refer to his own age {{harv|O'Donnell|1979|loc=235 n9}}. 
The terms ''antiquus'' and ''modernus'' were used in a chronological sense in the [[Carolingian era]]. For example, a ''magister modernus'' referred to a contemporary scholar, as opposed to old authorities such as [[Benedict of Nursia]]. In early medieval usage, ''modernus'' referred to authorities younger than pagan antiquity and the early church fathers, but not necessarily to the present day, and could include authors several centuries old, from about the time of [[Beda]], i.e. referring to the time after the foundation of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] and/or the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] {{harv|Hartmann|1974|loc=passim}}.

The Latin adjective was adopted in  [[Middle French]], as ''moderne'', by the 15th century, and hence, in the early [[Tudor period]], into [[Early Modern English]].
The early modern word meant "now existing", or "pertaining to the present times", not necessarily with a positive connotation.
[[Shakespeare]] uses ''modern'' in the sense of "every-day, ordinary, commonplace".

The word entered wide usage in the context of the  late 17th-century [[quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] within the [[Académie française]], debating the question of "Is Modern culture superior to Classical (Græco–Roman) culture?"
In the context of this debate, the "ancients" (''anciens'') and "moderns" (''modernes'') were proponents of opposing views, the former believing that contemporary writers could do no better than imitate the genius of classical antiquity, while the latter, 
first with [[Charles Perrault]] (1687), proposed that more than a mere "[[Renaissance]]" of ancient achievements, the "[[17th-century philosophy|Age of Reason]]" had gone beyond what had been possible in the classical period. 
The term [[:wikt:modernity|modernity]], first coined in the 1620s, in this context assumed the implication of a historical epoch following the Renaissance, in which the achievements of antiquity were surpassed {{harv|Delanty| 2007}}.

==Phases&lt;!--'Phases of modernity' redirects here; section linked from 'Contemporary history'--&gt;==
Modernity has been associated with cultural and [[intellectual]] movements of 1436–1789 and extending to the 1970s or later {{harv|Toulmin|1992|loc=3–5}}.

According to [[Marshall Berman|Marshall]] {{harvtxt|Berman|1982|loc=16–17}}, modernity is periodized into three conventional phases (dubbed "Early," "Classical," and "Late," respectively, by Peter {{harvtxt|Osborne|1992|loc=25}}):

* [[Early modern period|Early modernity]]: 1500–1789 (or 1453–1789 in traditional historiography)
* Classical modernity: 1789–1900 (corresponding to the [[long 19th century]] (1789–1914) in [[Eric Hobsbawm|Hobsbawm]]'s scheme)
* Late modernity: 1900–1989

In the second phase Berman draws upon the growth of modern technologies such as the newspaper, telegraph and other forms of mass media. There was a great shift into modernization in the name of industrial capitalism. Finally in the third phase, modernist arts and individual creativity marked the beginning of a new modernist age  as it combats oppressive politics, economics as well as other social forces including mass media {{harv|Laughey|2007|loc=30}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;!--Citations are needed to the relevant writings of Berman, not just to a tertiary source (namely Laughey 2007).--&gt;

Some authors, such as [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]] and [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} believe that modernity ended in the mid- or late 20th century and thus have defined a period subsequent to modernity, namely [[Postmodernity]] (1930s/1950s/1990s–present). Other theorists, however, regard the period from the late 20th century to the present as merely another phase of modernity; [[Zygmunt Bauman|Zygmunt]] {{harvtxt|Bauman|1989}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--Or is this in Bauman 2000, or both?--&gt; calls this phase [[Liquid modernity|"liquid" modernity]], {{harvtxt|Giddens|1998}}{{Page needed|date=September 2014}} labels it "high" modernity (see [[High modernism]]).

==Definition==

===Political===
Politically, modernity's earliest phase starts with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s works which openly rejected the medieval and Aristotelian style of analyzing politics by comparison with ideas about how things should be, in favour of realistic analysis of how things really are. He also proposed that an aim of politics is to control one's own chance or fortune, and that relying upon providence actually leads to evil. Machiavelli argued, for example, that violent divisions within political communities are unavoidable, but can also be a source of strength which lawmakers and leaders should account for and even encourage in some ways {{harv|Strauss|1987}}.

Machiavelli's recommendations were sometimes influential upon kings and princes, but eventually came to be seen as favoring free republics over monarchies {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=1}}. Machiavelli in turn influenced [[Francis Bacon]] {{harv|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[Marchamont Needham]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}), [[John Milton]] {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, [[David Hume]] {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}, and many others {{harv|Strauss|1958}}.

Important modern political doctrines which stem from the new Machiavellian realism include [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville]]'s influential proposal that "''Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits''" (the last sentence of his ''[[Fable of the Bees]]''), and also the doctrine of a constitutional "[[separation of powers]]" in government, first clearly proposed by [[Montesquieu]]. Both these principles are enshrined within the [[constitution]]s of most [[modern democracy|modern democracies]]. It has been observed that while Machiavelli's realism saw a value to war and political violence, his lasting influence has been "tamed" so that useful conflict was deliberately converted as much as possible to formalized political struggles and the economic "conflict" encouraged between free, private enterprises ({{harvnb|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 5{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}; {{harvnb|Mansfield|1989}}).

Starting with [[Thomas Hobbes]], attempts were made to use the methods of the new modern physical sciences, as proposed by [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]] and [[Descartes]], applied to humanity and politics {{harv|Berns|1987}}. Notable attempts to improve upon the methodological approach of Hobbes include those of [[John Locke]] {{harv|Goldwin|1987}}, [[Spinoza]] {{harv|Rosen|1987}}, [[Giambattista Vico|Giambattista]] {{harvtxt|Vico|1984|loc=xli}}, and {{harvtxt|Rousseau|1997|loc=part 1}}. [[David Hume]] made what he considered to be the first proper attempt at trying to apply Bacon's scientific method to political subjects {{harv|Hume|1896 [1739]|loc=''intro.''}}, rejecting some aspects of the approach of Hobbes.

Modernist republicanism openly influenced the foundation of republics during the [[Dutch Revolt]] (1568–1609) {{harv|Bock, Skinner, and Viroli|1990|loc=chapt. 10,12{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive pages.--&gt;}}, [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 1{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, [[American Revolution]] (1775–1783) {{harv|Rahe|2006|loc=chapt. 6–11{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}, the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799), and the Haitian revolution (1791–1804). {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 8{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}.

A second phase of modernist political thinking begins with Rousseau, who questioned the natural rationality and sociality of humanity and proposed that [[human nature]] was much more malleable than had been previously thought. By this logic, what makes a good political system or a good man is completely dependent upon the chance path a whole people has taken over history. This thought influenced the political (and aesthetic) thinking of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Edmund Burke]] and others and led to a critical review of modernist politics. On the conservative side, Burke argued that this understanding encouraged caution and avoidance of radical change. However more ambitious movements also developed from this insight into human [[culture]], initially [[Romanticism]] and [[Historicism]], and eventually both the [[Communism]] of [[Karl Marx]], and the modern forms of [[nationalism]] inspired by the [[French Revolution]], including, in one extreme, the German [[Nazi]] movement {{harv|Orwin and Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

On the other hand, the notion of modernity has been contested also due to its Euro-centric underpinnings. This is further aggravated by the re-emergence of non-Western powers. Yet, the contestations about modernity are also linked with Western notions of democracy, social discipline, and development {{harv|Regilme|2012|loc=96}}.

===Sociological===
[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of the original German edition of [[Max Weber]]'s ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]
In [[sociology]], a discipline that arose in direct response to the social problems of "modernity" {{harv|Harriss|2000|loc=325}}, the term most generally refers to the social conditions, processes, and discourses consequent to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In the most basic terms, [[Anthony Giddens]] describes modernity as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...a shorthand term for modern society, or industrial civilization. Portrayed in more detail, it is associated with (1) a certain set of attitudes towards the world, the idea of the world as open to transformation, by human intervention; (2) a complex of economic institutions, especially industrial production and a market economy; (3) a certain range of political institutions, including the nation-state and mass democracy. Largely as a result of these characteristics, modernity is vastly more dynamic than any previous type of social order. It is a society—more technically, a complex of [[institution]]s—which, unlike any preceding culture, lives in the future, rather than the past {{harv|Giddens|1998|loc=94}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other writers have criticized such definitions as just being a listing of factors. They argue that modernity, contingently understood as marked by an ontological formation in dominance, needs to be defined much more fundamentally in terms of different ways of being. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The modern is thus defined by the way in which prior valences of social life ... are reconstituted through a constructivist reframing of social practices in relation to basic categories of existence common to all humans: time, space, embodiment, performance and knowledge. The word 'reconstituted' here explicitly does not mean replaced. {{harv|James|2015|loc= 51–52}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This means that modernity overlays earlier formations of traditional and customary life without necessarily replacing them.

===Cultural and philosophical===
The era of modernity is characterised socially by industrialisation and the division of labour and philosophically by "the loss of certainty, and the realization that certainty can never be established, once and for all" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}. With new social and philosophical conditions arose fundamental new challenges. Various 19th-century intellectuals, from [[Auguste Comte]] to [[Karl Marx]] to [[Sigmund Freud]], attempted to offer scientific and/or political ideologies in the wake of secularisation. Modernity may be described as the "age of ideology." {{harv|Calinescu|1987|loc=2006}}.

{{Quote|For Marx, what was the basis of modernity was the emergence of capitalism and the revolutionary bourgeoisie, which led to an unprecedented expansion of productive forces and to the creation of the world market. [[Durkheim]] tackled modernity from a different angle by following the ideas of Saint-Simon about the industrial system. Although the starting point is the same as Marx, feudal society, Durkheim emphasizes far less the rising of the bourgeoisie as a new revolutionary class and very seldom refers to capitalism as the new mode of production implemented by it. The fundamental impulse to modernity is rather industrialism accompanied by the new scientific forces. In the work of [[Max Weber]], modernity is closely associated with the processes of rationalization and disenchantment of the world. {{harv|Larraín|2000|loc=13}}}}

[[Critical theory|Critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Zygmunt Bauman]] propose that modernity or industrialization represents a departure from the central tenets of the Enlightenment and towards nefarious processes of [[social alienation|alienation]], such as [[commodity fetishism]] and the [[Holocaust]] ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|1989}}). Contemporary sociological [[critical theory]] presents the concept of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]" in even more negative terms than those Weber originally defined. Processes of rationalization—as progress for the sake of progress—may in many cases have what critical theory says is a negative and dehumanising effect on modern society. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}; {{harvnb|Bauman|2000}})

{{Quote|Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth radiates under the sign of disaster triumphant. ({{harvnb|Adorno|1973|loc=210}})}}

{{Quote|What prompts so many commentators to speak of the 'end of history', of post-modernity, 'second modernity' and 'surmodernity', or otherwise to articulate the intuition of a radical change in the arrangement of human cohabitation and in social conditions under which life-politics is nowadays conducted, is the fact that the long effort to accelerate the speed of movement has presently reached its 'natural limit'. Power can move with the speed of the electronic signal – and so the time required for the movement of its essential ingredients has been reduced to instantaneity. For all practical purposes, power has become truly exterritorial, no longer bound, or even slowed down, by the resistance of space (the advent of cellular telephones may well serve as a symbolic 'last blow' delivered to the dependency on space: even the access to a telephone market is unnecessary for a command to be given and seen through to its effect. {{harv|Bauman|2000|loc=10}}}}

Consequent to debate about [[economic globalization]], the comparative analysis of civilizations, and the post-colonial perspective of "alternative modernities," [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] introduced the concept of "multiple modernities" ({{harvnb|Eisenstadt|2003}}; see also {{harvnb|Delanty|2007}}). Modernity as a "plural condition" is the central concept of this sociologic approach and perspective, which broadens the definition of "modernity" from exclusively denoting Western European culture to a [[cultural relativism|culturally relativistic]] definition, thereby: "Modernity is not Westernization, and its key processes and dynamics can be found in all societies" {{harv|Delanty|2007}}.

===Secularization===
Modernity, or the Modern Age, is typically defined as a post-[[traditional]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} and post-[[medieval]] historical period ({{harvnb|Heidegger|1938|loc=66–67}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QImd2ARqQPMC&amp;pg=PA66 66–67]). Central to modernity is emancipation from [[religion]], specifically the hegemony of [[Christianity]], and the consequent secularization. Modern thought repudiates the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief in the Biblical God as a mere relic of superstitious ages ({{harvnb|Fackenheim|1957|loc=272-73}}; {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}}, {{Page needed|date=February 2012}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Fackenheim|1967|loc=272–73}}: {{quotation|But there does seem to be a necessary conflict between modern thought and the Biblical belief in revelation. All claims of revelation, modern science and philosophy seem agreed, must be repudiated, as mere relics of superstitious ages. ... [to a modern phylosopher] The Biblical God...was a mere myth of bygone ages.}} Quotation from {{harvnb|Husserl|1931}},{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}: {{quotation|When, with the beginning of modern times, religious belief was becoming more and more externalized as a lifeless convention, men of intellect were lifted by a new belief, their great belief in an autonomous philosophy and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It all started with Descartes' revolutionary [[methodic doubt]], which transformed the concept of truth in the concept of certainty, whose only guarantor is no longer God or the Church, but Man's subjective judgement ({{harvnb|Alexander|1931|loc=484-85}}; {{harvnb|Heidegger|1938}}, {{Page needed|date=September 2014}}).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from Heidegger 1938{{Page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;!--If this English version is taken from one of the two mentioned published translations, then that edition should be cited instead of the German one; otherwise the grammatical and spelling mistakes cannot be verified.--&gt;: {{quotation|The essence of modernity can be seen in humanity's freeing itself from the bonds of Middle Ages... Certainly the modern age has, as a consequence of the liberation of humanity, introduced subjectivism and indivisualism. ... For up to Descartes... The claim [of a self-supported, unshakable foundation of truth, in the sense of certainty] originates in that emancipation of man in which he frees himself from obligation to Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine to a legislating for himself that takes its stand upon itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologians have tried to cope with their worry that Western modernism has brought the world to no longer being well-disposed towards Christianity ({{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA262 262]; {{harvnb|Davies|2004|loc=133}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G26xfiuhCmIC&amp;pg=PA133 133]; {{harvnb|Cassirer|1944|loc=13–14}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=x46qiaccZLYC&amp;pg=PA14 13–14]).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Quotation from {{harvnb|Kilby|2004|loc=262}}: {{quotation|... a cluster of issues surrounding the assessment of modernity and of the apologetic task of theology in modernity. Both men [Rahner and Balthasar] were deeply concerned with apologetics, with the question of how to present Christianity in a world which is no longer well-disposed towards it. ... both thought that modernity raised particular problems for being a believing Christian, and therefore for apologetics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modernity aimed towards "a progressive force promising to liberate humankind from ignorance and irrationality" {{harv|Rosenau|1992|loc=5}}.

===Scientific===
{{Main|Modern science}}
In the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Galileo]] and others developed a new approach to physics and astronomy which changed the way people came to think about many things. Copernicus presented new models of the [[solar system]] which no longer placed humanity's home, on [[Earth]], in the centre. Kepler used mathematics to discuss physics and described regularities of nature this way. Galileo actually made his famous proof of uniform acceleration in [[freefall]] using mathematics ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Francis Bacon]], especially in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', argued for a new experimental based approach to science, which sought no knowledge of [[four causes|formal or final causes]], and was therefore [[materialism|materialist]], like the ancient philosophy of [[Democritus]] and [[Epicurus]]. But he also added a theme that science should seek to control nature for the sake of humanity, and not seek to understand it just for the sake of understanding. In both these things he was influenced by Machiavelli's earlier criticism of medieval [[Scholasticism]], and his proposal that leaders should aim to control their own fortune ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 1,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

Influenced both by Galileo's new physics and Bacon, [[René Descartes]] argued soon afterward that [[mathematics]] and [[geometry]] provided a model of how scientific knowledge could be built up in small steps. He also argued openly that human beings themselves could be understood as complex machines ({{harvnb|Kennington|2004|loc=chapt. 6{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with inclusive page numbers.--&gt;}}).

[[Isaac Newton]], influenced by Descartes, but also, like Bacon, a proponent of experimentation, provided the archetypal example of how both [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[mathematics]], [[geometry]] and [[theory|theoretical]] [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] on the one hand, and [[Baconian method|Baconian]] [[scientific method|experimental observation]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] on the other hand, together could lead to great advances in the practical understanding of regularities in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] ({{harvnb|d'Alembert|2009 [1751]}}; {{harvnb|Henry|2004}}).

===Artistic===
{{Main|Modern art}}

After modernist political thinking had already become widely known in France, [[Rousseau]]'s re-examination of human nature led to a new criticism of the value of [[reason]]ing itself which in turn led to a new understanding of less rationalistic human activities, especially the arts. The initial influence was upon the movements known as [[German Idealism]] and [[Romanticism]] in the 18th and 19th century. Modern art therefore belongs only to the later phases of modernity {{harv|Orwinand Tarcov|1997|loc=chapt. 2,4{{Page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--Replace chapter number with specific page citation.--&gt;}}.

For this reason [[art history]] keeps the term "modernity" distinct from the terms [[Modern History|Modern Age]] and [[Modernism]] – as a discrete "term applied to the cultural condition in which the seemingly absolute necessity of [[innovation]] becomes a primary fact of life, work, and thought". And modernity in art "is more than merely the state of being modern, or the opposition between old and new" {{harv|Smith|2009}}.

In the [[essay]] "The Painter of Modern Life" (1864)&lt;!--NB: Baudelaire died in 1867, do not confuse this date of original composition with the year of publication of the English edition of Baudelaire's writings.--&gt;, Charles Baudelaire gives a literary definition: "By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent" {{harv|Baudelaire|1964|loc=13}}.

Advancing technological innovation, affecting artistic technique and the means of manufacture, changed rapidly the possibilities of art and its status in a rapidly changing society.  Photography challenged the place of the painter and painting.  Architecture was transformed by the availability of steel for structures.

===Theological===
From theologian [[Thomas C. Oden]]'s perspective, "modernity" is marked by "four fundamental values" {{harv|Hall|1990}}: 
* "Moral relativism (which says that what is right is dictated by culture, social location, and situation)"
* "Autonomous individualism (which assumes that moral authority comes essentially from within)"
* "Narcissistic hedonism (which focuses on egocentric personal pleasure)"
* "Reductive naturalism (which reduces what is reliably known to what one can see, hear, and empirically investigate)"
Modernity rejects anything "old" and makes "novelty ... a criterion for truth." This results in a great "phobic response to anything antiquarian." In contrast, "classical Christian consciousness" resisted "novelty" {{harv|Hall|1990}}.

Pope Pius IX and Pope Pius X of the Roman Catholic Church claim that [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|Modernism]] (in a particular definition of the Catholic Church) is a danger to the Christian faith. Pope Pius IX compiled a [[Syllabus of Errors]] published on December 8, 1864 to describe his objections to Modernism {{harv|Pius IX|1864}}. Pope Pius X further elaborated on the characteristics and consequences of Modernism, from his perspective, in an encyclical entitled "[[Pascendi dominici gregis]]" (Feeding the Lord's Flock) on September 8, 1907 {{harv|Pius X|1907}}. Pascendi Dominici Gregis states that the principles of Modernism, taken to a logical conclusion, lead to atheism. The Roman Catholic Church was serious enough about the threat of Modernism that it required all Roman Catholic clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors and seminary professors to swear an [[Oath against modernism|Oath Against Modernism]]  {{harv|Pius X|1910}} from 1910 until this directive was rescinded in 1967.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--The 1910 source does not (and cannot) confirm the directive was rescinded in 1967.--&gt;

Of the available conceptual definitions in [[sociology]], modernity is "marked and defined by an obsession with '[[evidence]]'," [[visual culture]], and personal visibility {{harv|Leppert|2004|loc=19}}. Generally, the large-scale social integration constituting modernity, involves{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} the:
* increased movement of goods, [[Capital (economics)|capital]], people, and information among formerly discrete populations, and consequent influence beyond the local area
* increased formal social organization of mobile populaces, development of "circuits" on which they and their influence travel, and societal standardization conducive to socio-economic mobility
* increased specialization of the segments of society, i.e., [[division of labor]], and area inter-dependency
* increased level of excessive stratification in terms of social life of a modern man

{{see also|Character structure|good moral character}}
'''Moral character''' or '''character''' is an evaluation of an individual's stable [[Morality|moral]] qualities. The concept of ''character'' can imply a variety of attributes including the existence or lack of [[virtue]]s such as [[empathy]], [[courage]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], [[honesty]], and [[loyalty]], or of good behaviors or [[habit]]s. Moral character primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another—although on a cultural level, the set of moral behaviors to which a social group adheres can be said to unite and define it culturally as distinct from others. Psychologist Lawrence Pervin defines moral character as "a disposition to express behavior in consistent patterns of functions across a range of situations".&lt;ref&gt;Pervin 1994, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the philosopher George refers to moral character as the “sum of one’s moral habits and dispositions.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=George |first1=MI |title=What moral character is and is not. |journal=The Linacre quarterly |date=August 2017 |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=261-274 |doi=10.1080/00243639.2017.1338442 |pmid=28912619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The word "character" is derived from the Ancient Greek word "charaktêr", referring to a mark impressed upon a coin. Later it came to mean a point by which one thing was told apart from others.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"&gt;Timpe 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are two approaches when dealing with moral character: [[Normative ethics]] involve moral standards that exhibit right and wrong conduct. It is a test of proper behavior and determining what is right and wrong. [[Applied ethics]] involve specific and [[controversial]] issues along with a moral choice, and tend to involve situations where people are either for or against the issue.&lt;ref name="Timpe 2007"/&gt;

In 1982  [[V. Campbell]] and [[R. Bond]] proposed the following as major sources in influencing character and moral development: [[heredity]], early childhood experience, [[Role model|modeling]] by important adults and older youth, [[peer influence]], the general [[Environment (biophysical)|physical]] and [[social environment]], the [[communications media]], the teachings of [[schools]] and other institutions, and specific situations and roles that elicit corresponding behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, V., &amp; Bond, R. (1982). "Evaluation of a Character Education Curriculum". In D. McClelland (ed.), ''Education For Values''. (New York: Irvington Publishers). As described in Huitt, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] examines moral controversies relating to the social responsibilities of [[capitalist]] business practices, the moral status of [[corporate entities]], [[deceptive advertising]], [[insider trading]], [[employee rights]], [[job discrimination]], [[affirmative action]] and [[drug testing]].

In the military field, character is considered particularly relevant in the [[leadership]] development area. Military leaders should not only "know" theoretically the moral values but they must embody these values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milsci.ucsb.edu/sites/secure.lsit.ucsb.edu.mili.d7/files/sitefiles/fm6_22.pdf|title=FM-62: Leader Development|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Department of the Army|accessdate=18 December 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Character analysis ad.jpg|thumb|1915 magazine ad]]
The ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' provides a historical account of some important developments in philosophical approaches to moral character. A lot of attention is given to [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Karl Marx]]'s views, since they all follow the idea of moral character after the [[Greeks]]. Marx accepts Aristotle's insight that virtue and good character are based on a sense of [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]].

[[Plato]] believed that the [[soul]] is divided into three parts of desire: [[Rationality|Rational]], [[Appetitive]], or [[Spirited]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-character/ |title=Moral Character (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to have moral character, we must understand what contributes to our overall good and have our spirited and appetitive desires educated properly, so that they can agree with the guidance provided by the rational part of the soul.

[[Aristotle]] tells us that there are good people in the world.  These are those who exhibit [[excellence]]s – excellences of [[thought]] and excellences of character. His phrase for excellences of character – ''êthikai aretai'' – we usually translate as moral virtue or moral excellence. When we speak of a moral [[virtue]] or an excellence of character, the emphasis is on the combination of qualities that make an individual the sort of ethically admirable person that he is.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;  Aristotle defines virtuous character at the beginning of Book II in ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'': “Excellence of character, then, is a state concerned with choice, lying in a [[mean]] relative to us, this being determined by reason and in the way in which the man of [[practical wisdom]] would determine it. Now it is a mean between two [[vices]], that which depends on [[wikt:excess|excess]] and that which depends on [[wikt:Special:Search/defect|defect]]”. In Aristotle's view, good character is based on two naturally occurring psychological responses that most people experience without difficulty: our tendency to take [[pleasure]] from [[self-realizing]] activity and our tendency to form friendly feelings toward others under specific circumstances. Based on his view, virtually everyone is capable of becoming better and they are the ones [[Individual responsibility|responsible]] for actions that express (or could express) their character.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

[[Abraham Lincoln]] once said, "Character is like a [[tree]] and [[reputation]] like its [[shadow]]. The shadow is what we think of it; the tree is the real thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotationspage.com/subjects/character/ |title=Character Quotes |publisher=The Quotations Page |date= |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
[[File:Dublin Christ Church Cathedral Passage to Synod Hall Window Fruit of the Spirit 2012 09 26.jpg|thumb|Stained glass window at [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin]], depicting the ''Fruit of the Holy Spirit'' along with role models representing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dia.ie/works/view/57668/building/CO.+DUBLIN%2C+DUBLIN%2C+CHRISTCHURCH+PLACE%2C+CHRIST+CHURCH+CATHEDRAL+%28CI%29 |title=CO.

Christian character is also defined as exhibiting the "[[Fruit of the Holy Spirit]]": love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.{{Bibleref2c|Galatians|5:22-23|NIV}} Doctrines of [[Grace (Christianity)#Augustine versus Pelagius|grace]] and [[total depravity]] assert that – due to [[original sin]] – mankind, entirely or in part, was incapable of truly being good without God's intervention; otherwise at best, one could only mimic good behavior for selfish reasons.

==Scientific experiments==
The [[Milgram experiment]] was a study done in the early 1960s that helped measure a person's moral character. Subjects from different [[socio-economic group]]s were tested on their willingness to press a [[buzzer]] that caused a participant – posing as a [[Human subject research|subject]] – in another room to express great [[pain]] and distress for giving a wrong answer to a test question. When the subjects raised questions about what they are being asked to do, the [[experiment]]er applied mild pressure in the form of appealing to the need to complete the experiment. The Milgram experiment caused a huge amount of criticism among individuals.  In post-experiment interviews with subjects Milgram noted that many were completely convinced of the wrongness of what they were doing. Although the subjects may have had moral values, many were criticized on whether they were a truly moral character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment that was done in the United States in 1985, the moral character of a person was based on whether or not a person had found a [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]] in a [[public phone booth]]. The findings were that 87% of subjects who found a dime in a phone booth mailed a sealed and addressed envelope that was left at the booth in an apparent mistake by someone else, while only 4% of those who did not find a dime helped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Isen |last2= Levin|first1=Paula F. |first2= Alice M.|title=Further Studies on the Effect of Feeling Good on Helping|jstor=2786238|publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{Who|date=April 2011}} found it very troubling that people would be influenced by such morally [[trivia]]l factors in their choice whether to provide low-cost [[Aid|assistance]] to others. [[John M. Doris]] raises the issue of [[ecological validity]] – do experimental findings reflect [[phenomena]] found in natural [[Archaeological context|context]]s. He recognizes that these results are [[counterintuitive]] to the way most of us think about morally relevant behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1344 |title=Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior // Reviews // Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews // University of Notre Dame |publisher=Ndpr.nd.edu |date=2003-08-02 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another experiment that was done that asked [[college student]]s at [[Cornell]] to predict how they would behave when faced with one of several [[moral dilemma]]s, and to make the same [[prediction]]s for their [[Peer group|peer]]s. Again and again, people predicted that they would be more [[Generosity|generous]] and [[Kindness|kind]] than others. Yet when put into the moral dilemma, the subjects did not behave as generously or as kindly as they had predicted. In [[psychological terms]], the experimental subjects were successfully anticipating the base rate of moral behavior and accurately predicting how often others, in general, would be [[Self sacrifice|self-sacrificing]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of [[philosophers]] and [[social scientists]] began to question the very [[presuppositions]] that theories of moral character and moral character traits are based on. Due to the importance of moral character to issues in [[philosophy]], it is unlikely that the debates over the nature of moral character will disappear anytime soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm#H3 |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Situationism (psychology)|Situationism]] can be understood as composed of three central claims:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/m/moral-ch.htm |title=Moral Character |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |website=Iep.utm.edu |date=2008-10-09 |accessdate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Non-robustness Claim: moral character traits are not consistent across a wide spectrum of trait-relevant situations. Whatever moral character traits an individual has are situation specific.
*Consistency Claim: while a person’s moral character traits are relatively stable over time, this should be understood as consistency of situation specific traits, rather than robust traits.
*Fragmentation Claim: a person’s moral character traits do not have the [[evaluative]] [[integrity]] suggested by the Integrity Claim. There may be considerable disunity in a person’s moral character among his or her situation-specific character traits.

According to Situationists, the [[empirical]] evidence favors their view of moral character over the Traditional View. [[Hugh Hartshorne]] and [[M. A. May]]’s study of the trait of [[honesty]] among school [[children]] found no cross-situational [[correlation]]. A child may be consistently honest with his [[friendship|friends]], but not with his [[parents]] or [[teachers]]. From this and other studies, Hartshorne and May concluded that character traits are not [[wikt:robust|robust]] but rather “specific functions of life situations”.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A second challenge to the traditional view can be found in the idea of moral [[luck]]. This idea is that moral luck occurs when the moral judgment of an [[Moral agency|agent]] depends on factors beyond the agent’s control. Fiery Cushman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2219685|title=A Solution to the Problem of Moral Luck|first=Brynmor|last=Browne|date=1 January 1992|publisher=|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=42|issue=168|pages=345–56|doi=10.2307/2219685}}&lt;/ref&gt; clarifies that this is judgement of an outcome comprising both the agent's character and an unanticipated circumstance, rather than an agent's intent. There are number of ways that moral luck can motivate criticisms of moral character. It is similar to “the kind of problems and situations one faces”&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Nagel|Nagel, Thomas]] (1993). "Moral Luck," in ''Moral Luck'', ed. Daniel Statman ([[State University of New York Press]]): 57–61&lt;/ref&gt;  If all of an agent’s moral character traits are situation-specific rather than robust, what traits an agent manifests will depend on the situation that she finds herself in. But what situations an agent finds herself in is often beyond her control and thus a matter of situational luck. Whether moral character traits are robust or situation-specific, some have suggested that what character traits one has is itself a matter of luck. If our having certain traits is itself a matter of luck, this would seem to undermine one’s moral responsibility for one’s moral character, and thus the concept of moral character altogether. As [[Owen Flanagan]] and Amélie Oksenberg Rorty write:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
{{quote|It [the morality and meaning of an individual’s life] will depend on luck in an individual’s upbringing, the values she is taught, the [[self-control]]ling and self-constructing capacities her [[social environment]] enables and encourages her to develop, the moral challenges she faces or avoids. If all her character, not just [[temperamental traits]] and [[disposition]]s but also the reflexive capacities for self-control and self-construction, are matters of luck, then the very ideas of character and agency are in danger of [[evaporation]].}}

A moral character trait is a character trait for which the agent is morally responsible. If moral responsibility is impossible, however, then agents cannot be held responsible for their character traits or for the behaviors that they do as a result of those character traits.

A similar argument has also recently been advocated by [[Bruce Waller]]. According to Waller, no one is "morally responsible for her character or deliberative powers, or for the results that flow from them.… Given the fact that she was shaped to have such characteristics by [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] (or [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]]) forces far beyond her control, she deserves no [[blame]] [nor [[praise]]]".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

'''Non-equilibrium thermodynamics''' is a branch of [[thermodynamics]] that deals with physical systems that are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] but can be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation  of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Almost all systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium, for they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems and to chemical reactions. Some systems and processes are, however, in a useful sense, near enough to thermodynamic equilibrium to allow description with useful accuracy by currently known non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Nevertheless, many natural systems and processes will always remain far beyond the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods.{{Citation needed|reason=This assumes that non-equilibrium thermodynamic methods will not change over time.  ''Always'' is too broad.|date=April 2018}} This is because of the very small size of atoms, as compared with macroscopic systems.

The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by [[equilibrium thermodynamics]]. One fundamental difference between equilibrium thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics lies in the behaviour of inhomogeneous systems, which require for their study knowledge of rates of reaction which are not considered in equilibrium thermodynamics of homogeneous systems. This is discussed below. Another fundamental and very important difference is the difficulty or impossibility, in general, in defining [[entropy]] at an instant of time in macroscopic terms for systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium; it can be done, to useful approximation, only in carefully chosen special cases, namely those that are throughout in local thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"&gt;Grandy, W.T., Jr (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"&gt;Lebon, G., Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J. (2008). ''Understanding Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics: Foundations, Applications, Frontiers'', Springer-Verlag, Berlin, e-{{ISBN|978-3-540-74252-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics==

===Difference between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics===
A profound difference separates equilibrium from non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Equilibrium thermodynamics ignores the time-courses of physical processes. In contrast, non-equilibrium thermodynamics attempts to describe their time-courses in continuous detail.

Equilibrium thermodynamics restricts its considerations to processes that have initial and final states of thermodynamic equilibrium; the time-courses of processes are deliberately ignored. Consequently, equilibrium thermodynamics allows processes that pass through states far from thermodynamic equilibrium, that cannot be described even by the variables admitted for non-equilibrium thermodynamics,&lt;ref name="EY 5"&gt;[[Elliott H. Lieb|Lieb, E.H.]], [[Jakob Yngvason|Yngvason, J.]] (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; such as time rates of change of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1967/1970), pp.&amp;nbsp;8–12.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in equilibrium thermodynamics, a process is allowed to include even a violent explosion that cannot be described by non-equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="EY 5"/&gt; Equilibrium thermodynamics does, however, for theoretical development, use the idealized concept of the "quasi-static process".  A quasi-static process is a conceptual (timeless and physically impossible) smooth mathematical passage along a continuous path of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), §&amp;nbsp;4–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an exercise in differential geometry rather than a process that could occur in actuality.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, on the other hand, attempting to describe continuous time-courses, need its [[State function|state variables]] to have a very close connection with those of equilibrium thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971), Ch. {{math|II}},§&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; This profoundly restricts the scope of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and places heavy demands on its conceptual framework.

===Non-equilibrium state variables===
The suitable relationship that defines non-equilibrium thermodynamic state variables is as follows. On occasions when the system happens to be in states that are sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, non-equilibrium state variables are such that they can be measured locally with sufficient accuracy by the same techniques as are used to measure thermodynamic state variables, or by corresponding time and space derivatives, including fluxes of matter and energy. In general, non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems are spatially and temporally non-uniform, but their non-uniformity still has a sufficient degree of smoothness to support the existence of suitable time and space derivatives of non-equilibrium state variables. Because of the spatial non-uniformity, non-equilibrium state variables that correspond to extensive thermodynamic state variables have to be defined as spatial densities of the corresponding extensive equilibrium state variables. On occasions when the system is sufficiently close to thermodynamic equilibrium, intensive non-equilibrium state variables, for example temperature and pressure, correspond closely with equilibrium state variables. It is necessary that measuring probes be small enough, and rapidly enough responding, to capture relevant non-uniformity. Further, the non-equilibrium state variables are required to be mathematically functionally related to one another in ways that suitably resemble corresponding relations between equilibrium thermodynamic state variables.&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt; In reality, these requirements are very demanding, and it may be difficult or practically, or even theoretically, impossible to satisfy them. This is part of why non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress.

==Overview==
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.

Some concepts of particular importance for non-equilibrium thermodynamics include time rate of dissipation of energy (Rayleigh 1873,&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strutt | first1 = J.

One problem of interest is the thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium [[steady state]]s, in which [[entropy]] production and some [[flux|flows]] are non-zero, but there is no [[Time-variant system|time variation]] of physical variables.

One initial approach to non-equilibrium thermodynamics is sometimes called 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'.&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; There are other approaches to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, for example [[extended irreversible thermodynamics]],&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JCVL 1993"/&gt; and generalized thermodynamics,&lt;ref&gt;Eu, B.C. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; but they are hardly touched on in the present article.

===Quasi-radiationless non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter in laboratory conditions===

At laboratory temperatures, in laboratory quantities of matter, thermal radiation is weak and can be practically nearly ignored. But, for example, atmospheric physics is concerned with large amounts of matter, occupying cubic kilometers, that, taken as a whole, are not within the range of laboratory quantities; then thermal radiation cannot be ignored.

===Local equilibrium thermodynamics===
The terms 'classical irreversible thermodynamics'&lt;ref name="Lebon Jou Casas-Vázquez 2008"/&gt; and 'local equilibrium thermodynamics' are sometimes used to refer to a version of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that demands certain simplifying assumptions, as follows. The assumptions have the effect of making each very small volume element of the system effectively homogeneous, or well-mixed, or without an effective spatial structure, and without kinetic energy of bulk flow or of diffusive flux. Even within the thought-frame of classical irreversible thermodynamics, care&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt; is needed in choosing the independent variables&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1950/1954). ''Chemical Thermodynamics'', Longmans, Green &amp; Co, London, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; for systems. In some writings, it is assumed that the intensive variables of equilibrium thermodynamics are sufficient as the independent variables for the task (such variables are considered to have no 'memory', and do not show hysteresis); in particular, local flow intensive variables are not admitted as independent variables; local flows are considered as dependent on quasi-static local intensive variables.

Also it is assumed that the local entropy density is the same function of the other local intensive variables as in equilibrium; this is called the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavenda 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"&gt;Glansdorff, P., Prigogine, I. (1971). ''Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations'', Wiley-Interscience, London, 1971, {{ISBN|0-471-30280-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JCVL 1993"&gt;Jou, D., Casas-Vázquez, J., Lebon, G.

''Statistical Thermodynamics of Nonequilibrium Processes'', Springer-Verlag, New York, {{ISBN|0-387-96501-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Radiation is ignored because it is transfer of energy between regions, which can be remote from one another. In the classical irreversible thermodynamic approach, there is allowed very small spatial variation, from very small volume element to adjacent very small volume element, but it is assumed that the global entropy of the system can be found by simple spatial integration of the local entropy density; this means that spatial structure cannot contribute as it properly should to the global entropy assessment for the system. This approach assumes spatial and temporal continuity and even differentiability of locally defined intensive variables such as temperature and internal energy density. All of these are very stringent demands. Consequently, this approach can deal with only a very limited range of phenomena. This approach is nevertheless valuable because it can deal well with some macroscopically observable phenomena.{{examples|date=February 2015}}

In other writings, local flow variables are considered; these might be considered as classical by analogy with the time-invariant long-term time-averages of flows produced by endlessly repeated cyclic processes; examples with flows are in the [[thermoelectric effect|thermoelectric phenomena]] known as the Seebeck and the Peltier effects, considered by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in the nineteenth century and by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]] in the twentieth.&lt;ref name="De Groot Mazur 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008). ''Introduction to Modern Thermodynamics'', Wiley, Chichester UK, {{ISBN|978-0-470-01598-8}}, pages 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects occur at metal junctions, which were originally effectively treated as two-dimensional surfaces, with no spatial volume, and no spatial variation.

====Local equilibrium thermodynamics with materials with "memory"====
A further extension of local equilibrium thermodynamics is to allow that materials may have "memory", so that their [[constitutive equation]]s depend not only on present values but also on past values of local equilibrium variables. Thus time comes into the picture more deeply than for time-dependent local equilibrium thermodynamics with memoryless materials, but fluxes are not independent variables of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = B.D. | last2 = Noll | first2 = W. | year = 1963 | title = The thermodynamics of elastic materials with heat conduction and viscosity | url = | journal = Arch.

===Extended irreversible thermodynamics===
'''Extended irreversible thermodynamics''' is a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that goes outside the restriction to the local equilibrium hypothesis. The space of state variables is enlarged by including the [[flux]]es of mass, momentum and energy and eventually higher order fluxes.
The formalism is well-suited for describing high-frequency processes and small-length scales materials.

==Basic concepts==
There are many examples of stationary non-equilibrium systems, some very simple, like a system confined between two thermostats at different temperatures or the ordinary  [[Couette flow]], a fluid  enclosed between two flat walls moving in opposite directions and defining non-equilibrium conditions at the walls. [[Laser]] action is also a non-equilibrium process, but it depends on departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium and is thus beyond the scope of classical irreversible thermodynamics; here a strong temperature difference is maintained between two molecular degrees of freedom (with molecular laser,  vibrational and rotational molecular motion), the requirement for two component 'temperatures' in the one small region of space, precluding local thermodynamic equilibrium, which demands that only one temperature be needed. Damping of acoustic perturbations or shock waves are non-stationary non-equilibrium processes.  Driven [[complex fluids]], turbulent systems and glasses are other examples of non-equilibrium systems.

The mechanics of macroscopic systems depends on a number of extensive quantities. It should be stressed that all systems are permanently interacting with their surroundings, thereby causing unavoidable fluctuations of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es. Equilibrium conditions of thermodynamic systems are related to the maximum property of the entropy.  If the only extensive quantity that is allowed to fluctuate is the internal energy, all the other ones being kept strictly constant, the temperature of the system is measurable and meaningful. The system's properties are then most conveniently described using the thermodynamic potential [[Helmholtz free energy]] (''A'' = ''U'' - ''TS''), a  [[Legendre transformation]] of the energy. If, next to fluctuations of the energy, the macroscopic dimensions (volume) of the system are left fluctuating, we use the [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G'' = ''U'' + ''PV'' - ''TS''), where the system's properties are determined both by the temperature and by the pressure.

Non-equilibrium systems are much more complex and they may undergo fluctuations of more extensive quantities. The boundary conditions impose on them particular intensive variables, like temperature gradients or distorted collective motions (shear motions, vortices, etc.), often called thermodynamic forces. If free energies are very useful in equilibrium thermodynamics, it must be stressed that there is no general law defining stationary non-equilibrium properties of the energy as is the second law of thermodynamics for the [[entropy]] in equilibrium thermodynamics.  That is why in such cases a more generalized Legendre transformation should be considered. This is the extended Massieu potential.
By definition, the [[entropy]] (''S'') is a function of the collection of [[extensive quantity|extensive quantiti]]es &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;. Each extensive quantity has a conjugate intensive variable &lt;math&gt;I_i&lt;/math&gt; (a restricted definition of intensive variable is used here by comparison to the definition given in this link)  so that:

:&lt;math&gt; I_i = \partial{S}/\partial{E_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then define the extended [[Massieu function]] as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b M = S - \sum_i( I_i E_i),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ k_b&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], whence

:&lt;math&gt;\ k_b \, dM = \sum_i (E_i \, dI_i).&lt;/math&gt;

The independent variables are the intensities.

Intensities are global values, valid for the system as a whole. When boundaries impose to the system different local conditions, (e.g. temperature differences), there are intensive variables representing the average value and others representing gradients or higher moments. The latter are the thermodynamic forces driving fluxes of extensive properties through the system.

It may be shown that the Legendre transformation changes the maximum condition of the entropy (valid at equilibrium) in a minimum condition of the extended Massieu function for stationary states, no matter whether at equilibrium or not.

==Stationary states, fluctuations, and stability==
In thermodynamics one is often interested in a stationary state of a process, allowing that the stationary state include the occurrence of unpredictable and experimentally unreproducible fluctuations in the state of the system. The fluctuations are due to the system's internal sub-processes and to exchange of matter or energy with the system's surroundings that create the constraints that define the process.

If the stationary state of the process is stable, then the unreproducible fluctuations involve local transient decreases of entropy. The reproducible response of the system is then to increase the entropy back to its maximum by irreversible processes: the fluctuation cannot be reproduced with a significant level of probability. Fluctuations about stable stationary states are extremely small except near critical points (Kondepudi and Prigogine 1998, page 323).&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D., Prigogine, I, (1998). ''Modern Thermodynamics. From Heat Engines to Dissipative Structures'', Wiley, Chichester, 1998, {{ISBN|0-471-97394-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The stable stationary state has a local maximum of entropy and is locally the most reproducible state of the system. There are theorems about the irreversible dissipation of fluctuations. Here 'local' means local with respect to the abstract space of thermodynamic coordinates of state of the system.

If the stationary state is unstable, then any fluctuation will almost surely trigger the virtually explosive departure of the system from the unstable stationary state. This can be accompanied by increased export of entropy.

==Local thermodynamic equilibrium==
The scope of present-day non-equilibrium thermodynamics does not cover all physical processes. A condition for the validity of many studies in non-equilibrium thermodynamics of matter is that they deal with what is known as ''local thermodynamic equilibrium''.

===Local thermodynamic equilibrium of ponderable matter===
''Local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter''&lt;ref name="Gyarmati 1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G&amp;P 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balescu 1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mihalas Mihalas 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schloegl 1989"/&gt; (see also Keizer (1987)&lt;ref name="Keizer 1987"/&gt; means that conceptually, for study and analysis, the system can be spatially and temporally divided into 'cells' or 'micro-phases' of small (infinitesimal) size, in which classical thermodynamical equilibrium conditions for matter are fulfilled to good approximation. These conditions are unfulfilled, for example, in very rarefied gases, in which molecular collisions are infrequent; and in the boundary layers of a star, where radiation is passing energy to space; and for interacting fermions at very low temperature, where dissipative processes become ineffective. When these 'cells' are defined, one admits that matter and energy may pass freely between contiguous 'cells', slowly enough to leave the 'cells' in their respective individual local thermodynamic equilibria with respect to intensive variables.

One can think here of two 'relaxation times' separated by order of magnitude.&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"&gt;[[Dmitry Zubarev|Zubarev D. N.]],(1974). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SQy3AAAAIAAJ&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics]'', translated from the Russian by P.J. Shepherd, New York, Consultants Bureau. {{ISBN|0-306-10895-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-306-10895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The longer relaxation time is of the order of magnitude of times taken for the macroscopic dynamical structure of the system to change. The shorter is of the order of magnitude of times taken for a single 'cell' to reach local thermodynamic equilibrium. If these two relaxation times are not well separated, then the classical non-equilibrium thermodynamical concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium loses its meaning&lt;ref name="Zubarev 1971/1974"/&gt; and other approaches have to be proposed,  see for instance [[Extended irreversible thermodynamics]]. For example, in the atmosphere, the speed of sound is much greater than the wind speed; this favours the idea of local thermodynamic equilibrium of matter for atmospheric heat transfer studies at altitudes below about 60&amp;nbsp;km where sound propagates, but not above 100&amp;nbsp;km, where, because of the paucity of intermolecular collisions, sound does not propagate.

===Milne's 1928 definition of local thermodynamic equilibrium in terms of radiative equilibrium===
Milne (1928),&lt;ref name="Milne 1928"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Milne |first1= E.A. |year=1928 | title= The effect of collisions on monochromatic radiative equilibrium |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] | volume= 88|pages=493–502|bibcode=1928MNRAS..88..493M | doi = 10.1093/mnras/88.6.493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thinking about stars, gave a definition of 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in terms of the [[thermal radiation]] of the [[matter]] in each small local 'cell'. He defined 'local thermodynamic equilibrium' in a 'cell' by requiring that it macroscopically absorb and spontaneously emit radiation as if it were in radiative equilibrium in a cavity at the [[temperature]] of the matter of the 'cell'. Then it strictly obeys Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity, with a black body source function. The key to local thermodynamic equilibrium here is that the rate of collisions of ponderable matter particles such as molecules should far exceed the rates of creation and annihilation of photons.

==Entropy in evolving systems==

Grandy Jr that entropy, though it may be defined for a non-equilibrium system, is when strictly considered, only a macroscopic quantity that refers to the whole system, and is not a dynamical variable and in general does not act as a local potential that describes local physical forces. Under special circumstances, however, one can metaphorically think as if the thermal variables behaved like local physical forces. The approximation that constitutes classical irreversible thermodynamics is built on this metaphoric thinking.

This point of view shares many points in common with the concept and the use of entropy in continuum thermomechanics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Rational Thermodynamics | year = 1984 | last1 = Truesdell | first1 = Clifford | publisher = Springer | edition = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Continuum Thermomechanics | year = 2002 | last1 = Maugin | first1 = Gérard A. | publisher = Kluwer }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continua | year = 2010 | last1 = Gurtin | first1 = Morton E. | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Thermodynamics of Materials with Memory: Theory and Applications | year = 2012| last1 = Amendola | first1 = Giovambattista | publisher = Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt; which evolved completely independently of statistical mechanics and maximum-entropy principles.

===Entropy in non-equilibrium===

To describe deviation of the thermodynamic system from equilibrium, in addition to constitutive variables  &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ..., x_n&lt;/math&gt;  that are used to fix  the equilibrium state, as was described above, a set of variables &lt;math&gt;\xi_1, \xi_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;  that are called ''internal variables'' have been introduced. The equilibrium state is considered to be stable and the main property of the internal variables, as measures of [[non-equilibrium]] of the system, is their trending to disappear; the local law of disappearing can be written as relaxation equation for each internal variable
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\xi_i}{dt} = - \frac{1}{\tau_i} \, \left(\xi_i - \xi_i^{(0)} \right),\quad i =1,\,2,\ldots , 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where &lt;math&gt; \tau_i= \tau_i(T, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;  is a relaxation time of a corresponding variables. It is convenient to consider the initial value &lt;math&gt; \xi_i^0&lt;/math&gt;  are equal to zero. The above equation is valid for small deviations from equilibrium; The dynamics of internal variables in general case is considered by Pokrovskii&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;.    

Entropy of the system in  non-equilibrium is a function of the total set of variables 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
S=S(T, x_1, x_2, , x_n; \xi_1, \xi_2,  \ldots) 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The essential contribution to the thermodynamics of the  [[non-equilibrium systems]] was brought by [[Prigogine]],  when he and his collaborators  investigated the systems of  chemically reacting substances. The stationary  states of such systems exists due to exchange both particles and energy with the environment. In section 8 of the third chapter of his book &lt;ref&gt;[[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1955/1961/1967). ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes''. 3rd edition, Wiley Interscience, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;, Prigogine has specified three contributions to the variation of entropy of the considered system at the given volume and constant temperature &lt;math&gt; T&lt;/math&gt; . The increment of [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated according to the formula 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T\,dS = \Delta Q - \sum_{j} \, \Xi_{j} \,\Delta \xi_j  + \sum_{\alpha =1}^k\, \mu_\alpha \, \Delta N_\alpha.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The first term on the right hand side of the equation presents a stream of thermal energy into the  system;  the last term --  a stream of energy into the system coming with the stream of particles of substances  &lt;math&gt; \Delta N_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;  that can be positive or negative, &lt;math&gt; \mu_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;  is [[chemical potential]] of substance &lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.   The  middle term in (1) depicts [[ energy dissipation]] ([[entropy production]])  due to the  relaxation of internal variables &lt;math&gt; \xi_j&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of chemically  reacting substances, which  was investigated  by Prigogine, the internal variables appear to be measures of incompleteness of chemical reactions, that is  measures of how much  the considered system with chemical reactions is  out of equilibrium. The theory can be  generalised &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2005) Extended thermodynamics in a discrete-system approach,  Eur. J. Phys.  vol. 26,  769-781.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N.

Stöcker (1997), ''Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (Classical Theoretical Physics)'' ,Springer-Verlag, New York, '''P85, 91, 101,108,116''', {{ISBN|0-387-94299-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;dS=\frac{1}{T}dU+\frac{p}{T}dV-\sum_{i=1}^s\frac{\mu_i}{T}dN_i&lt;/math&gt;

expresses the change in [[entropy]] &lt;math&gt;dS&lt;/math&gt; of a system as a function of the intensive quantities [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[chemical potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the differentials of the extensive quantities [[energy]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; [[particle number]] &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Following Onsager (1931,I),&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; let us extend our considerations to thermodynamically non-equilibrium systems. As a basis, we need locally defined versions of the extensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; and of the intensive macroscopic quantities &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;.

For classical non-equilibrium studies, we will consider some new locally defined intensive macroscopic variables. We can, under suitable conditions, derive these new variables by locally defining the gradients and flux densities of the basic locally defined macroscopic quantities.

Such locally defined gradients of intensive macroscopic variables are called 'thermodynamic forces'. They 'drive' flux densities, perhaps misleadingly often called 'fluxes', which are dual to the forces. These quantities are defined in the article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]].
 
Establishing the relation between such forces and flux densities is a problem in statistical mechanics. Flux densities (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) may be coupled. The article on [[Onsager reciprocal relations]] considers the stable near-steady thermodynamically non-equilibrium regime, which has dynamics linear in the forces and flux densities.

In stationary conditions, such forces and associated flux densities are by definition time invariant, as also are the system's locally defined entropy and rate of entropy production. Notably, according to [[Ilya Prigogine]] and others, when an open system is in conditions that allow it to reach a stable stationary thermodynamically non-equilibrium state, it organizes itself so as to minimize total entropy production defined locally. This is considered further below.

One wants to take the analysis to the further stage of describing the behaviour of surface and volume integrals of non-stationary local quantities; these integrals are macroscopic fluxes and production rates. In general the dynamics of these integrals are not adequately described by linear equations, though in special cases they can be so described.

==The Onsager relations==
{{Main article|Onsager reciprocal relations}}
Following Section III of Rayleigh (1873),&lt;ref name="Rayleigh 1873"/&gt; Onsager (1931, I)&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; showed that in the regime where both the flows (&lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt;) are small and the thermodynamic forces (&lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;) vary slowly, the rate of creation of entropy &lt;math&gt;(\sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is [[linear relation|linearly related]] to the flows:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_i J_i\frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

and the flows are related to the gradient of the forces, parametrized by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients conventionally denoted &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i =  \sum_{j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma =  \sum_{i,j} L_{ij} \frac{\partial F_i}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial F_j}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]. [[Statistical mechanics]] considerations involving microscopic reversibility of dynamics imply that the matrix &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]]. This fact is called the ''Onsager reciprocal relations''.

The generalization of the above equations for the rate of creation of entropy was given by Pokrovskii  &lt;ref&gt; Pokrovskii V.N. (2013) A derivation of the main relations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Hindawi Publishing Corporation: ISRN Thermodynamics, vol. 2013, article ID 906136, 9 p.  https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/906136. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Speculated extremal principles for non-equilibrium processes==
{{main article|Extremal principles in non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Until recently, prospects for useful extremal principles in this area have seemed clouded. C. Nicolis (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/qj.49712555718 | last1 = Nicolis | first1 = C. | year = 1999 | title = Entropy production and dynamical complexity in a low-order atmospheric model | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society | volume = 125 | issue = 557| pages = 1859–1878 |bibcode = 1999QJRMS.125.1859N }}&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that one model of atmospheric dynamics has an attractor which is not a regime of maximum or minimum dissipation; she says this seems to rule out the existence of a global organizing principle, and comments that this is to some extent disappointing; she also points to the difficulty of finding a thermodynamically consistent form of entropy production. Another top expert offers an extensive discussion of the possibilities for principles of extrema of entropy production and of dissipation of energy: Chapter 12 of Grandy (2008)&lt;ref name="Grandy 2008"/&gt; is very cautious, and finds difficulty in defining the 'rate of internal entropy production' in many cases, and finds that sometimes for the prediction of the course of a process, an extremum of the quantity called the rate of dissipation of energy may be more useful than that of the rate of entropy production; this quantity appeared in Onsager's 1931&lt;ref name="Onsager 1931 I"/&gt; origination of this subject. Other writers have also felt that prospects for general global extremal principles are clouded. Such writers include Glansdorff and Prigogine (1971), Lebon, Jou and Casas-Vásquez (2008), and Šilhavý (1997).

A recent proposal may perhaps by-pass those clouded prospects.&lt;ref name="Attard 2012"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Attard|first=P.|title=Optimising Principle for Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions and Pattern Formation with Results for Heat Convection|journal=|year=2012|arxiv=1208.5105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attard, P.

{{Nuclear physics}}

In [[nuclear physics]] and [[nuclear chemistry]], a '''nuclear reaction''' is semantically considered to be the process in which two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], or else a nucleus of an atom and a [[subatomic particle]] (such as a [[proton]], [[neutron]], or high [[energy]] [[electron]]) from outside the atom, collide to produce one or more [[nuclide]]s that are different from the nuclide(s) that began the process. Thus, a nuclear reaction must cause a transformation of at least one nuclide to another. If a nucleus interacts with another nucleus or particle and they then separate without changing the nature of any nuclide, the process is simply referred to as a type of nuclear [[scattering]], rather than a nuclear reaction.

In principle, a reaction can involve more than two [[particle]]s [[collision|colliding]], but because the probability of three or more nuclei to meet at the same time at the same place is much less than for two nuclei, such an event is exceptionally rare (see [[triple alpha process]] for an example very close to a three-body nuclear reaction). "Nuclear reaction" is a term implying an '''induced''' changing in a nuclide, and thus it does not apply to any type of [[radioactive decay]] (which by definition is a spontaneous process).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Natural nuclear reactions occur in the interaction between [[cosmic ray]]s and matter, and nuclear reactions can be employed artificially to obtain nuclear energy, at an adjustable rate, on demand. Perhaps the most notable nuclear reactions are the [[nuclear chain reaction]]s in [[fissionable]] materials that produce induced [[nuclear fission]], and the various [[nuclear fusion]] reactions of light elements that power the energy production of the Sun and stars.

Nuclear reactions may be shown in a form similar to chemical equations, for which [[invariant mass]] must balance for each side of the equation, and in which transformations of particles must follow certain conservation laws, such as conservation of charge and baryon number (total atomic [[mass number]]). An example of this notation follows:

&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → He + ?
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||?.
|}
To balance the equation above for mass, charge and mass number, the second nucleus to the right must have atomic number 2 and mass number 4; it is therefore also helium-4. The complete equation therefore reads:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → n + He
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]].
|}
or more simply:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → 2 He
--&gt;:{| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[Hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||2&amp;nbsp;[[Helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]].
|}

Instead of using the full equations in the style above, in many situations a compact notation is used to describe nuclear reactions. This style of the form A(b,c)D is equivalent to A + b producing c + D. Common light particles are often abbreviated in this shorthand, typically p for proton, n for neutron, d for [[deuteron]], α representing an [[alpha particle]] or [[helium-4]], β for [[beta particle]] or electron, γ for [[gamma photon]], etc. The reaction above would be written as [[lithium-6|Li-6]](d,α)α.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/stars/FusionHydrogenRate.html The Astrophysics Spectator: Hydrogen Fusion Rates in Stars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
In 1919, [[Ernest Rutherford]] was able to accomplish transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen at the University of Manchester, using alpha particles directed at nitrogen &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N + α → &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O + p.&amp;nbsp; This was the first observation of an induced nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus. Eventually, in 1932 at Cambridge University, a fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved by Rutherford's colleagues [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium-7, to split the nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as "splitting the atom", although it was not the modern [[nuclear fission]] reaction later discovered in heavy elements, in 1938 by the German scientists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm Cockcroft and Walton split lithium with high energy protons April 1932.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902195556/http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm |date=2012-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy conservation==
[[Kinetic energy]] may be released during the course of a reaction ([[chemical reaction#Exothermic reactions|exothermic reaction]]) or kinetic energy may have to be supplied for the reaction to take place ([[chemical reaction#Endothermic reactions|endothermic reaction]]). This can be calculated by reference to a table of very accurate particle rest masses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Compositions/index.html a table of atomic masses]&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: according to the reference tables, the {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} nucleus has a [[standard atomic weight]] of 6.015 [[atomic mass unit]]s (abbreviated [[u]]), the deuterium has 2.014 u, and the helium-4 nucleus has 4.0026 u. Thus:
* the sum of the rest mass of the individual nuclei = 6.015 + 2.014 = 8.029 u;
* the total rest mass on the two helium-nuclei = 2 × 4.0026 = 8.0052 u;
* missing rest mass = 8.029 – 8.0052 = 0.0238 atomic mass units.

In a nuclear reaction, the total [[conservation of energy|(relativistic) energy is conserved]]. The "missing" rest mass must therefore reappear as kinetic energy released in the reaction; its source is the nuclear [[binding energy]]. Using Einstein's [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''mc''², the amount of energy released can be determined. We first need the energy equivalent of one [[atomic mass unit]]:
: 1&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;''c²''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1.66054&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg)&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(2.99792&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s)²&amp;nbsp;
: =&amp;nbsp;1.49242&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;(m/s)²&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.49242&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J ([[joule]])&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]]&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;1.60218&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;J)
: =&amp;nbsp;931.49&amp;nbsp;MeV,
: so 1&amp;nbsp;u&amp;nbsp;''c²''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;931.49&amp;nbsp;MeV.

Hence, the energy released is 0.0238 × 931 MeV = 22.2 [[MeV]].

Expressed differently: the mass is reduced by 0.3%, corresponding to 0.3% of 90&amp;nbsp;PJ/kg is 270&amp;nbsp;TJ/kg.

This is a large amount of energy for a nuclear reaction; the amount is so high because the binding energy per [[nucleon]] of the helium-4 nucleus is unusually high, because the He-4 nucleus is "[[magic number (physics)|doubly magic]]". (The He-4 nucleus is unusually stable and tightly bound for the same reason that the helium atom is inert: each pair of protons and neutrons in He-4 occupies a filled '''1s''' [[nuclear orbital]] in the same way that the pair of electrons in the helium atom occupy a filled '''1s''' [[atomic orbital|electron orbital]]). Consequently, alpha particles appear frequently on the right hand side of nuclear reactions.

The energy released in a nuclear reaction can appear mainly in one of three ways:
*kinetic energy of the product particles (fraction of the kinetic energy of the charged nuclear reaction products can be directly converted into electrostatic energy);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shinn|first1=E.|last2=Et.|first2=al.|title=Nuclear energy conversion with stacks of graphene nanocapacitors|journal=Complexity|date=2013|doi=10.1002/cplx.21427|bibcode=2013Cmplx..18c..24S}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*emission of very high energy [[photon]]s, called [[gamma ray]]s;
*some energy may remain in the nucleus, as a [[metastable]] [[energy level]].

When the product nucleus is metastable, this is indicated by placing an [[asterisk]] ("*") next to its atomic number. This energy is eventually released through [[nuclear decay]].

A small amount of energy may also emerge in the form of [[X-ray]]s. Generally, the product nucleus has a different atomic number, and thus the configuration of its [[electron shell]]s is wrong. As the electrons rearrange themselves and drop to lower energy levels, internal transition X-rays (X-rays with precisely defined [[emission line]]s) may be emitted.

==Q-value and energy balance==
In writing down the reaction equation, in a way analogous to a [[chemical equation]], one may in addition give the reaction energy on the right side:
:Target nucleus + projectile → Final nucleus + ejectile + ''Q''.

For the particular case discussed above, the reaction energy has already been calculated as Q = 22.2&amp;nbsp;MeV. Hence:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.10 by [[User:SkyLined]]
Li-6 + H-2 → 2 He + 22.2 MeV
--&gt;
: {| border="0"
|- style="height:2em;"
|[[Lithium-6|{{nuclide|lithium|6}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||[[hydrogen-2|{{nuclide|hydrogen|2}}]]&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||2&amp;nbsp;[[helium|{{nuclide|helium|4}}]]&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||22.2&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]].
|}

The reaction energy (the "Q-value") is positive for exothermal reactions and negative for endothermal reactions, opposite to the similar expression in [[chemistry]]. On the one hand, it is the difference between the sums of kinetic energies on the final side and on the initial side. But on the other hand, it is also the difference between the nuclear rest masses on the initial side and on the final side (in this way, we have calculated the [[Q value (nuclear science)|Q-value]] above).

==Reaction rates==
If the reaction equation is balanced, that does not mean that the reaction really occurs. The rate at which reactions occur depends on the particle energy, the particle [[flux]] and the reaction [[cross section (physics)|cross section]]. An example of a large repository of reaction rates is the REACLIB database, as maintained by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics]].

==Neutrons vs. ions==
In the initial collision which begins the reaction, the particles must approach closely enough so that the short range [[strong force]] can affect them. As most common nuclear particles are positively charged, this means they must overcome considerable [[electrostatics|electrostatic repulsion]] before the reaction can begin. Even if the target nucleus is part of a neutral [[atom]], the other particle must penetrate well beyond the [[electron cloud]] and closely approach the nucleus, which is positively charged. Thus, such particles must be first accelerated to high energy, for example by:
*[[particle accelerator]]s;
*[[nuclear decay]] (alpha particles are the main type of interest here, since beta and gamma rays are rarely involved in nuclear reactions);
*very high temperatures, on the order of millions of degrees, producing [[thermonuclear]] reactions;
*[[cosmic ray]]s.

Also, since the force of repulsion is proportional to the product of the two charges, reactions between heavy nuclei are rarer, and require higher initiating energy, than those between a heavy and light nucleus; while reactions between two light nuclei are the most common ones.

[[Neutron]]s, on the other hand, have no electric charge to cause repulsion, and are able to initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to [[thermal neutron|thermal equilibrium at room temperature]]), the neutron's [[de Broglie wavelength]] is greatly increased, possibly greatly increasing its capture cross section, at energies close to [[resonance]]s of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons ''may'' be even more reactive than high energy neutrons.

==Notable types==
While the number of possible nuclear reactions is immense, there are several types which are more common, or otherwise notable. Some examples include:
*[[Nuclear fusion|Fusion]] reactions — two light nuclei join to form a heavier one, with additional particles (usually protons or neutrons) emitted subsequently.
*[[Spallation]] — a nucleus is hit by a particle with sufficient energy and momentum to knock out several small fragments or smash it into many fragments.
*[[Induced gamma emission]] belongs to a class in which only photons were involved in creating and destroying states of nuclear excitation.
*[[Alpha decay]] — Though driven by the same underlying forces as spontaneous fission, α decay is usually considered to be separate from the latter. The often-quoted idea that "nuclear reactions" are confined to induced processes is incorrect. "Radioactive decays" are a subgroup of "nuclear reactions" that are spontaneous rather than induced. For example, so-called "hot alpha particles" with unusually high energies may actually be produced in induced [[ternary fission]], which is an induced nuclear reaction (contrasting with spontaneous fission). Such alphas occur from spontaneous ternary fission as well.
*[[Nuclear fission|Fission]] reactions — a very heavy nucleus, after absorbing additional light particles (usually neutrons), splits into two or sometimes three pieces. This is an induced nuclear reaction. [[Spontaneous fission]], which occurs without assistance of a neutron, is usually not considered a nuclear reaction. At most, it is not an ''induced'' nuclear reaction.

===Direct reactions===
An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10&lt;sup&gt;−21&lt;/sup&gt; second) event. Energy and momentum transfer are relatively small. These are particularly useful in experimental nuclear physics, because the reaction mechanisms are often simple enough to calculate with sufficient accuracy to probe the structure of the target nucleus.

====Inelastic scattering====
{{Main|Inelastic scattering}}

Only energy and momentum are transferred.
*(p,p') tests differences between nuclear states.
*(α,α') measures nuclear surface shapes and sizes. Since α particles that hit the nucleus react more violently, [[elastic scattering|elastic]] and shallow inelastic α scattering are sensitive to the shapes and sizes of the targets, like [[light scattering|light scattered]] from a small black object.
*(e,e') is useful for probing the interior structure. Since electrons interact less strongly than do protons and neutrons, they reach to the centers of the targets and their [[wave function]]s are less distorted by passing through the nucleus.

====Transfer reactions====
Usually at moderately low energy, one or more nucleons are transferred between the projectile and target. These are useful in studying outer [[nuclear shell model|shell]] structure of nuclei.
*(α,n) and (α,p) reactions. Some of the earliest nuclear reactions studied involved an alpha particle produced by [[alpha decay]], knocking a nucleon from a target nucleus.
*(d,n) and (d,p) reactions. A [[deuteron]] [[ion beam|beam]] impinges on a target; the target nuclei absorb either the neutron or proton from the deuteron. The deuteron is so loosely bound that this is almost the same as proton or neutron capture. A compound nucleus may be formed, leading to additional neutrons being emitted more slowly. (d,n) reactions are used to generate energetic neutrons.
*The [[strangeness]] exchange reaction ([[Kaon|K]], [[Pion|π]]) has been used to study [[hypernucleus|hypernuclei]].
*The reaction &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N(α,p)&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O performed by Rutherford in 1917 (reported 1919), is generally regarded as the first [[nuclear transmutation]] experiment.

Reactions with [[neutron]]s are important in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. While the best-known neutron reactions are [[neutron scattering]], [[neutron capture]], and [[nuclear fission]], for some light nuclei (especially [[odd-odd nuclei]]) the most probable reaction with a [[thermal neutron]] is a transfer reaction:

Some reactions are only possible with [[fast neutrons]]:
*(n,2n) reactions produce small amounts of [[protactinium-231]] and [[uranium-232]] in the [[thorium cycle]] which is otherwise relatively free of highly radioactive [[actinide]] products.
*&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be + n → 2α + 2n can contribute some additional neutrons in the [[beryllium]] [[neutron reflector]] of a [[nuclear weapon]].
*&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li + n → [[tritium|T]] + α + n unexpectedly contributed additional yield in [[Castle Bravo]], [[Castle Romeo]], and [[Castle Yankee]], the three highest-yield [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the U.S.

'''Othello error''' occurs when a suspicious observer discounts cues of truthfulness. Essentially the Othello error occurs, [[Paul Ekman]] states, "when the lie catcher fails to consider that a truthful person who is under stress may appear to be lying"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; their non-verbal signals expressing their worry at the possibility of being disbelieved.&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Harrison, ''Forensic Interviewing'' (2013) p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lie-detector]] or [[polygraph]] may be deceived in the same way, by misinterpreting nervous signals from a truthful person.&lt;ref&gt;K. Fiedler, ''Social Communication'' (2011) p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; The error is named after [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragic play ''[[Othello]]''; the dynamics between the two main characters, [[Othello (character)|Othello]] and [[Desdemona (character)|Desdemona]], are a particularly well-known example of the error in practice.

== History ==
The phrase Othello error was first used in the book ''Telling Lies'' by [[Paul Ekman]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.paulekman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Lies-That-Fail.pdf|title = Lies That Fail|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-05|website = |publisher = |first=P. |last = Ekman|last2= Frank|first2=M. G.}} In Lewis, M. &amp; Saarni, C. (Eds.), Lying and deception in everyday life (pp. 184-200). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was coined from Shakespeare's play ''[[Othello]]'', which provides an "excellent and famous example"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Telling Lies|first=P. |last = Ekman|publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 1985|isbn = 0393337456|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; of what can happen when fear and distress upon confrontation do not signal deception. In Shakespeare's ''Othello'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.emcp.com/previews/AccessEditions/ACCESS%20EDITIONS/Othello.pdf|title = Othello|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-05|website = |publisher =EMC Publishing, LLC |last = Shakespeare|first = William}}&lt;/ref&gt; Othello falsely believes that his wife, [[Desdemona]], has been cheating on him with another man. There, upon confronting his wife, Desdemona, about her love for another, she cries and denies, all the while aware that her mien will be taken as evidence of guilt by her jealous husband. Seeing his wife's emotional distress, Othello ignores alternative, innocent explanations—like the possibility that she did not love another—and kills her, as his preconceptions biased his observation and, therefore, his judgments.

Othello made the mistake of assuming that he understood the source of Desdemona's anguish. He assumed that his wife's sobs when confronted were a sign of her guilt; he didn't understand that her grief was rooted not in guilt, but in her knowledge that there was no way to convince her husband of her innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Body Language: Why You Should Avoid Othello's Error {{!}} Mr. Media Training|url = http://www.mrmediatraining.com/2014/04/03/body-language-why-you-should-avoid-othellos-error/|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpersonal deception theory ==
{{main article|Interpersonal deception theory}}
[[Interpersonal deception theory]] is the fundamental deception that can occur between two (or more) people face to face, and is what drives the Othello error. David Buller and Judee Burgoon coined this theory after 25 experiments in which they would ask one participant to attempt to deceive another. They concluded that people often say things that are not the truth "To avoid hurting or offending another person, to emphasize their best qualities, to avoid getting into a conflict, or to speed up or slow down a relationship."&lt;ref name=Buller1996&gt;{{Cite journal|doi =10.1111/j.1468-2885.1996.tb00127.x|title =Interpersonal Deception Theory|journal =Communication Theory|volume =6|issue =3|pages =203–242|year =1996|last1 =Buller|first1 =David B.|last2 =Burgoon|first2 =Judee K.|url =http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/interpersdecep.pdf|deadurl =bot: unknown|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160323024039/http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/interpersdecep.pdf|archivedate =2016-03-23|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the lead of others who study verbal deceit, Buller and Burgoon label these three strategies falsification, concealment, and [[equivocation]]. The three differ in that falsification creates a fiction, concealment hides a secret, and equivocation dodges the issue, yet all three are types of deception.&lt;ref name=Buller1996/&gt;

Buller and Burgoon think that the Othello error is typical of most interactions where honesty is an issue. Their theory explains why detection of deception (and detection of truth telling) is a hit-and-miss business. One could believe someone was lying when they were not, or one could believe their lies when they were being deceitful.

== Post-9/11 ==
{{main article|Facial Action Coding System}}
The error was studied most extensively after 9/11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Othello Error Makes You Sure Everyone is Lying |url=http://io9.com/the-othello-error-makes-you-sure-everyone-is-lying-1576531014 |website=io9 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many law enforcement officials were on high alert for future attacks and quick to point the finger at "suspicious" looking individuals. The process for determining who was a potential suspect was the "[[Facial Action Coding System]]"&lt;ref name=Herbert2007&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/students/groups/osjcl/files/2012/05/Herbert-PDF.pdf |title=Othello Error: Facial Profiling, Privacy, and the Suppression of Dissent |last=Herbert |first=Lenese C. |date=2007 |journal=Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law |doi= |pmid= |access-date=|volume=5|pp=79–129|ssrn=1547194}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a system to taxonomize human facial movements by their appearance on the face, based on a system originally developed by a Swedish anatomist named Carl-Herman Hjortsjö.&lt;ref&gt;Hjortsjö, CH (1969). [http://diglib.uibk.ac.at/ulbtirol/content/titleinfo/782346 Man's face and mimic language]. {{OCLC|909592}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen, and published in 1978. However, in a situation in which not only law enforcement, but also the general public are anxious, and assiduous, the potential for Othello errors to creep into the real world is high. In a review of these practices by Lenese Herbert, it is stated that invasive visual examination of faces and facial expressions for law enforcement purposes under the guise of protective administrative searches ineffectively protects national and airport security and violates reasonable expectations of privacy. FACS improperly provides unreasonable governmental activity with a legitimizing scientific imprimatur that conceals governmental agents' race- and ethnicity-based prejudices, which leads to targeting minorities' faces as portents of danger."&lt;ref name=Herbert2007/&gt;

== Lie detectors ==
{{main article|Lie detection}}
Lie detectors use questioning techniques in conjunction with technology to measure human responses to these stimuli, to attempt to ascertain if that person is lying, or telling the truth. The most longstanding and still most frequently used measure is the [[polygraph]] test.  A polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and [[Electrodermal activity|skin conductivity]] while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=Alternative Views of Bashore and Rapp's (1993) alternatives to traditional polygraphy: a critique |last=Rosenfeld |first=J. P. |date=1995 |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=117 |number=1 |pages=159–166 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.1.159 |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polygraph is currently being used in 19 states of the US. The use of polygraph in court testimony remains controversial, and no judge can force a witness to go through with the test although it is used extensively in post-conviction supervision, particularly of sex offenders. The reason that the test is controversial, and the reason that [[lie detector test]]s are fundamentally flawed, is the Othello error—an especially emotional, angry or distraught subject produces similar results to a supposed liar. Ekman's ''Telling lies'' has a chapter dedicated to the usage of the polygraph, in which he discusses the element of "fear" and states "The severity of the punishment will influence the truthful person's fear of being misjudged just as much as the lying person's fear of being spotted—both suffer the same consequences."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Attempts to overcome this, such as the Matte-Quadri comparison technique that factors into the system the innocent examinee's fear of terror and quantifies the results, hence addressing physiological responses produced by that emotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Forensic Psychophysiology Using The Polygraph: Scientific Truth Verification - Lie Detection |last=James |first=Matte |publisher=J. a. M. Pubns |year=1996 |isbn=0-9655794-0-9 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been met with scepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cushman, B.|title=Is Matte's Inside Track the Answer to False Positives, False Negatives and Countermeasures? There is Reason to Fear that Hope is Gone|url=http://www.polygraph.org/assets/docs/APA-Journal.Articles/2013/mattes_inside_track.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Quadri-Track Zone Comparison Technique: It's just not science: A critique to Mangan, Armitage, and Adams (2008)|year=2008|publisher=|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=95|issue=1-2|pages=27–28|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.06.002|author1=Verschuere, B.|author2=Meijer, E.|author3=Merckelbach, H.|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential solutions ==
The lie catcher must make an effort to consider the possibility that a sign of an emotion is not a clue to deceit but a clue
to how a truthful person feels about being suspected of lying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When analyzing the [[body language]] of another, one must ascertain if the emotion sign of emotion is a fear of being caught lying or a fear of being falsely accused and negatively judged. The lie catcher must estimate both the emotions a suspect will be feeling if they are lying, but also, hand in hand, if they are being truthful. Just as not all liars will have every possible feeling about lying, not all truthful people will have every feeling about being under suspicion.

This is difficult and requires the lie catcher to have previous background knowledge of the suspect, and the emotions they convey under different types of duress. The lie catcher needs to know the emotional characteristics of the suspect so that they are aware of what emotions they convey when they are suspected of wrongdoing, versus when they actually have done wrong. Not everybody is likely to feel afraid, guilty, angry, and so on when they know they are suspected of wrongdoing or lying. It depends in part upon the personality of the suspect.

'''Palmira N. Ríos''' (born 1956) is an [[Afro-Puerto Ricans|Afro-Puerto Rican]] academic who has worked as a professor in New York, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. She has served as a commissioner and president of the [[Civil Rights Commission (Puerto Rico)|Puerto Rican Civil Rights Commission]], the first [[person of color]] or woman to be appointed to the government body. After serving as the dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration for the [[University of Puerto Rico]], she became the Dean of Academic Affairs for the [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus|Río Piedras Campus]] in 2015. The [[Bar Association of Puerto Rico]] honored Ríos with the Martin Luther King Jr.-Arturo Alfonso Schomburg Medal for her efforts to promote racial equality.

==Early life==
Palmira N. Ríos González was born in 1956 in Puerto Rico to a family with African roots. She graduated with a degree in sociolology from the [[University of Puerto Rico]] in 1974 and went on to earn a master's degree from [[Fisk University]] the following year. Her thesis evaluated the administration of the [[Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago]] [[Eric Williams]].{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} She moved on to [[Yale University]] and became involved in the student organization, ''Despierta Boricua'' (Boricua Awakens), which actively worked to expand the rights of [[Latino]]s and [[people of color]].{{sfn|Jordan|2015}}

==Career==
While working on her doctorate at Yale in the 1980s, Ríos began teaching at the [[State University of New York]] and [[City University of New York]]. She published prolifically,{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} evaluating the difficulties of effecting social change because of class, gender and race discrimination,{{sfn|Fernós|2006|p=106}} with articles like ''Women under Colonialism: The Case of Puerto Rico'' (1985) and ''Puerto Rican Women in the US Labor Force'' (1985).{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} Completing her PhD at Yale in 1990, with her dissertation, ''Women and Industrialization in Puerto Rico: Gender Division of Labor and the Demand for Female Labor in Manufacturing Sector, 1952–1980'',{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} she began working as an associate professor in the urban planning department of [[The New School for Social Research]].{{sfn|Gonzalez|1992}} Later, she worked as a professor at the [[Santo Domingo Institute of Technology]] (INTEC) in the [[Dominican Republic]].{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}}

In the 1990s, along with other academics, Ríos founded the Puerto Rican Institute of Studies in Race and Identity ({{lang-es|Puertorriqueño de Estudios en Raza e Identidad (IPERI)}}) to promote study and conversation on racism in the country. Through the activities of the institute, she began attending conferences on racism,{{sfn|Pagán Negrón|2016}} participating in the [[United Nation]]'s 3rd World Congress on Racism, held in [[Durban, South Africa]].{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}}{{sfn|Pagán Negrón|2016}} In 1995, Ríos became a research associate at the Graduate School of Public Administration at the [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus]].{{sfn|''Diálogo Iberoamericano''|1996}} She was promoted to dean of the Graduate School in 2002 and the following year was appointed to serve on the [[Civil Rights Commission (Puerto Rico)|Civil Rights Commission of Puerto Rico]]. Her appointment was the first for a person of color and a woman to serve as commissioner on the government body which investigates civil rights violations and complaints for the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]],{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} serving as president of the commission from 2003 to 2008.{{sfn|Pagán Negrón|2016}} She continued to serve on the commission until 2013{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}} and in 2016 was honored with the Martin Luther King Jr.-Arturo Alfonso Schomburg Medal from the [[Bar Association of Puerto Rico]] for her efforts in promoting racial equality on the island.{{sfn|Pagán Negrón|2016}}{{sfn|''Univision Puerto Rico''|2016}}

Ríos continued to serve as dean of the Graduate School of Public Administration until 2015, when she was made Dean of Academic Affairs of the Río Piedras Campus.{{sfn|''Tribuna Puerto Rico''|2013}}{{sfn|Pagán Negrón|2016}}{{sfn|Universia|2015}} She has continued to serve on various governmental advisory councils, including the Land Use Advisory Council{{sfn|''Tribuna Puerto Rico''|2013}} and the Transition Committee for the incoming government of [[Alejandro García Padilla]].{{sfn|''Telemundo Puerto Rico''|2015}} She continues to work in activism to promote the civil and human rights of migrants, the [[LGBT community]], and improve racial relationships within society.{{sfn|Aponte Ramos|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1833">Trade negotiators generally refer to Article 13 of the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Agriculture]] as the '''Peace Clause'''. Article 13 holds that domestic support measures and export [[subsidies]] of a WTO Member that are legal under the provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture cannot be challenged by other WTO Members on grounds of being illegal under the provisions of another WTO agreement.

The Peace Clause has expired on January 1, 2004. It is now possible, therefore, for [[developing countries]] and nations favoring [[free trade]] in agricultural goods, such as the [[Cairns Group]], to use the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|WTO dispute settlement]] mechanism in order to challenge, in particular, [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Union|EU]] [[export subsidies]] on agricultural products.

Another temporary peace clause was made at the WTO Bali conference in December 2013. It stipulated that no country would be legally barred from food security programs for its own people even if the subsidy breached the limits specified in the WTO [[Agreement on Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20180430171655/https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-peace-clause/article22985323.ece])&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Political Obligation''' refers to a moral requirement to obey the laws of one’s country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0121.xml|title=Political Obligation - Political Science - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the political obligation are somewhat unclear, however it can be traced back to the Ancient Greeks. The idea of political obligation is also a philosophical one, that focuses on the morality of laws, rather than if a law is just or not as well as the obvious self-interests.

=== History ===
The idea of political obligation was first founded by [[Thomas Hill Green]] around the late 1800's. For Green, he discussed this idea as "obedience to the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dagger|first=Richard|title=Political Obligation|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/political-obligation/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-04|last2=Lefkowitz|first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Green's explanation for what is Political Obligation only scratches the surface, and a more detailed look at the term can be traced to the thoughts of [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. [[Dudley Knowles]] also looks at this through his book ''Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction'', and finds a more detailed look at the relationship the person and the state have towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/kentstate/reader.action?docID=452103&amp;query=|title=Kent State University -- CAS – Central Authentication Service|website=ebookcentral.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Socrates ====
The earliest understanding of political obligation can be traced back to the teachings of Socrates. One account recalls Socrates being jailed and sentenced to death for "corrupting the morals of the youth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/political-obligation/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Richard|last1=Dagger|first2=David|last2=Lefkowitz|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=5 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates was set to escape, a design set up by his friends, however he chose to stay and accept his punishment, as he found it morally wrong not to do so. In Crito, Socrates describes the struggle man has with the rule of law and the connection it has with humans political obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1408204|title=Citizenship and Socrates in Plato's "Crito"|first=Michael J.|last=Rosano|date=5 November 2018|publisher=|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=62|issue=3|pages=451–477|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4554">'''Reservation''' (or '''reserve''') '''price''' is a limit on the [[price]] of a [[good (economics)|good]] or a [[service (economics)|service]]. On the [[demand]] side, it is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay; on the [[supply (economics)|supply]] side, it is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a good or service. Reservation prices are commonly used in [[auction]]s, but the concept is extended beyond.

== Description ==
In [[microeconomics]], consumers set their reservation price as the highest price that they are willing to pay for goods or [[service (economics)|a service]], while seller set the smallest price at which they would sell. Similarly, in [[finance]], the reservation price—also called the [[indifference price]]—is the value at which an investor would be willing to buy (or sell) a [[security (finance)|financial security]] given his or her particular [[utility function]].

Reservation prices are commonly used in [[auction]]s, where the seller may or may not make it known what the lowest acceptable price is. Buyers—especially if by proxy—may have their own reservation price at which they are unwilling to further bid. This can be seen as the "walk away" point for either party, in [[negotiation]] where the reservation price is the point beyond which a negotiator is ready to walk away from a negotiated agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.negotiations.com/definition/reservation-price/|title=Reservation Price|work=negotiations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A seller may produce a '''reservation demand''', which is a schedule of reservation prices at which a seller would be willing to sell different quantities of a particular good.

== Analysis ==
Reservation prices vary for the buyers and sellers according to their [[disposable income]], their desire for—or to sell—the good, and knowledge of information about [[substitute good]]s. A reservation price can be used to help calculate the [[consumer surplus]] or the [[producer surplus]] with reference to the [[equilibrium price]].

== Auction theory ==
In the basic model of optimal auction design developed by [[Roger Myerson]] (1981), the optimal reservation price (i.e., the smallest admissible bid) is independent of the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B.|date=1981|title=Optimal Auction Design|url=https://doi.org/10.1287/moor.6.1.58|journal=Mathematics of Operations Research|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=58–73|doi=10.1287/moor.6.1.58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myerson assumes that the bidders have private independent values (i.e., each bidder’s valuation of the object to be auctioned off is a realization of a random variable observed only by the bidder, and the random variables are stochastically independent). For example, if every bidder’s valuation is drawn independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [0,100], then the optimal reservation price is 50. According to traditional economic theory, the optimal reservation price results from balancing two opposing effects. First, a higher reservation price is desirable for the seller since it deters bidders from falsely claiming that they have only a small valuation. Second, a higher reservation price is undesirable for the seller since it deters bidders with truly small valuations from participating in the auction. According to behavioral economic theory, a reservation price may also have additional effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kőszegi|first=Botond|date=2014|title=Behavioral Contract Theory|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.52.4.1075|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1075–1118|doi=10.1257/jel.52.4.1075|issn=0022-0515|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have argued that a reservation price can serve as a reference point when bidders have preferences as studied in [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2007|title=Reserve Prices in Auctions as Reference Points|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02044.x|journal=The Economic Journal|language=en|volume=117|issue=520|pages=637–653|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2007.02044.x|issn=1468-0297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of perception]], the theory of '''sense data''' was a popular view held in the early 20th century by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[H. H. Price]], [[A. J. Ayer]], and [[G. E. Moore]].  Sense data are taken to be mind-dependent objects whose existence and properties are known directly to us in perception.  These objects are unanalyzed experiences inside the mind, which appear to subsequent more advanced mental operations exactly as they are.

Sense data are often placed in a time and/or causality series, such that they occur after the potential unreliability of our perceptual systems yet before the possibility of error during higher-level conceptual analysis and are thus incorrigible. They are thus distinct from the 'real' objects in the world outside the mind, about whose existence and properties we often ''can'' be mistaken.

Talk of sense-data has since been largely replaced by talk of the closely related [[qualia]]. The formulation ''the given'' is also closely related. None of these terms has a single coherent and widely agreed-upon definition, so their exact relationships are unclear. One of the greatest troubling aspects to 20th century theories of sense data is its unclear rubric nature.

== Examples ==

Bertrand Russell heard the sound of his knuckles rapping his writing table, felt the table's hardness and saw its apparent colour (which he knew 'really' to be the brown of wood) change significantly under shifting lighting conditions.

[[H. H. Price]] found that although he was able to doubt the presence of a tomato before him, he was unable to doubt the existence of his red, round and 'somewhat bulgy' sense-datum and his consciousness of this sense-datum.

When we twist a coin it 'appears' to us as elliptical.  This elliptical 'appearance' cannot be identical with the coin (for the coin is perfectly round), and is therefore a sense datum, which somehow represents the round coin to us.

Consider a reflection which appears to us in a mirror.  There is nothing corresponding to the reflection in the world external to the mind (for our reflection appears to us as the image of a human being apparently located inside a wall, or a wardrobe).  The appearance is therefore a mental object, a sense datum.

== The nature of sense data ==

The idea that our perceptions are based on sense data is supported by a number of arguments. The first is popularly known as the [[argument from illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sense-data/ Sense-Data (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; From a subjective experience of perceiving something, it is theoretically impossible to distinguish perceiving something which exists independently of oneself from an hallucination or mirage. Thus, we do not have any direct access to the outside world that would allow us to reliably distinguish it from an illusion that caused identical experiences. Since (the argument claims) we must have direct access to some specific experiential entity in order to have the percepts that we do, and since this entity is not identical to the real object itself, there must be some sort of internal mental entity somehow correlated to the real world, about which we afterwards have perceptions, make judgments, etc. This entity is a sense-datum.

==Abstract sense data==
Abstract sense data is sense data without human judgement, sense data without human conception and yet evident to the senses, found in [[aesthetic]] experience. As opposed to; imaginary sense data which is more like a quasi substance and does not really exist; Imaginary sense data is abstract sense data as presented from the aestheticized senses to [[consciousness]]; i.e. imagination, power of reason and inner subjective states of [[self-awareness]] including: emotion, self-reflection, ego, and theory.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;[http://gradworks.umi.com/14/73/1473509.html "Cubist paintings 1910-1912 and Piaget's theory of the development of object permanence: On the existence of abstract and imaginary sense data" by Jackson, Scott]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of abstract and imaginary sense data operates on the tacit definition of imagination as "a power mediating between the senses and the reason by virtue of representing perceptual objects without their presence".&lt;ref&gt;Brann, Eva T. H. The World of the Imagination: Sum and Substance. Savage, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Imaginary sense data are 'imaginary' per [[Immanuel Kant]]'s analysis that imagination is the primary faculty of mind capable of synthesizing input from the senses into a world of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. Immanuel Kant's: Critique of Pure Reason. London: Macmillan and Co.  Limited, 1933. pg 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, Richard. The Wake of Imagination: Ideas of Creativity in Western Culture.  London: Hutchinson, 1988. pg 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, Collin. Mindsight.: Image, Dream, Meaning. Cambridge, Mass. Harvard  University Press, 2004. pg 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Code, Murray. Myths of Reason: Vagueness, Rationality, and the Lure of Logic. Atlantic  Highlands, N.J.:Humanities Press, 1995. pg 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract and imaginary sense data are key to understanding abstract art's relationship with the conscious and unconscious mind.

== Criticisms ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Sense data theories have been criticised by philosophers such as [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (Sellars diagnosing in them [[Wilfred Sellars#Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind|The Myth of the Given]]), and more recently by [[Kevin O'Regan]], [[Alva Noë]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. Much of the early criticism may arise from a claim about sense data that was held by philosophers such as A. J. Ayer. This was that sense data really do have the properties they appear to have. Thus, in this account of sense data, the sense data that are responsible for the experience of a red tomato really "are red".

In one sense this is ridiculous, since there is nothing red in a brain to act as a sense datum. However, in another sense it is perfectly consistent—in the sense that the data "are red" when experienced directly, even though the physical processes of perception may not appear red if they were experienced in a contrived and inappropriately indirect way, such as by examining the brain of the experiencer with scientific instruments.

On some theories, the tomato itself is not red except in the eyes of a red-seeing being. Thus when one says that a neural state is or is not 'red' without referring the judgement of redness to the owner of the neurons concerned, there is an assumption that things can have innate appearances without reference to perceivers—which is implicitly denied by the sense data theory. Thus the criticism that sense data cannot really be red is made from a position of presupposition inconsistent with a theory of sense data—so it is bound to seem to make the theory seem wrong. More recent opposition to the existence of sense data appears to be simply regression to [[naïve realism]].

By objectifying and partially externalising a Subject's basic experiences of the world as 'sense-data', positing their necessity for perception and [[Higher-order thinking|higher order thinking]] and installing them permanently between the perceiving Subject and the 'real world', sense-data theories tend towards [[Solipsism]]. Attempts to repair this must avoid both obscurantism and over-dependence on psychology (and therefore empiricism, and potentially circularity).

'''Seth Siegelaub''' (born 1941, Bronx, New York - June 15, 2013, Basel, Switzerland) was an American-born [[art dealer]], [[curator]], author and [[researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/06/seth-siegelaub-pioneering-dealer-and-curator-of-conceptual-art-dies-at-71/|title=Seth Siegelaub, Pioneering Dealer and Curator of Conceptual Art, Dies at 71|last=Russeth |first=Andrew|date=2013-06-17|publisher=GalleristNY.com (website of [[The New York Observer]])|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his innovative promotion of [[conceptual art]] in New York in the 1960s and 70s.,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson, ''Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology'', MIT Press, 1999, pxl. {{ISBN|0-262-51117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also been a political researcher and publisher, [[textile history]] bibliographer and collector, and a researcher working on a project on time and [[Causality (physics)|causality]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008070113/http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=77%2F "Who Is Seth Siegelaub?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At his gallery, "Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art", operating between the Fall 1964 and April 1966, for one exhibition Siegelaub encouraged visitors to lounge on couches and chairs to appreciate the show as an overall environment and hosted a four-day [[happening]] featuring the artist Arni Hendin.&lt;ref name=Alberro10&gt;Alexander Alberro, ''Conceptual Art and the Politics of Publicity'', MIT Press, 2003, pp10-11. {{ISBN|0-262-51184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an aggressive promoter and paid as much attention to press and publicity as to the content of exhibitions, showing that even unconventional art work could be sold.&lt;ref name=Alberro10/&gt;

After the close of the gallery he gradually became, in [[Joseph Kosuth]]'s words, a "curator-at-large".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'', in Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson, ''Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology'', MIT Press, 1999, p.177 {{ISBN|0-262-51117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first exhibition organizer to specialize in dealing with [[conceptual art]], holding group exhibitions that had no existence outside of the catalogue., and was an active "independent curator", organizing 21 art exhibitions, books, catalogues and projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=310/ "21 art exhibitions, books, catalogues and projects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723114254/http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=310%2F |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the USA, Canada and Europe between February 1968 and July 1971 in a wide range of new and original formats, including several important group shows, such as "The Xeroxbook" in December 1968, and "January 5–31, 1969" exhibition, which contained no objects, no paintings and no sculptures.

He was also the originator and author, with lawyer Robert Projansky, of "The Artist's Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement," published in 1971, which has been translated and published in French, Italian, German and Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primaryinformation.org/index.php?/projects/siegelaubartists-rights/ "The Artist's Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century he founded the Stichting Egress Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egressfoundation.net/ "The Stichting Egress Foundation"]&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam to bring together his varied range of projects: contemporary art, textile history, time &amp; causality research, and left communications study.

Siegelaub was born in the [[Bronx]], New York, grew up in New York City, and was residing in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands. He died in Basel, Switzerland on June 15, 2013.

The '''Southern Regional Council''' (SRC) is a reform-oriented organization created in 1944 to avoid racial violence and promote racial equality in the [[Southern United States]]. Voter registration and political-awareness campaigns are used toward this end.  The SRC evolved in 1944 from the [[Commission on Interracial Cooperation]].  It is headquartered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==History==
{{See also|Commission on Interracial Cooperation}}
The Commission on Interracial Cooperation (CIC) was formed in 1919.&lt;ref name="dunbar-src"/&gt;  The CIC formed in response to the increased tensions between white Americans and [[Black people|black]] [[soldier]]s returning from fighting in Europe after [[World War I|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="nge-cic"/&gt; Although most African Americans still lived in the South, the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] had started to the North and Midwestern industrial cities, and thousands of blacks were living in new urban environments. They often had to compete with immigrants and ethnic whites for jobs and housing. In the summer of 1919, race riots erupted in numerous major cities as whites attacked blacks. African-American veterans and others resisted being treated as second-class citizens and fought back, especially in Chicago and Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="proquest-cic"/&gt; during what has been called "[[Red Summer]]" because of all the violence. Black veterans in the South were confronted with expectations they would submit to [[Jim Crow]] and lynchings of black men rose after the war,  including of some veterans in uniform.

During [[World War II|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;II]], members of the CIC realized that the same problem could recur during and following that war.&lt;ref name="proquest-src"/&gt;  In 1943, leaders from the CIC, including sociologist [[Howard W. Odum]], held a series of conferences in [[Durham, North Carolina]]; [[Richmond, Virginia]], and Atlanta, Georgia.  As a result, they formed the Southern Regional Council, with Odum selected as its leader.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;  The CIC was disbanded,&lt;ref name="proquest-src"/&gt; essentially being merged with the new SRC in 1944.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;&lt;ref name="src-timeline"/&gt; The SRC was formed "to attain through research and action the ideals and practices of equal opportunity for all peoples of the region."&lt;ref name="src-timeline"/&gt;

The SRC urged [[white people|whites]], particularly those with more [[Liberalism|liberal]] political attitudes,  to help [[black people]] obtain [[Racial integration|equal rights]].  Like the CIC before it, the SRC was a coalition of [[lawyer]]s, [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian minister]]s, and [[newspaper editor]]s from thirteen southern states. Although the group was bi-racial and included both men and women, the majority of its members were white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Steven P.|title=Whither Southern Liberalism in the Post-Civil Rights Era? The Southern Regional Council and its Peers, 1965-1972|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2006|volume=90|issue=4|pages=547-568|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=23695963&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Odum sought to bring about racial equality in the Southern US by improving economic, social and political conditions.&lt;ref name="dunbar-src"/&gt;  The SRC avoided taking a public stand against legal segregation, on the belief that this would hinder progress toward its economic-planning goals.  Critics of this approach, such as activist author [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]], believed that the SRC should condemn the state-imposed legal segregation.  In 1949 the SRC declared in a resolution that segregation "in and of itself constitutes discrimination and inequality of treatment."&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;  As a result, many whites left the SRC, resulting in a decline of membership by almost half by 1954.&lt;ref name="nge-src"/&gt;

==Activities==

Often partners with other groups involved in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the SRC used [[communications]] and [[analysis]] to try to reach people through facts and education. It published literature related to racial justice, released studies on [[race relations]], and acted as a [[think tank]] for issues concerning the movement.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Publications===
Since 1944, the SRC has published some form of journal. The Council's first publication, ''Southern Frontier'', was published for two years before being reformatted and renamed as ''New South''.  In 1974, ''New South'' and a companion tabloid ''South Today'' were merged into a color glossy magazine, ''Southern Voices''. This published for ten months but ceased because of financial issues.&lt;ref name="newmag"/&gt;

The SRC journal ''Southern Changes'' was published between 1978 and 2003.&lt;ref name="sc-archive"/&gt; [[Emory University]], in partnership with the [[Library of Congress]], has digitally preserved the journal, described as "an alternative and groundbreaking news outlet for stories on social justice in the South."&lt;ref name="metarchive-interview"/&gt;

The Council publishes various issues briefs, position papers, and legislative reviews, including the annuals ''Southern States Legislative Review'' and ''State of the South Report''.&lt;ref name="src-programs"/&gt;

===Voter Education Project===
[[File:Vernon E. Jordan working on a voter education project.jpg|thumb|[[Vernon Jordan]] working on a voter education project at the Southern Regional Council in 1967.]]
The SRC served as a liaison between a number of southern organizations and northern foundations, providing resources and opportunities for mutual understanding. The organization created the [[Voter Education Project]], building on an idea from U.S. Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]] during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]; the project was run by the SRC from its inception on April 1, 1962 until it was made an independent organization on June 1, 1971.&lt;ref name="emory-vep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mediator"/&gt;  The Voter Education Project did not actually register voters; instead, it acted as a conduit between [[Philanthropy|philanthropic]] grants and civil rights organizations conducting [[voter registration]] drives or voting-related research.&lt;ref name="emory-vep"/&gt;  For example, the Project funded voter-registration work by the [[National Urban League]]; in October 1962, the Jefferson County (Alabama) Voters Campaign received assistance with a registration effort from the League.&lt;ref name="mediator"/&gt;

===Lillian Smith Book Award===
The [[Lillian Smith Book Award]] was established by the SRC in 1968, shortly after writer [[Lillian Smith (author)|Lillian Smith]] died, to "recognize authors whose writing extends the legacy of this outspoken writer, educator and social critic who challenged her fellow Southerners and all Americans on issues of social and racial justice."&lt;ref name="src-programs"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23954">'''Survivorship bias''' or '''survival bias''' is the [[logical error]] of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of [[selection bias]].

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence ([[Post hoc ergo propter hoc|correlation proves causality]]). For example, if three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education. This could be true, but the question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who "survived" the top-five selection process

==Examples==

=== In business, finance and economics ===
In finance, survivorship bias is the tendency for failed companies to be excluded from performance studies because they no longer exist. It often causes the results of studies to skew higher because only companies which were successful enough to survive until the end of the period are included. For example, a [[mutual fund]] company's selection of funds today will include only those that are successful now. Many losing funds are closed and merged into other funds to hide poor performance. In theory, 90% of extant funds could truthfully claim to have performance in the first quartile of their peers, if the peer group includes funds that have closed. {{Citation needed|reason=Where did the '90%' come from?|date=April 2017}}

In 1996, Elton, Gruber, and Blake showed that survivorship bias is larger in the small-fund sector than in large mutual funds (presumably because small funds have a high probability of folding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elton |last2=Gruber |last3=Blake |year=1996 |title=Survivorship Bias and Mutual Fund Performance |journal=[[Review of Financial Studies]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=1097–1120 |doi=10.1093/rfs/9.4.1097 }} In this paper the researchers eliminate survivorship bias by following the returns on all funds extant at the end of 1976. They show that other researchers have drawn spurious conclusions by failing to include the bias in regressions on fund performance.&lt;/ref&gt; They estimate the size of the bias across the U.S. mutual fund industry as 0.9% per annum, where the bias is defined and measured as:

{{quote|"Bias is defined as average α for surviving funds minus average α for all funds"

(Where [[Alpha (investment)|α]] is the risk-adjusted return over the [[S&amp;P 500]]. This is the standard measure of mutual fund out-performance).}}

Additionally, in quantitative [[backtesting]] of market performance or other characteristics, survivorship bias is the use of a current index membership set rather than using the actual constituent changes over time. Consider a backtest to 1990 to find the average performance (total return) of S&amp;P 500 members who have paid dividends within the previous year. To use the current 500 members only and create a historical equity line of the total return of the companies that met the criteria would be adding survivorship bias to the results. S&amp;P maintains an index of healthy companies, removing companies that no longer meet their criteria as a representative of the large-cap U.S. stock market. Companies that had healthy growth on their way to inclusion in the S&amp;P 500 would be counted as if they were in the index during that growth period, which they were not. Instead there may have been another company in the index that was losing market capitalization and was destined for the S&amp;P 600 Small-cap Index that was later removed and would not be counted in the results. Using the actual membership of the index and applying entry and exit dates to gain the appropriate return during inclusion in the index would allow for a bias-free output.

In his book [[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|''The Black Swan'']], financial writer [[Nassim Taleb]] called the data obscured by survivorship bias "silent evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Taleb |first= Nassim Nicholas |date= 2010 |title= The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable | edition= 2nd |url= |location= New York |publisher= Random House |page= 101 |isbn= 9780679604181|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In history ===
[[Diogenes]] was asked concerning paintings of those who had escaped shipwreck: "Look, you who think the gods have no care of human things, what do you say to so many persons preserved from death by their especial favour?", to which Diogenes replied: "Why, I say that their pictures are not here who were cast away, who are by much the greater number." &lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Mumm has described how survival bias leads historians to study organisations that are still in existence more than those which have closed. This means large, successful organisations such as the Women's Institute, which were well organised and still have accessible archives for historians to work from, are studied more than smaller charitable organisations, even though these may have done a great deal of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women and Philanthropic Cultures, in Women, Gender and Religious Cultures in Britain, 1800-1940, Eds Sue Morgan and Jacqueline deVries .|last=Mumm|first=Susan|publisher=London: Routledge|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In manufacturing and goods production ===
{{unsourced-section|date=April 2017}}
A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer than similar contemporary items. (This perception is reflected in the common expression "They don't make 'em [them] like they used to"). Again, because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items which were built to last will have survived into the present day.  Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive.  All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.  

Though survivorship bias may explain a significant portion of the common perception that older manufacturing processes were more rigorous, there are other processes that may explain that perception, such as [[planned obsolescence]] and [[overengineering]].  It is difficult to directly compare and determine whether manufacturing has become overall better or worse.  Manufactured goods are constantly changing, the same items are rarely built for more than a single generation, and even the raw materials change from one era to the next.  Capabilities and processes in materials science, technology, manufacturing, and testing have all advanced immensely since the 20th century, undoubtedly raising the potential for similar increases in durability, but pressures on production costs and time have also increased, resulting in manufacturing shortcuts that often result in less durable products.  Overall, the contemporary consumer probably {{Weasel inline|date=June 2017}} has access to and experiences a much wider range of product durability than past generations.   Again, bias arises from the fact that historical goods of poor quality are no longer visible, and only the best produced items of the past survive to today.

=== In architecture and construction ===

Just as new buildings are being built every day and older structures are constantly torn down, the story of most civil and urban architecture involves a process of constant renewal, renovation, and revolution.  Only the most (subjectively, but popularly determined) beautiful, most useful, and most structurally sound buildings survive from one generation to the next.  This creates another selection effect where the ugliest and weakest buildings of history have long been eradicated from existence and thus the public view, and so it leaves the visible impression, seemingly correct but factually flawed, that all buildings in the past were both more beautiful and better built.

=== In highly competitive careers ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Whether it be movie stars, or athletes, or musicians, or CEOs of multibillion-dollar corporations who dropped out of school, popular media often tells the story of the determined individual who pursues their dreams and beats the odds.  There is much less focus on the many people that may be similarly skilled and determined but fail to ever find success because of factors beyond their control or other (seemingly) random events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-11/success-stories-how-survivorship-bias-tricks-entrepreneurs|title=How Survivorship Bias Tricks Entrepreneurs|author=Karen E. Klein|publisher=Bloomberg Business|date=2014-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This creates a false public perception that anyone can achieve great things if they have the ability and make the effort.  The overwhelming majority of failures are not visible to the public eye, and only those who survive the selective pressures of their competitive environment are seen regularly.

=== In the military ===

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018|talk=In the military}}

[[File:Survivorship-bias.png|thumb|The damaged portions of returning planes show locations where they can take a hit and still return home safely; those hit in other places do not survive. (Image shows hypothetical data.)]]
During World War II, the statistician [[Abraham Wald]] took survivorship bias into his calculations when considering how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire.&lt;ref name=Wald1943&gt;Wald, Abraham. (1943). ''A Method of Estimating Plane Vulnerability Based on Damage of Survivors''. Statistical Research Group, Columbia University.

Wald proposed that the Navy reinforce areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed{{r|Wald1943|p=88}}, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost. His work is considered seminal in the then-fledgling discipline of [[operational research]].&lt;ref name=Mangel1984&gt;{{cite journal

===In cats===
In a study performed in 1987 it was reported that cats who fall from less than six stories, and are still alive, have greater injuries than cats who fall from higher than six stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3692980 |year=1987 |last1=Whitney |first1=WO |last2=Mehlhaff |first2=CJ |title=High-rise syndrome in cats |volume=191 |issue=11 |pages=1399–403 |journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petplace.com/cats/highrise-syndrome-in-cats/page1.aspx Highrise Syndrome in Cats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that this might happen because cats reach [[terminal velocity]] after righting themselves at about five stories, and after this point they relax, leading to less severe injuries in cats who have fallen from six or more stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~barneye/kitty.html Falling Cats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712033200/http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~barneye/kitty.html |date=2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' newspaper column proposed that another possible explanation for this phenomenon&lt;ref name="VisserSchnitzer2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Schnitzer|first2=Stefan A.|last3=Muller-Landau|first3=Helene C.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=de Kroon|first5=Hans|last6=Comita|first6=Liza S.|last7=Hubbell|first7=Stephen P.|last8=Wright|first8=S.

Cats that die in falls are less likely to be brought to a veterinarian than injured cats, and thus many of the cats killed in falls from higher buildings are not reported in studies of the subject.&lt;ref name=straightdope&gt;{{cite web

===In tropical trees===
Tropical vines and lianas are often viewed as macro-parasites of trees that reduce host tree survival. The proportion of trees infested with lianas was observed to be much greater in shade-tolerant, heavy wooded, slow-growing tree species while light-demanding, lighter wooded and fast-growing species are often liana free. Such observations led to the expectation that lianas have stronger negative effects on shade-tolerant species &lt;ref name="Schnitzer2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schnitzer|first1=S|title=The ecology of lianas and their role in forests|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=5|year=2002|pages=223–230|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, further investigations revealed that liana infestation is far more harmful to light-demanding fast-growing tree species where liana infestation greatly decreases survival such that the observable sample is biased towards those that survived and are liana-free &lt;ref name="VisserSchnitzer2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Schnitzer|first2=Stefan A.|last3=Muller-Landau|first3=Helene C.|last4=Jongejans|first4=Eelke|last5=de Kroon|first5=Hans|last6=Comita|first6=Liza S.|last7=Hubbell|first7=Stephen P.|last8=Wright|first8=S. Joseph|last9=Zuidema|first9=Pieter|title=Tree species vary widely in their tolerance for liana infestation: A case study of differential host response to generalist parasites|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=106|issue=2|year=2018|pages=781–794|issn=00220477|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, the observable sample of trees with lianas in their crown is skewed due to survivorship bias.

===In studies of evolution===

Large groups of organisms called [[clades]] that survive a long time are subject to various survivorship biases such as the "[[push of the past]]", generating the illusion that clades in ''general'' tend to originate with a high rate of [[Genetic divergence|diversification]] that then slows through time.&lt;ref name="POTPa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G. E. |last2=Mann |first2=R. P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record |journal=Evolution |date=2018 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.13593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a general experimental flaw ==

Survivorship bias (or survivor bias) is a statistical [[artifact (error)|artifact]] in applications outside [[finance]], where studies on the remaining population are fallaciously compared with the historic average despite the survivors having unusual properties.  Mostly, the unusual property in question is a track record of success (like the successful funds).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

For example, the [[parapsychology]] researcher [[Joseph Banks Rhine]] believed he had identified the few individuals from hundreds of potential subjects who had powers of [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]. His calculations were based on the [[improbability]] of these few subjects guessing the [[Zener cards]] shown to a partner by chance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

A major criticism which surfaced against his calculations was the possibility of unconscious survivorship bias in subject selections. He was accused of failing to take into account the large effective size of his sample (all the people he rejected as not being "strong [[telepath]]s" because they failed at an earlier testing stage). Had he done this he might have seen that, from the large sample, one or two individuals would probably achieve the track record of success he had found purely by chance.

Writing about the Rhine case in ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'', [[Martin Gardner]] explained that he did not think the experimenters had made such obvious mistakes out of [[statistical]] naïveté, but as a result of subtly disregarding some poor subjects. He said that, without trickery of any kind, there would always be some people who had improbable success, if a large enough sample were taken. To illustrate this, he speculates about what would happen if one hundred professors of [[psychology]] read Rhine's work and decided to make their own tests; he said that survivor bias would winnow out the typical failed experiments, but encourage the lucky successes to continue testing. He thought that the common [[null hypothesis]] (of no result) would not be reported, but:
{{quote|Eventually, one experimenter remains whose subject has made high scores for six or seven successive sessions. Neither experimenter nor subject is aware of the other ninety-nine projects, and so both have a strong delusion that ESP is operating.}}

He concludes:

{{quote|The experimenter writes an enthusiastic paper, sends it to Rhine who publishes it in his magazine, and the readers are greatly impressed.}}

If enough [[scientist]]s study a phenomenon, some will find [[statistically significant]] results by chance, and these are the experiments submitted for publication. Additionally, papers showing positive results may be more appealing to editors.&lt;ref name="ioannidis2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ioannidis |first=J. P. A. |year=2005 |title=Why Most Published Research Findings Are False |journal=[[PLoS Med]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=e124 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 |pmid=16060722 |pmc=1182327}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is known as ''positive results bias'', a type of [[publication bias]]. To combat this, some editors now call for the submission of "negative" scientific findings, where "nothing happened".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Survivorship bias is one of the issues discussed in the provocative 2005 paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False".&lt;ref name="ioannidis2005"/&gt;

== In business law ==

Survivorship bias can raise [[false advertising|truth-in-advertising]] problems when the success rate advertised for a product or service is measured with respect to a population whose makeup differs from that of the target audience whom the company offering that product or service targets with advertising claiming that success rate.  These problems become especially significant when
# the advertisement either fails to disclose the existence of relevant differences between the two populations or describes them in insufficient detail;
# these differences result from the company's deliberate "pre-screening" of prospective customers to ensure that only customers with traits increasing their likelihood of success are allowed to purchase the product or service, especially when the company's selection procedures or evaluation standards are kept [[Trade secret|secret]]; and
# the company offering the product or service charges a fee, especially one that is non-refundable or not disclosed in the advertisement, for the privilege of attempting to become a customer.

For example, the advertisements of online dating service [[EHarmony|eHarmony.com]] pass this test because they fail the first two prongs but not the third:  They claim a success rate significantly higher than that of competing services while generally not disclosing that the rate is calculated with respect to a viewership subset who possess traits that increase their likelihood of finding and maintaining relationships and lack traits that pose obstacles to their doing so (1), and the company deliberately selects for these traits by administering a lengthy [[EHarmony#Criticism|pre-screening process]] designed to reject prospective customers who lack the former traits or possess the latter ones (2), but the company does not charge a fee for administration of its pre-screening test, with the effect that its prospective customers face no "downside risk" other than losing the time and expending the effort involved in completing the pre-screening process (negating 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/12/AR2007051201350.html |title=They Met Online, but Definitely Didn't Click |first=Paul |last=Farhi |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Images ==
[[File:Vf-101 grim reapers tomcat tail.jpg|thumb|Image of the Grim Reaper on the tailfin of a [[U.S. Navy]] [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14D Tomcat]] of Flight Squadron, [[VF-101]], nicknamed the "Grim Reapers."]]
[[File:Flag of Edward England.svg|thumb|Traditional [[Jolly Roger]], the flag of [[Samuel Bellamy|"Black Sam" Bellamy]] and other [[pirate]]s of the 18th century, displaying a skull and crossbones.]]
Various images are used traditionally to symbolize death; these rank from blunt depictions of [[cadaver]]s and their parts to more [[allusion|allusive]] suggestions that time is fleeting and all men are mortals.

The [[human skull]] is an obvious and frequent symbol of death, found in many cultures and religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Glennys Howarth|author2=Oliver Leaman|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GK2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA416|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91360-0|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human skeleton]]s and sometimes non-human animal [[skeleton]]s and skulls can also be used as blunt images of death; the traditional figures of [[Death (personification)|the Grim Reaper]] – a black-hooded skeleton with a [[scythe]] – is one use of such symbolism.  The [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] motif (☠) has been used among Europeans as a symbol of both [[piracy]] and [[poison]].

[[Decomposition|Decayed]] cadavers can also be used to depict death; in medieval Europe, they were often featured in artistic depictions of the ''[[danse macabre]]'', or in [[cadaver tomb]]s which depicted the living and decomposed body of the person entombed. [[Coffin]]s also serve as blunt reminders of mortality.

Less blunt symbols of death frequently allude to the passage of [[time]] and the fragility of [[life]], and can be described as ''[[memento mori]]'';&lt;ref name='oed'&gt;literally 'remember to die', [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; that is, an artistic or symbolic reminder of the inevitability of death.  [[Clock]]s, [[hourglass]]es, [[sundial]]s, and other timepieces both call to mind that time is passing. Similarly, a [[candle]] both marks the passage of time, and bears witness that it will eventually burn itself out.  These sorts of symbols were often incorporated into ''[[vanitas]]'' paintings, a variety of early [[still life]].

Certain animals such as [[crow]]s, [[cat]]s, [[owl]]s, [[moth]]s, [[vulture]]s and [[bat]]s are associated with death; some because they feed on carrion, others because they are nocturnal.

== Religious symbols ==

Religious symbols of death and depictions of the afterlife will vary with the [[religion]] practiced by the people who use them.

[[Tomb]]s, [[grave stone|tombstone]]s, and other items of [[funeral]] architecture are obvious candidates for symbols of death.  In ancient [[Egypt]], the [[god]]s [[Osiris]] and [[Ptah]] were typically depicted as [[mummy|mummies]]; these gods governed the Egyptian [[afterlife]].  In [[Christianity]], the [[Christian cross]] is frequently used on [[Grave (burial)|graves]], and is meant to call to mind the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]].  Some Christians also erect temporary crosses along public [[highway]]s as memorials for those who died in accidents.  In [[Buddhism]], the symbol of a [[wheel]] represents the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth that happens in samsara.  The symbol of a grave or tomb, especially one in a picturesque or unusual location, can be used to represent death, as in [[Nicholas Poussin]]'s famous painting ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''.

Images of life in the afterlife are also symbols of death.  Here, again, the ancient Egyptians produced detailed pictorial representations of the life enjoyed by the dead.  In Christian [[folk religion]],  the [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of the dead are often depicted as [[wing]]ed [[angel]]s or angel-like creatures, dwelling among the clouds; this imagery of the afterlife is frequently used in [[comedy|comic]] depictions of the life after death. In the Islamic view of the Afterlife, death is [[Qiyamah#Personification in Qiyâmah|symbolised]] by a black and white [[sheep|ram]] which in turn will be slain to symbolise the ''Death of Death''.

The [[Banshee]] also symbolizes the coming of death in Irish Mythology.

== Colors ==

[[Black]] is the [[color]] of [[mourning]] in many [[Europe]]an cultures. Black clothing is typically worn at funerals to show mourning for the death of the person. In [[East Asia]], [[white]] is similarly associated with mourning; it represented the purity and perfection of the deceased person's spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colors for Your Every Mood: Discover Your True Decorating Colors|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RKcQbF5cBiQC|publisher = Capital Books|date = 2000|isbn = 9781892123381|first = Leatrice|last = Eiseman|page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian era]], [[purple]] and [[grey]] were considered to be mourning colors in addition to [[black]]. Furthermore, in Revelation 6 in [[The Bible]], Death is one of the four horsemen; and he rides a pale horse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206:%208;&amp;version=NIV Revelation 6:8 (New International Version)] at Bible Gateway.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaginal trauma''' is injury to the [[vagina]]. It can happen during [[childbirth]], sexual assault, and accidental occurrences.

This injury often consists of bruising. But in some cases, severe hemorrhage can be a concern that requires immediate medical attention. In adults, the vagina is largely protected from trauma due to the protective function of the [[mons pubis]] and [[labia majora]]. This protection is lacking in girls who lack a protective fat layer to protect the vagina. Vaginal trauma can occur when something is inserted into the vagina, for example, a sharp object causing [[penetrating trauma]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Barbara L.|title=Williams Gynecology|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9780071716727|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur as a result of a painful sexual experience or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/vagina/art-20046562|title=Vagina: What's normal, what's not|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaginal trauma can occur in children as a result of a straddle injury. Most of these, though distressing, are not serious injuries.

In some instances, a severe injury occurs and requires immediate medical attention.

== Treatment ==
Treatment begins with a thorough assessment. The presence of someone to provide support during the examination is very beneficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such support is especially prioritized in cases of vaginal trauma due to sexual assault. A support person provides emotional support and can help minimize the risk of re-traumatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those treating victims employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.&lt;ref name="mci2017"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''veridicality''' is a [[semantic]] or [[grammar|grammatical]] assertion of the truth of an utterance. For example, the statement "Paul saw a snake" asserts the truthfulness of the claim, while "Paul ''did'' see a snake" is an even stronger assertion. [[Negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is veridical, though of opposite [[polarity (grammar)|polarity]], sometimes called ''antiveridical'': "Paul didn't see a snake" asserts that the statement "Paul saw a snake" is false.  In English, [[linguistic modality|non-indicative moods]] are frequently used in a nonveridical sense: "Paul may have seen a snake" and "Paul would have seen a snake" do not assert that Paul actually saw a snake (and the second implies that he did not), though "Paul would indeed have seen a snake" is veridical, and some languages have separate veridical [[conditional mood]]s for such cases.

== In semantic theory ==
The formal definition of veridicality views the context as a [[propositional operator]].

# A propositional operator ''F'' is veridical [[iff]] ''Fp'' entails ''p'': ''Fp'' → ''p''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
# Additionally, a nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff ''Fp'' entails ''not p'': ''Fp'' → ¬''p''.

For [[temporal logic#Temporal operators|temporal]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] operators, the definition of veridicality is somewhat more complex:

* For operators relative to instants of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an instant of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true at time ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true at a (contextually relevant) time ''t&amp;prime;'' ≤ ''t''.
* For operators relative to intervals of time: Let ''F'' be a temporal or aspectual operator, and ''t'' an interval of time.
*# ''F'' is veridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''; otherwise ''F'' is nonveridical.
*# A nonveridical operator ''F'' is antiveridical iff for ''Fp'' to be true of ''t'', ¬''p'' must be true of all (contextually relevant) ''t&amp;prime;'' ⊆ ''t''.

=== Nonveridical operators ===
Nonveridical operators typically license the use of ''polarity items'', which in veridical contexts normally is ungrammatical:

: * John saw ''any'' students. (The context is veridical.)
: John didn't see ''any'' students. (The context is nonveridical.)

=== Downward entailment ===
All [[Downward entailment|downward entailing]] contexts are nonveridical. Because of this, theories based on nonveridicality can be seen as extending those based on downward entailment, allowing to explain more cases of PI licensing.

Downward entailment predicts that polarity items will be licensed in the scope of [[negation (linguistics)|negation]], downward entailing [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s like ''few N'', ''at most n N'', ''no N'', and the restriction of ''every'':

: No students saw ''anything''.
: John didn't see ''anything''.
: Few children saw ''anything''.
: Every student who saw ''anything'' should report to the police.

=== Non-monotone quantifiers ===
[[Quantifier (linguistics)|Quantifiers]] like ''exactly three students'', ''nobody but John'', and ''almost nobody'' are non-monotone (and thus not downward entailing) but nevertheless admit ''any'':

: % Exactly three students saw ''anything''.
: Nobody but John saw ''anything''.
: Almost nobody saw ''anything''.

=== ''Hardly'' and ''barely'' ===
''Hardly'' and ''barely'' allow for ''any'' despite not being downward entailing.

: John hardly talked to ''anybody''. (Does not entail "John hardly talked to his mother".)
: John barely studied ''anything''. (Does not entail "John barely studied linguistics".)

=== Questions ===
Polarity items are quite frequent in [[question]]s, although questions are not monotone.

: Did you see ''anything''?

Although questions [[loaded question|biased]] towards the negative answer, such as "Do you &lt;nowiki&gt;[even]&lt;/nowiki&gt; give a damn about any books?" ([[tag question]]s based on negative sentences exhibit even more such bias), can sometimes be seen as downward entailing, this approach cannot account for the general case, such as the above example where the context is perfectly neutral. Neither can it explain why [[negative question]]s, which naturally tend to be biased, don't license negative polarity items.

In semantics which treats a question as the set of its true answers, the [[denotation]] of a polar question contains two possible answers:

: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Did you see John?]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt; you saw John ∨ you didn't see John &lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Because [[disjunction]] ''p'' ∨ ''q'' entails neither ''p'' nor ''q'', the context is nonveridical, which explains the admittance of ''any''.

=== Future ===
Polarity items appear in [[future tense|future]] sentences.

: John will buy ''any'' bottle of wine.
: The children will leave as soon as they discover ''anything''.

According to the formal definition of veridicality for temporal operators, future is nonveridical: that "John will buy a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' does not entail that "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true at any instant up to and including ''now''. On the other hand, [[past tense|past]] is veridical: that "John bought a bottle of Merlot" is true ''now'' entails that there is an instant preceding ''now'' at which "John buys a bottle of Merlot" is true.

=== Habitual aspect ===
Likewise, nonveridicality of the [[habitual aspect]] licenses polarity items.

: He usually reads ''any'' book very carefully.

The habitual aspect is nonveridical because e.g., that "He is usually cheerful" is true over some interval of time does not entail that "He is cheerful" is true over every subinterval of that. This is in contrast to e.g., the [[progressive aspect]], which is veridical and prohibits negative polarity items.

=== Generic sentences ===
Non-monotone generic sentences accept polarity items.

: ''Any'' cat hunts mice.

=== Modal verbs ===
[[Modal verb]]s create generally good environments for polarity items:

: John may talk to ''anybody''.
: ''Any'' minors must be accompanied by their parents.
: The committee can give the job to ''any'' candidate.

Such contexts are nonveridical despite being non-monotone and sometimes even upward entailing ("John must tango" entails "John must dance").

=== Imperatives ===
[[Imperative mood|Imperatives]] are roughly parallel to modal verbs and intensional contexts in general.

: Take ''any'' apple. (cf. "You may/must take ''any'' apple", "I want you to take ''any'' apple".)

=== Protasis of conditionals ===
[[Protasis (linguistics)|Protasis]] of [[conditional sentence|conditionals]] is one of the most common environments for polarity items.

: If you sleep with ''anybody'', I'll kill you.

=== Directive intensional verbs ===
Polarity items are licensed with [[directive modality|directive]] [[propositional attitude]]s but not with [[epistemic]] ones.

: John would like to invite ''any'' student.
: John asked us to invite ''any'' student.
: * John believes that we invited ''any'' student.
: * John dreamt that we invited ''any'' student.

The '''vicious circle principle''' is a principle that was endorsed by many [[impredicativity|predicativist]] mathematicians in the early 20th century to prevent contradictions.  The principle states that no object or property may be introduced by a definition that depends on that object or property itself.  In addition to ruling out definitions that are explicitly circular (like "an object has property P [[iff]] it is not next to anything that has property P"), this principle rules out definitions that quantify over domains which include the entity being defined.  Thus, it blocks [[Russell's paradox]], which defines a set S that contains all sets that don't contain themselves.  This definition is blocked because it defines a new set in terms of the totality of all sets, of which this new set would itself be a member.

However, it also blocks one standard definition of the [[natural numbers]].  First, we define a property as being "[[hereditary]]" if, whenever a number ''n'' has the property, so does ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Then we say that ''x'' has the property of being a natural number [[iff|if and ''only'' if]] it has every hereditary property that 0 has.  This definition is blocked, because it defines "natural number" in terms of the totality of all hereditary properties, but "natural number" itself would be such a hereditary property, so the definition is circular in this sense.

Most modern mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics think that this particular definition is not circular in any problematic sense, and thus they reject the vicious circle principle.  But it was endorsed by many early 20th century researchers including [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Henri Poincaré]].  On the other hand, [[Frank P. Ramsey]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]] accepted the ban on explicit circularity, but argued against the ban on circular quantification.  After all, the definition "let T be the tallest man in the room" defines T by means of quantification over a domain (men in the room) of which T is a member.  But this is not problematic, they suggest, because the definition doesn't actually create the person, but merely shows how to pick him out of the totality.  Similarly, they suggest, definitions don't actually create sets or properties or objects, but rather just give one way of picking out the already existing entity from the collection of which it is a part.  Thus, this sort of circularity in terms of quantification can't cause any problems.

This principle was the reason for Russell's development of the [[System of types#The 1908 .22ramified.22 theory of types|ramified theory of types]] rather than the [[History of type theory#Theory of simple types|theory of simple types]].  (See "Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles".&lt;ref name="SEP001"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result from a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise from supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which can only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for example, the collection of propositions will be supposed to contain a proposition stating that “all propositions are either true or false.” It would seem, however, that such a statement could not be legitimate unless “all propositions” referred to some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new propositions are created by statements about “all propositions.” We shall, therefore, have to say that statements about “all propositions” are meaningless.… The principle which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be stated as follows: “Whatever involves all of a collection must not be one of the collection”; or, conversely: “If, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have members only definable in terms of that total, then the said collection has no total.” We shall call this the “vicious-circle principle,” because it enables us to avoid the vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate totalities. (Whitehead and Russell 1910, 37) (quoted in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/ Russell's Paradox])
