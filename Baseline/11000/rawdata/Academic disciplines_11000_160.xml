      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1875">An '''activity relationship chart''' (ARC) is a [[tabular]] means of displaying the [[Closeness (graph theory)|closeness rating]] among all pairs of activities or departments.&lt;ref name="Groover" /&gt; In an ARC there are six closeness ratings which may be assigned to each pair of departments, as well as nine reasons for those ratings (each is assigned by a reason code).

== Rating symbols ==
#A: Absolutely necessary
#E: Especially important
#I: Important and core
#O: Ordinary 
#U: Unimportant
#X: Undesirable &lt;ref name="Tompkins" /&gt;

== Reason codes ==
#Same table
#Flow of material
#Service
#Convenience
#[[Inventory control]]
#Communication
#Same personnel
#[[Cleanliness]]
#Flow of parts&lt;ref name="Tompkins" /&gt; 
A [[rule of thumb]] is used to restrict the choice of rating letters:
*Very few ''A'' and ''X'' relationships (no more than five percent) should be assigned
*No more than 10 percent should be ''E''
*No more than 15 percent should be ''I''
*No more than 20 percent should be ''O''
*About 50 percent of the relationships should be ''U''

=={{anchor|Developing an activity relationship chart}}Developing an ARC==
#List all the departments within the facility, and draw a rectangle around each one.
#Draw a [[rhombus]] between each department, until you fully construct the rhombus as a tree.
#Divide each rhombus into two halves; the upper half will contain the rating letter, while the lower half will contain the rating-reason code.

'''Anna L. Peterson''' (born 1963) is an American scholar of [[religious studies]] who is currently a [[professor]] in the Department of Religion at the [[University of Florida]], where she has worked since 1993. Her research variously concerns [[religion in Latin America]] and [[ethics]]—including [[religious ethics]], [[Christian ethics]], [[environmental ethics]], [[animal ethics]] and [[social ethics]]. She is the author of five monographs: ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' ([[State University of New York Press]], 1997); ''Being Human'' ([[University of California Press]], 2001); ''Seeds of the Kingdom'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2001); ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2009); and ''Being Animal'' (Columbia University Press, 2013).

==Career==
Peterson studied at [[Williams College]] (1981–1983) before going on to receive a [[religious studies]] [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of California at Berkeley]] (1983–1985). She then studied at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] from 1986 to 1991. She received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in 1987, and a [[doctorate|PhD]] in Ethics and Society in 1991. Her doctoral [[thesis]] was supervised by Robin Lovin.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;Peterson, Anna L. [http://sites.clas.ufl.edu/religion/files/2012/11/Peterson-CV1.pdf CV]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ufl"&gt;"[http://people.clas.ufl.edu/annap/ Anna L. Peterson]". [[University of Florida]]. Accessed 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[assistant professor]] in religious studies at [[St. Norbert College]] in 1991, where she remained until 1993, when she took up the position of assistant professor at the [[University of Florida]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1997, her ''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion'' was published with [[State University of New York Press]]. The book blends [[theology]], [[social history]] and [[ethnographic]] [[anthropology]] to explore ideas of [[Catholic]] [[martyrdom]] in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Cornelia. (1998). "''Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion: Progressive Catholicism in El Salvador's Civil War''. By Anna L. Peterson". ''Journal of Church and State'' '''40''' (3): 696–7. {{Doi|10.1093/jcs/40.3.696}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an [[associate professor]] in 1998, and spent two years as a [[visiting fellow]] at the [[Wesleyan University]] Department of Religion.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; 2001 saw the publication of her ''Being Human'', a book about [[environmental ethics]] from the perspective of [[religious ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Susan J. (2002). "[http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_9/0602armstrong.html ''Being Human: Ethics, Environment, and Our Place in the World'']". ''[[Journal of Political Ecology]]'' '''9''' (2). {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she became a [[full professor]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Peterson has published a number of books while a full professor at Florida. ''Seeds of the Kingdom'', a comparative study of United States [[Amish]] farming communities and of El Salvador's refugee communities, appeared in 2005. Both groups examined, Peterson argues, attempt to build [[utopian]] Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;McKanan, Dan (2007). "Anna L Peterson, ''Seeds of the Kingdom''". ''[[The Journal of Religion]]'' '''87''' (2): 295–7. {{doi|10.1086/513230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Everyday Ethics and Social Change'' was published in 2009. In this book, Peterson argues that humans should the extend ethical values dominant in interpersonal relationships, such as love, to differently structure currently instrumental societal and political relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Rita (2010). "''Everyday Ethics and Social Change''". ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' '''32''' (4): 421–4. {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics201032445}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 2011 saw the publication of ''Working Toward Sustainability: Ethical Decision-Making in a Technological World'', a textbook which Peterson co-authored with Charles J. Kibert, Martha C. Monroe, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Kibert, Charles J., Martha C. Monroe, Anna L. Peterson, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele (2012). ''Working Toward Sustainability''. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013's ''Being Animal'', Peterson critiques the separation of environmental and [[animal ethics]]. Though frequently thought irreconcilable, Peterson argues that the separation can be blamed on a weak understanding of nature, humans, and animals, as well as the relationships between them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhall, Andrew (2015). "Anna L. Peterson: ''Being Animal: Beasts &amp; Boundaries in Nature Ethics''". ''[[Ethical Theory and Moral Practice]]'' '''18''' (4): 877–9. {{Doi|10.1007/s10677-015-9560-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected bibliography==
In addition to her books, Peterson has written over twenty articles published in [[peer review]]ed [[academic journals]] and scholarly [[edited collections]], as well as various [[review articles]], [[book reviews]] and [[encyclopedia]] articles.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

'''Antiques restoration''' is restoring an [[antique]] or work of [[art]] to a like-new condition, or preserving an antique or work of art against further deterioration as in [[art conservation|conservation]].

==Restoration==
[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration, [[National Museum, Warsaw]]]]

Restoration can be as simple as light cleaning to remove disfiguring dirt or grime, such as on the surface of a painting, or it may include near complete rebuilding or replacement, as might be the case with old [[automobile]]s or [[furniture]]. Often done in preparation for sale, or by a [[art collector|collector]] upon acquiring a new piece, the main goal of restoration is to "restore" the original appearance or functionality of a piece.

There is a lot of difference between restoring and repairing. Functionality may be achieved by a repair, but restoring an item properly is an art-form. Finishes might/may be stripped and redone, but it is essential that the original [[patina]]tion is retained, if possible. Stripping is only done as a last resort, especially with antique furniture. Engines might be rebuilt with new parts as necessary, or holes in a silver pot might/may be patched. While some of these practices are frowned on by many museums, scholars, and other experts, for many people{{fact|date=December 2015}} there is little value in an antique that is unusable or not able to be displayed. Poor restoration is the bane of a trained restorer. Working on someone else's bad repair is the worst possible situation. Often with antique restoration, there are also other issues as well. For example, some collectors value "patina", or also want an item to still reflect an aesthetic that shows its age- in this respect, an "over restored" item can actually take away from its value than if nothing has been done to the item at all. Therefore, restoration of valuable objects should always be left to professionals who are sensitive to all of the issues, ensuring that a piece retains or increases its value after restoration.

Original artwork can sustain all sorts of damage over its lifetime. Conservatorshave an obligation to the artwork to recommend the best techniques for preserving it for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiebold.com/paintings_and_frames "Paintings and Frames"] 2000-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restorers are often trained craftspersons, such as furniture makers, [[mechanic]]s, or [[smith (metalwork)|metalsmiths]]. Some have years of experience in their fields, whereas others are self-taught volunteers. Many of the antique aircraft around the [[United States]] are restored by trained aircraft engineers assisted by volunteers, some of whom are men who flew those same aircraft years ago.

Given that a single piece of furniture may include wood, glass, inlay, leather and fabric, antique restoration encompasses several skills. Caldararo estimates that 90 percent of USA restorers are self-taught, or cobble together their skills from idiosyncratic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Davis Kho. [http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Restoring-antiques-a-nearly-lost-art-3253209.php "Restoring antiques a nearly lost art."] ''San Francisco Chronicle''. January 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[French polish|French Polishing]]" was the industry standard in [[Europe]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, pushed aside by the efficient advantage of modern methods in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. [[Lacquer]]s and spray systems replaced the original French polish finish, which is impractical for mass furniture production due to the labor-intensive process of application. As the desire for antiques was not idle, neither was the need for them to be appropriately restored; thus, the trade has been kept alive by a thread.

===Restoration terminology===
*[[Conservation-restoration|Conservation]]: Detail-oriented process designed to preserve as much original finish and materials as possible while bringing the piece back to as close to its original condition as possible.
*[[Finish restoration]]: Finish restoration is the process of bringing an existing finish back to life. This involves re-emulsifying the original finish, either shellac or varnish. By using the original solvents to liquefy the solids, their ability to adhere to and penetrate the piece returns. The process also removes the dirt and grime accumulated over years of use. If the finish is very thin, additional layers of the same finish may be applied to bolster the restored finish and ensure longevity. Finish restoration results in an original finish rating: for example, 85% of the original finish remains. The more original finish that remains, the more antique value remains.
*[[Historic preservation|Preservation]]: The process of stopping or slowing deterioration usually does not involve actual restoration or attempts to return the piece to its original condition. Damage and finish deterioration are left intact, but prevented from going further. This process is usually done on museum works; we recommend a conservation or restoration process for home use of antiques. In most cases this is a chemical process that prevents further oxidation of the wood and metals, and in addition adds moister to the existing finish. 
*[[Refinishing]]: Removing a finish and applying a new finish in its place. This process destroys significant portions of antique value in furniture and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. 
*[[Repair]]: Physical structural replacement or reinforcement of parts of the original piece. May involve addition of new materials altered to appear aged or the application of antique materials to improve appearance of repair and preserve as much value as possible. 
*[[Art restoration|Restoration]]: Bringing a piece back to close to its original condition including structural and finish repairs. 
*[[Paint stripper|Stripping]]:  stripping involves dipping the piece in a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, and in some cases the glue holding the piece together.&lt;ref&gt;Eric &amp; Stanley Saperstein [http://www.artisansofthevalley.com/docs/the_philosophy_of_restoration.pdf "The Philosophy of Restoration"] December 2002 page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvage==
On the other extreme, though most bad old pieces were thrown away long ago, there are pieces that, because of their original design or workmanship or because of damage, are not worth restoring but that are made of re-usable materials such as hard wood, amber, pewter or ivory.  As the number of people increases and the number of trees and other natural products in the world decreases, wood and other materials becomes more scarce.  So the fact that the material was not worth doing a good job with when an item was made does not mean that the material should be discarded along with the object now.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19947">An '''Assistant Language Teacher''' ('''ALT''') is a foreign national serving as an [[assistant teacher]] ([[paraprofessional educator]]) in a Japanese classroom, particularly for English.

The term was created by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] at the time of the creation of the [[JET Programme]] as a translation of the term 外国語指導助手 (''gaikokugo shidō joshu'') or literally "foreign language instruction assistant". The terms '''AET''' (Assistant English Teacher), '''ELT''' (English Language Teacher) and '''NESA''' (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education ('''BOE'''s) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to [[English language]] speakers who assist with [[Teaching English as a foreign language|teaching of English]] in [[primary school|elementary]], [[middle school|junior high]] and [[secondary school|senior high school]]s. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.

ALTs are required to be [[university]] graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues.

==Being an ALT==

===Requirements===

The JET Programme set the general prerequisites imposed by [[Immigration to Japan|Japanese immigration]] ([[bachelor's degree]], [[health]], [[nationality]]) and the characteristics that can be considered to be sought by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], [[board of education|boards of education]] (BOEs), and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |title=Teach English in Japan |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction |date=December 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207232329/http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ALTs from private language teaching companies, further requirements may include items such as [[Teaching English as a foreign language|TEFL]] [[certification]], [[Japanese language]] ability (at least spoken) at a communicative level, teaching experience (both within Japan and in other countries) and other specialized skills ([[foreign language]]s other than English, IT, etc.)  However, as a basic rule, the standards that are expected of JET Programme are still considered as norms among private language teaching companies that provide ALTs to BOEs, although agreements between BOEs and private companies often allow for a relaxing on some of these rules.

===Recruitment===
At one time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as "dispatch companies", either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area.  ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.

ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.

===Payment===

The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time [[Eikaiwa]] teacher and far less than a teacher from the [[JET Programme]] (¥3.36 to ¥3.96 million depending on year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jetprogramusa.org/contract-benefits/ |title=Contract Information |year=2016 |website=[[JET Programme|JET Program]] USA |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with some of the lowest salaries around ¥180,000 per month (¥2.16 million annually)
The Interac company ALTs/ dispatch staff make approximately ¥3600 (US $32) per hour, BUT, the ALT receives approximately half of that amount ¥1800( US$16 ) per hour before tax. Interac deducts approximately half of the monthly earnings with its justification being that it trains ALTs and incurs other administrative costs.In reality most Interac ALT's receive 5days of actual training before being dispatched to teach at schools. It is therefore a lucrative business for such companies, minimal initial investment, but constant monthly cashflow from the 3000+ active ALTs at Interac in Japan alone.If requested to attend 3 monthly briefing meetings,  the pay is ¥900 per hour( US $7.00).In Japan almost every business which employs a person for 30 hours(or more ), has to pay for the employees monthly health insurance.  Interac dodges having to pay health insurance for workers claiming to the government that its employees work only 29.5 hours per week instead of 30 hours. But in REALITY, employees are actually stuck at a school site or at a desk for 40hours(or more) per week {cn|date=October 16th 2018}}. Benefits and workload also vary.Elementary school ALTs are the most exhausted because they require extra 'Genki' energy to engage students and recently focus has changed with new MEXT ideologies as of March 2018 .  JHS and Highschool are less energy consuming but focus more on grammar and practical use of  English . Some companies pay their ALTs between semesters and some do not. Some provide benefits, such as access to employer subsidized health insurance, paid holidays, paid vacation/sick leave and unemployment insurance, and some do not.

===Job duties===
An ALT's primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks.Regarding Elemenary school,  the term ALT is often misleading, in many instances the ALT will solely be responsible for total lesson planning( for the academic year and delivering the lessons). This is mostly the case with Elementary schools outside of the Kanto region. During such lessons, Japanese teachers often act as a support teacher or translator.In those instances the term "Assistant" Language Teacher becomes unsuitable, as the ALT is not "assisting" but actually "leading and facilitating" the entire english class.   However in Junior Highschool and Highschool, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions|url=https://jetprogramusa.org/positions/|website=JET Program USA|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45–50 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (''bukatsudō''), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students' planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.

ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students.  They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.

ALTs may be required to read aloud stories about [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] and the lingering deaths of Japanese children to their classes, which omit any mention of [[World War II]] or the Japanese government's [[Japanese war crimes|conduct during the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[New Horizon (textbook)|New Horizon]] 3|chapter=A Mother's Lullaby|page=36|publisher=Tokyo Shoseki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://akitajet.com/wiki/A_Mother's_Lullaby| title=A Mother's Lullaby| publisher=Akita JET| accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the private ALT system in Japan==
In 1999, Dispatch Law (労働者派遣) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.

The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country.  There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.

===Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs===

*'''Application:''' The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.
*'''Compensation:''' As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between ¥3.36 and ¥3.96 million annually depending on their year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary" /&gt;. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as ¥2.2 million per annum{{cn|date=April 2018}}.
*'''Support:''' The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.
*'''Workload:''' The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.
*'''External Work:''' JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.
*'''Contractual Term Limits''': JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.

The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.

==Union Activity and ALTs==

===Education law===

Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal ''gyomu itaku'' (service contracts). According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, these contracts violate Japan's General Education Law since the principal must be in charge of all staff at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.150m.com/ |title=Gyomu Itaku Contracts are Illegal |date=February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alt.150m.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with these contracts, the company is actually in charge - not the principal.

The licensed Japanese teacher is normally in charge of junior high school and high school classes regardless of where the ALT originates; however in the case of elementary school classes, the ALT is normally responsible for the entire class, with the Japanese teacher either providing limited input or in some cases not being present in the classroom, and for that reason the continuity of school management is sometimes maintained with the school principal in compliance with any legal requirements, as the product being contracted itself is an abstract, education, and the contract basis for private language teaching corporations is to provide education and educational services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===29.5 hours per week===

It is common for ALTs to be recruited with job contracts with private language companies such as [[W5 (company)|W5]], [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], [[Borderlink]] and [[WING (company)|WING]] which stipulates ALT working hours as being 29.5 hours per week. In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or [[Social welfare in Japan|Shakai hoken]]. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, companies consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20080105f1.html|author=Kanako Takahara|title=Assistant language teachers in trying times|publisher=The Japan Times Online|date=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken. Furthermore, no company would ever be prohibited from enrolling their employees in the Social Insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacunion.org/to-interac-info-on-health-insurance/|title=To Interac: Info on Health Insurance|publisher=Nambu Foreign Workers Caucus|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some AETs dispatched to the City of [[Nagoya]] have a 35-hour work week and are not enrolled in Shakai Hoken, receive no paid sick leave, no paid holidays, no paid vacation leave, and are not enrolled in unemployment insurance. They are only paid for days worked and receive no pay between semesters except for a few training sessions.

===Kanagawa Board of Education===

In 2006, ALTs in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] who were previously hired directly as part-time workers rejected the privatization of their jobs to [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], a nationwide language services dispatch company, and took the Kanagawa Prefecture Board of Education to the Labour Relations Board where the case is still on-going.

As in many cases, the likely cause of the dissolution of the direct-hire situation draws back to Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] who took a hard-line stance on privatization (e.g. Japan Post) and the idea of allowing local governments more flexibility in deciding how to spend their budgets.

===Other local Boards of Education===

The General Workers Union has been involved with several boards of education in the Kanto area including the Tokyo Board of Education, the Koga Board of Education (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and the Fukaya Board of Education (in [[Saitama Prefecture]]). In the case versus the Tokyo Board of Education, the General Workers Union won a decision stating that the directly hired ALTs were indeed legally classified as "workers" (''rodosha'') and not simply contractors. Further victories were achieved through the private companies that had contracts with the Koga and Fukaya boards of education.

The '''Australian National Wildlife Collection''' ('''ANWC''') is a collection of almost 200,000 [[zoology|zoological]] [[Biological specimen|specimen]]s, including skeletons, skins, spirit specimens, birds’ eggs, frozen tissue samples and a wildlife sound library, mainly of [[vertebrate]] animals from [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], which are stored in a secure, climate-controlled facility.  It is based at [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]] Sustainable Ecosystems Division in the [[Australian Capital Territory]].

==History==
The ANWC was established in 1966, though its origins date from the late 1950s when scientists in the CSIRO’s Wildlife Survey section were collecting specimens in the course of their work and were concerned that their individual collections should not be dispersed and should be accessible at a central location for long-term security and so that comparative studies could be made.  The decision to establish a central facility was made by [[Harold James Frith|Harold Frith]], Chief of the Division of Wildlife.  The founding Curator, later Director, was [[Richard Schodde]], who held the post for nearly thirty years.  It was formally recognised and named the Australian National Wildlife Collection in 1976 through [[gazettal]] by the [[Government of Australia]].

The '''biocapacity''' or '''biological capacity''' of an [[ecosystem]] is an estimate of its production of certain biological materials such as [[natural resources]], and its absorption and filtering of other materials such as [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/|website=[[Global Footprint Network]]: Advancing the Science of Sustainability|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yue|first1=Dongxia|last2=Guo|first2=Jianjun|last3=Hui|first3=Cang|title=Scale dependency of biocapacity and the fallacy of unsustainable development|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2013|volume=126|pages=13–19|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.022}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; “Useful biological 

Biocapacity is expressed in terms of [[global hectares]] per person, thus is dependent on human population. A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive [[hectares]] on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of [[ecosystem services]]). Biocapcity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. 

For example, there were 12 billion hectares of biologically productive land and water on this planet in 2008. Dividing by the number of people alive in that year, 6.7 billion, gives a biocapacity of 1.8 global hectares per person . This assumes that no land is set aside for other species that consume the same biological material as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/ecological_wealth_of_nations_en Ecological Wealth of Nations: Earth's Biocapacity as a new framework for International Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocapacity is used together with [[Ecological Footprint]] as a method of measuring [[Human impact on the environment]]. Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint are tools created by the [[Global Footprint Network]], used in sustainability studies around the world.

==Applications of biocapacity==
An increase in global population can result in a decrease in biocapacity.  This is usually due to the fact that the Earth’s resources have to be shared; therefore, there becomes little to supply the increasing demand of the increasing [[population]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web|title=What does ecological overshoot mean?|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/overshoot/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this issue can be resolved by [[outsourcing]]. However, resources will run out due to the increasing demands and as a result a collapse of an ecosystem can be the consequence of such actions.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; When the [[ecological footprint]] becomes greater than the biocapacity of the population, a [[ecological deficit|biocapacity deficit]] is suspected.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap&gt;{{cite web|title=Natures regenerative capacity|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/biocapacity/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Global biocapacity' is a term sometimes used to describe the total capacity of an ecosystem to support various continuous activity and changes.  When the [[ecological footprint]] of a population exceeds the biocapacity of the environment it lives in, this can be called an 'ecological overshoot'.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap /&gt;&lt;ref name=RefiningEF&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venetoulis|first1=Jason|last2=Talberth|first2=John|title=Refining the ecological footprint|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=5 January 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=441–469|doi=10.1007/s10668-006-9074-z}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report stated that people were using an equivalence of 1.5 Earths to compensate for their needs.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt;  However other sources have suggested that depletion of cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land is not occurring on an aggregate, global level. Hence, virtually all of the ecological overshoot comes from the measure of the rate at which carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does the Shoe Fit? Real versus Imagined Ecological Footprints|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001700|publisher=PLOS biology journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stresses of [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[climate change]], and [[ocean acidification]] can also aggravate the problem.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; In reference to the definition of biocapacity: 1.5 Earths means [[renewable resource]]s will eventually result in depletion because they are being produced faster and more often than the resources can be re-grown.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; Therefore, it will one year and six months for the resources we use to be able to regenerate again and in addition absorb all the waste we manufactured as well.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; So instead of taking one year, we are now in-taking enough [[resource]]s that should last us one year and six months.

In addition, if this matter becomes severe, an [[nature reserve|ecological reserve]] will be set on areas to preserve their ecosystems. Awareness about our depleting resources include: agricultural land, forest resources and rangeland.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayden|first1=Anders|title=ecological footprint (EF)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1699724/ecological-footprint-EF|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocapacity used in correlation to ecological footprint can therefore suggest whether a specific population, region, country or part of a world is living in the means of their capital. Accordingly,§98 the study of biocapacity and ecological footprint is known as the [[ecological footprint|Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA)]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

Biocapacity is also affected on the technology used during the year. With new technologies emerging, it is not whether the technology in that year is good or bad but whether how the technology impacts resource supply and demand; which in return affects biocapacity.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; Hence what is considered “useful” can change from year to year (e.g. use of corn (maize) stover for cellulosic ethanol production would result in corn stover becoming a useful material, and thus increase the biocapacity of maize cropland).

Moreover, environmentalists have created [[ecological footprint|ecological footprint calculators]] for a single person(s) to determine whether they are encompassing more than what is available for them in their population.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopton|first1=Matthew E.|last2=White|first2=Denis|title=A simplified ecological footprint at a regional scale|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2012|volume=111|pages=279–286|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.07.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, biocapacity results will be applied to their ecological footprint to determine how much they may contribute or take away from sustainable development.

In general, biocapacity is the amount of resources available to people at a specific moment in time to a specific population ([[resource|supply]]) and to differentiate between ecological footprint – that is the demand constructed on behalf of a '''regional ecosystem'''.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale /&gt; Biocapacity is able to determine the human impacts on Earth. By determining productivity of land, hence the resources available for human consumption, biocapacity will be able to predict and perhaps examine the effects on the ecosystems closely based on collected results of human consumption.
.The biocapacity of an area is calculated by multiplying the actual physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence factor. Biocapacity is usually expressed in [[global hectare|global hectares (gha)]].&lt;ref name=Serres&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioresources, Biocapacity of Ecosystems, and related terms|url=http://institutmichelserres.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?article37|website=Michel Serres Institute: for resources and public goods|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since global hectares is able to convert [[Consumer (food chain)|human consumptions]] like food and water into a measurement, biocapacity can be applied to determine the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.

[[File:Dakar University, Senegal, 1967.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cheikh Anta Diop University campus, 1967. The original library building at center.]]
'''Cheikh Anta Diop University''' ({{lang-fr|'''Université Cheikh Anta Diop''' or '''UCAD'''}}), also known as the '''University of Dakar''', is a [[university]] in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. It is named after the [[Senegal]]ese physicist, [[historian]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Cheikh Anta Diop]]&lt;ref&gt;Touré, Maelenn-Kégni, [http://www.blackpast.org/gah/cheikh-anta-diop-university-1957 "Cheikh Anta Diop University (1957--)"], BlackPast.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/University-Cheikh-Anta-Diop "University Cheikh Anta Diop"], Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; and has an enrollment of over 60,000.

==History==
Cheikh Anta Diop University predates Senegalese independence and grew out of several French institutions set up by the colonial administration.  In 1918, the French created the "école africaine de médecine" (African medical school), mostly to serve white and [[Métis]] students but also open to the small educated elite of the [[Four Communes (colonial Senegal)|four free towns of Senegal]] with nominal French citizenship.  In 1936, under the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government in France, Dakar became home to the [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN), an institute for the study of African culture.

In 1950s, with [[decolonisation]] already looming, the French administration expanded these schools, added science faculties, and combined the schools into the "Institut des Hautes Etudes de Dakar".  In 1957, a new campus was constructed as the 18th French Public University, attached to the [[University of Paris]] and the [[University of Bordeaux]].  This became the '''University of Dakar''' the largest and most prestigious university in [[French West Africa]]. In 1987, its name was changed to honor the Senegalese philosopher and anthropologist, [[Cheikh Anta Diop]].

===Enrollment growth===
At independence in 1960, enrollment was 1,018 students, only 39% Senegalese, with most of the rest from other former French colonies. By 1976, this number grew to 8,014.

In the 1970s, a time of state financial crisis, funding to higher education was cut, and international agencies stepped in over the next decade. Most of this funding, though, went to meet the needs of primary schools.  In the 1990s and 2000s there was a huge boom in Senegalese primary and secondary education, much of it funded through international projects. In 1984 around 50% of Senegalese children received primary education and by 2004 more than 90% did.

In the mid-1980s around 20% of World Bank funding to Senegalese education went to higher education, but this figure dropped to 7% by the mid-1990s.  With these projects came severe [[World Bank]] restrictions, dramatically cutting domestic funding available to university programs. As students who have benefited from primary and secondary education age, Cheikh Anta Diop University has had its already stretched resources stretched further.  Nine thousand Senegalese students received a Baccalaureate degree in 2000, while total registration shot above 40,000, for a campus built with only 5,000 dorm rooms.&lt;ref&gt;"Africa's Storied Colleges, Jammed and Crumbling," By Lydia Polgreen, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 20 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Andrew Francis; Phillips, Lucie Colvin; Phillips, Lucie Colvin. ''Historical Dictionary of Senegal''. p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these pressures Cheikh Anta Diop University maintains a reputation as one of Africa's most prestigious institutions.  Most of the post-independence generation of Senegalese leaders are graduates of the university, and its alumni teach in universities around the world.

==Academics==
The education system follows the French pattern, with oral and/or written final exams administered at the end of the year. All courses at the university are taught in French, except those in language departments other than French.

===Schools and institutes===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
UCAD offers courses of study in Humanities, Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, Finance, Accounting, and Law. The university awards the following degrees: B.A., B.S., Ph.D., and D.M.A.

The School of Medicine includes departments of Pharmacy, Research, and Surgery.&lt;ref name="Ucad"&gt;University Cheikh Anta Diop. (2004). University Cheikh Anta Diop's Background. Retrieved March 27, 2004, from http://www.ucad.sn&lt;/ref&gt; The university also encompasses the Institute of Sciences of the Environment (ISE) and the Institute of Sciences of Earth (ISE).

The [[Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire]] (IFAN), founded in 1936, remains one of the world centers of [[African Studies]]. The [[IFAN Museum of African Arts]]' ''Musée d'Art africain'', attached to IFAN, displays and conserves a world-renowned collection of African arts.

The [[Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar]] (Center of Applied Linguistics of Dakar) at CADU is the regulatory body for the [[Wolof language]].

Language studies are divided into the following disciplines: [[Philosophy]], [[Sociology]], [[History]], [[Geography]], Letters, Arabic, Russian, Languages and Civilizations, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Latin, German and Linguistics.

The university oversees a language school: Institut de Français pour Etrangers (IFE). The IFE specializes in French language studies aimed at foreign students in preparation for regular courses taught in French.

===Foreign programs===
UCAD hosts a number of foreign study abroad programs, including ones administered by [[Wells College]], [[Indiana University]], and the [[University of Oregon]] in the [[United States]] and numerous European universities. Participants in the program typically take a required course in Introductory Wolof and a French language (if applicable) course through the IFE in addition to regular university courses taught in French.&lt;ref name="WELL"&gt;Wells Program. (2005). Dakar Program for foreigners. Retrieved April 10, 2005, from {{cite web |url=http://www.wells.edu/academic/dakar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618181652/http://www.wells.edu/academic/dakar.htm |archivedate=2006-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A division of the university offers courses for foreign students in Senegalese and African studies, including African literature, history, politics, philosophy, and sociology.
[[File:BibliothèqueCheikhAntaDiop.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Cheikh Anta Diop University library building, showing additions, 2005.]]

CADU is a member of the [[Federation of the Universities of the Islamic World]].

====Special requirements====
For foreign students, UCAD requires a minimum age of 18 to enroll in studies in Pharmacy and a minimum age of 22 to enroll in studies relating to oral surgery.

==Student life==
UCAD has a diverse student body drawn from many countries including Senegal, [[Chad]], [[Burkina-Faso]], [[Ivory Coast]], France, [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], the United States, [[Mauritania]], [[Mali]], [[Morocco]], [[Rwanda]], [[Cameroon]], Belgium, and the United Kingdom.

As with a number of other African universities, UCAD occasionally experiences student strikes protesting government or university policies. These strikes generally last not more than one or two weeks but may be longer, as occurred during the 1993 presidential election.

With over 60,000 students and only 5,000 dormitory rooms, most students from outside Dakar must look for other accommodations.  Many students live in the [[Cité Aline Sitoe Diatta]], near the university campus, and those who can't afford Dakar's often high rents often share rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Polgreen|first1=Lydia|title=Africa’s Storied Colleges, Jammed and Crumbling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/world/africa/20senegal.html|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=The New York Times|date=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==

The university has had a number of notable incidents of violence. A Senegalese LGBT organization noted in 2016 that ten cases of homophobic mob violence had occurred at the university since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgbt-education.info/en/news/local_news/160323-senegalese-student-mob-try-to-lynch-student-thought-to-be-gay|title=Senegalese student mob try to lynch student thought to be gay - GALE|website=www.lgbt-education.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these, following a riot at the university, resulted in the death of the student who was suspected to be gay. The riot followed an attempt to apprehend the student, who had sought refugee in the university's bank and security office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi0T3H6nB6E&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=SeneNews TV:  Ucad, un présumé homosexuel lynché par une foule d'étudiants|first=|last=SeneNews TV|date=15 March 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, self-immolations and clashes between students and police have been reported after students unsuccessfully demanded scholarships or challenged grading schemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15188">A '''Collection Management Policy''' lays the foundation for how a museum handles situations pertaining to their collection. It can be defined as “a detailed written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business. The policy articulates the museum’s professional standards regarding the objects left in its care and serves as a guide for the staff”.&lt;ref&gt;Malaro, M. C., &amp; Pogany DeAngelis, I. (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections (Third ed.). Page 46. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Since museums are often faced with questions that deal with what objects they should acquire, how to handle removing or loaning objects in the collection, or standards of care for objects; it is imperative to have a well-written policy that can help prevent possible issues on the museum’s end. Prevention is the best approach when dealing with operations and objects in the collection, therefore the policy is an important document that can be looked at almost like boundaries set in place to help insure that the museum stays true to its mission while also providing the best care for the collection.

== Writing a Policy ==
When writing a policy, take the time to ensure that it covers any possible factors that might affect the museum collection, operations, or staff. It is important to note that not all museums are created equally and will therefore have their own unique situations to deal with. With this in mind one must also note that “collection management policies should be written to meet the needs of a specific museum, its collections, and the use of those collections”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simmons, J. E. (2010). Collections Management Policies. In R. A. Buck &amp; J. A. Gilmore (Eds.), Museum Registration Methods (5th ed., pp. 24-29). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  To help insure that the written policy can be put to use the museum must be aware of current practices and standards to include. The policy should also be easy to follow while avoiding being overly complex.  During the beginning stages of this process the museum and staff members should work together to develop procedures, review the policy and revise as necessary until the policy is complete.  There is a lot to consider and quite a bit of work that goes into writing this type of policy, but as the American Alliance of Museums notes, “the process of creating and implementing a policy is far more important and beneficial to the museum than the actual policy itself. The policy may seem like the end result, but in actuality, the end result is a broad understanding of ethics and procedures, which influences how the museum operates”.&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/default-source/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=4|title=American Alliance of Museums. 2012. Alliance Reference Guide Developing a Collections Management Policy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What Should a Policy Include ==
Although every museum is different, below are some of the common key factors a museum should include in their policy.

=== Introductory Section ===
Seeing how almost every decision a museum makes is done with its [[mission statement]] in mind, it is important that it is included in the policy. A mission statement addresses the museum’s focus in terms of its purpose and its roles and responsibilities to the public and collections.   This statement is what helps determine everything the museum does and should be referenced to on a regular bases to ensure that decisions are still in line with the museum’s original goal. Museum mission statements should adhere to the standards of the [[American Alliance of Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org|title=American Alliance of Museums|website=American Alliance of Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the mission statement, policies typically include a section that outlines the scope of the collection. This is a useful part of the policy that “reviews the history of the collection; considers its strengths, weaknesses, and current uses; and states what the museum does and does not collect” .  The '''collections policy''' or '''selection criteria''' of a library, archive or museum collection is a statement of the institution's priorities as they apply to the acquisition of new materials. Collections policies guide the process of collection development.

Even the largest, best funded and most famous libraries (such as the [[Library of Congress]], the [[British Library]] and [[Stanford University#Libraries and digital resources|Stanford University]]) cannot acquire, house, [[Library catalog|catalogue]] and maintain all works,&lt;ref&gt;For attempts to do this, see [[Universal library]].&lt;/ref&gt; so a policy or set of criteria is required for selecting which should be acquired. Generally collections policy is related to the mission or purpose of the library: for example [[National library|national libraries]] collect materials related to that nation or published in that nation's territory, academic libraries generally collect materials used in teaching and research at the institution which they serve&lt;ref&gt;Donated materials may be subject to less rigorous criteria and electronic materials are usually selected from large collections of serials and databases which may contain a mixture of appropriate and inappropriate materials&lt;/ref&gt; and public libraries collect materials which are expected to satisfy demands from the public they serve.

Sample collections policies include:

As well as setting priorities for purchasing materials, collections policies also serve as a guide when libraries are offered gifts of materials or [[Financial endowment|endowments]]. Acquisition of materials can be less costly than the processing (sorting, cataloguing, etc.) and long term storage costs of many materials, and even ''free'' gifts to libraries usually have associated costs.

This introductory section may also look to include a history of the museum,

=== Acquisitions ===
The acquisitions portion of a policy outlines whether or not proposed objects should be included into the museum’s collection. 
Within this section the policy will also include who is involved in this decision making process and whether or not the museum is acquiring the object on a permanent or short-term loan basis. These acquisitions must fit into the scope of collection that has been outlined by the museum. This portion of the policy can also include information pertaining to receipts for donations and ensuring that all acquired objects have proper title and have been obtained legally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The acquisitions portion of the policy tends to also include guidelines for dealing with storage, potential use, and copyright.

=== Deaccessions ===
Deaccessioning is the “process used to remove permanently an object from a museum’s collection or to document the reasons for an involuntary removal”.&lt;ref&gt;Malaro, M. C., &amp; Pogany DeAngelis, I. (2012). A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections (Third ed.) pg 46. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to new acquisitions, the policy will fully outline the steps the museum will take when considering the permanent removal of an object from the collection. Also include reasons why the object should be removed, who can propose the removal, and who has final vote on removal. Proper methods of removal and how the museum will use the proceeds should and object be sold are also key factors to include in the policy. Museums often state its adherence to the American Alliance of Museum’s Code of Ethics for Museums to make sure that the “disposal of collections through sale, trade, or research activities is solely for the advancement of the museum’s mission".&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"/&gt;

=== Loans ===
The loans section of a policy typically includes procedures for both incoming and outgoing loans. A strong loan policy will assure that the loan furthers the purpose of the museum, that the object will be cared for properly, and that the registration system can keep track of the object over for the duration of the loan".&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, D. B. (2008). Registration methods for the small museum (4th ed.). Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other key points in this portion of the policy pertain to who the museum will lend to; institutions rather than individuals, that the loaned object still fits the mission of the museum and scope of collection, insurance needs, length of the loan, and use of photography.

=== Care of Collections ===
Museums serve a purpose to protect and preserve objects within its collection. In order to ensure that the objects are getting the best possible care, the museum uses this portion of the policy to address all factors that pertain to the care of the museum’s collection. It will also identify key staff members, required levels of training to handle objects, and who has access to the collection. This section will set that standards pertaining to topics like museum storage, integrated pest management, conservation, record management, inventories, and risk management. The policy needs to clearly state the responsibilities each staff member has in order to protect objects in the collection.

==== Storage ==== 
It is likely that not every piece the museum has will be exhibited at one point. Therefore, it is important that the policy outlines standards for storage whether it be onsite or off. The policy addresses proper [[Collections care#Environmental conditions|environment conditions]] in storage areas pertaining to things like light levels, temperature, and relative humidity. This portion of the policy will also outline standards that deal with proper packing of objects in storage to insure that proper materials are used and that like objects are grouped together.

==== Integrated Pest Management ====
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated pest management]] is essential in protecting the museum’s objects from pest damage. Within this section of the policy the museum addresses what the museum plans to do in order to keep pests out of the museum. It can also address any products that can and cannot be used in the museum or on the objects themselves. In planning for preparedness the policy will address how the museum will respond to and to whom they should report any suspicion activity to.

==== Conservation ====
Museums work hard to ensure that the objects in the collection are properly cared for but conservation is still needed from time to time to help keep objects in their ideal state. The conservation portion of the policy will identify who has the final vote on whether or not objects can be treated, whether or not the staff has responsibilities dealing with actively monitoring objects, and how the museum will cover the cost of funding for conservation. It will also include specific conservators to contact and whether or not there are any treatment methods that are prohibited for use. If the museum has a long-range conservation plan, it can be mentioned here.&lt;ref name="aam-us.org"/&gt;

==== Record Management and Documentation ====
This is one of the key roles of staff members working with collections. Without proper documentation, it is almost as if the object does not exist. Therefore, it is imperative that the policy addresses standards relating to proper record management and documentation related to objects in the collection. As the American Alliance of Museums notes “In writing this section, museums typically reference the types of records created, what information is contained in each record, the parties responsible for maintaining and documenting the records and any procedures and back-up systems”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/docs/default-source/continuum/developing-a-cmp-final.pdf?sfvrsn=4|title=American Alliance of Museums. 2012. Alliance Reference Guide Developing a Collections Management Policy |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Inventories ====
[[Inventory (museum)|Inventory]] of the museum’s collection is used to ensure that all objects within the collection are accounted for and in the correct location. This section of the policy will note necessary steps to take when completing an inventory. It will also address how often the museum conducts comprehensive inventories and spot-check inventories.  Comprehensive inventories are ones that include checking the entire collection, where spot-check inventories deal with a selected amount of random objects in the collection that will need to be located and checked for inventory.  This part of the policy also notes the steps to take and whom to notify if something is missing.

==== Risk Management ====
Museum staff can hope that a disaster will never hit, but it is important for the museums have a plan in place in the event that one does. Risk management in regards to a collections management policy will note what the museum is doing in an effort to best protect objects. This includes topics dealing with fire protection, ways to prevent mold, and security. The museum should also have an emergency response plan in place as well.

As stated before, not all policies will be the same. There is no template that can be used but below are examples of policies that might be beneficial to reference when writing a policy.

The '''Danish Maritime Safety Administration''' (DaMSA) ({{lang-da|Farvandsvæsenet}}) was a department of the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]] with administration located in [[Christianshavn]], [[Copenhagen]]. DaMSA operated throughout Denmark as part of the Danish [[search and rescue|Search and Rescue]] (SAR) organization that runs 21 rescue stations located along the coasts of Denmark.

Responsibilities of DaMSA included authorizing [[navigation]] systems and [[buoy]]age, resolving issues concerning [[Shipwreck|wreck]]s and their [[Marine salvage|salvage]] in Danish waters, and running the [[Danish Pilotage Service]] (Lodsvæsenet). DaMSA was the [[Centre for Operational Oceanography (Denmark)|Centre for Operational Oceanography]], which collects hydrographical and oceanographic data from all national waters, and makes charts and maps for use by the [[Danish Defence|Military of Denmark]] and civilians. DaMSA was a full member of the [[North West Shelf Operational Oceanographic System]].

==History==
[[File:Farvandsvaesenet.20090713(007).jpg|left|thumb|200px|Farvandsvæsenet is headquartered in Søkvæsthuset.]]
On 1 April 1973 ''Farvandsdirektoratet'' was established by merging the following organizations: Danish Lighthouse Service  (Fyrvæsenet), Danish Pilotage Service  (Lodsvæsenet), Danish Rescue Service (Redningsvæsenet) and the  [[Det Kongelige danske Søkortarkiv|Royal Danish Nautical charts archive]] (Det Kongelige danske Søkortarkiv).

During the late 1970s and 1980s, the name Farvandsdirektoratet was changed to Farvandsvæsenet. Farvandsdirektoratet remained a used and accepted name.

In 1987 the Royal Danish Nautical charts archive was detached for merger with the [[National Survey and Cadastre of Denmark]]. All of these services have a long history on their own, reaching back to 1560.

On 1 April 2008 Farvandsvæsenet changed its English name from ''Royal Danish Administration of Navigation and Hydrography'' (RDANH) to ''Danish Maritime Safety Administration'' (DaMSA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iho.shom.fr/REG_HYD_COM/NSHC/28th_Meeting/NSHC28_EN_B1-1_DK_Hydrographic_National_Report_2008.pdf Hydrographic National Report of Denmark, April 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
Farvandsvaesenet occupied the buildings named Søkvæsthuset and Bakkehuset. Bakkehuset is known for housing the Danish poet [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]].[[Image:JohanLudvigHeibergOgJohanneLuiseHeibergPlaque.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Plaque on Bakkehuset]]

==Mission and tasks==
The mission of the '''Danish Maritime Safety Administration''' was to assure the safety of navigation at sea in Danish, Faroese and Greenlandic waters. DaMSA achieved this mission through execution of the following tasks: Exercise jurisdiction and issue nautical publications; Provide aids to navigation; Provide coastal rescue; Provide [[pilotage]]; Conduct [[Hydrographic survey|hydrographical survey]]s and provide oceanographic information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danish Maritime Safety Administration|url=http://www.efficiensea.org/default.asp?Action=Details&amp;Item=415|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DaMSA was a member of the [[SeaDataNet]] European Directory of Marine Organizations, providing bathymetric measurements in Danish
and Greenlandic waters. Five surveying ships are present working in Danish waters, all equipped with a shallow water multibeam system. Two surveying ships (one with multibeam) are stationed in Greenland with working area on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeaDataNet European Directory of Marine Organizations|url=http://seadatanet.maris2.nl/v_edmo/print.asp?check_n_code=465&amp;page_size=10&amp;page_count=3&amp;screen=0&amp;rs_found=41&amp;key=27|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
The Maritime Safety Administration was abolished by royal decree of 3 October 2011. Its tasks were redistributed: pilotage service and maritime buoyage were transferred to the [[Minister of Economic and Business Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs]], oceanography was transferred to the [[Ministry of Climate and Energy (Denmark)|Ministry of Climate and Energy]] and hydrographic surveying was transferred to the [[Ministry of Environment (Denmark)|Ministry of Environment]].

It is practical to express the surface evolution by dexels especially when the surface evolution scale is very different from the structural [[finite element]] 3D model discretization step (e.g. in machining the depth of cut variation is often several orders of magnitude smaller (1–10&amp;nbsp;µm) than the FE model mesh step (1&amp;nbsp;mm)).

As such, there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between the pixels in an image, and the dexels used to create that image.  For example, cameras labeled as "10-megapixel" can be used to create a 640x480 picture.  Using dexel terminology, the camera actually uses 10 million dexels to create a picture with 640x480 pixels.

A '''duplexer''' is an electronic device that allows bi-directional ([[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]) communication over a single path.  In [[radar]] and radio communications systems, it isolates the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] from the [[transmitter]] while permitting them to share a common [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]].   Most [[radio repeater]] systems include a duplexer.  Duplexers can be based on frequency (often a [[waveguide filter]]), polarization (such as an [[orthomode transducer]]), or timing (as is typical in radar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radar for Meteorologists |author= Rinehart, Ronald E. |publisher= University of North Dakota |year=1991}}  radar engineers have added the automatic
switch (also called a duplexer) in the ... As soon as the transmitter stops sending a signal, the
duplexer switches so that the receiver is now connected to the antenna.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Transmit-receive switch===
[[Image:Bsp_Duplex-eng.svg|thumb|TR duplex switching]]
In radar, a transmit/receive (TR) switch alternately connects the transmitter and receiver to a shared antenna. In the simplest arrangement, the switch consists of a [[Sutton tube#Soft Sutton tube|gas-discharge tube]] across the input terminals of the receiver. When the transmitter is active, the resulting high voltage causes the tube to conduct, shorting together the receiver terminals to protect it, while its complementary, the anti-transmit/receive (ATR) switch, is a similar discharge tube which decouples the transmitter from the antenna while not operating, to prevent it from wasting received energy.

===Circulator===
{{Main|Circulator}}

===Orthomode transducer===

===Frequency domain===
[[Image:Repeater duplexer.png|right|190px]]

In radio communications (as opposed to radar), the transmitted and received signals can occupy different frequency bands, and so may be separated by frequency-selective filters. These are effectively a higher performance version of a [[diplexer]], typically with a narrow split between the two frequencies in question (typically around 2%-5% for a commercial two-way radio system).

With a duplexer the high and low frequency signals are traveling in opposite directions at the shared [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] of the duplexer.

Modern duplexers often use nearby frequency bands, so the frequency separation between the two ports is also much less.  For example, the transition between the uplink and downlink bands in the [[GSM frequency bands]] may be about 1 percent (915&amp;nbsp;MHz to 925&amp;nbsp;MHz). Significant attenuation (isolation) is needed to prevent the transmitter's output from overloading the receiver's input, so such duplexers will employ multi-pole filters. Duplexers are commonly made for use on the 30-50 MHz ("low band"), 136-174 MHz ("high band"), 380-520 MHz ("UHF"), plus the  790–862 MHz ("800"), 896-960 MHz ("900") and 1215-1300 MHz ("1200") bands.

There are two predominant types of duplexer in use - "notch duplexers", which exhibit sharp notches at the "unwanted" frequencies and only pass through a narrow band of wanted frequencies and "bandpass duplexers", which have wide pass frequency ranges and high out of band attenuation.

On shared antenna sites, the bandpass duplexer variety is greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates interference between transmitters and receivers by removing out of band transmit emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason.

[[File:Kathrein-weiche.jpg|thumb|350px|Commercial 19" rack mount antenna filter&lt;br&gt;Isolation typical &gt;75 dB &lt;br&gt; Insertion Loss typical &lt; 1.0 dB]]

''Note 1:''  A duplexer must be designed for operation in the [[frequency]] [[band (radio)|band]] used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of handling the output [[Power (physics)|power]] of the transmitter.

''Note 2:''  A duplexer must provide adequate rejection of transmitter [[noise]] occurring at the receive frequency, and must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the transmitter and receiver.

''Note 3:''  A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to prevent receiver desensitization.

'''''Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi''''' is a [[sculpture]] created by American artist [[Richard Serra]]. Originally created in 1986 for the [[Reina Sofia Museum]], the sculpture was put into storage in 1988. In 2006, the museum admitted that they had lost the sculpture and had no idea where it was. Serra created a replicate sculpture which is currently on display in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/equal-parallel-guernica-bengasi|title=Equal-Parallel: Guernica-Bengasi |website=museoreinasofia.es |publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Reina Sofia Museum]] for the exhibition 'Referencias: Un encuentro artístico en el tiempo' (''References: An artistic encounter in time''), which took place between 26 May-15 September 1986.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4626502.stm|title= Madrid 'mislays' Serra sculpture|date=19 January 2006 |website= bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News |access-date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 January 2006 |title=El Reina Sofía ha 'perdido' una escultura de 38 toneladas que dejó en depósito hace 14 años | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/01/18/cultura/1137601181.html |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serra was paid $200,000 for the art work, which weighed 38 tonnes.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In March 1988, the sculpture was placed into storage with the company Fluiters S.A., who specialized in the storage of works of art. In November 1990, the sculpture was taken out of storage and placed back on display briefly. On 25 November 1990 the sculpture was placed back into storage with the company Macarrón S.A. According to museum documentation, the sculpture was still in the storage through the year 1992.

In October 2005, the museum director Ana Martínez de Aguilar wanted to display the sculpture and found that it could not be located.&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt; The company it had been stored with had gone into receivership in 1998 and the sculpture could not be accounted for. The [[ABC (newspaper)|Spanish newspaper ''ABC'']] speculated that the sculpture may have been sold for scrap metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tremlett|first= Giles|date=19 January 2006 |title=Museum discovers loss of 38-tonne sculpture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/19/arts.spain|work=The Guardian |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the museum made a deal with Serra to create a [[replica]] of the original. In 2009 the replica was reinstated in the museum and is currently exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2009 |title=La escultura robada de richard serra vuelve a verse desde manana en el reina sofía en una réplica gemela |url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/1025919/02/09/La-escultura-robada-de-richard-serra-vuelve-a-verse-desde-manana-en-el-reina-sofia-en-una-replica-gemela.html |work=El Economist |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date=5 December 2017|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{physical cosmology|expanded=expansion}}
The '''expansion of the universe''' is the increase of the [[proper length|distance]] between two [[observable universe#Size|distant parts of the universe]] with [[Chronology of the universe|time]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties (philosophy)|intrinsic]] expansion whereby ''the scale of space itself changes''. The  universe does not expand "into" anything and does not require space to exist "outside" it. Technically, neither space nor objects in space move. Instead it is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] governing the size and geometry of [[spacetime]] itself that changes in scale. Although light and objects within spacetime cannot travel faster than the [[speed of light]], this limitation does not restrict the metric itself. To an observer it appears that space is expanding and all but [[Local Group|the nearest galaxies]] are receding into the distance.

During the [[inflationary epoch]] about 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; of a second after the [[Big Bang]], the universe suddenly expanded, and its volume increased by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt; (an expansion of distance by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; in each of the three dimensions), equivalent to expanding an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]] or 62 trillion miles) long. A much slower and gradual expansion of space continued after this, until at around 9.8 billion years after the Big Bang (4 billion years ago) it began to gradually [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expand more quickly]], and is still doing so today.

The metric expansion of space is of a kind completely different from the [[thermal expansion|expansion]]s and [[explosion]]s seen in daily life. It also seems to be a property of the [[Mathematics of general relativity#Local versus global structure|universe as a whole]] rather than a phenomenon that applies just to one part of the universe or can be observed from "outside" it.

Metric expansion is a key feature of [[Big Bang cosmology]], is modeled mathematically with the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric]] and is a generic property of the universe we inhabit. However, the model is valid only on large scales (roughly the scale of [[galaxy cluster]]s and above), because [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] binds matter together strongly enough that metric expansion cannot be observed at this time, on a smaller scale. As such, the only galaxies receding from one another as a result of metric expansion are those separated by cosmologically relevant scales larger than the [[Jeans instability|length scales]] associated with the gravitational collapse that are possible in the [[age of the universe]] given the [[matter density]] and average expansion rate.

Physicists have postulated the existence of [[dark energy]], appearing as a [[cosmological constant]] in the simplest gravitational models as a way to explain the acceleration. According to the simplest extrapolation of the currently-favored cosmological model, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], this acceleration becomes more dominant into the future. In June 2016, [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] scientists reported that the [[universe]] was found to be expanding 5% to 9% faster than thought earlier, based on studies using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="TG-20160603"&gt;{{cite news |last=Radford |first=Tim |title=Universe is expanding up to 9% faster than we thought, say scientists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/03/universe-is-expanding-up-to-9-faster-than-we-thought-say-scientists |date=3 June 2016 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[special relativity]] prohibits objects from moving faster than light with respect to a [[local reference frame]] where spacetime can be treated as [[Minkowski space|flat and unchanging]], it does not apply to situations where [[spacetime curvature]] or evolution in time become important.  These situations are described by [[general relativity]], which allows the separation between two distant objects to increase faster than the speed of light, although the definition of "separation" is different from that used in an inertial frame.  This can be seen when observing distant galaxies more than the [[Hubble radius]] away from us (approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[gigaparsec]]s or 14.7 billion [[light-year]]s); these galaxies have a recession speed that is faster than the [[speed of light]]. Light that is emitted today from galaxies beyond the [[Cosmological horizon#Event horizon|cosmological event horizon]], about 5&amp;nbsp;gigaparsecs or 16 billion light-years, will never reach us, although we can still see the light that these galaxies emitted in the past. Because of the high rate of expansion, it is also possible for a distance between two objects to be greater than the value calculated by multiplying the speed of light by the age of the universe. These details are a frequent source of confusion among amateurs and even professional physicists.&lt;ref name="astro-ph/0310808"&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H.

== Cosmic inflation ==
{{main|inflation (cosmology)|inflaton}}

In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that light from remote galaxies was [[redshift]]ed; i.e. the more remote galaxies were, the more shifted was the light coming from them. This observation was quickly interpreted as ''galaxies  receding from earth''. If [[earth]] is not in some special, privileged, central position in the universe, then it would mean all galaxies are moving apart, and the further away, the faster they are moving away. It is now understood that the universe is expanding, carrying the galaxies with it, and causing this observation.  Many other observations agree, and also lead to the same conclusion. However, for many years it was not clear why or how the universe might be expanding, or what it might signify.

Based on a huge amount of experimental observation and theoretical work, it is now believed that the reason for the observation is that ''space itself is expanding'', and that it expanded very rapidly within the first fraction of a second after the [[Big Bang]]. This kind of expansion is known as the "metric expansion". In mathematics and physics, a "[[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]" means a measure of distance, and the term implies that ''the sense of distance within the universe is itself changing'', although at this time it is far too small an effect to see on less than an intergalactic scale.

The modern explanation for the metric expansion of space was proposed by physicist [[Alan Guth]] in 1979, while investigating the problem of why no [[magnetic monopoles]] are seen today. Guth found in his investigation that if the universe contained a [[field (physics)|field]] that has a positive-energy [[false vacuum]] state, then according to [[general relativity]] it would generate an ''exponential expansion of space''. It was very quickly realized that such an expansion would resolve many other long-standing problems. These problems arise from the observation that to look like it does today, the universe would have to have started from very [[fine tuned universe|finely tuned]], or "special" initial conditions at the Big Bang. Inflation theory largely resolves these problems as well, thus making a universe like ours much more likely in the context of [[Big Bang theory]].

No field responsible for the cosmic inflation has been discovered. However such a field, if found in the future, would be [[scalar field|scalar]]. The first similar [[scalar field]] proven to exist was [[Higgs field|only discovered]] in 2012 - 2013 and is still being researched. So it is not seen as problematic that a field responsible for cosmic inflation and the metric expansion of space has not yet been discovered.

The proposed field and its [[quantum|quanta]] (the [[subatomic particle]]s related to it) have been named ''[[inflaton]]''. If this field did not exist, scientists would have to propose a different explanation for all the observations that strongly suggest a metric expansion of space has occurred, and is still occurring much more slowly today.

==Overview of metrics and comoving coordinates==
{{Main|Metric (mathematics)|tensor}} 
To understand the metric expansion of the universe, it is helpful to discuss briefly what a metric is, and how metric expansion works.

A '''[[Metric tensor|metric]]''' defines the concept of [[distance]], by stating in mathematical terms how distances between two nearby points in space are measured, in terms of the [[coordinate system]]. Coordinate systems locate points in a space (of whatever number of [[dimension]]s) by assigning unique positions on a grid, known as [[coordinate]]s, to each point. [[GPS]], [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], and [[Cartesian coordinates|x-y graphs]] are common examples of coordinates. A metric is a [[formula]] which describes how a number known as "distance" is to be measured between two points.

It may seem obvious that distance is measured by a straight line, but in many cases it is not. For example, [[long haul]] aircraft travel along a curve known as a "[[great circle]]" and not a straight line, because that is a better metric for air travel. (A straight line would go through the earth). Another example is planning a car journey, where one might want the shortest journey in terms of travel time - in that case a straight line is a poor choice of metric because the shortest distance by road is not normally a straight line, and even the path nearest to a straight line will not necessarily be the quickest. A final example is the [[internet]], where even for nearby towns, the quickest route for data can be via major connections that go across the country and back again. In this case the metric used will be the shortest time that data takes to travel between two points on the network.

In cosmology, we cannot use a ruler to measure metric expansion, because our ruler will also be expanding (extremely slowly). Also any objects on or near earth that we might measure are being held together or pushed apart by several forces which are far larger in their effects. So even if we could measure the tiny expansion that is still happening, we would not notice the change on a small scale or in everyday life. On a large intergalactic scale, we can use other tests of distance and these ''do'' show that space is expanding, even if a ruler on earth could not measure it.

The metric expansion of space is described using the mathematics of [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] [[tensor]]s. The coordinate system we use is called "[[comoving coordinates]]", a type of coordinate system which takes account of [[spacetime|time as well as space]] and the [[speed of light]], and allows us to incorporate the effects of both [[general relativity|general]] and [[special relativity]].

===Example: "Great Circle" metric for Earth's surface===

For example, consider the measurement of distance between two places on the surface of the Earth. This is a simple, familiar example of [[spherical geometry]]. Because the surface of the Earth is two-dimensional, points on the surface of the Earth can be specified by two coordinates — for example, the latitude and longitude. Specification of a metric requires that one first specify the coordinates used. In our simple example of the surface of the Earth, we could choose any kind of coordinate system we wish, for example [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], or X-Y-Z [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. Once we have chosen a specific coordinate system, the numerical values of the coordinates of any two points are uniquely determined, and based upon the properties of the space being discussed, the appropriate metric is mathematically established too. On the curved surface of the Earth, we can see this effect in long-haul [[airline]] flights where the distance between two points is measured based upon a [[great circle]], rather than the straight line one might plot on a two-dimensional map of the Earth's surface. In general, such shortest-distance paths are called "[[geodesic]]s". In [[Euclidean geometry]], the geodesic is a straight line, while in [[non-Euclidean geometry]] such as on the Earth's surface, this is not the case. Indeed, even the shortest-distance great circle path is always longer than the Euclidean straight line path which passes through the interior of the Earth. The difference between the straight line path and the shortest-distance great circle path is due to the [[curvature]] of the Earth's surface. While there is always an effect due to this curvature, at short distances the effect is small enough to be unnoticeable.

On plane maps, great circles of the Earth are mostly not shown as straight lines. Indeed, there is a seldom-used [[map projection]], namely the [[gnomonic projection]], where all great circles are shown as straight lines, but in this projection, the distance scale varies very much in different areas. There is no map projection in which the distance between any two points on Earth, measured along the great circle geodesics, is directly proportional to their distance on the map; such accuracy is possible only with a globe.

===Metric tensors===

In [[differential geometry]], the backbone mathematics for [[general relativity]], a [[metric tensor]] can be defined which precisely characterizes the space being described by explaining the way distances should be measured in every possible direction. General relativity necessarily invokes a metric in four dimensions (one of time, three of space) because, in general, different reference frames will experience different [[spacetime interval|intervals]] of time and space depending on the [[inertial frame]]. This means that the metric tensor in general relativity relates precisely how two [[event (relativity)|event]]s in [[spacetime]] are separated. A metric expansion occurs when the metric tensor changes with [[time]] (and, specifically, whenever the spatial part of the metric gets larger as time goes forward). This kind of expansion is different from all kinds of [[Thermal expansion|expansion]]s and [[explosion]]s commonly seen in [[nature]] in no small part because times and [[distance]]s are not the same in all reference frames, but are instead subject to change. A useful visualization is to approach the subject rather than objects in a fixed "space" moving apart into "emptiness", as space itself growing between objects without any [[acceleration]] of the objects themselves. The space between objects shrinks or grows as the various [[geodesic]]s converge or diverge.

Because this expansion is caused by relative changes in the distance-defining metric, this expansion (and the resultant movement apart of objects) is not restricted by the [[speed of light]] [[upper bound]] of [[special relativity]]. Two reference frames that are globally separated can be moving apart faster than light without violating special relativity, although whenever two reference frames diverge from each other faster than the speed of light, there will be observable effects associated with such situations including the existence of various [[cosmological horizon]]s.

Theory and observations suggest that very early in the history of the universe, there was an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] phase where the metric changed very rapidly, and that the remaining time-dependence of this metric is what we observe as the so-called [[Hubble Law|Hubble expansion]], the moving apart of all gravitationally unbound objects in the universe. The expanding universe is therefore a fundamental feature of the universe we inhabit — a universe fundamentally different from the [[static universe]] [[Albert Einstein]] first considered when he developed his gravitational theory.

===Comoving coordinates===
{{Main|Comoving coordinates}}
In expanding space, [[proper distance]]s are dynamical quantities which change with time. An easy way to correct for this is to use [[comoving coordinates]] which remove this feature and allow for a characterization of different locations in the universe without having to characterize the physics associated with metric expansion. In comoving coordinates, the distances between all objects are fixed and the instantaneous [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of [[matter]] and [[light]] are determined by the normal [[physics]] of [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Any time-evolution however must be accounted for by taking into account the [[Hubble law]] expansion in the appropriate equations in addition to any other effects that may be operating ([[gravity]], [[dark energy]], or [[curvature]], for example). Cosmological simulations that run through significant fractions of the universe's history therefore must include such effects in order to make applicable predictions for [[observational cosmology]].

===Measurement of expansion and change of rate of expansion===
[[File:Redshift blueshift.svg|thumb|250px|left|When an object is receding, its light gets stretched ([[redshift]]ed). When the object is approaching, its light gets compressed ([[blueshift]]ed).]]
In principle, the expansion of the universe could be measured by taking a standard ruler and measuring the distance between two cosmologically distant points, waiting a certain time, and then measuring the distance again, but in practice, standard rulers are not easy to find on cosmological scales and the timescales over which a measurable expansion would be visible are too great to be observable even by multiple generations of humans. The expansion of space is measured indirectly. The [[theory of relativity]] predicts phenomena associated with the expansion, notably the [[redshift]]-versus-distance relationship known as [[Hubble's Law]]; functional forms for [[Distance measures (cosmology)|cosmological distance measurements]] that differ from what would be expected if space were not expanding; and an observable change in the [[Density parameter|matter and energy density]] of the universe seen at different [[lookback time]]s.

The first measurement of the expansion of space occurred with the creation of the Hubble diagram. Using [[Cosmic distance ladder|standard candles]] with known intrinsic brightness, the expansion of the universe has been measured using redshift to derive Hubble's Constant: [[Hubble's law|H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] = {{nowrap|67.15 ± 1.2 (km/s)/Mpc}}. For every million [[parsec]]s of distance from the observer, the rate of expansion increases by about 67 kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planck Mission Brings universe Into Sharp Focus|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-109&amp;rn=news.xml&amp;rst=3739|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2013-03-21|date=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA's Hubble Rules Out One Alternative to Dark Energy|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/cosmic-expansion.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-03-27|date=2011-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riess2011"&gt;{{cite journal | title = A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble Constant with the Hubble Space Telescope and Wide Field Camera 3 |journal = The Astrophysical Journal | date = 2011-04-01 | first = Adam G. | last = Riess |author2=Lucas Macri |author3=Stefano Casertano |author4=Hubert Lampeitl |author5=Henry C.

The Hubble parameter is not thought to be constant through time. There are dynamical forces acting on the particles in the universe which affect the expansion rate. It was earlier expected that the Hubble parameter would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the universe called the [[deceleration parameter]] which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the universe. Surprisingly, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be less than zero (actually, consistent with −1) which implied that today the Hubble parameter is converging to a constant value as time goes on. Some cosmologists have whimsically called the effect associated with the "accelerating universe" the "cosmic [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=A 'Cosmic Jerk' That Reversed the universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/11/us/a-cosmic-jerk-that-reversed-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|newspaper=The New York Times|date=11 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2011 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was given for the discovery of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/press.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring distances in expanding space===

([[:File:Embedded LambdaCDM geometry.png#Mathematical details|Mathematical details]])}}

At cosmological scales the present universe is geometrically flat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krauss |first1=Lawrence M. |authorlink1=Lawrence M. Krauss |title=[[A Universe from Nothing]] |year=2012 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9781451624458 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is to say that the rules of [[Euclidean geometry]] associated with [[Parallel postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate]] hold, though in the past [[spacetime]] could have been highly curved. In part to accommodate such different geometries, the expansion of the universe is inherently [[general relativity|general relativistic]]; it cannot be modeled with [[special relativity]] alone, though [[Milne universe|such models]] exist, they are at fundamental odds with the observed interaction between matter and spacetime seen in our universe.

The images to the right show two views of [[spacetime diagram]]s that show the large-scale geometry of the universe according to the [[ΛCDM]] cosmological model. Two of the dimensions of space are omitted, leaving one dimension of space (the dimension that grows as the cone gets larger) and one of time (the dimension that proceeds "up" the cone's surface). The narrow circular end of the diagram corresponds to a [[cosmological time]] of 700 million years after the big bang while the wide end is a cosmological time of 18 billion years, where one can see the beginning of the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] as a splaying outward of the spacetime, a feature which eventually dominates in this model. The purple grid lines mark off cosmological time at intervals of one billion years from the big bang. The cyan grid lines mark off [[comoving distance]] at intervals of one billion light years in the present era (less in the past and more in the future). Note that the circular curling of the surface is an artifact of the embedding with no physical significance and is done purely to make the illustration viewable; space does not actually curl around on itself. (A similar effect can be seen in the tubular shape of the [[pseudosphere]].)

The brown line on the diagram is the [[worldline]] of the Earth (or, at earlier times, of the matter which condensed to form the Earth). The yellow line is the worldline of the most distant known [[quasar]]. The red line is the path of a light beam emitted by the quasar about 13 billion years ago and reaching the Earth in the present day. The orange line shows the present-day distance between the quasar and the Earth, about 28 billion light years, which is, notably, a larger distance than the age of the universe multiplied by the speed of light: ''ct''.

According to the [[equivalence principle]] of general relativity, the rules of special relativity are ''locally'' valid in small regions of spacetime that are approximately flat. In particular, light always travels locally at the speed ''c''; in our diagram, this means, according to the convention of constructing spacetime diagrams, that light beams always make an angle of 45° with the local grid lines. It does not follow, however, that light travels a distance ''ct'' in a time ''t'', as the red worldline illustrates. While it always moves locally at ''c'', its time in transit (about 13 billion years) is not related to the distance traveled in any simple way since the universe expands as the light beam traverses space and time. In fact the distance traveled is inherently ambiguous because of the changing scale of the universe. Nevertheless, we can single out two distances which appear to be physically meaningful: the distance between the Earth and the quasar when the light was emitted, and the distance between them in the present era (taking a slice of the cone along the dimension that we've declared to be the spatial dimension). The former distance is about 4 billion light years, much smaller than ''ct'' because the universe expanded as the light traveled the distance, the light had to "run against the treadmill" and therefore went farther than the initial separation between the Earth and the quasar. The latter distance (shown by the orange line) is about 28 billion light years, much larger than ''ct''. If expansion could be instantaneously stopped today, it would take 28 billion years for light to travel between the Earth and the quasar while if the expansion had stopped at the earlier time, it would have taken only 4 billion years.

The light took much longer than 4 billion years to reach us though it was emitted from only 4 billion light years away, and, in fact, the light emitted towards the Earth was actually moving ''away'' from the Earth when it was first emitted, in the sense that the metric distance to the Earth increased with cosmological time for the first few billion years of its travel time, and also indicating that the expansion of space between the Earth and the quasar at the early time was faster than the speed of light. None of this surprising behavior originates from a special property of metric expansion, but simply from local principles of special relativity [[Integral|integrated]] over a curved surface.

===Topology of expanding space===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|left|450px|A graphical representation of the expansion of the universe with the inflationary epoch represented as the dramatic expansion of the [[metric tensor|metric]] seen on the left. This diagram can be confusing because the expansion of space looks like it is happening into an empty "nothingness". However, this is a choice made for convenience of visualization: it is not a part of the physical models which describe the expansion.]]
Over [[time]], the [[space]] that makes up the [[universe]] is expanding. The words '[[space]]' and '[[universe]]', sometimes used interchangeably, have distinct meanings in this context. Here 'space' is a mathematical concept that stands for the three-dimensional [[manifold]] into which our respective positions are embedded while 'universe' refers to everything that exists including the matter and energy in space, the extra-dimensions that may be wrapped up in [[string theory|various strings]], and the time through which various events take place. The expansion of space is in reference to this 3-D manifold only; that is, the description involves no structures such as extra dimensions or an exterior universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peebles|first=P. J. E.|title=Principles of Physical Cosmology|date=1993|page=73|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate [[topology]] of space is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a posteriori]]'' &amp;mdash; something which in principle must be observed &amp;mdash; as there are no constraints that can simply be reasoned out (in other words there can not be any ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' constraints) on how the space in which we live is [[Simply connected space|connected]] or whether it wraps around on itself as a [[compact space]]. Though certain cosmological models such as [[Gödel metric|Gödel's universe]] even permit bizarre [[worldline]]s which intersect with themselves, ultimately the question as to whether we are in something like a "[[Pac-Man]] universe" where if traveling far enough in one direction would allow one to simply end up back in the same place like going all the way around the surface of a balloon (or a planet like the Earth) is [[Shape of the universe#Detection|an observational question which is constrained as measurable or non-measurable by the universe's global geometry]]. At present, observations are consistent with the universe being infinite in extent and simply connected, though we are limited in distinguishing between simple and more complicated proposals by [[cosmological horizon]]s. The universe could be infinite in extent or it could be finite; but the evidence that leads to the [[cosmic inflation|inflationary model]] of the early universe also implies that the "total universe" is much larger than the [[observable universe]], and so any edges or exotic geometries or topologies would not be directly observable as light has not reached scales on which such aspects of the universe, if they exist, are still allowed. For all intents and purposes, it is safe to assume that the universe is infinite in spatial extent, without edge or strange connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is the universe expanding into? |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/104-the-universe/cosmology-and-the-big-bang/expansion-of-the-universe/623-what-is-the-universe-expanding-into-intermediate |author=Rothstein, Dave |publisher=Ask an Astronomer |date=23 April 2003 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the overall shape of the universe, the question of what the universe is expanding into is one which does not require an answer according to the theories which describe the expansion; the way we define space in our universe in no way requires additional exterior space into which it can expand since an expansion of an infinite expanse can happen without changing the infinite extent of the expanse. All that is certain is that the manifold of space in which we live simply has the property that the distances between objects are getting larger as time goes on. This only implies the simple observational consequences associated with the metric expansion explored below. No "outside" or embedding in hyperspace is required for an expansion to occur. The visualizations often seen of the universe growing as a bubble into nothingness are misleading in that respect. There is no reason to believe there is anything "outside" of the expanding universe into which the universe expands.

Even if the overall spatial extent is infinite and thus the universe cannot get any "larger", we still say that space is expanding because, locally, the characteristic distance between objects is increasing. As an infinite space grows, it remains infinite.

===Density of universe during expansion===
Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] when very young and during part of its early expansion - far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]] - the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This is because commonly-used calculations for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.

===Effects of expansion on small scales===
The expansion of space is sometimes described as a force which acts to push objects apart. Though this is an accurate description of the effect of the [[cosmological constant]], it is not an accurate picture of the phenomenon of expansion in general. For much of the universe's history the expansion has been due mainly to [[inertia]]. The matter in the very early universe was flying apart for unknown reasons (most likely as a result of [[cosmic inflation]]) and has simply continued to do so, though at an ever-decreasing{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} rate due to the attractive effect of gravity.
[[File:Raisinbread.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animation of an expanding raisin bread model. As the bread doubles in width (depth and length), the distances between raisins also double.]]
In addition to slowing the overall expansion, gravity causes local clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. Once objects are formed and bound by gravity, they "drop out" of the expansion and do not subsequently expand under the influence of the cosmological metric, there being no force compelling them to do so.

There is no difference between the inertial expansion of the universe and the inertial separation of nearby objects in a vacuum; the former is simply a large-scale extrapolation of the latter.

Once objects are bound by gravity, they no longer recede from each other. Thus, the Andromeda galaxy, which is bound to the Milky Way galaxy, is actually falling ''towards'' us and is not expanding away. Within the [[Local Group]], the gravitational interactions have changed the inertial patterns of objects such that there is no cosmological expansion taking place. Once one goes beyond the Local Group, the inertial expansion is measurable, though systematic gravitational effects imply that larger and larger parts of space will eventually fall out of the "[[Hubble Flow]]" and end up as bound, non-expanding objects up to the scales of [[supercluster]]s of galaxies. We can predict such future events by knowing the precise way the Hubble Flow is changing as well as the masses of the objects to which we are being gravitationally pulled. Currently, the Local Group is being gravitationally pulled towards either the [[Shapley Supercluster]] or the "[[Great Attractor]]" with which, if dark energy were not acting, we would eventually merge and no longer see expand away from us after such a time.

A consequence of metric expansion being due to inertial motion is that a uniform local "explosion" of matter into a vacuum can be locally described by the [[FLRW metric|FLRW geometry]], the same geometry which describes the expansion of the universe as a whole and was also the basis for the simpler [[Milne universe]] which ignores the effects of gravity. In particular, general relativity predicts that light will move at the speed ''c'' with respect to the local motion of the exploding matter, a phenomenon analogous to [[frame dragging]].

The situation changes somewhat with the introduction of dark energy or a cosmological constant. A cosmological constant due to a [[vacuum energy]] density has the effect of adding a repulsive force between objects which is proportional (not inversely proportional) to distance. Unlike inertia it actively "pulls" on objects which have clumped together under the influence of gravity, and even on individual atoms. However, this does not cause the objects to grow steadily or to disintegrate; unless they are very weakly bound, they will simply settle into an equilibrium state which is slightly (undetectably) larger than it would otherwise have been. As the universe expands and the matter in it thins, the gravitational attraction decreases (since it is proportional to the density), while the cosmological repulsion increases; thus the ultimate fate of the ΛCDM universe is a near vacuum expanding at an ever-increasing rate under the influence of the cosmological constant. However, the only locally visible effect of the [[Accelerating universe|accelerating expansion]] is the disappearance (by runaway [[redshift]]) of distant galaxies; gravitationally bound objects like the Milky Way do not expand and the Andromeda galaxy is moving fast enough towards us that it will still merge with the Milky Way in 3 billion years time, and it is also likely that the merged supergalaxy that forms will eventually fall in and merge with the nearby [[Virgo Cluster]]. However, galaxies lying farther away from this will recede away at ever-increasing speed and be redshifted out of our range of visibility.

===Metric expansion and speed of light===
At the end of the [[early universe|early universe's]] [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflationary period]], all the matter and energy in the universe was set on an [[inertia|inertial trajectory]] consistent with the [[equivalence principle]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[general theory of relativity]] and this is when the [[Hubble's law|precise and regular form of the universe's expansion]] had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the [[inflaton field]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2015|reason= this seems original research, the causes for inflation are still debated, the same for possible pre-inflation non -homogeneity of the universe}}.

While [[special relativity]] prohibits objects from moving faster than light with respect to a [[local reference frame]] where spacetime can be treated as [[Minkowski space|flat and unchanging]], it does not apply to situations where [[spacetime curvature]] or evolution in time become important.  These situations are described by [[general relativity]], which allows the separation between two distant objects to increase faster than the speed of light, although the definition of "distance" here is somewhat different from that used in an inertial frame.  The definition of distance used here is the summation or integration of local [[comoving distance]]s, all done at constant local proper time.  For example, galaxies that are more than the [[Hubble radius]], approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;[[gigaparsec]]s or 14.7 billion [[light-year]]s, away from us have a recession speed that is faster than the [[speed of light]].  Visibility of these objects depends on the exact expansion history of the universe.  Light that is emitted today from galaxies beyond the [[Cosmological horizon#Event horizon|cosmological event horizon]], about 5&amp;nbsp;gigaparsecs or 16 billion light-years, will never reach us, although we can still see the light that these galaxies emitted in the past.

Because of the high rate of expansion, it is also possible for a distance between two objects to be greater than the value calculated by multiplying the speed of light by the age of the universe. These details are a frequent source of confusion among amateurs and even professional physicists.&lt;ref name="astro-ph/0310808"/&gt; Due to the non-intuitive nature of the subject and what has been described by some as "careless" choices of wording, certain descriptions of the metric expansion of space and the misconceptions to which such descriptions can lead are an ongoing subject of discussion in the realm of pedagogy and communication of scientific concepts.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baryshev"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peacock/&gt; In June 2016, [[NASA]] and [[ESA]] scientists reported that the [[universe]] was found to be expanding 5% to 9% faster than thought earlier, based on studies using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="TG-20160603"/&gt;

===Scale factor===
At a fundamental level, the expansion of the universe is a property of spatial measurement on the largest measurable scales of our universe. The distances between cosmologically relevant points increases as time passes leading to observable effects outlined below. This feature of the universe can be characterized by a single parameter that is called the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time and a single value for all of space at any instant (if the scale factor were a function of space, this would violate the [[cosmological principle]]). By convention, the scale factor is set to be unity at the present time and, because the universe is expanding, is smaller in the past and larger in the future. Extrapolating back in time with certain cosmological models will yield a moment when the scale factor was zero; our current understanding of cosmology sets [[Age of the universe|this time at 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years ago]]. If the universe continues to expand forever, the scale factor will approach infinity in the future. In principle, there is no reason that the expansion of the universe must be [[monotonic function|monotonic]] and there are models where at some time in the future the scale factor decreases with an attendant contraction of space rather than an expansion.

===Other conceptual models of expansion===
The expansion of space is often illustrated with conceptual models which show only the size of space at a particular time, leaving the dimension of time implicit.

In the "[[ant on a rubber rope]] model" one imagines an ant (idealized as pointlike) crawling at a constant speed on a perfectly elastic rope which is constantly stretching. If we stretch the rope in accordance with the ΛCDM scale factor and think of the ant's speed as the speed of light, then this analogy is numerically accurate — the ant's position over time will match the path of the red line on the embedding diagram above.

In the "rubber sheet model" one replaces the rope with a flat two-dimensional rubber sheet which expands uniformly in all directions. The addition of a second spatial dimension raises the possibility of showing local perturbations of the spatial geometry by local curvature in the sheet.

In the "balloon model" the flat sheet is replaced by a spherical balloon which is inflated from an initial size of zero (representing the big bang). A balloon has positive Gaussian curvature while observations suggest that the real universe is spatially flat, but this inconsistency can be eliminated by making the balloon very large so that it is locally flat to within the limits of observation. This analogy is potentially confusing since it wrongly suggests that the big bang took place at the center of the balloon. In fact points off the surface of the balloon have no meaning, even if they were occupied by the balloon at an earlier time.

In the "raisin bread model" one imagines a loaf of raisin bread expanding in the oven. The loaf (space) expands as a whole, but the raisins (gravitationally bound objects) do not expand; they merely grow farther away from each other.

==Theoretical basis and first evidence==
[[File:Evolution of the universe.svg|thumb|300px|right|The expansion of the universe proceeds in all directions as determined by the [[Hubble constant]]. However, the Hubble constant can change in the past and in the future, dependent on the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated, and so Ω on this graph corresponds to the ratio of the matter density to the [[Density parameter|critical density]] (&lt;math&gt;\Omega_m&lt;/math&gt;).]]

===Hubble's law===
Technically, the metric expansion of space is a feature of many solutions{{which|date=March 2016}} to the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], and distance is measured using the [[Lorentz interval]]. This explains observations which indicate that [[galaxy|galaxies]] that are more distant from us are [[recessional velocity|receding]] faster than galaxies that are closer to us (see [[Hubble's law]]).

===Cosmological constant and the Friedmann equations===
The first general relativistic models predicted that a universe which was dynamical and contained ordinary gravitational matter would contract rather than expand. Einstein's first proposal for a solution to this problem involved adding a [[cosmological constant]] into his theories to balance out the contraction, in order to obtain a static universe solution. But in 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] derived a set of equations known as the [[Friedmann equations]], showing that the universe might expand and presenting the expansion speed in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, A: Über die Krümmung des Raumes, Z. Phys. 10 (1922), 377–386. (English translation in: Gen. Rel. Grav. 31 (1999), 1991–2000.)&lt;/ref&gt; The observations of [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 suggested that distant galaxies were all apparently moving away from us, so that many scientists came to accept that the universe was expanding.

===Hubble's concerns over the rate of expansion===
While the metric expansion of space appeared to be implied by Hubble's 1929 observations, Hubble disagreed with the expanding-universe interpretation of the data:

{{Quotation|[...] if redshift are not primarily due to velocity shift [...] the velocity-distance relation is linear, the distribution of the nebula is uniform, there is no evidence of expansion, no trace of curvature, no restriction of the time scale [...] and we find ourselves in the presence of one of the principles of nature that is still unknown to us today [...] whereas, if redshifts are velocity shifts which measure the rate of expansion, the expanding models are definitely inconsistent with the observations that have been made [...] expanding models are a forced interpretation of the observational results.|E. Hubble|''[[Ap. J.]]'', 84, 517, 1936 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Effects of Red Shifts on the Distribution of Nebulae |author=Hubble, Edwin |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1936 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=84 |page=517 |doi=10.1086/143782 |bibcode=1936ApJ....84..517H|pmc=1076828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quotation|[If the redshifts are a Doppler shift ...] the observations as they stand lead to the anomaly of a closed universe, curiously small and dense, and, it may be added, suspiciously young. On the other hand, if redshifts are not Doppler effects, these anomalies disappear and the region observed appears as a small, homogeneous, but insignificant portion of a universe extended indefinitely both in space and time.|E. Hubble|''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'', 97, 506, 1937 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Red-shifts and the distribution of nebulæ |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1937MNRAS..97..506H&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=427d1954a200670 |author=Hubble, Edwin |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1937 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=97 |page=506 |doi=10.1093/mnras/97.7.506 |bibcode=1937MNRAS..97..506H}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubble's skepticism about the universe being too small, dense, and young turned out to be based on an observational error. Later investigations appeared to show that Hubble had confused distant [[H II region]]s for [[Cepheid variable]]s and the Cepheid variables themselves had been inappropriately lumped together with low-luminosity [[RR Lyrae]] stars causing calibration errors that led to a value of the [[Hubble Constant]] of approximately 500 [[kilometer|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] instead of the true value of approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc. The higher value meant that an expanding universe would have an age of 2 billion years (younger than the [[Age of the Earth]]) and extrapolating the observed number density of galaxies to a rapidly expanding universe implied a mass density that was too high by a similar factor, enough to force the universe into a peculiar [[shape of the universe|closed]] geometry which also implied an impending [[Big Crunch]] that would occur on a similar time-scale. After fixing these errors in the 1950s, the new lower values for the Hubble Constant accorded with the expectations of an older universe and the density parameter was found to be fairly close to a geometrically flat universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A Brief History of Our View of the Universe |jstor=10.1086/316324 |author=Gingerich, Owen |authorlink=Owen Gingerich |publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] |journal=[[Publ.

However, recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies revealed a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant, implying a universe that seems expanding too fast compared to previous measurements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html|title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast?|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|date=2017-02-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Dr. Wendy Freedman determined space to expand at 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec - roughly 3.3 million light years - meaning that for every 3.3 million light years further away from the earth you are, the matter where you are is moving away from earth 72 kilometers a second faster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the summer of 2016, another measurement reported a value of 73 for the constant, thereby contradicting 2013 measurements from the European Planck mission of slower expansion value of 67. The discrepancy opened new questions concerning the nature of dark energy, or of neutrinos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Inflation as an explanation for the expansion===
Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case, but with the development of models of [[cosmic inflation]], the expansion of the universe became a general feature resulting from [[vacuum decay]].  Accordingly, the question "why is the universe expanding?" is now answered by understanding the details of the inflation decay process which occurred in the first [[inflationary epoch|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds]] of the existence of our universe.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Alan Guth]]; ''THE INFLATIONARY UNIVERSE'', [11.19.02] by [[Edge.org]]. [http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-inflationary-universe-alan-guth]&lt;/ref&gt; During inflation, the metric changed [[exponential growth|exponentially]], causing any volume of space that was smaller than an [[atom]] to grow to around 100 million [[light year]]s across in a time scale similar to the time when inflation occurred (10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds).

===Measuring distance in a metric space===
[[File:Space Expansion (no center).png|thumb|right|200px|The diagram depicts the expansion of the universe and the relative observer phenomenon. The blue galaxies have expanded further apart than the white galaxies. When choosing an arbitrary reference point such as the gold galaxy or the red galaxy, the increased distance to other galaxies the further away they are appear the same. This phenomenon of expansion indicates two factors: there is no centralized point in the universe, and that the Milky Way Galaxy is not the center of the universe. The appearance of centrality is due to an observer bias that is equivalent no matter what location an observer sits.]]
{{Main|Comoving coordinates}}
In expanding space, distance is a dynamic quantity which changes with time. There are several different ways of defining distance in cosmology, known as ''distance measures'', but a common method used amongst modern astronomers is '''comoving distance'''. &lt;!--possible usage debate here--&gt;

The metric only defines the distance between nearby (so-called "local") points. In order to define the distance between arbitrarily distant points, one must specify both the points and a specific curve (known as a "[[spacetime interval]]") connecting them. The distance between the points can then be found by finding the length of this connecting curve through the three dimensions of space. Comoving distance defines this connecting curve to be a curve of constant [[cosmological time]]. Operationally, comoving distances cannot be directly measured by a single Earth-bound observer. To determine the distance of distant objects, astronomers generally measure luminosity of [[standard candles]], or the redshift factor 'z' of distant galaxies, and then convert these measurements into distances based on some particular model of spacetime, such as the [[Lambda-CDM model]]. It is, indeed, by making such observations that it was determined that there is no evidence for any 'slowing down' of the expansion in the current epoch.

==Observational evidence==
Theoretical cosmologists developing [[models of the universe]] have drawn upon a small number of reasonable assumptions in their work. These workings have led to models in which the metric expansion of space is a likely feature of the universe. Chief among the underlying principles that result in models including metric expansion as a feature are:

* the [[Cosmological Principle]] which demands that the universe looks the same way in all directions ([[isotropic]]) and has roughly the same smooth mixture of material ([[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]]).
* the [[Copernican Principle]] which demands that no place in the universe is preferred (that is, the universe has no "starting point").

Scientists have tested carefully whether these assumptions are valid and borne out by observation. [[Observational cosmology|Observational cosmologists]] have discovered evidence — very strong in some cases — that supports these assumptions, and as a result, metric expansion of space is considered by cosmologists to be an observed feature on the basis that although we cannot see it directly, scientists have tested the properties of the universe and observation provides compelling confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=Charles L.|authorlink=Charles L. Bennett|title=Cosmology from start to finish|journal=Nature|date=27 April 2006|volume=440|issue=7088|pages=1126–1131|doi=10.1038/nature04803|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7088/abs/nature04803.html|bibcode = 2006Natur.440.1126B|pmid=16641983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of this confidence and confirmation include:

* Hubble demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from us, as predicted by a universal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hubble, Edwin, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1929PNAS...15..168H&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30954 A Relation between Distance and Radial Velocity among Extra-Galactic Nebulae]" (1929) ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', Volume 15, Issue 3, pp. 168-173 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/15/3/168 Full article], PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Using the [[redshift]] of their [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic spectra]] to determine the distance and speed of remote objects in space, he showed that all objects are moving away from us, and that their speed is proportional to their distance, a feature of metric expansion. Further studies have since shown the expansion to be highly [[isotropic]] and [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]], that is, it does not seem to have a special point as a "center", but appears universal and independent of any fixed central point.
* In studies of [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]] taken from [[redshift survey]]s a so-called "[[End of Greatness]]" was discovered at the largest scales of the universe. Until these scales were surveyed, the universe appeared "lumpy" with clumps of [[galaxy cluster]]s, [[supercluster]]s and [[galaxy filament|filaments]] which were anything but isotropic and homogeneous. This lumpiness disappears into a smooth distribution of galaxies at the largest scales.
* The isotropic distribution across the sky of distant [[gamma-ray burst]]s and [[supernova]]e is another confirmation of the Cosmological Principle.
* The Copernican Principle was not truly tested on a cosmological scale until measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems were made. A group of astronomers at the [[European Southern Observatory]] noticed, by measuring the temperature of a distant intergalactic cloud in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background, that the radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times.&lt;ref&gt;Astronomers reported their measurement in a paper published in the December 2000 issue of [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] titled ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?astro-ph/0012222 The microwave background temperature at the redshift of 2.33771]'' which can be read here [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012222]. A [https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0043/ press release] from the European Southern Observatory explains the findings to the public.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniform cooling of the cosmic microwave background over billions of years is strong and direct observational evidence for metric expansion.

Taken together, these phenomena overwhelmingly support models that rely on space expanding through a change in metric. It was not until the discovery in the year 2000 of direct observational evidence for the changing temperature of the cosmic microwave background that more bizarre constructions could be ruled out. Until that time, it was based purely on an assumption that the universe did not behave as one with the [[Milky Way]] sitting at the middle of a fixed-metric with a universal explosion of galaxies in all directions (as seen in, for example, an [[Milne Model|early model proposed by Milne]]). Yet before this evidence, many rejected the Milne viewpoint based on the [[mediocrity principle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12262">'''Eye music''' (often referred to in English by its exact German translation ''Augenmusik'') describes graphical features of [[Sheet music|score]]s that when performed are unnoticeable by the listener.

==Difficulties in defining eye music==
A clear definition of eye music is elusive, for the border between eye music, [[word painting]], and representations of melody and form depends on the relationships of composer, performer, and listener.&lt;ref name="dart"&gt;Dart, Thurston. "Eye music." New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie, ed. London:Macmillan, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye music and puzzle-solving===
The difficulty in definition is also apparent with border-line cryptographic [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] works such as [[Canon (music)#Puzzle canon|puzzle canons]], which appear in the score entirely as a bare line of notes with [[clefs]], [[Rest (music)|rests]], [[time signature]]s, or [[key signatures]] as clues to reveal multiple lines of music in canon. (Closer to true cryptographic works would be those with [[soggetto cavato]], where letters are embedded in the work using their [[solfège]] names.)&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; As an example, a puzzle canon might be notated as one line of music with two key signatures and clefs, where the worked-out result will be a two-voice canon with one voice the [[Canon (music)#Retrograde|retrograde]] (reverse) of the other. In itself the score with the clues alone is not eye music. But represent the same work "graphically spelled out," however, say with a drawing of the clued score facing a mirror, and the score/drawing becomes eye music.&lt;ref&gt;For many such figures of music graphically portrayed in mirrors, helixes, etc. ''see'' Hofstadter, Douglas R. Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid (New York: Basic Books [1979] 1999. {{ISBN|0-394-75682-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''type'' of puzzle canon is also a factor. A four-voiced circular canon, when notated as a puzzle canon, may remain an un-worked-out single line of notes, and be inadmissible as eye music. When that single line of notes is inscribed in a graphical shape it becomes eye music, even if the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] puzzle remains unsolved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt;

An even finer use of graphical conceit is when the canon does not have any musical way to end, and are in a sense "infinite"—classically referred to as ''canon perpetuus,'' more commonly as "circular canons," and even more commonly as "[[round (music)|rounds]]." When an infinite (circular) canon is inscribed in a circle, and the ''circle itself'' is a  clue that means "play me as a round," a different type of eye music entails.

===Eye music for the performer===
Another class of eye music is when the score is purposely made difficult for the performer.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; For example, in [[Benedetto Marcello]]'s cantata ''Stravaganze d’amore,'' the [[Figured bass|continuo]] part is written entirely in [[enharmonic]] chords, that is, "puns" of chord indications spelled with no regard to the key of the rest of the ensemble, but (in [[equal temperament]]) indistinguishable audibly from those spelled in the appropriate way. Here, the perverse spelling (whether humorous or annoying to the trained continuo player) is not unusual graphically, but represents a score writing unmotivated except as an inside joke between composer and performer, and is unhearable by the listener.

The ''Gulliver Suite'' by [[Telemann]] discussed below, shows a combination of three eye music features. The score is made difficult "unnecessarily," is eye-catching for its graphics, and has a clever external reference, all unnoticeable to the listener.

==The Renaissance==
[[Image:Cordier circular canon.gif|170 px|thumb|right|[[Baude Cordier]]'s ''Tout par compas suy composés.'']] 
[[Image:CordierColor.jpg|thumb|left|Cordier's ''Belle, bonne, sage'' with a red notation heart of notes within the larger heart.]]Two examples of eye music from the early Renaissance are from [[Baude Cordier]], (ca. 1380-ca.1440). Cordier's chanson about love ''Belle, bonne, sage'' is in a heart shape, with red notes ([[Ars subtilior#Notational characteristics|coloration]]) indicating rhythmic alterations. Eye-music-within-eye music is in the small group of notes hanging like a locket in the upper left, also all in red and in the shape of a heart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icking-music-archive.org/ByComposer/Cordier.php A modern transcription and music media file of "''Belle, bonne, sage.''"]&lt;/ref&gt; Another work of Cordier, this time inscribed in circles, ''Tout par compas suy composés'' ("With a compass was I composed"), goes out of its way to identify itself as eye music.&lt;ref&gt;Bergsagel, John. "Cordier's Circular Canon." ''The Musical Times,'' 113:1558 (Dec., 1972), pp. 1175-1177.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josquin des Prez]], the most important composer of the next generation, used [[Mensural notation#Note values|black note notation]] eye music in his well-known ''Nymphes des bois,'' a lament over the death of the composer [[Ockeghem]], as well as another lament, this time for the composer [[Jacob Obrecht]], ''Absolve, quaesumus, Domine.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Elders, Willem. "Zeichen und Symbol in der altniederländischen Totenklage." In Zeichen und Struktur in der Musik der Renaissance: Ein Symposium aus Anlaß der Jahrestagung der Gesellschaft für Musikforschung Münster. Westfalen (1987) pp. 27-46.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It can be seen that words of death and lament are associated with black notes, a [[mannerism]] made even simpler to achieve in light of the contemporaneous simplification to [[Mensural notation#Note values|white note]] notation. This feature of eye music would extend through the [[Humanism|Humanist]] period.

[[Image:Dosi_allegory_canon.png|thumb|left|A detail from [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music'' with an anonymous [[canon (music)|canon]] notated in a circle and a canon by [[Josquin]] notated in a triangle. (The notes of the triangular canon can be seen on the original painting under raking light.)]] Another instance of eye music in the Renaissance is apparently unique—the representation of a triangle for a canonic piece, which appears in juxtaposition with an anonymous canon written in a circle—in [[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Allegory of Music.''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Slim, H. Colin. "Dosso Dossi's Allegory at Florence about Music." ''Journal of the American Musicological Society.'' 43:No. 1 (April 1990), pp. 43–98.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the two types of representation—the circle and the inherent symbolism of the tenets of Christianity in the triangle—are both suggestive of a sense of the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;A transcription of the canon written as a circle is in Slim, pp. 53-55. The triangle canon is transcribed on p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The work represented in the triangle, is part of a "rough" version of a puzzle canon in Josquin's Agnus Dei II from his ''[[Missa L'homme armé super voces musicales]]'' canonic mass. It has the superscript "trinitas in un[um]" ("three in one") as a clue to its solution, is a [[Canon (music)#Mensuration and tempo canons|mensuration canon]] of 3:1, and has one voice take part at the interval of a fifth, that is, 3:2. Its relation to the Christian [[Holy Trinity]] is clear, suggesting the use of a triangular representation. The representation is unique, although possibly from a copy used by Dossi.&lt;ref&gt;On the implication of "transcendance" expressed by the theoretically infinite repetition in many canons, ''see'' Chafe, Eric. " Allegorical Music: The "Symbolism" of Tonal Language in the Bach Canons." ''The Journal of Musicology'' 3:4 (Autumn, 1984), pp. 340-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanism==
[[Image:John bull sphera mundi.gif|thumb|[[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]]'s 6-part circular canon ''Sphera mundi.'' (From an 18th-century MS.)]]With the significant shift of style of composers of the [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] movement—the rediscovery and translation of Greek texts in the mid-16th century—eye music flourished. The change in musical practice, particularly with the [[madrigal (music)|madrigalists]] and their focus on text declamation, at a word-by-word basis, was fertile ground for eye music. Words that suggest "blackness," such as "death" or "night," receive "black" notes (e.g. [[quarter note]]s, [[eighth note]]s); "white words" such as "light" or "pale" receive "white" notes (e.g. [[whole note]]s, [[half note]]s).&lt;ref name="einstein1"&gt;Einstein, Alfred. "Augenmusik im Madrigal." ''Zeitschrift für internationazional Musikgesellschaft,'' XIX (1912–13), pp. 8–21; partly trans. in The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Italian madrigalists from the 1580s until the early 17th century (whose style was almost literally imported to England), eye music reached its apogee until its transformation in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="einstein2"&gt;''See'' Einstein, Alfred. The Italian Madrigal, transl. Krappe, [[Roger Sessions|Sessions]], and [[Oliver Strunk|Strunk]]. 3 Vol. Princeton:Princeton University Press, (1949) 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luca Marenzio]] is considered the composer most fond of eye music.&lt;ref name="einstein2"/&gt; For example, in the madrigal ''Senza il mia sole'' from his ''Madrigali a quattro, cinque e sei voci'' (1588), black notes are used for "chiuser le luci" ("close their eyes")&lt;ref&gt;Steele, John. "Lamenting Marenzio." ''The Musical Times,'' 120:1636 (June, 1979), pp. 497 and 499.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Marenzio's standing among madrigalists and his use of eye music, ''see'' Lang, Paul Henry. "Editorial." ''The Musical Quarterly '' 35:3 (July 1949), pp. 437-447.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaction by theorists of the time was mixed. A leading musical humanist, [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (the father of the physicist), was opposed to it but [[Zarlino]] approved.&lt;ref name="dart"/&gt; In the 20th century, [[Alfred Einstein]], a groundbreaking scholar of the Humanist madrigal, wrote that eye music is "the most extreme and (for our aesthetic convictions) most horrible testimony of naturalism, of ''imitazione,'' in the madrigal."&lt;ref&gt;''Das übertriebenste und (für unser ästhetisches Empfinden) grausamste Zeugnis des Naturalismus, der imitazione, im Madrigal.'' Einstein,'' Op. cit.'', p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque==
[[Image:Telemann Gulliver Suite.jpg|thumb|right|The notes for scampering Lilliputians and ponderous Brobdingnag in [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite.'' {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Lilliputian.mid|Play Chaconne}} and {{audio|Telemann Gulliver Suite Brobigdinian.mid|Play gigue}}]]

In [[Telemann]]'s ''Gulliver Suite'' for two violins the note values in the [[chaconne]] are "[[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputian]]",  and, in the [[gigue]], are [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|"Brobdingnagian"]] ones. Because the Lilliputian movement is written in the bizarre [[time signature]] of {{music|time|3|32}}, and the Brobdingnagian one in the equally obtuse {{music|time|24|1}} (which is doubly humorous because gigues are generally light and brisk), the time signatures reduce to {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|12|8}}, perfectly normal ones for each movement, as are the tempos associated with them and the type of dance of each.

==20th century==
Post-tonal music has seen an expansion of eye music in line with its expansion and experimentalism of musical techniques. The last examples using a rigorous scoring system rooted in standard practice are the finely turned circles and spirals (as well as a peace symbol and a crucifix) in the works of [[George Crumb]].

===Graphic notation===
The beauties of many examples of [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]] are not, in fact, a feature of eye music. As novel and attractive as the graphics may be in these scores, they function entirely as performance indications or true records of compositional method (such as the Steiner score shown here). Also often seen are graphical or [[conceptual art]] works that use the symbols of music notation but are not performing scores at all, such as  [[Erwin Schulhoff]]'s 1919 ''In futurum (Zeitmaß-zeitlos).''{{cn|date=August 2012}}

The '''[[Friedrich Miescher]] Laboratory''' (FML) of the [[Max Planck Society]] is a biological research institute located on the Society's campus in [[Tübingen]], Germany. It was founded in 1969 to offer highly qualified junior scientists in the area of biology an opportunity to establish independent research groups and pursue their own line of research within a five-year period (extensions possible). The group leaders are elected by a committee of scientists from diverse areas and institutions on the basis of a public tendering procedure. While at the FML, they can use modern, well-equipped laboratories and work in teams tailored to their ideas. The laboratory is not headed by a director. Instead, the group leaders take turns in representing the FML, and its administrative and organizational interests. Furthermore, all group leaders jointly manage the funds available to the laboratory.

There is no specification as to which kind of biological research should be conducted at the FML, and the focus of research changes with the appointment of each new group leader. In the past, research interests have included developmental biology, neurobiology, cell biology, psychology and many other areas of modern biology.

'''Genlock''' ('''generator locking''') is a common technique where the video output of one source, or a specific reference signal from a [[signal generator]], is used to synchronize other picture sources together. The aim in video applications is to ensure the coincidence of signals in time at a combining or switching point. When video instruments are synchronized in this way, they are said to be ''generator-locked'', or ''genlocked''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mivs.com/documents/appnotes/an005.html |publisher=MicroImage Video Systems |title=An Overview of Genlock |accessdate=2014-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403120241/http://www.mivs.com/documents/appnotes/an005.html |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_10793.html |publisher=NVIDIA |title=Genlock |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_genlock.html |publisher=ATIS Committee |title=genlock |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227035958/http://www.atis.org/tg2k/_genlock.html |archivedate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=John H.|date=March–April 1950|title=The Genlock for Improved TV Programming|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RCA-Broadcast-News/RCA-58.pdf|journal=RCA Broadcast News|volume=Number 58|pages= 11–12|via=americanradiohistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible problems==
===Phase differences===
Video signals generated and output by generator-locked instruments are said to be [[wikt:syntonize|syntonized]]. Syntonized video signals will be precisely frequency-locked, but because of delays caused by the unequal transmission path lengths, the synchronized signals will exhibit differing phases at various points in the television system. Modern video equipment such as production switchers that have multiple video inputs often include a variable delay on each input to compensate for the phase differences and time all the input signals to precise phase coincidence.

===Jumping===
Where two or more video signals are combined or being switched between, the horizontal and vertical timing of the picture sources should be coincident with each other. If they are not, the picture will appear to jump when switching between the sources whilst the display device re-adjusts the horizontal and/or vertical [[Raster scan|scan]] to correctly reframe the image.

===Color changes===
Where composite video is in use, the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the [[chrominance]] [[subcarrier]] of each source being combined or switched should also be coincident.  This is to avoid changes in colour hue and/or saturation during a [[Film transition|transition]] between sources.

==Scope==
Generator locking can be used to synchronize as few as two isolated sources (e.g., a [[television camera]] and a [[videotape]] machine feeding a [[vision mixer]] (production switcher)), or in a wider facility where all the video sources are locked to a single synchronizing pulse generator (e.g., a fast-paced sporting event featuring multiple cameras and recording devices). Generator locking can also be used to ensure that multiple CRT monitors that appear in a movie are flicker-free. Generator locking is also used to synchronize two cameras for [[Stereoscopy|Stereoscopic 3D]] video recording.

===Broadcast systems===
In broadcast systems, an analog generator-lock signal usually consists of vertical and horizontal synchronizing pulses together with chrominance phase reference in the form of [[colorburst]]. No picture information is usually carried to avoid disturbing the timing signals, and the name ''reference'', ''[[black and burst]]'', ''color black'', or ''black burst'' is usually given to such a signal. A composite colour video signal inherently carries the same reference signals and can be used as a generator-locking signal, albeit at the risk of being disturbed by out-of-specification picture signals.

===High-definition===
Although some high-definition broadcast systems may use a standard-definition reference signal as a generator-locking reference signal, the use of tri-level synchronising pulses directly related to the frame and line rate is increasing within HD systems. A [[tri-level sync]] pulse is a signal that initially goes from 0 volts DC to a negative voltage, then a positive voltage, before returning to zero volts DC again. The voltage excursions are typically 300&amp;nbsp;mV either side of zero volts, and the duration each of the two excursions is the same as a particular number of digital picture samples.

==Connections==
Most [[television studio]] and [[professional video camera]]s have dedicated generator-locking ports on the camera. If the camera is tethered with a [[triaxial cable]] or optical fibre cable, the analog generator-locking signal is used to lock the camera control unit, which in turn locks the camera head by means of information carried within a data channel transmitted along the cable. If the camera is an [[Electronic News Gathering|ENG]]-type camera, one without a triax/fibre connection or without a dockable head, the generator-locking signal is carried through a separate cable from the video.

==Natlock and Icelock==
''Natlock'' is a picture-source synchronizing system using audio tone signals to describe the timing discrepancies between composite video signals, whilst ''Icelock'' uses digital information conveyed in the [[vertical blanking interval]] of a composite video signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41098">'''Granular computing''' (GrC) is an emerging [[computing]] paradigm of [[information processing]] that concerns the processing of complex information entities called "information [[granulation|granules]]", which arise in the process of data abstraction and [[knowledge extraction|derivation of knowledge]] from information or data.  Generally speaking, information granules are collections of entities that usually originate at the numeric level and are arranged together due to their [[Similarity measure|similarity]], functional or physical adjacency, indistinguishability, coherency, or the like.

At present, granular computing is more a ''theoretical perspective'' than a coherent set of methods or principles.  As a theoretical perspective, it encourages an approach to data that recognizes and exploits the knowledge present in data at various levels of resolution or scales.  In this sense, it encompasses all methods which provide flexibility and adaptability in the resolution at which knowledge or information is extracted and represented.

== Types of granulation ==
[[File:Catarina 26 mar 2004 1310Z.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of cyclone.]] 
[[File:NASA Manhattan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|Satellite view of Manhattan.]] 
As mentioned above, ''granular computing'' is not an algorithm or process; there is no particular method that is called "granular computing".  It is rather an approach  to looking at data that recognizes how different and interesting regularities in the data can appear at different levels of granularity, much as different features become salient in [[satellite images]] of greater or lesser resolution.  On a low-resolution satellite image, for example, one might notice interesting cloud patterns representing [[cyclones]] or other large-scale weather phenomena, while in a higher-resolution image, one misses these large-scale atmospheric phenomena but instead notices smaller-scale phenomena, such as the interesting pattern that is the streets of [[Manhattan]].  The same is generally true of all data: At different resolutions or granularities, different features and relationships emerge.  The aim of granular computing is to try to take advantage of this fact in designing more effective machine-learning and reasoning systems.

There are several types of granularity that are often encountered in [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]], and we review them below:

=== Value granulation (discretization/quantization) ===
One type of granulation is the [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of variables.  It is very common that in data mining or machine-learning applications the resolution of variables needs to be ''decreased'' in order to extract meaningful regularities.  An example of this would be a variable such as "outside temperature" (&lt;math&gt;temp&lt;/math&gt;), which in a given application might be recorded to several decimal places of [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] (depending on the sensing apparatus).  However, for purposes of extracting relationships between "outside temperature" and, say, "number of health-club applications" (&lt;math&gt;club &lt;/math&gt;), it will generally be advantageous to quantize "outside temperature" into a smaller number of intervals.

==== Motivations ====
There are several interrelated reasons for granulating variables in this fashion:
* Based on prior [[domain knowledge]], there is no expectation that minute variations in temperature (e.g., the difference between {{convert|80|-|80.7|°F|C|1}}) could have an influence on behaviors driving the number of health-club applications.  For this reason, any "regularity" which our learning algorithms might detect at this level of resolution would have to be ''spurious'', as an artifact of overfitting.  By coarsening the temperature variable into intervals the difference between which we ''do'' anticipate (based on prior domain knowledge) might influence  number of health-club applications, we eliminate the possibility of detecting these spurious  patterns.  Thus, in this case, reducing resolution is a method of controlling [[overfitting]].
* By reducing the number of intervals in the temperature variable (i.e., increasing its ''grain size''), we increase the amount of sample data indexed by each interval designation.  Thus, by coarsening the variable, we increase sample sizes and achieve better statistical estimation.  In this sense, increasing granularity provides an antidote to the so-called ''[[curse of dimensionality]]'', which relates to the exponential decrease in statistical power with increase in number of dimensions or variable cardinality.
*Independent of prior domain knowledge, it is often the case that meaningful regularities (i.e., which can be detected by a given learning methodology, representational language, etc.) may exist at one level of resolution and not at another.

[[File:Value granulation.png|thumb|200 px|Benefits of value granulation: Implications here exist at the resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{X_i,Y_j\}&lt;/math&gt; that do not exist at the higher resolution of &lt;math&gt;\{x_i,y_j\}&lt;/math&gt;; in particular, &lt;math&gt;\forall x_i,y_j: x_i \not\to y_j&lt;/math&gt;, while at the same time, &lt;math&gt;\forall X_i \exists Y_j: X_i \leftrightarrow Y_j&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For example, a simple learner or pattern recognition system may seek to extract regularities satisfying a [[conditional probability]] threshold such as &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) \ge \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.  In the special case where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, this recognition system is essentially detecting ''[[logical implication]]'' of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt; or, in words, "if &lt;math&gt;X=x_i&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;".  The system's ability to recognize such implications (or, in general, conditional probabilities exceeding threshold)  is partially contingent on the resolution with which the system analyzes the variables.

As an example of this last point, consider the feature space shown to the right.  The variables may each be regarded at two different resolutions.  Variable &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution wherein it takes on the four values &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or at a lower (binary) resolution wherein it takes on the two values &lt;math&gt;\{X_1, X_2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, variable &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; may be regarded at a high (quaternary) resolution or at a lower (binary) resolution, where it takes on the values &lt;math&gt;\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{Y_1, Y_2\}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  It will be noted that at the high resolution, there are '''no''' detectable implications of the form &lt;math&gt;X=x_i \rightarrow Y=y_j &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is associated with more than one &lt;math&gt;y_j&lt;/math&gt;, and thus, for all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p(Y=y_j|X=x_i) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  However, at the low (binary) variable resolution, two bilateral implications become detectable:    &lt;math&gt;X=X_1 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X=X_2 \leftrightarrow Y=Y_2 &lt;/math&gt;, since every &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; occurs ''iff'' &lt;math&gt;Y_2&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, a pattern recognition system scanning for implications of this kind would find them at the binary variable resolution, but would fail to find them at the   higher quaternary variable resolution.

====Issues and methods====
It is not feasible to exhaustively test all possible discretization resolutions on all variables in order to see which combination of resolutions yields interesting or significant results.  Instead, the feature space must be preprocessed (often by an [[information entropy|entropy]] analysis of some kind) so that some guidance can be given as to how the discretization process should proceed.  Moreover, one cannot generally achieve good results by naively analyzing and discretizing each variable independently, since this may obliterate the very interactions that we had hoped to discover.

A sample of papers that address the problem of variable discretization in general, and multiple-variable discretization in particular, is as follows: {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Wong|Cheung|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Bay|2001}},  {{Harvtxt|Liu|Hussain|Tan|Dasii|2002}}, {{Harvtxt|Wang|Liu|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Zighed|Rabaséda|Rakotomalala|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Catlett|1991}}, {{Harvtxt|Dougherty|Kohavi|Sahami|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|Monti|Cooper|1999}}, {{Harvtxt|Fayyad|Irani|1993}}, {{Harvtxt|Chiu|Cheung|Wong|1990}}, {{Harvtxt|Nguyen|Nguyen|1998}}, {{Harvtxt|Grzymala-Busse|Stefanowski|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Ting|1994}}, {{Harvtxt|Ludl|Widmer|2000}}, {{Harvtxt|Pfahringer|1995}}, {{Harvtxt|An|Cercone|1999}}, 
{{Harvtxt|Chiu|Cheung|1989}}, {{Harvtxt|Chmielewski|Grzymala-Busse|1996}}, {{Harvtxt|Lee|Shin|1994}}, {{Harvtxt|Liu|Wellman|2002}}, {{Harvtxt|Liu|Wellman|2004}}.

=== Variable granulation (clustering/aggregation/transformation) ===
Variable granulation is a term that could describe a variety of techniques, most of which are aimed at reducing dimensionality, redundancy, and storage requirements.  We briefly describe some of the ideas here, and present pointers to the literature.

====Variable transformation====
A number of classical methods, such as [[principal component analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]], [[factor analysis]], and [[structural equation modeling]], and their relatives, fall under the genus of "variable transformation."  Also in this category are more modern areas of study such as [[dimensionality reduction]], [[projection pursuit]], and [[independent component analysis]].  The common goal of these methods in general is to find a representation of the data in terms of new variables, which are a linear or nonlinear transformation of the original variables, and in which important statistical relationships emerge. The resulting variable sets are almost always smaller than the original variable set, and hence these methods can be loosely said to impose a granulation on the feature space.  These dimensionality reduction methods are all reviewed in the standard texts, such as {{Harvtxt|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}}, {{Harvtxt|Witten|Frank|2005}}, and {{Harvtxt|Hastie|Tibshirani|Friedman|2001}}.

====Variable aggregation====
A different class of variable granulation methods derive more from [[data clustering]] methodologies than from the linear systems theory informing the above methods.  It was noted fairly early that one may consider "clustering" related variables in just  the same way that one considers clustering related data.  In data clustering, one identifies a group of similar entities (using a "[[measure of similarity]]" suitable to the domain — {{Harvtxt|Martino|Giuliani|Rizzi|2018}}), and then in some sense ''replaces'' those entities with a prototype of some kind.  The prototype may be the simple average of the data in the identified cluster, or some other representative measure.  But the key idea is that in subsequent operations, we may be able to use the single prototype for the data cluster (along with perhaps a statistical model describing how exemplars are derived from the prototype) to ''stand in'' for the much larger set of exemplars.   These prototypes are generally such as to capture most of the information of interest concerning the entities.

[[File:Kraskov tree.png|thumb|400 px|A Watanabe-Kraskov variable agglomeration tree. Variables are agglomerated (or "unitized") from the bottom-up, with each merge-node representing a (constructed) variable having entropy equal to the joint entropy of the agglomerating variables. Thus, the agglomeration of two m-ary variables &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; having individual entropies &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; yields a single &lt;math&gt;m^2&lt;/math&gt;-ary variable &lt;math&gt;X_{1,2}&lt;/math&gt; with entropy &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})=H(X_1,X_2)&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt; are highly dependent (i.e., redundant) and have large mutual information &lt;math&gt;I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H(X_{1,2})&lt;/math&gt; &amp;#x226A; &lt;math&gt;H(X_1)+H(X_2)&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;H(X_1,X_2)=H(X_1)+H(X_2)-I(X_1;X_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and this would be considered a parsimonious unitization or aggregation.]]
Similarly, it is reasonable to ask whether a large set of variables might be aggregated into a smaller set of ''prototype'' variables that capture the most salient relationships between the variables.    Although variable clustering methods based on [[linear correlation]] have been proposed ({{Harvnb|Duda|Hart|Stork|2001}};{{Harvnb|Rencher|2002}}), more powerful methods of variable clustering are based on the [[mutual information]] between variables. Watanabe has shown ({{Harvnb|Watanabe|1960}};{{Harvnb|Watanabe|1969}}) that for any set of variables one can construct a ''polytomic'' (i.e., n-ary) tree representing a series of variable agglomerations in which the ultimate "total" correlation  among the complete variable set is the sum of the "partial" correlations exhibited by each agglomerating subset (see figure). Watanabe suggests that an observer might seek to thus partition a system in such a way as to minimize the interdependence between the parts "... as if they were looking for a natural division or a hidden crack."

One practical approach to building such a tree is to successively choose for agglomeration the two variables (either atomic variables or previously agglomerated variables) which have the highest pairwise mutual information {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}. The product of each agglomeration is a new (constructed) variable that reflects the local [[joint distribution]] of the two agglomerating variables, and thus possesses an entropy equal to their [[joint entropy]].
(From a procedural standpoint, this agglomeration step involves replacing two columns in the attribute-value table—representing the two agglomerating variables—with a single column that has a unique value for every unique combination of values in the replaced columns {{Harv|Kraskov|Stögbauer|Andrzejak|Grassberger|2003}}.  No information is lost by such an operation; however, it should be noted that if one is exploring the data for inter-variable relationships, it would generally ''not'' be desirable to merge redundant variables in this way, since in such a context it is likely to be precisely the redundancy or ''dependency'' between variables that is of interest;  and once redundant variables are merged, their relationship to one another can no longer be studied.

=== System granulation (aggregation) ===

In [[database systems]], aggregations (see e.g. [[OLAP|OLAP aggregation]] and [[Business intelligence]] systems) result in transforming original data tables (often called information systems) into the tables with different semantics of rows and columns, wherein the rows correspond to the groups (granules) of original tuples and the columns express aggregated information about original values within each of the groups. Such aggregations are usually based on SQL and its extensions. The resulting granules usually correspond to the groups of original tuples with the same values (or ranges) over some pre-selected original columns.

There are also other approaches wherein the groups are defined basing on, e.g., physical adjacency of rows. For example, [[Infobright]] implemented a database engine wherein data was partitioned onto ''rough rows'', each consisting of 64K of physically consecutive (or almost consecutive) rows. Rough rows were automatically labeled with compact information about their values on data columns, often involving multi-column and multi-table relationships. It resulted in a higher layer of granulated information where objects corresponded to rough rows and attributes - to various aspects of rough information. Database operations could be efficiently supported within such a new framework, with an access to the original data pieces still available {{Slezak|Synak|Wojna|Wroblewski|2013}}.

=== Concept granulation (component analysis) ===
The origins of the ''granular computing'' ideology are to be found in the [[rough sets]] and [[fuzzy sets]] literatures.  One of the key insights of rough set research—although by no means unique to it—is that, in general, the selection of different sets of features or variables will yield different ''concept'' granulations.  Here, as in elementary rough set theory, by "concept" we mean a set of entities that are ''indistinguishable'' or ''indiscernible'' to the observer (i.e., a simple concept), or a set of entities that is composed from such simple concepts (i.e., a complex concept).  To put it in other words, by projecting a data set ([[value-attribute system]]) onto different sets of variables, we recognize alternative sets of equivalence-class "concepts" in the data, and these different sets of concepts will in general be conducive to the extraction of different relationships and regularities.

====Equivalence class granulation====
We illustrate with an example.  Consider the attribute-value system below:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes or primitive (simple) concepts:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;,  cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes.  The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.  Now, let us imagine a projection of the attribute value system onto attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, which would represent, for example, the  view from an observer which is only capable of detecting this single attribute. Then we obtain the following much coarser equivalence class structure.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

This is in a certain regard the same structure as before, but at a lower degree of resolution (larger grain size).  Just as in the case of [[#Value granulation (discretization/quantization)|value granulation (discretization/quantization)]], it is possible that relationships (dependencies) may emerge at one level of granularity that are not present at another.  As an example of this, we can consider the effect of concept granulation on the measure known as ''attribute dependency'' (a simpler relative of the [[mutual information]]).

To establish this notion of dependency (see also [[rough sets]]), let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt; represent a particular concept granulation, where each &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence class from the concept structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  For example, if the  attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of attribute &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; alone, as above,  then the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; will be composed of    &lt;math&gt;Q_1 = \{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_2 = \{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Q_3 = \{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''dependency''' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on another attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\left | \sum_{i=1}^N {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its "lower approximation" (see [[rough sets]]) by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  More simply, this approximation  is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which—based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;—can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by  attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects, in a sense capturing the "synchronization" of the two concept structures &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;" (Ziarko &amp; Shan 1995).

Having gotten definitions now out of the way, we can make the simple observation that the choice of concept granularity (i.e., choice of attributes) will influence the detected dependencies among attributes.  Consider again the attribute value table from above:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"

|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the dependency of attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;
on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, we wish to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

The objects that can be ''definitively'' categorized according to concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are those in the set &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{8},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and since there are six of these, the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 6/10&lt;/math&gt;.  This might be considered an interesting dependency in its own right, but perhaps in a particular data mining application only stronger dependencies are desired.

We might then consider the dependency of the smaller attribute set  &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt;
on the attribute set &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_2, P_3\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The move from &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4, P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Q = \{P_4\}&lt;/math&gt; induces a coarsening of the class structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, as will be seen shortly.  We wish again to know what proportion of objects can be correctly classified into the (now larger) classes of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on knowledge of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.  The equivalence classes of the new &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; are shown below.

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;
! &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{5},O_{6},O_{8},O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{5},O_{9}\} \\
\{O_{8}\}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; has a coarser granularity than it did earlier.  The objects that can now be ''definitively'' categorized according to the concept structure &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; based on &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; constitute the complete universe &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2},\ldots,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  the dependency of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, knowledge of membership according to category set  &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; is adequate to determine category membership in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; with complete certainty; In this case we might say that &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, by coarsening the concept structure, we were able to find a stronger (deterministic) dependency.  However, we also note that the classes induced in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt; from the reduction in resolution necessary to obtain this deterministic dependency are now themselves large and few in number; as a result, the dependency we found, while strong, may be less valuable to us than the weaker dependency found earlier under the higher resolution view of &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

In general it is not possible to test all sets of attributes to see which induced concept structures yield the strongest dependencies, and this search must be therefore be guided with some intelligence.  Papers which discuss this issue, and others relating to intelligent use of granulation, are those by Y.Y. Yao and [[Lotfi Zadeh]] listed in the [[#References]] below.

====Component granulation====
Another perspective on concept granulation may be obtained from work on parametric models of categories.  In [[mixture model]] learning, for example, a set of data is explained as a mixture of distinct [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] (or other) distributions.  Thus, a large amount of data is "replaced" by a small number of distributions.  The choice of the number of these distributions, and their size, can again be viewed as a problem of ''concept granulation''.  In general, a better fit to the data is obtained by a larger number of distributions or parameters, but in order to extract meaningful patterns, it is necessary to constrain the number of distributions, thus deliberately  ''coarsening'' the concept resolution.  Finding the "right" concept resolution is a tricky problem for which many methods have been proposed (e.g., [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]], [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], [[Minimum description length|MDL]], etc.), and these are frequently  considered under the rubric of "[[model regularization]]".

==Different interpretations of granular computing==
Granular computing can be conceived as a framework of theories, methodologies, techniques, and tools that make use of information granules in the process of problem solving.  In this sense, granular computing is used as an umbrella term to cover topics that have been studied in various fields in isolation.  By examining all of these existing studies in light of the unified framework of granular computing and extracting their commonalities, it may be possible to develop a general theory for problem solving.

In a more philosophical sense, granular computing can describe a way of thinking that relies on the human ability to perceive the real world under various levels of granularity (i.e., abstraction) in order to abstract and consider only those things that serve a specific interest and to switch among different granularities. By focusing on different levels of granularity, one can obtain different levels of knowledge, as well as a greater understanding of the inherent knowledge structure.  Granular computing is thus essential in human problem solving and hence has a very significant impact on the design and implementation of intelligent systems.

[[File:Bischofferode Grotte01.jpg|thumb|294x294px|A Marian grotto in [[Bischofferode]], [[Germany]]]]
A '''grotto''' (Italian ''grotta'' and French ''grotte'') is a natural or artificial [[cave]] used by humans in both modern times and antiquity, and historically or prehistorically. Naturally occurring grottoes are often small caves near water that are usually flooded or liable to flood at [[high tide]]. Sometimes, artificial grottoes are used as [[garden feature]]s. The ''[[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Grotta Azzurra]]'' at [[Capri]] and the grotto at the villa of [[Tiberius]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] are examples of popular natural seashore grottoes.

Whether in tidal water or high up in hills, grottoes are generally made up of [[limestone]] [[geology]], where the acidity of standing water has [[Solvation|dissolved]] the [[carbonate]]s in the [[rock matrix]] as it passes through what were originally small fissures.{{cn|date=June 2018}} See [[karst topography]], [[cavern]].
{{Wiktionary|grotto}}

==Etymology==
The word "grotto" comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''grotta'', [[Vulgar Latin]] grupta, and [[Latin]] crypta (a [[crypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', ''s.v.'' "grotto".&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also related by a historical accident to the word "grotesque". In the late 15th century, Romans accidentally unearthed [[Nero]]'s ''[[Domus Aurea]]'' on the [[Palatine Hill]], a series of rooms, decorated with designs of garlands, slender architectural framework, foliage, and animals. The rooms had sunk underground over time. The Romans who discovered this historical monument found it very strange, partly because it was uncovered from an "underworld" source. This led the Romans of that era to give it the name ''grottesca'', from which came the French ''[[grotesque]]''.

==Antiquity==
[[File:Taq-e Bostan - view of two grottoes.jpg|thumb|upright|Two vaulted grottoes called [[Taq-e Bostan]], located in Iran, [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] era]]
Grottoes were very popular in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture. Spring-fed grottoes were a feature of Apollo's oracles at [[Delphi]], [[Corinth]], and [[Clarus]].&lt;ref&gt;G. W. Elderkin, "The Natural and the Artificial Grotto", ''Hesperia'' '''10'''.2 (April – June 1941), pp. 125–137, gives numerous well-known ancient Greek examples, natural and architectural, with some details of their sites.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] city of [[Rhodes]] was designed with rock-cut artificial grottoes incorporated into the city, made to look natural.&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Rice, "Grottoes on the Acropolis of Hellenistic Rhodes", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''90''' (1995), pp. 383–404.&lt;/ref&gt; At the great Roman sanctuary of [[Palestrina|Praeneste]] south of Rome, the oldest portion of the primitive sanctuary was situated on the second lowest terrace, in a grotto in the natural rock where a spring developed into a well. According to tradition, Praeneste's sacred spring had a native [[nymph]], who was honored in a grotto-like watery [[nymphaeum]].&lt;ref&gt;A.R.A. van Aken, "Some Aspects of Nymphaea in Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia" ''[[Mnemosyne (journal)|Mnemosyne]]'', Fourth Series, '''4'''.3/4 (1951), pp. 272–284&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiberius]], the Roman emperor, filled his grotto with sculptures to create a sense of mythology, perhaps channeling [[Polyphemus]]' cave in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. The [[numinous]] quality of the grotto is still more ancient: in a grotto near [[Knossos]] in Crete, [[Eileithyia]] was venerated, even before [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] palace-building. Even farther back in time, the [[immanence]] of the divine in a grotto is seen in the sacred caves of [[Lascaux]].

== Garden grotto history and design ==
[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, scalinata.JPG|thumb|Grotto entrance, [[Villa Torrigiani]]]]

The popularity of artificial grottoes introduced the [[Mannerism|Mannerist style]] to Italian and French gardens of the mid-16th century. Two famous grottoes in the [[Boboli Gardens]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]] were begun by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] and completed by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati|Ammanati]] and [[Bernardo Buontalenti|Buontalenti]] between 1583 and 1593. One of these grottoes originally housed the ''Prisoners'' of [[Michelangelo]]. Before the Boboli grotto, a garden was laid out by [[Niccolò Tribolo]] at the Medici [[Niccolò Tribolo|Villa Castello]], near [[Florence]]. At [[Villa di Pratolino|Pratolino]], in spite of the dryness of the site, there was a Grotto of Cupid (surviving), with water tricks for the unsuspecting visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Webster Smith, "Pratolino", ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'' '''20'''.4 (December 1961), pp. 155–168.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fonte di Fata Morgana]] ("Fata Morgana's Spring") at Grassina, not far from Florence, is a small garden building, built in 1573–4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" (rest) of Bernardo Vecchietti. It is decorated with sculptures in the [[Giambologna]]n manner.

The outsides of garden grottoes are often designed to look like an enormous rock, a rustic porch or a rocky overhang. Inside, they are decorated as a temple or with fountains, [[stalactites]] and imitation gems and shells (sometimes made in ceramic); herms and mermaids, mythological subjects suited to the space; and [[naiad]]s, or river gods whose urns spilled water into pools.  Damp grottoes were cool places to retreat from the Italian sun, but they also became fashionable in the cool drizzle of the [[Île-de-France]]. In [[Kuskovo]] in the Sheremetev estate there is a Summer Grotto, built in 1775.
[[File:Villa torrigiani di lucca, statua 04.JPG|thumb|upright|Sculpture in a grotto setting, [[Villa Torrigiani]], Lucca]]

Grottoes could also serve as baths; an example of this is at the [[Palazzo del Te]], in the 'Casino della Grotta', where a small suite of intimate rooms is laid out around a grotto and ''loggetta'' (covered balcony). Courtiers once bathed in the small cascade that splashed over the pebbles and shells encrusted in the floor and walls.

Grottoes have also served as [[chapel]]s, or at [[Villa Farnese]] at Caprarola, a little theater designed in the grotto manner. They were often combined with cascading fountains in Renaissance gardens.

The grotto designed by [[Bernard Palissy]] for [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s château in [[Paris, France|Paris]], the [[Tuileries]], was renowned. There are also grottoes in the gardens designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] for [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. In England, an early garden grotto was built at [[Wilton House]] in the 1630s, probably by [[Isaac de Caus]].

Grottoes were suitable for less formal gardens too. [[Pope's Grotto]], created by [[Alexander Pope]], is almost all that survives of one of the very first [[Landscape architecture|landscape gardens]] in England, at [[Twickenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Bracher, "Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy Pope's Grotto: The Maze of Fancy", ''The Huntington Library Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (February 1949), pp. 141–162; Anthony Beckles Willson, "Alexander Pope's Grotto in Twickenham", ''Garden History'' '''26'''.1 (Summer, 1998), pp. 31–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Pope was inspired after seeing grottoes in Italy during a visit there. Efforts are under way to restore his grotto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/museums/11866157/Inside-Alexander-Popes-hidden-grotto.html] Lambert, Victoria. “Inside Alexander Pope's hidden grotto”. The Telegraph.  September 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; There are grottoes in the landscape gardens of [[Painshill Park]],&lt;ref&gt;Alison Hodges, "Painshill, Cobham, Surrey: The Grotto", ''Garden History'' '''3'''.2 (Spring 1975), pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stowe Landscape Garden|Stowe]], [[Clandon Park]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;James Turner, "The Structure of Henry Hoare's Stourhead", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''61'''.1 (March 1979), pp. 68–77; Malcolm Kelsall, "The Iconography of Stourhead", ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''46'''(1983), pp. 133–143; Kenneth Woodbridge, "Henry Hoare's Paradise," ''The Art Bulletin'' '''47'''.1 (March 1965), pp. 83–116.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending 67&amp;nbsp;ft (20 metres) into the chalk hillside on the outskirts of [[Ware, Hertfordshire]]. Built during the late 18th century, the chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints and pieces of coloured glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513215354/http://scotts-grotto.org/CMS/index.php |archivedate=2005-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic generation of tourists might not actually visit [[Fingal's Cave]], on the remote isle of [[Staffa]] in the Scottish [[Hebrides]], but they have often heard of it, perhaps through [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s "[[Hebrides Overture]]", better known as "[[Hebrides Overture|Fingal's Cave]]", which was inspired by his visit. In the 19th century, when miniature [[Matterhorn]]s and rock-gardens became fashionable, a grotto was often found, such as at [[Ascott House]]. In Bavaria, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig]]'s [[Linderhof]] contains an abstraction of the grotto under Venusberg, which figured in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''.

Although grottoes have largely fallen from fashion since the British [[Picturesque]] movement, architects and artists occasionally try to redefine the grotto in contemporary design works. Such examples include Aranda/Lasch's ''Grotto Concept,'' (2005), Callum Moreton's ''Grotto'' pavilion (2010), ARM's post-modern ''Storey Hall'' (1995), and [[Frederick Kiesler]]'s ''Grotto of Meditation for New Harmony'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alderslade, Jessica| title=An Introduction to the Grotto and Its Place within Contemporary Design|work=  Reinterpreting the Grotto in Contemporary Design|location= Australia, |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, artificial grottoes are purchased and built for ornamental and devotional purposes. They are often used as [[shrine]]s in which to place statues of saints, particularly the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], in outdoor gardens.

Many [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] visit a grotto where [[Bernadette Soubirous]] claimed she saw apparitions of [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Numerous garden shrines are modelled after these apparitions. They can commonly be found displayed in gardens and [[church architecture|churches]], among other places (see [[Lourdes grotto]]).

The '''United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development''' ('''HLPF''') is a subsidiary body of both the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] responsible for the entire organization's policy on [[Sustainable development|sustainable development]]. It adopts negotiated declarations, reviews commitment and the progress of the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The Forum replaced the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] on the 24 September 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1556 |title=High-level Political Forum |date=n.d. |website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=14 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the Forum are open to all Member States of the United Nations. 

== History ==

The HLPF has its origin in the '''Commission on Sustainable Development''' ('''CSD'''), which was created in 1992 to ensure follow-up of the [[Earth Summit|Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/intergovernmental/csd |title=Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) |date=n.d. |website= sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=November 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Commission met a total of 20 times, with its last session on 20 September 2013.

At the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Conference on Sustainable Development]], or Rio+20, it was decided that the Commission would be replaced by the '''High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.''' This new Forum would meet under the auspices of both the Economic and Social Council, as well as the General Assembly. The Forum was formally created by Resolution 67/290 on 9 July 2013. &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-67-290 |body=A |session=67 |type=R |resolution_number=290 |title= Format and Organizational Aspects of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Forum is held under the authority of both the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, the body hosts two different types of meetings:
* While under the auspices of the General Assembly: Once every four years at the level of Heads of State and Government for a period of two days.
* While under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council: Yearly, for a period of eight days, including a three-day ministerial segment.
Its meetings are held in July.

Ida Rodríguez Prampolini was born on 24 September 1925 in the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], in [[Veracruz]] state, Mexico to Ida Prampolini and Carlos Rodríguez Mendoza.{{sfn|Ponce|2017}}{{sfn|''El Financiero''|2017}} Her mother was of Italian origin and was instrumental in founding the chapter of the Red Cross in Veracruz. Her father was a physician and served as the director of the regional hospital.{{sfn|''El Financiero''|2017}} After completing her secondary education, she moved to [[Mexico City]] and enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)}}), graduating with an undergraduate degree in philosophy and letters. She continued her education at UNAM, earning a master's degree in history in 1947 and a doctorate in literature with an emphasis in history in 1948.{{sfn|''Al Color Politico''|2012}} 

Having graduated ''[[Magna cum Laude]]'', Rodríguez was awarded a government scholarship to pursue post-graduate studies between 1948 and 1949 at the summer school of the University of Santander at the [[Palacio de la Magdalena]] and the {{ill|School of Altamira|es|Escuela de Altamira}} in [[Santillana del Mar]], Spain, where she undertook courses in art history and abstract art.{{sfn|''Al Color Politico''|2012}} While she was there, she met [[Mathias Goeritz]], who would become her husband.{{sfn|Méndez-Gallardo|2014}} In 1950, she went to [[Montreal]], Canada, studying art history at [[McGill University]].{{sfn|''Al Color Politico''|2012}}

It is one of the most advanced research organization in the world. In 2001, it is ranked as no.1 in the field of material sciences by [http://scientific.thomson.com/ ISI, Philadelphia].

==Outline==
The institute is the oldest of the five research institutes of [[Tohoku University]]. It was started 90 years ago by the late Professor [[Kotaro Honda]] for research on [[KS steel]]. In 1987, it was reorganized into its present form, a national collaborative research institute, and designated as a Center of Excellence (COE) for material science.

Its research field is diverse materials as well as metals. As recent creations, new types of materials, including high performance, high quality and multifunctional materials such as [[amorphous alloys]] with complex structures, [[bulk metallic glasses]] developed from amorphous alloys. And multicomponent intermetallic compounds, [[quasicrystals]], [[oxides]], [[ceramic]]s, nanostructural controlled metals, [[semiconductors]], crystals for [[solar cells]], [[biomaterials]], [[organic materials]], [[hydrogen storage alloys]], and [[shaped crystals]], etc.

==Former institutes==
The name of the institute was consequently changed to the present one, Institute for Materials Research (IMR).

*April 1, 1916: '''the 2nd Division of the Provisional Institute of Physical and Chemical Research'''(東北帝国大学理科大学臨時理化学研究所第2部)

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NFC touch interactions 2.jpg|thumb|Mobile Phone Device]]
'''Mobile interaction''' is the study of interaction between mobile users and computers. Mobile interaction is an aspect of [[human–computer interaction]] that emerged when computers became small enough to enable mobile usage, around the 1990s.

[[Mobile devices]] are a pervasive part of people's everyday lives. People use [[mobile phones]], [[PDAs]], and [[portable media players]] almost everywhere. These devices are the first truly pervasive interaction devices that are currently used for a huge variety of services and applications.&lt;ref name="Mobile Interaction with the Real World" /&gt; Mobile devices affect the way people interact, share, and communicate with others. They are growing in diversity and complexity, featuring new interaction paradigms, modalities, shapes, and purposes (e.g., [[e-readers]], [[portable media players]], [[handheld game consoles]]). The strong differentiating factors that characterize mobile devices from traditional personal computing (e.g., [[desktop computers]]), are their ubiquitous use, usual small size, and mixed interaction modalities.&lt;ref name="Designing and Evaluating Mobile Interaction: Challenges and Trends" /&gt;

The history of mobile interaction includes different design trends. The main six design trends are portability, [[miniaturization]], [[Internet connectivity|connectivity]], [[Convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]], [[divergence]], and [[application software]] (apps). The main reason behind those trends is to understand the requirements and needs of mobile users which is the main goal for mobile interaction. Mobile interaction is a multidisciplinary area with various academic subjects making contributions to it. The main disciplines involved in mobile interaction are [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[sociology]], [[design]], and [[information systems]]. The processes in mobile interaction design includes three main activities: understanding users, developing prototype designs, and evaluation.

== History ==
The history of mobile interaction can be divided into a number of eras, or waves, each characterized by a particular technological focus, interaction design trends, and by leading to fundamental changes in the design and use of mobile devices. Although not strictly sequential, they provide a good overview of the legacy on which current mobile computing research and design is built.&lt;ref name="Mobile Interactions in Context: A Designerly Way Toward Digital Ecology" /&gt;

# Portability
#: One of the first work in the mobile interaction discipline was the concept of the [[Dynabook]] by [[Alan Kay]] in 1968. However, at that time the necessary hardware to build such system was not available. When the first [[laptop]]s were built in the early 1980s they were seen as transportable [[desktop computers]].
# Miniaturization
#: By the early 1990s, many types of handheld devices were introduced such as labelled [[palmtop]] computers, digital organizers, or [[personal digital assistants]] (PDAs).
# Connectivity
#: By 1973, [[Martin Cooper (inventor)|Martin Cooper]] worked at [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] developed a handheld mobile phone concept, which later on by 1983, led to the introduction of the first commercial mobile phone called the [[DynaTAC 8000X]].[[File:IPhone and iPhone 3G (Yutaka Tsutano).jpg|thumb|[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]]]]
# Convergence
#: During this era, different types of specialized mobile devices started to converge into new types of hybrid devices with primarily different form factors and interaction designs. On 1992, the first device of such technique, the "[[smartphones]]" was introduced. The first smart phone was the [[IBM Simon]] and it was used for making phone calls, calendars, addresses, notes, e-mail, fax and games.
# Divergence
#: During the 2000s, a trend toward a single function many devices started to spread. the basic idea behind divergence is that specialized tools facilitate optimization of functionality over time and enhancement of use. The most famous device of this era was the [[Apple iPod]] on 2001.
# Apps
#: During 2007, [[Apple Inc.]] introduced the first truly "smart" cellular phone; the [[iPhone]]. It was a converged mobile device with different features functionality. The most important thing is that it represents a significant rethinking of the design of mobile interactions and a series of notable interaction design choices. In less than a decade Apple Inc. would sell over one-billion iPhones&lt;ref name="Mobile Interactions in Context: A Designerly Way Toward Digital Ecology" /&gt;

== Goals ==
With the evolution of both [[software]] and hardware on the mobile devices, the users are becoming more demanding of the [[user interface]] that provide both functionality and pleasant [[user experience]]. The goal of mobile interaction researches is to understand the requirements and needs of mobile users. Compared with stationary devices mobile devices have specific, often restricted, input and output requirements. A goal that is often named is to overcome the limitations of mobile devices. However, exploiting the special opportunities of mobile usage can also be seen as a central goal.

== Disciplines involved ==
Mobile interaction is a multidisciplinary area with various academic subjects making contributions. This is a reflection of the complicated nature of an individual's interaction with a computer system. This includes factors such as an understanding of the user and the task the user wants to perform with the system, understanding of the design tools, [[software suite|software packages]] that are needed to achieve this and an understanding of software engineering tools. The following are the main disciplines involved in mobile interaction:&lt;ref name="Understanding Mobile Human-Computer Interaction" /&gt;

===1. Psychology===
Many of the research methods and system evaluation techniques currently used in mobile human-computer interaction research are borrowed from [[psychology]]. As well as attitude measures, performance measures that are used in mobile human-computer interaction research studies come from the area of [[experimental psychology]]. Understanding users and their needs is a key aspect in the design of mobile systems, devices, and applications so that they will be easy and enjoyable to use. Individual user characteristics such as age, or personality physical disabilities such as blindness, all have an effect on users' performance when they are using [[mobile applications]] and systems, and these individual differences can also affect people's attitude towards the mobile service or device that they interact with.

===2. Computer science===
[[Computer science]] (along with [[software engineering]]) is responsible for providing software tools to develop the interfaces that users need to interact with system. These include the [[software development tools]].

===3. Sociology===
[[Sociologist]]s working in this area are responsible for looking at [[socio-technical]] aspects of human-computer interaction. They bring methods and techniques from the [[social sciences]] (e.g., observational studies, ethnography) that can be used in the design and evaluation of mobile devices and applications.

===4. Design===
People working in this area are concerned with looking at the [[design]] layout of the interface (e.g., colors, positioning of text or graphics on a screen of a PDA). This is a crucial area of mobile human-computer interaction research due to the limited screen space available for most mobile devices. Therefore, it is crucial that services and applications reflect this limitation by reducing information complexity to fit the parameters of the mobile device, without losing any substantial content.

===5. Information systems===
People who work in [[information systems]] are interested in investigating how people interact with information and technologies in an organisational, managerial, and business context. In an organisational context, information system professionals and researchers are interested in looking at ways in which mobile technologies and [[mobile applications]] can be used to make an organisation more effective in conducting its business on a day-to-day business.

== Mobile interaction design ==
Mobile interaction design is part of the interaction design which heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires of the majority of people who will use the product.&lt;ref name="About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design" /&gt; The processes in mobile interaction design are in the following main types of activity:&lt;ref name="Mobile Interaction Design" /&gt;
# '''Understanding users''' – having a sense of people's capabilities and limitations; gaining a rich picture of what makes up the detail of their lives, the things they do and use.
# '''Developing prototype designs''' – representing a proposed interaction design in such a way that it can be demonstrated, altered, and discussed.
# '''Evaluation''' – each prototype is a stepping stone to the next, better, refined design. Evaluation techniques identify the strengths and weaknesses of a design but can also lead the team to propose a completely different approach, discarding the current line of design thinking for a radical approach.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">The '''Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program''' (PRISP) is a program which "links undergraduate and graduate students with US security and intelligence agencies" by providing funding to selected US students entering university, in return for a commitment to join the agency for at least 18 months on graduation.&lt;ref name=counterpunch&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 23 June 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html Son of PRISP: Obama's Classroom Spies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129210246/http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISP is a decentralized program which funds students through various intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=CPMar05/&gt; The program was established by the US Congress in 2004. In 2010 it became a permanent, authorized funded IC program. By 2011 most IC agencies participate in this program which is designated to recruit and train analysts and linguists. PRISP funding can be used to pay hiring incentives, such as a recruitment bonus or reimburse previous educational expenses for individuals who already possess the necessary skills (language, specialized scientific or geographical area expertise), or to provide additional education or training for those selected for the program. There is a service obligation of 18 months. IC agencies' websites should be consulted for specifics on any particular agency's PRISP program participation.

PRISP is named after Senator [[Pat Roberts]] (the then Chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]). In April 2009, [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] gave PRISP a "Narcissist Award".&lt;ref&gt;''Fox News'', 14 April 2009, [http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/government/anti-pork-group-announces-pig-book-awards/ Anti-Pork Group Announces 'Pig Book' Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423233408/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/government/anti-pork-group-announces-pig-book-awards/ |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, following PRISP, an additional, similar program (Intelligence Community Scholars Program, ICSP) was approved.

[[File:Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies.jpg|thumb|Main building at St Michael's College]]
[[Image:PIMSdoor.jpg|thumb|upright|Main entrance of the institute]]
The '''Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies''' ('''PIMS''') is a research institute in the [[University of Toronto]] that is dedicated to advanced studies in the culture of the [[Middle Ages]].

==Governance==
The [[Roman Catholic Archbishops of Toronto|Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto]], currently [[Thomas Christopher Collins]], acts as the chancellor of the institute. The Praeses (or president) of the Institute is [[Richard Alway]], who was formerly president of St. Michael's College.

==History==
It was founded in 1929 as the Institute of Mediaeval Studies at [[University of St. Michael's College|St. Michael's College]] of the University of Toronto. [[Étienne Gilson]], then of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], was instrumental in its foundation, along with Henry Carr and Edmund J. McCorkell of the [[Congregation of St. Basil]] and St. Michael's College. In 1939 it was granted a [[Papacy|pontifical]] charter by [[Pope Pius XII]], by which it was given the power to grant [[licenciate]] and doctorate degrees in [[medieval studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image of the Historical Plaque outside of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Pontifical_Institute_of_Mediaeval_Studies.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 the University of Toronto established the [[Centre for Medieval Studies, Toronto|Centre for Medieval Studies]] as part of the School of Graduate Studies, for students pursuing a [[master's degree]] or [[doctorate]] in [[medieval studies]]. Teaching at these levels gradually passed from the Institute to the Centre. (The Centre officially uses the spelling "medieval" while PIMS uses "mediaeval".)  Students of the Centre for Medieval Studies have access to the PIMS building and library. 

Up until 1958 the institute had its own charter. From 1958 to 2005, PIMS was a division of St. Michael's College. The Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies Act of 2005 gave the institute academic autonomy from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies Act, 2005, S.O. 2005, c. Pr10|url=https://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/source/private/english/2005/elaws_src_private_pr05010_e.htm|work=ServiceOntario e-Laws|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, PIMS is administered by a board of governors with its academic affairs vested in the Institute Council of the academic staff, consisting of fellows and associate fellows.

==Postdoctoral Program and Licence in Mediaeval Studies==

In 1998 the institute became an exclusively postdoctoral research centre, and it accepts students who have recently completed their doctoral studies and wish to conduct specialized research in medieval studies. PIMS offers a Licence in Mediaeval Studies (LMS) as a degree exclusively for students who have completed their postdoctoral studies there. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licence in Mediaeval Studies|url=http://www.pims.ca/academics/licence-in-mediaeval-studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The application for the LMS refers to it as a "Licentiate" and not as a "Licence.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licentiate in Mediaeval Studies Application, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies|url=http://www.pims.ca/uploads/htmleditor/licencap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually for a Pontifical licentiate, the degree is awarded after its bearer has already earned a doctorate, and not on the way to such.

==Étienne Gilson Lecture==
Since 1979 the institute has hosted an annual lecture from "a senior medievalist" in honour of its co-founder and his research interests.  Previous lecturers include [[Jaroslav Pelikan]], [[Mark D. Jordan]], [[John F. Wippel]], [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], and [[Francis Christopher Oakley|Francis Oakley]].  Lectures have been given on topics such as [[medieval philosophy]], [[medieval art]], [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medicine in the Middle Ages]], and medieval [[historiography]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Etienne Gilson Lecture|url=http://www.pims.ca/publications/the-etienne-gilson-lecture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==
The institute has its own [[library]] with over 150,000 volumes, one of the largest collections of medieval documentation in [[North America]].  The library is part of the larger system of the University of Toronto Libraries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PIMS Library page from the University of Toronto Libraries|url=https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/pontifical-institute-mediaeval-studies-library}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The library contains over 9,000 reels of [[microfilm]] and over 60,000 slides.  Materials are non-circulating, and use of the library is generally restricted to PIMS and Centre for Medieval Studies faculty, researchers, and graduate students, though visitor passes may be obtained by contacting the library itself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pontifical Institute for Mediaeval Studies Library|url=http://www.pims.ca/library/general-information-hours-access-staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
PIMS also has an extensive publishing program that includes its annual journal of research on the Middle Ages, ''Mediaeval Studies'', which began in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.5555/J.MS.6.75050409087802048803050201040705| issn = 0076-5872| volume = 1| pages = i–iv| title = Front Matter| journal = Mediaeval Studies| date = 1939| url = https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/abs/10.5555/J.MS.6.75050409087802048803050201040705}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A collection of Gilson Lectures focusing on [[Saint Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]] was published in 2008.

==Faculty and Fellows==
Faculty and research fellows, visiting and otherwise, associated with PIMS at various times include: 

* [[Leonard Boyle]], sometime Prefect of the [[Vatican Library]].

[[File:Ankara Muzeum B19-36.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük|Seated goddess of Çatalhöyük]] flanked by two [[Felidae|felines]]]]

'''Potnia Theron''' (Ἡ Πότνια Θηρῶν, "The Mistress of the Animals") is a term first used (once) by [[Homer]] (Iliad 21. 470) and often used to describe female divinities associated with animals.&lt;ref name=fatd&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer-Hansen|first=Tobias|title=From Artemis to Diana: the goddess of man and beast|year=2009|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=978-8763507882 |author2=Birte Poulsen|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[Potnia]]'', meaning mistress or lady, was a [[Mycenaean Greek]] word inherited by [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], with the same meaning, cognate to [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|patnī}}.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=John|title=The Mycenaean world|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29037-1|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homer's mention of ''potnia theron'' is thought to refer to [[Artemis]] and [[Walter Burkert]] describes this mention as "a well established formula".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|title=Greek Religion|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Artemis type deity, a 'Mistress of the Animals', is often assumed to have existed in prehistorical religion and often referred to as Potnia Theron, with some scholars positing a relationship between Artemis and goddesses depicted in Minoan art and "''Potnia Theron'' has become a generic term for any female associated with animals."&lt;ref name=fatd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roller|first=Lynn E.|title=In search of god the mother: the cult of Anatolian Cybele|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21024-0|page=139|quote=indefinite figures such as the Potnia Theron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many depictions use a female version of the widespread ancient [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] of the male [[Master of Animals]], showing a central figure with a human form grasping two animals, one to each side.  The oldest depiction has been discovered in [[Çatalhöyük]]. 
Another example of ''Potnia theròn'' is situated in Museo civico archeologico di Monte Rinaldo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retemusealedeisibillini.it/monterinaldo/|title=Monte Rinaldo - Rete Museale dei Sibillini|website=Retemusealedeisibillini.it|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Italy: plate illustrates goddess that wears a [[Peplos|long dress]] and holds hands with two [[Panthera|panthers]].

[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 006.jpg|thumb|300px|[[James Abbot McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge]]'' (1872), [[Tate Britain]], London, England]]
'''Realism''' was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Realists rejected [[Romanticism]], which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century.  Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial]] and [[Commercial Revolution]]s. The popularity of such "realistic" works grew with the introduction of [[photography]]—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.

The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Classical idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working class, and treating them with the same seriousness as other classes in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross. "Nineteenth-Century French Realism". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm online] (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism as an art movement was led by [[Gustave Courbet]] in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of [[Impressionism]] and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as [[Photorealism]], and others the depiction of "realist" subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both.


== Beginnings in France ==
[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A Realist painting by [[Gustave Courbet]].]]
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. The chief exponents of Realism were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm NGA Realism movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement National Gallery glossary, Realism movement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm Philosophy of Realism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] is closely associated with the beginning of ''Naturalism'', an artistic style that emerged from the later phase of the Realist movement and heralded the arrival of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;Fry, Roger. 1920. "Vision and Design." London: Chatto &amp; Windus. "An Essay in Æsthetics." 11-24. Accessed online on 13 March 2012 at {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/52044301/Roger-Fry-Vision-and-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114154844/http://www.scribd.com/doc/52044301/Roger-Fry-Vision-and-design |archivedate=2013-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Nineteenth-Century French Realism | Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courbet was the leading proponent of Realism and he challenged the popular [[history painting]] that was favored at the state-sponsored art academy.
His groundbreaking paintings ''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'' and ''[[The Stonebreakers]]'' depicted ordinary people from his native region. Both paintings were done on huge canvases that would typically be used for history paintings.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt; Although Courbet's early works emulated the sophisticated manner of Old Masters such as [[Rembrandt]] and [[Titian]], after 1848 he adopted a boldly inelegant style inspired by [[popular print]]s, shop signs, and other work of folk artisans.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In ''The Stonebreakers'', his first painting to create a controversy, Courbet eschewed the pastoral tradition of representing human subjects in harmony with nature. Rather, he depicted two men juxtaposed against a charmless, stony roadside. The concealment of their faces emphasizes the dehumanizing nature of their monotonous, repetitive labor.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

The French Realist movement had stylistic and ideological equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. The Realist movement in France was characterized by a spirit of rebellion against powerful official support for history painting. In countries where institutional support of history painting was less dominant, the transition from existing traditions of [[genre art|genre painting]] to Realism presented no such schism.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, J. 2003. "Realism". ''Grove Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Realist movement beyond France was the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as genre artist [[Vasily Perov]], [[landscape art|landscape]] artists [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Alexei Savrasov]], and [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], portraitist [[Ivan Kramskoy]], [[war artist]] [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], historical artist [[Vasily Surikov]] and, especially, [[Ilya Repin]], who is considered by many to be the most renowned Russian artist of the 19th century. 

Courbet's influence was felt most strongly in Germany, where prominent realists included [[Adolph Menzel]], [[Wilhelm Leibl]], [[Wilhelm Trübner]], and [[Max Liebermann]]. Leibl and several other young German painters met Courbet in 1869 when he visited Munich to exhibit his works and demonstrate his manner of painting from nature.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalgalerie (Berlin), and Françoise Forster-Hahn. 2001. ''Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings From the Nationalgalerie, Berlin''. London: National Gallery Company. p. 155. {{ISBN|1857099605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the artists of the [[Macchiaioli]] group painted Realist scenes of rural and urban life. The [[Hague School]] were Realists in the Netherlands whose style and subject matter strongly influenced the early works of [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In Britain artists such as the American [[James Abbot McNeill Whistler]], as well as English artists [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues and depictions of the "real" world. 

In the United States, [[Winslow Homer]] and [[Thomas Eakins]] were important Realists and forerunners of the [[Ashcan School]], an early-20th-century art movement largely based in [[New York City]]. The Ashcan School included such artists as [[George Bellows]] and [[Robert Henri]], and helped to define [[American realism]] in its tendency to depict the daily life of poorer members of society.

In [[music production]] or [[music composition|composition]], [[recording studio]]s are sometimes referred to as an instrument forming a vital part of the music creation process. Also known as "playing the studio", the approach is typically embodied by artists or producers who place less emphasis on simply capturing live performances in studio and instead favor the creative use of studio technology in completing finished works.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Techniques include the incorporation of [[noise in music|non-musical sounds]], [[overdub]]bing, [[magnetic tape|tape]] edits, [[sound synthesis]], [[Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects|audio signal processing]], and combining segmented performances ([[Take#Music_recording|takes]]) into a unified whole.

Composers have been exploiting the potentials of [[multitrack recording]] since the technology was made available to them. Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance. Following the advent of three-track tape in the mid 1950s, recording spaces became more accustomed for in-studio composition. By the late 1960s, in-studio composition had become standard practice, and remained so into the 2010s. Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as [[digital audio workstation]]s are still referred to as "the studio".

"Playing the studio" is critical shorthand for in-studio composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seymour|first1=Corey|title=Love &amp; Mercy Does Justice to the Brilliance of Brian Wilson|journal=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 5, 2015|url=http://www.vogue.com/13266664/love-and-mercy-brian-wilson/|accessdate=October 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus as to how to define the criterion of a musical instrument.{{sfn|Bell|2018|pp=34–35}} It is also unclear whether the "studio as instrument" concept extends to using multi-track recording simply to facilitate the basic music writing process.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=38}}  According to academic Adam Bell, some proposed definitions may be consistent with music produced in a recording studio, but not with music that relies heavily on [[digital audio workstations]] (DAW).{{sfn|Bell|2018|pp=34–35}} Various music educators alluded to "using the studio as a musical instrument" in books published as early as the late 1960s.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=xvi}}

[[Rock music|Rock]] historian Doyle Greene defines "studio as compositional tool" as a process in which music is produced around studio constructions rather than the more traditional method of capturing a live performance as is.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Techniques include the incorporation of [[noise in music|non-musical sounds]], [[overdub]]bing, [[magnetic tape|tape]] edits, [[sound synthesis]], [[Audio_signal_processing#Audio_effects|audio signal processing]], and combining segmented performances ([[Take#Music_recording|takes]]) into a unified whole.{{sfn|Greene|2016|p=179}} Despite the widespread changes that have led to more compact recording set-ups, individual components such as DAWs are still referred to as "the studio".{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=34}}

==Evolution of recording processes==
[[File:MFQ with Phil Spector.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phil Spector]] (center) at [[Gold Star Studios]], where he developed his [[Wall of Sound]] methods, 1965]]

Composers have been exploiting the potentials of [[multitrack recording]] since the technology was made available to them.{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=127}} Before the late 1940s, musical recordings were typically created with the idea of presenting a faithful rendition of a real-life performance.{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=128}} Writing in 1937, the American composer [[John Cage]] called for the development of "centers of experimental music" places where "the new materials, oscillators, turntables, generators, means for amplifying small sounds, film phonographs, etc." would allow composers to "work using twentieth-century means for making music."&lt;ref&gt;Cage, J.(2004),'The Future of Music Credo,'in Cox, Christoph; Warner, Daniel. Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music. A&amp;C Black. {{ISBN|978-0-8264-1615-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, electronic equipment was expensive to own, and for most people, was only accessible through large organizations or institutions. However, virtually every young composer was interested in the potential of tape-based recording.&lt;ref name="HolmesHolmes2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Thomas B.|last2=Holmes|first2=Thom|title=Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILkquoGXEq0C|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93644-6|pages=81–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Brian Eno]], "the move to tape was very important", because unlike [[gramophone records]], tape was "malleable and mutable and cuttable and reversible in ways that discs aren't. It's very hard to do anything interesting with a disc".{{sfn|Eno|2004|p=128}} In the mid 1950s, popular recording conventions changed profoundly with the advent of three-track tape,{{sfn|Eno|2004|pp=128–129}} and by the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with [[musical form]], [[orchestration]], [[reverberation|unnatural reverb]], and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] and [[Joe Meek]]'s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like [[the Tornados]].{{sfn|Blake|2009|p=45}}

In-studio composition became standard practice by the late 1960s and early 1970s, and remained so into the 2010s. During the 1970s, the "studio as instrument" concept shifted from the studio's recording space to the studio's control room, where electronic instruments could be plugged directly into the mixing console.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} As of the 2010s, the "studio as instrument" idea remains ubiquitous in genres such as [[pop music|pop]], [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]], and electronic music.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of The Studio As An Instrument: Part 1 - Early Reflections|url=https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/studio-as-an-instrument-part-1/|website=Ableton.com|date=October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable artists and works==
===1940s–1950s===
* Pioneers from the 1940s include [[Bill Putnam]], [[Les Paul]], and [[Tom Dowd]], who each contributed to the development of common recording practices like reverb, [[Delay (audio effect)|tape delay]], and [[overdubbing]]. Putnam was one of the first to recognize echo and reverb as elements to enhance a recording, rather than as natural byproducts of the recording space. He engineered [[the Harmonicats]]' 1947 novelty song "[[Peg o' My Heart]]", which was a significant chart hit and became the first popular recording to use artificial reverb for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt; Although Les Paul was not the first to use overdubs, he popularized the technique in the 1950s.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=12, 39}}

* Around the same time, French composers [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Henry]] were developing ''[[musique concrete]]'', a method of composition in which pieces of tape are rearranged and spliced together, and thus originated [[sampling (music)|sampling]]. Meanwhile in England, [[Daphne Oram]] experimented heavily with [[electronic instrument]]s during her tenure as a balancing engineer for the [[BBC]], however, her tape experiments were mostly unheard at the time.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;

* English producer Joe Meek is considered one of the most influential engineers of all time,{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} being one of the first to exploit the use of recording studios as instruments, and one of the first producers to assert an [[auteur|individual identity as an artist]].&lt;ref name="tmtpat2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patrick|first1=Jonathan|title=Joe Meek's pop masterpiece ''I Hear a New World'' gets the chance to haunt a whole new generation of audiophile geeks|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/joe-meeks-pop-masterpiece-i-hear-a-new-world-gets-the-chance-to-haunt-a-whole-new-generation-of|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He got his start in 1955 at IBC Studio in London. One of Meek's signature techniques was to overload a signal with [[dynamic range compression]], which was unorthodox at the time. Several of his "radical" techniques (such as close-miking instruments) later became part of normal recording practice.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|His employers often antagonized him over his methods, and to escape this, he developed a home studio in 1960.&lt;ref name="Ableton1"/&gt;}}

* Discussing [[Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller]], Adam Bell describes the songwriting duo's productions for [[the Coasters]] as "an excellent example of their pioneering practices in the emerging field of production", citing an account from Stoller in which he recalls "cutting esses off words, sticking the tape back together so you didn't notice. And sometimes if the first refrain on a take was good and the second one lousy, we'd tape another recording of the first one and stick it in place of the second one."{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=39}}

* Phil Spector, sometimes regarded as Joe Meek's American counterpart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gritten|first1=David|title=Joe Meek and the tragic demise of the maverick who revolutionised British pop|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/joe-meek-and-the-tragic-demise-of-the-maverick-who-revolutionise/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also considered "important as the first star producer of popular music and its first 'auteur' ... Spector changed pop music from a performing art ... to an art which could sometimes exist only in the recording studio".{{sfn|Bannister|2007|p=38}} His original production formula (dubbed the "Wall of Sound") called for large ensembles (including some instruments not generally used for ensemble playing, such as [[electric guitar|electric]] and [[acoustic guitars]]), with multiple instruments doubling and even tripling many of the parts to create a fuller, richer sound.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=77}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, Spector would often duplicate a part played by an [[acoustic piano]] with an [[electric piano]] and a [[harpsichord]].{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} Session guitarist [[Barney Kessel]] notes: "Musically, it was terribly simple, but the way he recorded and miked it, they’d diffuse it so that you couldn't pick out any one instrument. Techniques like distortion and echo were not new, but Phil came along and took these to make sounds that had not been used in the past. I thought it was ingenious."{{sfn|Ribowsky|1989|pp=185-186}} }} It evolved from his mid-1950s work with Leiber and Stoller during the period in which they sought a fuller sound through excessive instrumentation.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}}{{refn|group=nb|Leiber and Stoller considered Spector's methods to be very distinct from what they were doing, stating: "Phil was the first one to use multiple [[drum kit]]s, three pianos and so on. We went for much more clarity in terms of instrumental colors, and he deliberately blended everything into a kind of mulch. He definitely had a different point of view."{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=10}}}} His 1963 production of "[[Be My Baby]]", according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, was a "[[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta stone]] for studio pioneers such as [[the Beatles]] and [[Brian Wilson]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|publisher=RollingStone.com|accessdate=2007-06-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516110704/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/11028260/the_rs_500_greatest_songs_of_all_time/1|archivedate=16 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|thumb|right|Martin working with the Beatles, 1964]]

* The Beatles' producer [[George Martin]] and [[the Beach Boys]]' producer-songwriter Brian Wilson are generally credited with helping to popularize the idea of the studio as an instrument used for in-studio composition, and music producers after the mid 1960s increasingly drew from their work.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}}{{refn|group=nb|Academic [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] writes that the advancing technology of multitrack recording and [[mixing board]]s were more influential to [[experimental rock]] than [[electronic instruments]] such as the [[synthesizer]], allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non-[[classically trained]] musicians to create extended and complex compositions.{{sfn|Martin|2015|p=75}}}} Although Martin was nominally the Beatles' producer, from 1964 he ceded control to the band, allowing them to use the studio as a workshop for their ideas and later as a sound laboratory.{{sfn|Millard|2012|pp=178–79}} Musicologist Olivier Julien writes that the Beatles' "gradual integration of arranging and recording into one and the same process" began as early as 1963, but developed in earnest during the sessions for ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965) and ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and "ultimately blossomed" during the sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Julien|2008|p=162}} Wilson, who was mentored by Spector,{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}} was another early auteur of popular music.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=890}} Authors Jim Cogan and William Clark credit him as the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument.{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|pp=32–33}}

|description  = Author Mark Brend writes that, with ''Revolver'', the Beatles advanced on Meek's approach, and employed the studio as "an environment for wide-ranging sonic research" that included experimentation with [[tape loop]]s, reversed and speed-manipulated tape sounds, and backwards-recorded lead guitar parts.{{sfn|Brend|2005|pp=55–56}} 
}}

: According to author David Howard, Martin's work on the Beatles' "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]", from  ''Revolver'', and Spector's production  of "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]" from the same year were the two recordings that ensured that the studio "was now its own instrument".{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=2–3}} Citing composer and producer [[Virgil Moorefield]]'s book ''The Producer as Composer'', author Jay Hodgson highlights ''Revolver'' as representing a "dramatic turning point" in recording history through its dedication to studio exploration over the "performability" of the songs, as this and subsequent Beatles albums reshaped listeners' preconceptions of a pop recording.{{sfn|Hodgson|2010|pp=viii–ix}} According to Julien, the follow-up LP ''Sgt. Pepper'' represents the "epitome of the transformation of the recording studio into a compositional tool", marking the moment when "popular music entered the era of phonographic composition."{{sfn|Julien|2008|pp=166–167}} Composer and musicologist [[Michael Hannan (composer)|Michael Hannan]] attributes the album's impact to Martin and his engineers, in response to the Beatles' demands, making increasingly creative use of studio equipment and originating new processes.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=46}}

: Like ''Revolver'', "[[Good Vibrations]]", which Wilson produced for the Beach Boys in 1966, was a prime proponent in revolutionizing rock from live concert performances into studio productions that could only exist on record.{{sfn|Ashby|2004|p=282}} For the first time, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or "modules") rather than a complete song. Through the method of [[tape splicing]], each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence – as Wilson explored on subsequent recordings from this period – allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time.&lt;ref name="ARP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heiser|first1=Marshall|title=SMiLE: Brian Wilson’s Musical Mosaic|journal=The Journal on the Art of Record Production|date=November 2012|issue=7|url=http://arpjournal.com/smile-brian-wilson%E2%80%99s-musical-mosaic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Academic Marshall Heiser saw the resultant style of jumpcuts as a "striking characteristic", and that they "must be acknowledged as compositional statements in themselves, giving the music a sonic signature every bit as noticeable as the performances themselves. There was no way this music could be 'real.' Wilson was therefore echoing the techniques of ''musique concrète'' and seemed to be breaking the audio '[[fourth wall]]'—if there can said to be such a thing."&lt;ref name="ARP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heiser|first1=Marshall|title=SMiLE: Brian Wilson’s Musical Mosaic|journal=The Journal on the Art of Record Production|date=November 2012|issue=7|url=http://arpjournal.com/smile-brian-wilson%E2%80%99s-musical-mosaic/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Musicologist [[Charlie Gillett]] called "Good Vibrations" "one of the first records to flaunt studio production as a quality in its own right, rather than as a means of presenting a performance",{{sfn|Gillett|1984|p=329}} while rock critic [[Gene Sculatti]] called it the "ultimate in-studio production trip", adding that its influence was apparent in songs such as "[[A Day in the Life]]" from ''Sgt.

===1970s–2010s===
[[File:Brian Eno live remix at Punkt 2012 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Brian Eno]] at a live remix in 2012]]

* Adam Bell credits [[Brian Eno]] with popularizing the concept of the studio as instrument, particularly that it "did not require previous experience, and in some ways, a lack of know-how might even be advantageous to creativity", and that "such an approach was typified" by [[Kraftwerk]], whose members proclaimed "we play the studio".{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} He goes on to say:

: {{quote|While those of the ilk of Brian Wilson used the studio as an instrument by orchestrating everyone that worked within it, the turn to technology in the cases of [[Sly Stone]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and Brian Eno signify a conceptual shift in which an alternative approach that might make using the studio as an instrument cheaper, easier, more convenient, or more creative, was increasingly sought after. Compared to the 1960s, using the studio as an instrument became less about working ''the system'' as it were, and working the ''systems''.{{sfn|Bell|2018|p=49}} }}

* Jamaican producer [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] is noted for his 70s [[reggae]] and [[Dub music|dub]] productions, recorded at his [[Black Ark Studios|Black Ark]] studio.{{sfn|Toop|2018|p=115}} [[David Toop]] commented that "at its heights, Perry's genius has transformed the recording studio" into "virtual space, an imaginary chamber over which presided the electronic wizard, evangelist, gossip columnist and Dr. Frankenstein that he became."{{sfn|Toop|2018|pp=114—115}}

* From the late 1970s onward, [[hip hop production]] has been strongly linked to the lineage and technique of earlier artists who used the studio as an instrument. Jazz critic [[Francis Davis]] identified early hip-hop [[Disc jockey|DJs]], including [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Grandmaster Flash]], as "grassroots successors to Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, and George Martin, the 1960s producers who pioneered the use of the recording studio as an instrument in its own right."{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=259}}

[[File:MBV 2008.jpg|thumb|[[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] performing in 2008]]

* Beginning in the 1980s, musicians associated with the genres [[dream pop]] and [[shoegazing]] made innovative use of [[effects pedal]]s and recording techniques to create ethereal, "dreamy" musical atmospheres.{{sfn|Edmondson|2013|p=1205}} The English-Irish shoegazing band [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], helmed by guitarist-producer [[Kevin Shields]], are often celebrated for their studio albums ''[[Isn't Anything]]'' (1988) and ''[[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]]'' (1991). Writing for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Paul Lester]] said Shields is "widely accepted as shoegazing's genius", with "his astonishing wall of sound, use of the studio as instrument and dazzling reinvention of the guitar making him a sort of hydra-headed Spector-[[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]-Eno figure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lester|first1=Paul|author-link=Paul Lester|title=Sonic Cathedral spark shoegazing music revival|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6066716.ece|website=[[The Times|Times Online]]|date=April 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919185133/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6066716.ece|archive-date=September 19, 2009|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computer science]], a [[formal language]] is called '''recursively enumerable''' (also '''recognizable''', '''partially decidable''', '''semidecidable''', '''Turing-acceptable''' or '''Turing-recognizable''') if it is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the language, i.e., if there exists a [[Turing machine]] which will enumerate all valid strings of the language.

Recursively enumerable languages are known as '''type-0''' languages in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of formal languages. All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free grammar|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

The class of all recursively enumerable languages is called '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]'''.

==Definitions==
There are three equivalent definitions of a recursively enumerable language:

# A recursively enumerable language is a [[recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]] [[subset]] in the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all possible words over the [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of the [[formal language|language]].
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a [[Turing machine]] (or other [[computable function]]) which will enumerate all valid strings of the language. Note that if the language is [[Infinity|infinite]], the enumerating algorithm provided can be chosen so that it avoids repetitions, since we can test whether the string produced for number ''n'' is "already" produced for a number which is less than ''n''. If it already is produced, use the output for input ''n+1'' instead (recursively), but again, test whether it is "new".
# A recursively enumerable language is a formal language for which there exists a Turing machine (or other computable function) that will halt and accept when presented with any [[literal string|string]] in the language as input but may either halt and reject or loop forever when presented with a string not in the language. Contrast this to [[recursive language]]s, which require that the Turing machine halts in all cases.

All [[regular language|regular]], [[context-free language|context-free]], [[context-sensitive language|context-sensitive]] and [[recursive language|recursive]] languages are recursively enumerable.

[[Post's theorem]] shows that '''[[RE (complexity)|RE]]''', together with its [[complement (complexity)|complement]] [[co-RE]], correspond to the first level of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

==Example==
The set of [[Halting Problem|halting turing machines]] is recursively enumerable but not recursive. Indeed one can run the Turing Machine and accept if the machine halts, hence it is recursively enumerable. On the other hand the problem is undecidable. 

Some other recursively enumerable languages that are not recursive include:

* [[Post correspondence problem]] 
* [[Mortality (computability theory)]]
* [[Entscheidungsproblem]]

==Closure properties==
Recursively enumerable languages (REL) are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the following operations. That is, if ''L'' and ''P'' are two recursively enumerable languages, then the following languages are recursively enumerable as well:

* the [[Kleene star]] &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt; of ''L''
* the [[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] &lt;math&gt;L \circ P&lt;/math&gt; of ''L'' and ''P''
* the [[Union (set theory)|union]] &lt;math&gt;L \cup P&lt;/math&gt;
* the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] &lt;math&gt;L \cap P&lt;/math&gt;.

Recursively enumerable languages are not closed under [[set difference]] or complementation. The set difference ''L&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;P'' may or may not be recursively enumerable.  If ''L'' is recursively enumerable, then the complement of ''L'' is recursively enumerable if and only if ''L'' is also recursive.

[[File:Writing on a grain of rice.jpg|thumb|A person writing on a grain of rice.]]
'''Rice writing''' is the art and skill of being able to write small enough to write on a grain of [[rice]].

==History==
Rice writing originated in Ancient [[Anatolia]] in Turkey and India. Many rituals and rites use rice as a medium, but at some point in ancient [[Anatolia]] artisans who were skilled in making miniature paintings decided to turn their skill to making art with what had always been an ancient symbol of prosperity, the oldest example of which lies in [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey. The artisans would inscribe messages or names on a single grain of rice after it was treated and polished. Grains that were long and flat were favorites as they offered proper surfaces for writing. Apart from Turkey, India also had a large number of  artisans skilled in making miniature art including rice art.

==Rice art Symbolism==
Rice art is considered to bring good luck hence some of its most popular forms is good luck pendants, hope bracelets and cell phone charms.

==Rice art and Rice jewelry today==
[[File:Grain of rice necklace-2.jpg|thumb|A necklace containing a grain of rice with the name "Filip" written on it.]]
Within time rice writing and rice art evolved, soon creating rice jewelry where the rice grain was enclosed in a vial with a liquid/oil that magnifies the individual grain making it easier to appreciate the painstaking and intricate details. This went further with rice jewelry like good luck pendants, charm bracelets, anklets and earrings. In modern times most of these artisans and artists set up shop with street side stalls where they can personally write your message or name on a rice grain while displaying their wares and hard work.

==Technique==
Most modern day rice writers use the following tools:  
#Common long grain white rice:  This rice is a flat cylinder shape.  Because it is flat it provides two wide surfaces for writing.
#Sharp utility knife:  This is used to scrape the rice slightly to remove ridges to provide a smooth surface for writing.  This scraping method can also be used to remove minor mistakes. 
#[[Clay]]:  Some people use a utility gripper clay and others use a modeling clay.  The clay is used to hold the rice in place while performing the writing.
#[[Technical pen]]:  This is a drawing pen with an ultra-fine tip.  Most pens used are either size .18 (4x0) or .13 (6x0).  These can be purchased online, or at some arts and crafts stores.
#Waterproof Ink: This ink is sold with the technical pen.

Once the rice writing is complete, it is usually preserved in a small vial of liquid/oil.  Many craftsman mount these vials into [[jewelery]] such as necklaces, bracelets and key chains.

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

'''Science North''' ({{lang-fr|Science Nord}}) is an interactive [[science museum]] in [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The science centre, which is [[Northern Ontario]]'s most popular tourist attraction, consists of two [[snowflake]]-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of [[Ramsey Lake]], just south of the city's downtown core, and a former [[ice hockey]] arena which includes the complex's entrance and an [[IMAX]] theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old [[geologic fault]]. This fault line was not known to be under the complex during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern [[auditorium]] is frequently used for temporary exhibits, [[press conference]]s, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community.

Inside the main building, a 20-metre [[fin whale]] skeleton recovered from [[Anticosti Island]] hangs from the ceiling.

The complex also features a boat tour, the ''William Ramsey'', which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. The [[Jim Gordon (politician)|Jim Gordon]] [[Boardwalk]] also extends from the facility to the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]] along the western shore of the lake.

The facility was designed by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]], one of the founding partners of Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects, based in Toronto.

An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]].

==Facilities==

===First level===

* '''IMAX With Laser''' - Science North has a 3D [[IMAX with Laser]] theatre. The theatre opened in 1994, and was converted to 3D in February 2009.
* '''Planetarium''' - In June 2009 Science North added a planetarium. It has an 8-metre dome and 36 seats.
* '''Vale Cavern''' - Wildfires! A Firefighting Adventure in 3D
* '''TD Canada Trust Toddler's Treehouse''' - a children's educational play area

===Second level===

* '''[[Nature Exchange]]''' - visitors collect and research natural items from the wild and are swapped for points in a database. The points can be used to "purchase" other natural artifacts from around the world (i.e.: Rocks, sea shells, fossils, etc.)
* '''Lapidary Lab''' - Visitors learn how to cut, grind and polish rocks to turn them from ordinary stones into works of art.
* '''F. Jean MacLeod Butterfly Gallery''' - A glass-enclosed [[butterfly house]] home to more than 400 butterflies from 30 different tropical species.

===Third level===

The exhibits on the third floor are divided into four main areas:
* '''Northern Forests''' - This area focuses on animals who live in northern forests. Some of the animals ambassadors for the Northern Forest include Drifter and Kashkuanashku (Kash) the beavers, Maple the porcupine and Saunders the skunk. Other notable animals include the Northern Flying Squirrels, the Grey Rat Snake and the Big Brown bats. One of the biggest improvements to the third floor include a nocturnal room, allowing people to see active nocturnal animals during the day  and better equipment habitats for the animals and for visitors. Also, there is an intricate [[bee]] hive, behind a plate glass window, which allows visitors to see into the hive. 

* '''Lakes and Rivers''' - In this area, animals that live in rivers and lakes are featured. The animals ambassadors on this floor include Kash the Beaver, the Common Snapping Turtle, the Northern Water Snakes and local fish found in Northern Ontario Lakes. This sections allow people to get a better understanding of the aquatics systems that surround Northern Ontario and the difficulties and challenges these systems are currently facing. As well, the stream table (also known as the sand table) shows people what is erosion and how erosion can shape the landscape around us.
* '''Wetlands'''  - The wetlands area teaches about the complex wetlands ecosystems. With Lilly creek situated right beside Science North, people are able to go on Lilly Creek tours (weather permitting) and get a personal look of what makes wetland such an important landmass for our ecosystems. Some of the animal ambassadors include Northern Ontario frogs (including Green Frogs, Wood Frogs, Tree Frogs and Bullfrogs), American Toads, The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the [[painted turtle]]. This section also houses the SO2 monitor, which measures the sulphur dioxide levels in Sudbury. There is also an interactive computer that displays the current reading of other sulphur dioxide monitors located throughout the Greater Sudbury region.
* '''Discovery Theatre''' - The discovery theatre is located in the centre of the third and fourth levels of Science North. Here, live science shows cover topics ranging from fire to sound. A daily schedule, located in front of the theatre and on the LCD screens around the Science Centre, is kept up to date and people can schedule their day around the shows they want to see. Usually, upbeat music will be played two minutes before the show starts to allow people to know the show is about to begin. Wheelchair accessibly is offered on the first, and third level of the discovery theater.
* '''The Northern Garden''' - The Northern Garden is located outside of the science centre. This gives people the opportunity to learn about native plant species in Northern Ontario, plant growth and general garden maintenance.

===Fourth level===
* '''BodyZone''' - BodyZone teaches about DNA and how it makes people unique, and how bodies work. There are also many exhibits allowing visitors to measure their performance, such as the race track. The Club Genome object theatre entrance is also in BodyZone.
* '''Racetrack''' - Build a race car and run it on the figure 8 track. This area also features a [[K'Nex]] table, a [[Lego]] play area, and the ball wall.
* '''[[FedNor]] CyberZone''' - The focus of CyberZone is on computer and communications technology. Visitors can mix music at the DJ station, play with green screen technology, and create stop-motion animation movies.
* '''Space Place''' - This lab focuses on astronomy and space exploration. Exhibits include a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} gravity well, a microgravity drop tower, exhibits on [[SNOLAB]], and information on Canadian space exploration. The entrance to the "Between the Stars" object theatre is also found in Space Place. This show explores the topic of dark matter - why we know it exists, and how we are trying to detect it. Between the Stars opened in June 2010 and is designed to appeal to all age ranges with a cartoon character named String Man narrating the story of a topic that is quite complex.
*''' TechLab''' - Technology and engineering area where visitors can create circuits, take apart old electronics, and play with pulleys and gears.

===Object theatres===

Special film and video exhibits which change over time; current exhibits include
* '''The [[Global warming]] Changing Climate Show''' -- narrated by [[Rick Mercer]] and talks about the change in climate. This show was updated and reopened in March 2011.
* '''Club Genome''' -- talks about DNA
* '''Legends of the Great Lakes''' -- This 16-minute show focuses on the bald eagle, the sturgeon, and the woodland caribou. The information is presented as a story that a father tells his daughter before they go to sleep while camping on the shores of Lake Superior.
* '''Between the Stars''' -- This show is on the science of dark matter. It lasts 16 minutes and features holographic technology, creating a 3-D effect. The main themes on the show are an exploration of the evidence for dark matter, what it might be, and how scientists are trying to detect it at [[SNOLAB]].
* ''' Ready, Set, Move!''' -- This fully immersive, active and interactive theatre will take you on a journey into the world of healthy living. Movement-sensing technology allows your own activity to contribute to the story. You will jump, dodge, twist and play throughout the show, your actions helping our heroine Anna and her quest to save her family from an ominous, dark fog.


===Outdoor grounds===

* '''Polaris Boulevard''' - is a line which reaches from a large sundial right up the side of the building which points directly at Polaris (the north star).
* '''Terra''' - Visited stand on this one-millionth scale world model, outdoors near Science North’s main entrance. At sunset and sunrise, the Earth's shadow moves across Canada. The benchmark at the centre of Terra is:  46° 28' 12.00" N and 80° 59' 45.70" W.
*''' a sculpture''' honouring local [[bush plane]] pilot [[Rusty Blakey]].
* '''Lily Creek''' - a marsh located opposite to the centre, Lily Creek is home to many species of creatures.

Terms such as '''separate spheres''' and '''domestic–public dichotomy''' refer to a [[social phenomenon]], within [[modern society|modern societies]] that feature, to some degree, an [[empirical]] separation between a [[private sphere|domestic or private sphere]] and a [[Public sphere|public or social sphere]]. This observation may be  controversial, and is often also seen as supporting [[Patriarchy|patriarchal ideologies]] that seek to ''create or strengthen'', any such separation between spheres, and to confine women to the domestic/private sphere.

The patriarchal ideology of separate spheres, based primarily on notions of [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|biologically determined gender roles]]  and/or patriarchal religious doctrine, claims that women should avoid the public sphere &amp;ndash; the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and law. Women's "proper sphere", according to the ideology, is the realm of domestic life, focused on childcare, housekeeping, and religion.&lt;ref name="kuersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ryle |first1= Robyn |title= Questioning gender: a sociological exploration |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CHHz_p-j9hMC&amp;pg=PA342 |edition= |year= 2012 |publisher= SAGE/Pine Forge Press |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-6594-1 |pages= 342&amp;ndash;43|chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observable phenomena, however, the existence of separate spheres is much older.

==History==
The idea that women should inhabit a separate domestic sphere has been extant in [[Western thought]] for centuries, extending as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery | last2= |first2= |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

The modern ideology of separate spheres emerged in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory|last1=Wells|first1=Christopher|publisher=[[Routledge]]|others=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99802-4|editor1-last=Kowaleski-Wallace|editor1-first=Elizabeth|editor1-link=|location=London, New York|page=519|language=|chapter=Separate Spheres|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=blI0_52wIwYC&amp;pg=PA519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the industrialization of the Western world, family members worked side by side and the workplace was located mostly in and around the home. With the shift from home-based to factory production, men left the home to sell their labor for wages while women stayed home to perform unpaid domestic work. The separate spheres ideology reflected and fueled these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise encyclopedia of sociology|last1=Adams|first1=Michele|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|editor1-last=Ritzer|editor1-first=George|editor1-link=|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.; Malden, MA|pages=156&amp;ndash;57|chapter=Divisions of household labor|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=J.

Feminist writers like Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lucy Stone demanded political equality for women as well as men and provided searing criticisms of the "separate sphere" ideals that confined women exclusively to the domestic sphere. Theorists such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] have argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the [[means of production]] and consequently became a private, separate sphere. As a result, Engels contended, women were excluded from participating directly in the production process and relegated to the subordinate domestic sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to 19th-Century America|last1=Edwards|first1=Laura F.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|others=|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-20985-0|editor1-last=Barney|editor1-first=William L.|editor1-link=|location=Malden, MA|pages=225&amp;ndash;226|chapter=Gender and the Changing Roles of Women|editor2-last=|editor2-first=|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=elgGfYla0hwC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major commentator on the modern idea of "separate spheres" was the French political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="kerber1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kerber |first1= Linda K. | authorlink1 = Linda K.

[[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any "intrinsic" predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [[Cult of Domesticity|"Cult of True Womanhood"]], an ideal of [[femininity]] prevalent among the [[Upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es in the 19th century. "True women" were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Welter |first1= Barbara |authorlink1=  |last2=  |first2=  |year= 1966 |title= The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820–1860 |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–174 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi= 10.2307/2711179 |url= https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |accessdate=  |jstor= 2711179 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113000/https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |archivedate= 2011-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of the separate spheres ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt;

In [[Woman, Culture, and Society]] (1974), [[Michelle Rosaldo]] emphasizes the idea that these separate spheres can be explained in terms of a dichotomy, in the sense that these gender-oriented domains are viewed as so totally separate that it only reinforces the ideology of gender separation and inequality. Activities given to men, versus those assigned to women, were seen as having more value and contributing greatly to the society. Adversely, the woman's so-called simpler roles of housework and childrearing were held at a much lesser value. Rosaldo argues a "universal asymmetry" between the sexes that primarily caused these separations to arise. This model mainly focuses on the generational subordination of women in relation to men throughout history and across different cultures, defining the domestic and public spheres in very black and white terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:00972854|title=Woman, culture, and society|last=Rosaldo|first=Michelle Zimbalist|last2=Lamphere|first2=Louise|last3=Bamberger|first3=Joan|date=1974|isbn=0804708509|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier model, however, has since been challenged by researchers in the field, claiming the spheres cannot be outlined in such simplistic terms. Woman, Culture, and Society&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gender-in-cross-cultural-perspective/oclc/951536398?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F|date=2016|isbn=9780205247288|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-editor Louis Lamphere breaks down Rosaldo's model and discusses the spheres in different terms. Lamphere primarily dispels the concept of "universal asymmetry", looking toward various societies worldwide for proof. Even in some Middle Eastern cultures that place women in extreme positions of subordination, the model could not be so easily applied. This is because the domestic and public spheres are almost always overlapping in some way, regardless of a cultural female subservience or even egalitarianism. Women enter public spaces in order to fulfill certain duties that fall within their domestic responsibilities. Men must return to the private, or domestic, space eventually to bring home the spoils of his labor in the public sphere. In this sense, there are two separate spheres created and enforced by gender ideologies; but they are not dichotomous. They, instead, form an integrated system of life in society, varying only in levels of intensities from culture to culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to Cary Franklin, the women’s rights movements in the mid-1960s proposed that to achieve true equality between the sexes, it is necessary for the laws to be put in place to move past the simple separate spheres model and address the “interspherical impacts”. In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) pushed for equality of women in society and in the workplace and in order to attain this equality, there would have to be changes in family regulation. NOW stressed the importance of focusing on structurally altering the family sphere in order to then create gender equality in the education and workplace spheres. The family sphere is acting as a catalyst seeing that without a change in it, women would simply lack access to the opportunities that men already have available to them. Franklin also pointed out that the gender inequality among the American population in the 60’s and 70’s was a major contributor to the civil rights statutes of the Second Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/global/article/GALE%7CA376853033/165d132476e2721e8ea83c8ef676695a?u=txshracd2548|title=Redirect Page|website=bi.galegroup.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotman|first=DeborahL.|date=2006|title=Separate Spheres?: Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity|jstor=506286|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=666–674|doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Rotman, an anthropologist at Notre Dame, analyzed this concept of separate spheres specifically among the people of Deerfield, Massachusetts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In this community, there was a clear divide between men and women by means of a “proper allocation” in which females were given the domestic residence or sphere and the men were given the “economically productive agricultural land”. Men would migrate away from the women if agriculture was depleting in their given agricultural space. As the men were moving to work outside the home, women began to acclimate to the economic atmosphere and gain more opportunities in the public sphere with all the men working elsewhere. These women soon had various roles in the public and private spheres in Deerfield. As equal rights began to become part of the ideological framework in Deerfield, women found themselves voting in school boards, working on municipal water projects and working in fundraisers as men had done before them. Despite the traditional understanding of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of completely separate public and private spheres, the Deerfield community challenged these “dichotomies of domesticity” and paved the way for equal rights for men and women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Biological determinism===
The separation between female and male spheres was heavily influenced by [[biological determinism]],&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Roy |first1= Anupama |title= Gendered citizenship: historical and conceptual explorations |chapter = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko4sVA2JRJUC&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orient Longman]] |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-250-2797-3| page= 80&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grana |first1= Sheryl J. |title= Women and justice |chapter = 'Nature' and Biology | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5IKdJLjtbtoC&amp;pg=PA20 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-7002-3| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion that women and men are naturally suitable for different social roles due to their biological and genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= Jodi |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of gender and society |volume= 2 | year= 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= Los Angeles |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 586, 602&amp;ndash;603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of biological determinism was popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and among such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argued that women were inherently different from men and should devote themselves to [[reproduction]] and domesticity.&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt; Women were considered passive, dependent on men, and, due to their reproductive capacity, ill-suited for life outside the domestic realm.&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Adams |first1= Michele | last2 = Coltrane | first2 = Scott | editor1-first= Michael S. |editor1-last= Kimmel |editor1-link= Michael Kimmel |editor2-first= Jeff | editor2-last= Hearn | editor3-last = Connell | editor3-first = Raewyn |title= Handbook of studies on men and masculinities |chapter = The Cultural Ideal of Separate Spheres| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UvAZD45BMDoC&amp;pg=PA231 |year= 2005 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London |isbn= 978-0-7619-2369-5| pages= 231&amp;ndash;32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau described women's primary duties in ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', stating that "women's entire education should be planned in relation to men. To please men, to be useful to them, to win their love and respect, to raise them as children, to care for them as adults, correct and console them, make their lives sweet and pleasant; these are women's duties in all ages and these are what they should be taught from childhood."&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt;

The popular beliefs about inherent sex differences remained deeply embedded in popular consciousness throughout the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beyond separate spheres: intellectual roots of modern feminism |last= Rosenberg |first= Rosalind |authorlink= Rosalind Rosenberg |coauthors= |year= 1982 |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |location= New Haven |isbn= 978-0-300-02695-5 |pages= 114, 207, 245&amp;ndash;46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DpZ0Yzs_Cj8C&amp;pg=PA114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, however, [[dissident]] [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and other [[Social science|social scientists]] began to challenge the biological determination of human behavior, revealing great similarities between men and women and suggesting that many sex differences were socially constructed.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt; Despite these new insights and social and economic changes such as women's entry into the labor force, the separate spheres ideology did not disappear.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt;

Women's confinement to the private sphere was reinforced by cultural and legal arrangements, such as the lack of [[women's suffrage]], legal prohibitions against women undertaking professions like medicine and law, and discouragement from obtaining higher education.&lt;ref name="kuersten"&gt;{{cite book | title= Women and the law: leaders, cases, and documents |chapter = Separate Spheres Doctrine |last= Kuersten |first= Ashlyn K. |authorlink=  |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |location= Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn= 978-0-87436-878-9 |pages= 16&amp;ndash;17 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=AnKGWlZG_ncC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
In her paper "Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions", Cathy Ross suggests that the separate spheres ideology had ambiguous effects on women's lives.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt; She argues that while it "was clear that women were supposed to be subordinate and that home and children were their sphere", the separation of spheres enabled women "to reach out to other women in sisterhood, in solidarity, on the common ground of domesticity".&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

The ideology of separate spheres contributed to resistance to [[coeducation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]|location=New York|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the emergence of gendered educational institutions such as the [[female seminary]] and [[women's college]] in [[higher education]], and the [[woman's club]] in [[continuing education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's club movement|first=Christine|last=Woyshner|page=477|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[teaching]] as a woman's profession was also closely linked to the ideology of separate spheres, as women came to be regarded as uniquely skilled at [[classroom management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|pages=48, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coeducational universities in the late 19th century, the separation of spheres contributed to the emergence of [[home economics]] as a field of advanced study for the woman's sphere,&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; and the [[dean of women]] as frequently the only high-ranking woman administrator in coeducational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=How Deans of Women Became Men | first=Robert Arthur  | last=Schwartz | journal=[[The Review of Higher Education]] | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=1997 | doi=10.1353/rhe.1997.0011 | page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it created a space for women's academic and professional advancement, the separation of spheres also provided an excuse for keeping women out of fields not specifically marked as female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Tolley | first= Kim | title= The Science Education of American Girls | year= 2003 | isbn=978-0-415-93472-5 | publisher= RoutledgeFalmer |location= New York| page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many talented woman scientists were pushed into professorships in home economics rather than in their principal fields.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Melissa|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8|chapter=Home Economics|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women educators resisted this typecasting even while working within the framework of separation. [[Frances Shimer]], founder of [[Shimer College]], which was a woman's school from 1866 to 1950, insisted that she was "in favor of the co-education of the sexes" and that the education at her school was equal to what was given to young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='My whole ambition has ever been to do something smart': Frances Wood Shimer, Cinderella Gregory, and the 1853 Founding of Shimer College|first=Doris |last=Malkmus|journal=Journal of Illinois History|volume=6|issue=3|pages=212&amp;ndash;213|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Commentary ==
A recent study by Jacqueline Henke explores the history of the separate spheres model in America. Henke points out that between 1820 and 1860 (a period sometimes called the dawn of separate spheres) three parenting models were common for two-parent, mother/father families:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Parenting duties are wholly the responsibility of mothers
&lt;br&gt;
2. Parenting duties are separated into fatherly responsibilities and motherly responsibilities
&lt;br&gt;
3. Parenting duties are shared equally among mothers and fathers.
&lt;br&gt;
According to Henke, many parenting books from this era suggested that mothers should take primary responsibility for their children. Yet, some parenting books argued that mothers and fathers should have separate childrearing duties or a completely equal distribution of childrearing responsibilities. Henke argues that, even during the height of domestic ideology and the dawn of separate spheres, parenting advice was not monolithic. Furthermore, the lived realities parents and families during this era were more diverse than the ideals of parenting books.

The '''serfdom in Tibet controversy''' rests on [[China|Chinese]] claims of [[moral authority]] for governing [[Tibet]], portraying Tibet as a "feudal serfdom" and a "hell on earth" prior to its [[Invasion of Tibet (1950)|invasion in 1950]].&lt;ref name="Powers 122"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Claims of [[unfree labour]] practices have been a recurrent theme, covering periods both before and after the Chinese takeover. Supporters of the Chinese position highlight statements by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that, prior to 1959, 95% of Tibetans lived in "feudal serfdom",&lt;ref name="white" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/features/Tibetpaper/tb1.html|title=White Paper on Tibet's March Forward|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cite cases of abuse and cruelty in the traditional Tibetan system.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199756"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Western responses have tended to attempt to discredit the Chinese claims as part of an effort to discredit the takeover of Tibet.

== The idea of Tibet and the concept of serfdom ==

One of the central points of contention in the debate about labour and human rights in the historical region of Tibet before and after its incorporation into the modern state of the People's Republic of China is the very definition of Tibet and serfdom itself, with some scholars claiming that the debate is framed around [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric]] and [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] ideas about statehood and society which are projected onto the history of the area in a way that distorts understanding. Some western scholars reject claims of "serfdom in Tibet" outright based on the view that "Tibet" cannot be defined as one political entity or [[social system]]; its political and [[socioeconomic]] structures have varied greatly over time and between sub-districts. The various polities comprising Tibet have changed significantly over the past 2,000 years, and even during the modern period there have been dramatic changes in what Tibet is, as anthropologist Geoff Childs writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Tibet] has undergone numerous political transformations from a unified empire (640–842) incorporating parts of what are now Nepal, India, Pakistan, and several provinces of China (Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan), to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (842–1248), to protectorate under the power of an expanding Mongol empire (1248–1368), back to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (1368–1642), to a centralized state under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1642–1720), to a protectorate of the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1720–1911), and finally to a nation having de facto independence under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1911–1951)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Geoff|date=2003|title=Polyandry and population growth in a historical Tibetan society|url=http://case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/childs.polyandry.and.population.growth.pdf|journal=The History of the Family|volume=8|pages=423–444|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although  the central leadership in [[Lhasa]] had authority of these areas for various periods, some Western writers claim that this did not imply the kind of political control of modern Western states. According to [[Luciano Petech]], "K'ams [the [[Kham]] region, largely synonymous with the province of XIkang which was abolished in 1950] was practically independent of Lhasa under its great lamas"  in the 18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Petech 5198"&gt;Petech 1973, pp. 51, 98&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the areas of [[Qinghai]] with large Tibetan populations were not continuously ruled by Lhasa, including in the period leading up to the establishment of the PRC (in the late 1930s and 1940s) when the [[Kuomintang]] Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled Qinghai within the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+son&amp;q=genocidal#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20chairmen%20lords%20and%20slaves&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=54|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[definitions of Tibet|definition of Tibet]] has been contested with a map of competing claims identifying six distinct types of Tibetan regions claimed by various entities. In the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912) and in the ROC (1912-1949), the part of Tibet governed by Lhasa was limited to the modern [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], and did not include the Kham ([[Xikang Province|Xikang) Province]] of China. Meanwhile, the western part of Xikang (i.e. [[Qamdo, Tibet|Qamdo]]) and [[Qinghai]] was only occupied by Lhasa in the Tibet-Kham War which lasted from the 1910s to 1930s.

Generally, the government of the PRC also limits Tibet to the area it has designated the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], consisting of the traditional areas of Ü, Tsang, [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]], along with Qamdo (i.e. the western Kham/Xikang) which was legally incorporated into the TAR when Xikang Province was abolished by the [[National People's Congress|NPC]] in 1955. The Tibetan government in exile claims that other ethnically Tibetan areas to the east and to the north also belong to Tibet, i.e. "[[Greater Tibet]]". These areas now respectively belong to Qinghai Province, [[Gansu Province]], [[Sichuan Province]] and [[Yunnan Province]] of China.&lt;ref name="Powers 163"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhanghao"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Zhang |first1=Hao (张皓) |script-title=zh:1931年中国内部各方关于康藏冲突的协商 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|西北民族大学学报(哲学社会科学版)}}' ([[Northwest University for Nationalities]] university paper |year=2015 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaobin (王小彬) |script-title=zh:“中华人民共和国昌都地区人民解放委员会”隶属关系的历史沿革 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|中国藏学}}'' [China Tibetology] |year=2010 |issue=3 |page=41&amp;ndash;47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholarship frequently represents a limited survey, restricted to the central region of Tibet, and may not accurately represent the whole of cultural Tibet or all Tibetan speaking peoples.

Discussing the [[Social classes of Tibet|social structure of Tibet]] inevitably leads to difficulties with defining terms. Not only may [[serf]] and [[feudalism]] be Western terms inappropriate for Asian use but the geography and peoples of Tibet vary according to interpreter. The lack of agreement of the various sides as to terminology highlights that the "serfdom in Tibet" controversy is a politicised debate, with the term "feudal serfdom" largely being used by the People's Republic of China as a justification for their taking control of Tibet. According to the PRC:&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was a historically imperative need for the progress of Tibetan society and the welfare of the Tibetan people to expel the imperialists and shake off the yoke of feudal serfdom. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring about Tibet's peaceful liberation. After that, important policies and measures were adopted for Tibet's Democratic Reform, regional autonomy, large-scale modernization and reform and opening-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|title=Tibet's March Toward Modernization|year=2001|publisher=People's Republic of China|accessdate=2008-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222305/http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the Tibetan government in exile responds: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Chinese justifications make no sense. First of all, international law does not accept justifications of this type. No country is allowed to invade, occupy, annex and colonize another country just because its social structure does not please it. Secondly, the PRC is responsible for bringing more suffering in the name of liberation. Thirdly, necessary reforms were initiated and Tibetans are quite capable of doing so.&lt;ref name="tibet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html|title=Traditional society and democratic framework for future Tibet  |year=1996|publisher=Tibetan Government-in-Exile|accessdate=2008-07-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410151700/http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Competing versions of Tibetan history==
It is difficult to find academic consensus on the nature of society in Tibetan history. Sources on the [[history of Tibet]] are available from both pro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan writers.

Pro-Chinese materials may be published by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China. Tibetan materials, similarly, may be published by mainstream Western printers, or by the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]]. Both sides hope to persuade foreign readers to support their own point of view through these publications.&lt;ref name="Powers6 7"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the pro-Chinese works in English on the subject were translated from Chinese. Translators are not named, but censors are.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Asian studies scholar John Powers concludes that ideology was the most powerful influence on the translations: "In contemporary China, the Communist Party strictly controls the presentation of history, and several formal resolutions have been issued by the Central Committee, which are intended to guide historians in the "correct" interpretation of historical events and actors." &lt;ref name="Powers 12"&gt;Powers 2004, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The writings of contemporary Chinese historians conform to [[Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine, which asserts that societies progress from primitive communism, to slave societies, which are then overthrown and replaced by feudalism, which are in their turn overthrown and replaced by capitalism, which is followed - via rebellion, again - by socialism, which may progress peacefully toward communism. Several Chinese sources insert peasant rebellions into their accounts of Tibetan history, to achieve conformity with this structure required by political [[dogma]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Historians in China are prevented from performing research that could challenge orthodoxy. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Marx]] condemned religion as "the opiate of the masses", and this doctrine is also infused in Chinese writings on history.&lt;ref name="Powers 12 14"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with their political perspectives, Chinese sources claim that the common Tibetans suffered appallingly before the Chinese takeover.&lt;ref name="Powers19 20"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Western authors' writings on Tibetan history are sometimes controversial. For example, whilst Hugh Richardson, who lived in Lhasa in the 1930s and 1940s, before the takeover by the PRC in 1951, writes in ''Tibet and Its History'' that Chinese versions of Tibetan history are contemptible and he considers the Chinese rule brutal and illegal,&lt;ref name="Powers 16"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Israel Epstein]], a naturalized Chinese citizen born in Poland  who similarly claims the authority of first-hand knowledge, although following the Chinese takeover, supports Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers 17 18"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; There are few academic assessments of the recent history of Tibet. Anthropologist and historian [[Melvyn Goldstein]], who is fluent in Tibetan and has done considerable fieldwork with Tibetans in exile and in Tibet, considers pre-1950 Tibet to have been a feudal theocracy impaired by corrupt and incompetent leaders.&lt;ref name="Powers 21"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It was ''de facto'' independent of China from 1911 to 1949, but not recognised as ''de jure'' independent of China by any nation, including its protective power Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1989, ps. 815-824&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese side seeks to persuade international perception as to the appropriate nature and justifiability of Chinese rule in Tibet. Their position is that Tibet truly and historically belongs to China, that affairs of Tibet are internal matters, and Tibetans seek to internationalize their cause, in part by convincing readers that Tibet was independent.&lt;ref name="Powers 8"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating as it does on questions of national sovereignty, the official position of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] is more moderate in tone than that of some of its more extreme supporters who conflate the rule of the lamas with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] ideals, seeking to promote a Buddhist dogma that competes with the Marxist dogma of "feudal serfdom" by portraying Tibet under the [[lama]]s as, in [[Robert Thurman]]'s words: "a mandala of the peaceful, perfected universe".&lt;ref&gt;Inner Revolution: Robert Thurman&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetologist Robert Barnett&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/faculty/barnett.html|title=The Faculty and Scholars of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute: Robert J. Barnett|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

:"Chinese references to preliberation conditions in Tibet thus appear to be aimed at creating popular support for Beijing's project in Tibet. These claims have particular resonance among people who share the assumption—based on nineteenth-century Western theories of "social evolution" that are still widely accepted in China—that certain forms of society are "backward" and should be helped to evolve by more "advanced" societies. This form of prejudice converges with some earlier Chinese views and with vulgar Marxist theories that imagine a vanguard movement liberating the oppressed classes or nationalities in a society, whether or not those classes agree that they are oppressed. Moreover, the Chinese have to present that oppression as very extensive, and that society as very primitive, in order to explain why there were no calls by the Tibetan peasantry for Chinese intervention on their behalf.

:The question of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims in this respect are intrinsic to the functioning of the PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with caution. From a human rights point of view, the question of whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate question is why the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive. Writers and researchers in Tibet face serious repercussions if they do not concur with official positions on issues such as social conditions in Tibet prior to its "liberation," and in such a restrictive climate, the regime's claims on this issue have little credibility."&lt;ref name="barnett84"&gt;Barnett 2008, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===The political debate===
Chinese sources portray Tibet before 1950 as a feudal serfdom in which serfs suffered terribly under the despotic rule of [[lama]]s and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. Some Tibetan sources describe the people as happy, content, and devoted to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Powers18 19"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand the Tibetan [[Phuntsok Wangyal]], who founded the Tibetan communist party in the 40's, describes the old system as unequal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, and Siebenschuh 2004, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest publications in English to apply the term "serf" to Tibet was [[Marxist]] sympathiser [[Anna Louise Strong]]'s work from 1960, ''When Serfs Stood up in Tibet'', published by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="Powers 167"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Another seminal promoter of the term is historian&lt;ref name="nych"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyhumanities.org/speakers/adult_audiences/speaker.php?speaker_id=223|title=A.

[[Melvyn Goldstein]] has produced many works on Tibetan society since the 1960s and used "serf" to translate the Tibetan term ''mi ser'' (literally "yellow person";&lt;ref name="Powers 168"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as peasant"&lt;ref name="wmc4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to describe both the landless peasant classes and the wealthier land holding and taxpaying class of families. He has written, "with the exception of about 300 noble families, all laymen and laywomen in Tibet were serfs (''Mi ser'') bound via ascription by parallel descent to a particular lord (dPon-po) though an estate, in other words sons were ascribed to their father's lord but daughters to their mother's lord."&lt;ref name="CAJ7115"&gt;Goldstein, Central Asiatic Journal, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1989 book ''A History of Modern Tibet'' Goldstein argued that although serfdom was prevalent in Tibet, this did not mean that it was an entirely static society. There were several types of serf sub-status, of which one of the most important was the "human lease", which enabled a serf to acquire a degree of personal freedom. This was an alternative which, despite retaining the concept of lordship, partially freed the ''mi ser'' from obligations to a landed estate, usually for an annual fee.&lt;ref name="Goldstein JAS7152134"&gt;Goldstein, ''Journal of Asian Studies'', May 1971, pp. 521-34&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Goldstein used the term "serf" in the following, more cautious, way "...monastic and aristocratic elites ... held most of the land in Tibet in the form of feudal estates with hereditarily bound serflike peasants."&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199735"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Powers has characterized Goldstein as "generally pro-China"&lt;ref name="Powers 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but also called his ''History of Modern Tibet'' "the most balanced treatment".&lt;ref name="Powers 17"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein describes himself as having conservative political views.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to WTN by Goldstein July 2008, quoted on http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=22134&amp;article=Goldstein's+Response+to+Jamyang+Norbu.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to William Monroe Coleman, China misrepresents Goldstein's usage as support for their version of Tibetan history.&lt;ref name="wmc4"/&gt;

Goldstein distinguished serfdom from feudalism, and applied the term "serfdom" but not "feudalism" to old Tibet.&lt;ref name="wmc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he made some effort to avoid appearing to support China's invasion of Tibet, writing that the PRC left the traditional system in place, not only after the invasion of 1950, but even after the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959.  He pointed out that in 1950, Chinese rhetoric claimed that China was freeing Tibet, not from serfdom, but from imperialist influence.&lt;ref name="exchoice109"&gt;Goldstein, "Reexamining Choice" (1986), pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, his usage has been misinterpreted as support for the Chinese Marxist viewpoint, in which feudalism and serfdom are inseparable, and old Tibet is consistently described as "feudal serfdom".&lt;ref name="wmc11"/&gt;

Not all writers who use the term "serfdom" to describe pre-Communist society in Tibet do so pejoratively. [[Pico Iyer]], a journalist whose father is a friend of the Dalai Lama and who has himself been in private conversation with him for over thirty years writes: "Almost as soon as he came into exile, in 1959, the Dalai Lama seized the chance to get rid of much of the red tape and serfdom that had beset Tibet in the past".&lt;ref name="Iyer 176"&gt;Iyer 2008, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama himself used the term "serf" in 1991, saying: "The relationship between landlord and serf was much milder in Tibet than in China and conditions for the poor were much less harsh."&lt;ref&gt;Freedom in Exile, HHDL 1991. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Tibetan sources portray Tibetan peasants and workers to support their own view of a Tibetan people who were not only independent of China, but found the Chinese alien and incomprehensible, and who suffered genocide under Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers9 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]], the British Trade Envoy to Tibet in the 1940s, agrees with Tibetan authors, stating there was little difference between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref name="Powers22"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Thomas Laird notes that scholars debate the applicability of these terms to Tibet, and struggle with a lack of sufficient data.&lt;ref name="Laird 3179"&gt;Laird 2006, pp.317-9&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Barbara Crossette asserted in 1998 that "scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Crossette 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government-in-Exile says about conditions in Tibet pre-Communism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Traditional Tibetan society was, by no means, perfect and was in need of changes. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders have admitted as much. That is the reason why the Dalai Lama initiated far-reaching reforms in Tibet as soon as he assumed temporal authority. The traditional Tibetan society, however, was not nearly as bad as China would have us believe.
&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The academic debate===
The academic debate as to whether "serf" is an applicable term for a society such as pre-Communist Tibet continues to this day. Goldstein and Miller's exchanges in an academic journal between 1986 and 1989 were a notable part of this debate. The applicability of the concept of serfdom to Tibet was debated between Melvyn Goldstein and anthropologist Beatrice D. Miller of Wisconsin University over a series of five articles in the ''Tibet Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/social.htm|title=Tibetan History and Social &amp; Political Structure|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was initiated by Goldstein in the XI edition of the ''Tibet Journal'', in which he defended his description of the features of Tibetan society as being very comparable to European serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) pp.80-86&lt;/ref&gt; He based the comparison on the features of serfdom described by French historian Marc Bloch including:&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

* The status was hereditary.
* A serf, unlike a slave, had rights and possessed but did not own productive resources (land).
* The lord had the legal right to command his serfs, including judicial authority over him or her.

Goldstein argued that Tibetan society fulfilled all these requirements, and argued in detail against the specific diverging opinions of fellow scholars Miller, Micheal, Dargyay and Aziz. He underpinned his assertions by research, first hand accounts and case studies, and responded to criticisms which had been voiced by these researchers in the preceding years.

Only Miller responded in the next ''The Tibet Journal'', in a short letter, in 1987. She acknowledged Goldstein's scholarship, stating "Goldstein's article ... cannot be faulted. It is an outstanding example of his exemplary collection of fine data."&lt;ref name="miller65"&gt;Miller (1987) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed however with his interpretation, specifically the use of the word "serf" and challenged him by asserting the following:

* That a lord also had obligations to the central government, so the specific obligations of a peasant (Tibetan: "mi ser") to a lord were only examples of societal obligations which everyone had.&lt;ref name="miller65" /&gt;
* That the obligations owed to a lord were by the family collective, and not "personal" or individual.&lt;ref name="miller66"&gt;Miller (1987) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the obligations of a peasant were not so onerous as it was easy to run away.&lt;ref name="miller66-67"&gt;Miller (1987) pp.66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following issue Goldstein replied in brief arguing:

* The nature of the lord's relation with the central government was radically different from the peasant/lord relation and not relevant to the peasant/lord relation he was discussing.
* While corvee obligations fell primarily on households, a peasant's legal status very much related to his person, was hereditary and not rescindable.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
* He pointed out that running away was illegal, punishable, and that European serfs also ran away.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;
* He strongly disagreed with Miller's assertion that the peasant/lord relation was fundamentally contractual.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later publication and response Goldstein agreed to differ on the use of the word "serf" to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the form of partial manumission known as "human lease" and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not occasional service at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) pp.56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman, integrating Goldstein's research with subsequent work done by other scholars including Rebecca French, Graham Clarke, and Franz Michael, argues that Goldstein overemphasized the ''de jure'' status of the ''mi ser'' at the expense of ''de facto'' characteristics - a high degree of social and economic mobility, and hence autonomy; frequently successful negotiations with lords to improve their status; and flight from untenable situations such as unpayable debts and exorbitant labor requirements.&lt;ref name="wmc710"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that "serf" is a misleading term for the Tibetan ''mi ser''.&lt;ref name="wmc2022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights in Tibet==
{{Main|Human rights in Tibet}}
In the political debate regarding the nature of pre-Communist Tibet, Chinese sources assert [[human rights]] abuses as a justification for the Communist invasion. Both before and after the Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]]. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified.

===Prior to 1950===
Judicial mutilation - principally the gouging out of eyes, and the cutting off of hands or feet - was formalized under the [[Sakya]] school as part of the 13th century Tibetan legal code, and was used as a legal punishment until being declared illegal in 1913 by a proclamation of the [[13th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Barnett 2008, pp. 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; In this same reform, the Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so (preceding, for instance, Switzerland, Britain, and France).&lt;ref name="acme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamyangnorbu.com/blog/2008/08/17/acme-of-obscenity/|title=Acme of Obscenity|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 14th Dalai Lama's brother Jigme Norbu reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."&lt;ref name="Norbu 317"&gt;Norbu 1968, pg. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 244"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert W. Ford]], one of the few Westerners to have been appointed by the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Government of Tibet]] at the time of ''de facto'' [[Tibet (1912–1951)|independent Tibet]], spent five years in Tibet, from 1945 to 1950, before his arrest by the invading Chinese army. In his book ''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'', he writes

{{quote|"All over Tibet I had seen men who had been deprived of an arm or a leg for theft (...) Penal amputations were done without antiseptics or sterile dressings".&lt;ref&gt;''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'' by [[Robert W. Ford]] (1957), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Heinrich Harrer]] who lived in Tibet at the same time (1944 to 1951) wrote in his book "Return to Tibet" that these treatments had already ceased at that time:
{{quote|"The so-called "chamber of horrors" at the foot of the Potala is also no longer shown. I believe that the Chinese were perfectly well aware that they were conning the tourists with displays of desiccated human arms, flutes made from femurs, and silver-mounted skulls; these objects, they used to maintain, testified to torture, flogging and other atrocities. Even Wangdu was so much under Chinese influence that he confirmed the atrocity stories spread by the Chinese about the Tibetans. He reminded me that in the days of the fifth Dalai Lama (in the eighteenth century), and even under the thirteenth (1900- 33), Tibetans still had their hands and feet chopped off. In reply to my direct question he had to admit that this had ceased to happen during my time in Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Tibet'' by [[Heinrich Harrer]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, mutilation and other extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official [[Lungshar]] in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon [[Lungshar]], an official educated in England, introduced reform in the 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. "The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone on each of the temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to cauterize the wound." &lt;ref name="Lee Feigon"&gt;Demystifying Tibet: unlocking the secrets of the Land of the Snows pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldHist208"&gt;A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (''ragyaba'') carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.&lt;ref name="GoldHist208" /&gt;

As late as 1949 the Tibetan government still sentenced people to mutilation. When an CIA officer [[Douglas Mackiernan]] was killed against official entry permit, six Tibetan border guards were tried and sentenced in Lhasa. "The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each." The sentence was reduced to 200, 50 and 25 lashes, respectively, after another CIA agent [[Frank Bessac]] requested leniency.&lt;ref name="These Tibetans killed an American"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frank Bessac]]|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131| date=13 November 1950|publisher=Time Inc|pages=131–141|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping was legal and common as punishment&lt;ref&gt;French (1995) pp. 276, 316, 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process. Whipping could also have fatal consequences, as in the case of the trader Gyebo Sherpa subjected to the severe ''corca'' whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 1989 p163&lt;/ref&gt; Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997 pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ''100 Questions and Answers About Tibet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|title=100 Questions and Answers About Tibet|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|accessdate=2008-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331121008/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|archive-date=2006-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China]] states that [[human rights]] were 'severely infringed upon' by the [[Dalai Lama]]'s administration. The evidence for these accusations is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Robert, in: Blondeau, Anne-Marie and  Buffetrille, Katia (eds).  ''Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions''  (2008) University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24464-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-520-24928-8}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed criminal offenses as uncommon, but there are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes.&lt;ref name="French315"&gt;French (1995) p.315-316&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more likely to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.&lt;ref name="French315" /&gt;

Political power could play a role in a judicial process in Tibet. In the eye gouging case above the alleged criminal was a deposed member of the Kashag called Lungshar who had proposed democratic reform. The charge was planning a coup and the attempted murder of another Kashag member who opposed reform. It was strenuously denied by the accused. Conviction was based on the evidence of one informer who claimed to have seen a document which was never produced. He was richly rewarded, and the trial seems to have been a show trial by traditionalists seeking to prevent reform. From arrest to execution of the sentence was only ten days, limiting the possibilities of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, pp. 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

One evidence of Chinese brutality in Eastern Tibet was reported by an American missionary in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these Tibetans, slicing, boiling, tearing asunder and all …To sum up what China is doing here in eastern Tibet, the main things are collecting taxes, robbing, oppressing, confiscating, and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Believing that the American missionary's account might be a mistake, Sir Eric Teichman, a British diplomat, noted that whatever brutality existed, it was "in no way due to any action of the Chinese government in Peking or the provincial authorities in Szechuana."&lt;ref name="Teichman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Teichman|title=Travels of a Consular Officer in Eastern Tibet: Together with a History of the Relations Between China, Tibet and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA228|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Archive|page=228|id=GGKEY:C7S43JE1DN6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
[[Israel Epstein]] wrote that prior to the Communist takeover, poverty in Tibet was so severe that in some of the worst cases peasants had to hand over children to the manor as household slaves or [[nangzan]], because they were too poor to raise them.&lt;ref name="Laird 46"&gt;Epstein 1983, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Laird asserted that in the 1940s Tibetan peasants were well off and immune to famine, whereas starvation was common in China.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, the so-called "slaves" were domestic servants (nangtsen) and managers of estates in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://savetibet.ru/img/2010/tibet-book-eng.pdf Kuzmin, S.L. ''Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation''. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 the British army invaded and held the Tibetan [[Chumbi Valley]], in the border region adjacent to Bhutan and India. [[Charles Alfred Bell|Sir Charles Bell]] was put in charge of the district from September 1904 to November 1905&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pg. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby [[Bhutan]] where [[slavery in Bhutan|slavery was more widespread]]. Bell further remarked, "The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into [[Sikkim]] and [[British Raj|British India]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan welfare after the Chinese takeover===
Just as the Chinese and the Tibetan exile community argue over whether common Tibetans suffered or flourished before the Chinese takeover, they take diametrically opposing views on the fate of ordinary Tibetans since 1950.  This is understood to be highly important in persuading readers of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Chinese rule.  Chinese sources in English claim rapid progress for prosperous, free, and happy Tibetans participating in democratic reforms. Tibetans, on the other hand, write of Chinese genocide in Tibet, comparing the Chinese to the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Powers11 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cultural Revolution]], according to Powers, scholar Warren Smith, whose work became focused on Tibetan history and politics after spending five months in Tibet in 1982, portrays the Chinese as chauvinists who believe they are superior to the Tibetans, and claims that the Chinese use torture, coercion and starvation to control the Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Powers23 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibet Autonomous Region is much poorer than other provinces of China. In 1980, in order to help Tibet out of poverty, the 1st Tibet Work Forum (moderated by [[Hu Yaobang]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]), decided to give the Tibet Autonomous Region financial support, in order to build a "united, prosperous, civilized new Tibet". After this Forum, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, all taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry were waived, while other provinces had to wait until 2006 for the same. The old “[[people's commune]]” economic system was dismantled (while in other provinces it was ended in 1985), so farmland started to be used by the household, and livestock started to be owned and used by the household. In the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial level administrative region that enjoys some tax incentives, and after 1988 is the only provincial level administrative region that receives growing substantial quota subsidies from the central government. Under the "partner assistance" policy, all the rich provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, most of the Central Government organs, and some central enterprises respectively assist the prefectures and cities of the Tibet Autonomous Region. With this assistance, in 1988, the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminated its fiscal deficit for the first time in history. As the only provincial level "poverty-stricken areas which lie in vast, contiguous stretches" in the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region developed a lot of anti-poverty programs, and the impoverished population has been shrinking substantially. However, there are still many difficulties in poverty reduction.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-hans|罗绒战堆, 西藏的贫困与反贫困问题研究, 中国藏学出版社}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of 2012, the social security system in the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completely established. This system not only includes ordinary people, but also all the 29,000 monks and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism in the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://xw.sinoins.com/2013-12/17/content_82593.htm|script-title=zh:西藏2.9万在编僧尼全部纳入社会保障体系|date=2013-12-17|publisher=中国保险报·中保网|accessdate=2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of human rights infringements, including the 2006 [[Nangpa La shootings]]. See [[human rights in the People's Republic of China]] and [[Human rights in Tibet]] (include all the Tibetan areas) for an overview. The ''Human Rights Watch World Report 2008: Events in China 2007'' states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Widespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged "separatism." Seven Tibetan boys in [[Gansu Province|Gansu province]] were detained for over a month in early September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet. Ronggyal Adrak was detained and charged under state security offenses by police on August 1 after he called for the Dalai Lama's return at a horse race festival in [[Sichuan Province|Sichuan province]]. He is awaiting trial. The Chinese government has failed to bring to justice those responsible for the shooting death by People's Armed Police officers of a 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, while trying to cross the border into Nepal on September 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.hrw.org/press/other_news/hrw_world_report_2008_events_in_china_in_2007|title=Overview of key developments relating to human rights in China in 2007|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is notable in this Report that most of the examples are not in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the "[[reform and opening up]]" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support policies and substantial financial support to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan areas in the four provinces did not get the same. Although some of them (such as the [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan) are rich enough, others of them are not rich, and some of them in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai are poor enough. The Tibetan areas in the four provinces ask the central government to benefit them as the Tibet Autonomous Region. And the poverty in these areas makes some of their Tibetan residents support the idea of "[[Greater Tibet]]" which is claimed by Tibetan exile groups.&lt;ref name=you&gt;尤力, 杨明洪, [http://www.scfpym.gov.cn/show.aspx?id=32294 新形势下西藏与四省藏区协调发展基点研究], 西南民族大学学报(人文社会科学版) 2014年09期&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;廖桂蓉, [http://www.sass.cn/109005/19679.aspx 四川藏区贫困状况及脱贫障碍分析], 农村经济2014年第1期&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, on the 5th Tibet Work Forum, the central government declared its intention to make the Tibetan areas in the four provinces steadily progress as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region. The goal is to bring the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan areas in the four provinces in line together with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way in 2020.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;

==Comparison to other regions==

Debate continues as to whether pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: "In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries"&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt; the fact that most [[Dalai Lama]]s, including [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] and [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]], came from [[peasant]] families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to be far better off than their Chinese counterparts.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo, Nicola, State Formation and Periodization in ''Inner Asian History Journal of World History'' - Volume 10, Number 1, Spring 1999, pp. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; Much of [[Mongolia]]n, [[Tibetan history|Tibetan]] and [[History of China|Chinese]] political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain.

According to the 'United Nations Research Institute for Social  Development', [[Bonded labour|bonded labor]] and other forms of economic exploitation currently exist in nearby regions including India, Nepal, and {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}several Chinese provinces.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development.

However no local regions are in Tier 3.

The '''sphere of influence''' is a region around a [[supermassive black hole]] in which the [[gravitational potential]] of the black hole dominates the gravitational potential of the host [[galaxy]]. The radius of the sphere of influence is called the "(gravitational) influence radius".

There are two definitions in common use for the radius of the sphere of influence. The first&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peebles|first=J.|title=Star Distribution Near a Collapsed Object|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=December 1972 | volume=178 | pages=371–376 | doi=10.1086/151797|bibcode = 1972ApJ...178..371P }}&lt;/ref&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;r_h = \frac{GM_{\rm BH}}{\sigma^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the black hole, ''σ'' is the stellar [[velocity dispersion]] of the host [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]].
 
The second definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merritt | first=David | authorlink=David Merritt |editor-first=Luis |editor-last=Ho |title=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies | journal=Coevolution of Black Holes and Galaxies |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2004 |pages=263–275 |chapter=Single and Binary Black Holes and their Influence on Nuclear Structure | series=Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series | volume=1 | bibcode=2004cbhg.symp..263M | chapter-url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521824494#contributors|arxiv = astro-ph/0301257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the radius at which the enclosed mass in stars equals twice M&lt;sub&gt;BH&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e.

&lt;math&gt;M_\star(r&lt;r_h) = 2 M_{\rm BH} &lt;/math&gt;.

Which definition is most appropriate depends on the physical question that is being addressed. The first definition takes into account the bulge's overall effect on the motion of a star, since &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is determined in part by stars that have moved far from the black hole. The second definition compares the force from the black hole to the local force from the stars.

It is a minimum requirement that the sphere of influence be well [[Angular resolution|resolved]] in order that the mass of the black hole be determined dynamically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ferrarese | first = Laura | last2 = Ford | first2 = Holland

&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the rotational influence sphere, stellar orbits [[precession|precess]] at approximately the Lense-Thirring rate; while outside this sphere, orbits evolve predominantly in response to perturbations from stars on other orbits. Assuming that the [[Sagittarius A*|Milky Way black hole]] is maximally rotating, its rotational influence radius is about 0.001 parsec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Merritt |first=David | authorlink=David Merritt |last2=Alexander |first2=Tal |last3=Mikkola | first3 = Seppo | last4=Will | first4=Clifford |date= 2010|title=Testing properties of the Galactic center black hole using stellar orbits |journal=Physical Review D |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=062002 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.81.062002| name-list-format=vanc |arxiv = 0911.4718 |bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81f2002M }}&lt;/ref&gt; while its radius of gravitational influence is about 3 parsecs.

'''Sympathetic magic''', also known as '''imitative magic''', is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based on imitation or correspondence.

==Similarity and contagion==
It has been said that the theory of sympathetic magic was first developed by Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1889); [[Richard Andree]], however, anticipates Frazer, writing of 'Sympathie-Zauber' in his 1878 ''Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche''. Frazer further subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or 'contagion':
{{Quote |If we analyze the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3623/3623-h/3623-h.htm#c3section1 | publisher = Bartleby | title = The Golden Bough | year = 1922 | chapter = 3: Sympathetic Magic; Part 1: The Principles of Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imitation==
Imitation involves using [[effigies]], [[fetishes]] or [[poppet]]s to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves.  [[Voodoo doll]]s are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a "link" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person.

==Correspondence==
[[Correspondence (theology)|Correspondence]] is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the [[traditional medicine|folk-medicine]] of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with [[yellow]] sap can cure [[jaundice]], that [[walnut]]s could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that [[red beet]]-juice is good for the blood, that phallic-shaped roots will cure [[male impotence]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harrison| first = Regina | title = Signs, songs, and memory in the Andes: translating Quechua language and culture| publisher = [[University of Texas Press]]| year = 1989| page = 178| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t6RkAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-292-77627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose "life" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed. (Examples including [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the [[Russian folktale]] of [[Koschei the Deathless]]. Compare [[Horcrux]] and [[lich]].) [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that in [[Uganda]], a [[barren woman]] is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds.&lt;ref name= " Haper &amp; Row - 1976 - A Mircea Eliade Reader - "&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Mircea Eliade | first = Mircea | last = Eliade |title=Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader|editor1-first =Wendell C | editor1-last = Beane | editor2-first = William G | editor2-last = Doty|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]| year=1976|page =385|isbn=978-0-06-090510-1|oclc= 2136392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies have been documeted as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rehabilitation interventions: Ideas based on a South Pacific example|author-last=Gregory|author-first=R. J.| journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=18|issue=1|date=1996|doi=10.3109/09638289609167089|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inhabitants of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers.

The term is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] in relation to [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[North Africa]] and at [[Lascaux]] in [[France]].  The theory is one of prehistoric human behavior, and is based on studies of more modern [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. The idea is that the paintings were made by [[Cro-Magnon]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]s. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a [[trance]] state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to [[predator]]s and human hand-prints). In his book ''Primitive Mythology'', [[Joseph Campbell]] stated that the paintings "...were associated with the magic of the hunt." For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a ''[[participation mystique]]'', where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of "timeless principle", were acted upon by rite.

In 1933, [[Leo Frobenius]], discussing [[Cave painting#Africa|cave paintings in North Africa]], pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that "...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind."

In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory.  For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been "symbolically wounded", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds.  Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope.  Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or "medicine-men" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt.  Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho.  Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic  In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals.

In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called "White Lady" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are "symbolic wounds" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013.

At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1.   Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism.

In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive.

However, as with all [[prehistory]], it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern [[Mind#Evolutionary history of the human mind|mind]].

==Popular culture==
The concept of sympathetic magic features prominently in the [[The Kingkiller Chronicle|Kingkiller Chronicle]] novel series by [[Patrick Rothfuss]].

Merricat Blackwood in [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is a practitioner of sympathetic magic.

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', sympathetic magic is practiced prominently.

The music duo Charming Disaster has a song called "Sympathetic Magic". A duet between the magic user and her target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charmingdisaster.bandcamp.com/track/sympathetic-magic|title=Sympathetic magic lyrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Bandcamp.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6819">'''Tank blanketing''', also referred to as tank padding, is the process of applying a [[gas]] to the empty space in a storage container. The term storage container here refers to any container that is used to store products, regardless of its size. Though tank blanketing is used for a variety of reasons, it typically involves using a [[buffer gas]] to protect products inside the storage container. A few of the benefits of blanketing include a longer life of the product in the container, reduced hazards, and longer equipment life cycles.

==Methods==
In 1970, Appalachian Controls Environmental (ACE) was the world’s first company to introduce a [[storage tank|tank]] blanketing [[valve]]. There are now many ready-made systems available for purchase from a variety of process equipment companies. It is also possible to piece together your own system using a variety of different equipment. Regardless of which method is used, the basic requirements are the same.  There must be a way of allowing the blanketing gas into the system, and a way to vent the gas should the [[pressure]] get too high.

Since ACE introduced its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though many of the products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point.  This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas at a much higher than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure reducing valve to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.

Although it varies from application to application, blanketing systems usually operate at a slightly higher than atmospheric pressure (a few inches of [[pressure#Stagnation pressure|water column]] above [[atmospheric pressure|atmospheric]]). Higher pressures than this are generally not used as they often yield only marginal increases in results while wasting large amounts of expensive blanketing gas.

Some systems also utilize inert gases to agitate the liquid contents of the container. This is desirable because products, such as citric acid, are added to food oils the tank will begin to settle over time with the heavier contents sinking to the bottom. However, a system that utilizes nitrogen [[sparging (chemistry)|sparging]] (and then subsequently tank blanketing once the nitrogen reaches the vapor space) may have negative impact on the products involved. Nitrogen sparging creates a significantly higher amount of surface contact between the gas and the product, which in turn creates a much larger opportunity for undesired oxidation to occur. It is possible for nitrogen that is as much 99.9% free of oxygen to increase the amount of oxidation within the product due to the high amount of surface contact.

==Common practices==
The most common gas used in blanketing is [[nitrogen]]. Nitrogen is widely used due to its inert properties, as well as its availability and relatively low cost. Tank blanketing is used for a variety of products including [[cooking oil]]s, volatile [[combustion|combustible]] products, and [[purified water]]. These applications also cover a wide variety of storage containers, ranging from as large as a tank containing millions of gallons of vegetable oil down to a quart-size container or smaller. Nitrogen is appropriate for use at any of these scales.

The use of an inert blanketing gas for food products helps to keep [[oxygen]] levels low in and around the product. Low levels of oxygen surrounding the product help to reduce the amount of oxidation that may occur, and increases shelf life.  In the case of cooking oils, lipid [[redox|oxidation]] can cause the oil to change its [[color]], [[flavor]], or [[aroma]]. It also decreases the [[nutrient]] levels in the food and can even generate [[toxicity|toxic]] substances. Tank blanketing strategies are also implemented to prepare the product for transit ([[railcar]] or [[truck]]) and for final [[packaging]] before sealing the product.

When considering the application for combustible products, the greatest benefit is process safety. Since fuels require oxygen to combust, reduced oxygen content in the vapor space lowers the risk of unwanted combustion.

Tank blanketing is also used to keep contaminants out of a storage space. This is accomplished by creating positive pressure inside the container. This positive pressure ensures that if a leak should occur, the gas will leak out rather than having the contaminants infiltrate the container. Some examples include its use on purified water to keep unwanted minerals out and its use on food products to keep contaminants out.

To ensure their safety, gas-blanketing systems for food use are regulated by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and must adhere to strict maintenance schedules and follow all product-contact regulations with regards to purity, toxicity, and filter specs. As with any use of inert gases, care must be taken to ensure that workers are not exposed to large quantities of nitrogen or other non-breathable substances, which can quickly result in [[nitrogen asphyxiation|asphyxiation]] and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meridianeng.com/inertgas.html] Reference Data Sheet on Inert Gases and Atmospheres, by Richard Gullickson, CIH&lt;/ref&gt; Use of them in commercial applications is subject to the regulation of [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] in the USA and similar regulatory bodies elsewhere.

In mathematical or [[statistical model|statistical mode]]ling a '''threshold model''' is any model where a threshold value, or set of threshold values, is used to distinguish ranges of values where the behaviour predicted by the model varies in some important way. A particularly important instance arises in toxicology, where the model for the effect of a drug may be that there is zero effect for a dose below a critical or threshold value, while an effect of some significance exists above that value.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of regression model may include threshold effects.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

== Collective Behavior ==
Threshold models are often used to model the behavior of groups, ranging from social insects to animal herds to human society.

Classic threshold models were developed by Schelling, Axelrod, and [[Mark Granovetter|Granovetter]] to model [[collective behavior]]. Schelling attempted to model the dynamics of segregation  motivated by individual interactions in America (Schelling, 1971) by constructing two simulation models. Schelling demonstrated that “there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,” and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so Schelling highlighted the significance of “a general theory of ‘tipping’”.

Mark Granovetter, following Schelling, proposed the threshold model (Granovetter &amp; Soong, 1983, 1986, 1988), which assumes that individuals’ behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaging in that behavior (both Schelling and Granovetter classify their term of “threshold” as behavioral threshold.). He used the threshold model to explain the riot, residential segregation, and the spiral of silence. In the spirit of Granovetter’s threshold model, the “threshold” is “the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so”. 
It is necessary to emphasize the determinants of threshold. Different individuals have different thresholds. Individuals' thresholds may be influenced by many factors: social economic status, education, age, personality, etc. Further, Granovetter relates “threshold” with utility one gets from participating in collective behavior or not, using the utility function, each individual will calculate his or her cost and benefit from undertaking an action. And situation may change the cost and benefit of the behavior, so threshold is situation-specific.
The distribution of the thresholds determines the outcome of the aggregate behavior (for example, public opinion).

==Segmented Regression analysis==

The models used in [[segmented regression analysis]] are threshold models.

==Fractals==

Certain deterministic recursive multivariate models which include threshold effects have been shown to produce [[fractal]] effects.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;Tong, H. (1990) ''Non-linear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-852224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time series analysis==

Several classes of [[nonlinear]] [[autoregressive]] models formulated for [[time series]] applications have been threshold models.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

==Toxicology==
A threshold model used in [[toxicology]] posits that anything above a certain dose of a [[toxin]] is dangerous, and anything below it safe. This model is usually applied to non-[[carcinogen]]ic health hazards.

Edward J. Calabrese and Linda A. Baldwin wrote:

:The threshold dose-response model is widely viewed as the most dominant model in toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calabrese | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = The Hormetic Dose-Response Model Is More Common than the Threshold Model in Toxicology | url = http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/246 | journal = [[Toxicological Sciences]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 246–250 | doi=10.1093/toxsci/71.2.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative type of model in toxicology is the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT), while [[hormesis]] correspond to the existence of opposite effects at low vs. high dose, which usually gives a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response curve.

== Liability threshold model ==

The '''liability-threshold model''' is a threshold model of categorical (usually binary) outcomes in which a large number of variables are summed to yield an overall 'liability' score; the observed outcome is determined by whether the [[latent variable|latent]] score is smaller or larger than the threshold. The liability-threshold model is frequently employed in medicine and genetics to model risk factors contributing to disease.

In a genetic context, the variables are all the genes and different environmental conditions, which protect against or increase the risk of a disease, and the threshold ''z'' is the biological limit past which disease develops. The threshold can be estimated from population prevalence of the disease (which is usually low). Because the threshold is defined relative to the population &amp; environment, the liability score is generally considered as a N(0, 1) [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]].

Early genetics models were developed to deal with very rare genetic diseases by treating them as [[Mendelian disease]]s caused by 1 or 2 genes: the presence or absence of the gene corresponds to the presence or absence of the disease, and the occurrence of the disease will follow predictable patterns within families. Continuous traits like height or intelligence could be modeled as [[normal distribution]]s, influenced by a large number of genes, and the heritability and effects of selection easily analyzed. Some diseases, like alcoholism, epilepsy, or [[Schizophrenia#Genetic|schizophrenia]], cannot be Mendelian diseases because they are common; do not appear in Mendelian ratios; respond slowly to selection against them; often occur in families with no prior history of that disease; however, relatives and adoptees of someone with that disease are far more likely (but not certain) to develop it, indicating a strong genetic component. The liability threshold model was developed to deal with these non-Mendelian binary cases; the model proposes that there is a continuous normally-distributed trait expressing risk polygenically influenced by many genes, which all individuals above a certain value develop the disease and all below it do not.

The first threshold models in genetics were introduced by [[Sewall Wright]], examining the propensity of [[guinea pig]] strains to have an extra hind toe, a phenomenon which could not be explained as a dominant or recessive gene, or continuous "blinding inheritance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208511/pdf/506.pdf | pmc=1208511 | pmid=17246735 | volume=19 | title=An Analysis of Variability in Number of Digits in an Inbred Strain of Guinea Pigs | journal=Genetics | pages=506–36 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208512/pdf/537.pdf | pmc=1208512 | pmid=17246736 | volume=19 | title=The Results of Crosses between Inbred Strains of Guinea Pigs, Differing in Number of Digits | journal=Genetics | pages=537–51 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern liability-threshold model was introduced into human research by geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer]] in his textbook&lt;ref&gt;ch18, "Threshold characters", [https://archive.org/details/introductiontoq00falc ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''], Falconer 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and two papers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to certain diseases, estimated from the incidence among relatives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815214451/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to diseases with variable age of onset, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203446/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Falconer had been asked about the topic of modeling 'threshold characters' by [[Cyril Clarke]] who had [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/167/4/1529 "D. S. Falconer and ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''"], Hill &amp; Mackay 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

An early application of liability-threshold models was to schizophrenia by [[Irving Gottesman]] &amp; James Shields, finding substantial heritability &amp; little shared-environment influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335617/pdf/pnas00677-0218.pdf | pmc=335617 | pmid=5231600 | volume=58 | title=A polygenic theory of schizophrenia | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=199–205 | last1 = Gottesman | first1 = II | last2 = Shields | first2 = J | doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.199 | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and undermining the "cold mother" theory of schizophrenia.

{{Federal Bureau of Investigation}}
The '''Uniform Crime Reports''' ('''UCR''') compiles official data on [[crime in the United States]], published by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). UCR is "a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of nearly 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal]], and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily reporting data on crimes brought to their attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/killed/2009/aboutucr.html |title=Summary of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program |website=fbi.gov |date=1987-09-30 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime statistics are compiled from UCR data and published annually by the FBI in the ''Crime in the United States'' series.

The FBI does not collect the data itself. Rather, [[Law enforcement in the United States|law enforcement agencies]] across the United States provide the data to the FBI, which then compiles the Reports.

The Uniform Crime Reports program began in 1929, and since then has become an important source of crime information for law enforcement, policymakers, scholars, and the media. The UCR Program consists of four parts:
* Traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) and the [[National Incident Based Reporting System]] (NIBRS) – Offense and arrest data 
* Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) Program 
* Hate Crime Statistics Program – [[hate crime]]s
* Cargo Theft Reporting Program – [[cargo theft]]

The FBI publishes annual data from these collections in ''Crime in the United States'', ''Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted'', and ''Hate Crime Statistics''.

==History==
The UCR Program was based upon work by the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]] (IACP) and the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC)&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Rosen, "The Creation of the Uniform Crime Report", ''Social Science History'' 19:2 (Summer 1995):215–238.&lt;/ref&gt;  throughout the 1920s to create a uniform national set of crime statistics, reliable for analysis.  In 1927, the IACP created the Committee on Uniform Crime Reporting to determine statistics for national comparisons.  The committee determined seven crimes fundamental to comparing crime rates: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, burglary, aggravated assault, larceny and motor vehicle theft (the eighth, arson, was added under a congressional directive in 1979).  The early program was managed by the IACP, prior to FBI involvement, done through a monthly report.  The first report in January 1930 reported data from 400 cities throughout 43 states, covering more than 20 million individuals, approximately twenty percent of the total U.S. population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_00/contents.pdf Crime in the United States 2000]. (PDF). Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice. Washington, D.C.. Retrieved on 30 March 2008. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414194515/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_00/contents.pdf Archived] on 14 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 11, 1930, through IACP lobbying, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation enacting [[Title 28 of the United States Code|28 U.S.C.]] § 534, which granted the office of the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] the ability to "acquire, collect, classify, and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime, and other records" with the ability to appoint officials to oversee this duty, including the subordinate members of the Bureau of Investigation.  The Attorney General, in turn, designated the FBI to serve as the national clearinghouse for the data collected, and the FBI assumed responsibility for managing the UCR Program in September 1930. The July 1930 issue of the IACP crime report announced the FBI's takeover of the program.  While the IACP discontinued oversight of the program, they continued to advise the FBI to better the UCR.

Since 1935, the FBI served as a data clearinghouse; organizing, collecting, and disseminating information voluntarily submitted by local, state, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies.  The UCR remained the primary tool for collection and analysis of data for the next half century.  Throughout the 1980s, a series of National UCR Conferences were with members from the IACP, Department of Justice, including the FBI, and newly formed [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS).  The purpose was to determine necessary system revisions and then implement them.  The result of these conferences was the release of a ''Blueprint for the Future of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program'' release in May 1985, detailing the necessary revisions.  The report proposed splitting reported data into two separate categories, the eight serious crimes (which later became known as "Part I index crimes") and 21 less commonly reported crimes (which later became known as "Part II index crimes").

In 2003, FBI UCR data were compiled from more than 16,000 agencies, representing 93 percent of the population&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucrquest.htm Frequently Asked Questions].

Retrieved on 2008-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in 46 states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/nibrsstatus.htm UCR and NIBRS Participation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425085732/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/nibrsstatus.htm |date=2006-04-25 }}. U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics. Washington, D.C. Retrieved on 2008-03-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  While nationally reporting is not mandated, many states have instituted laws requiring law enforcement within those states to provide UCR data.

==Data collection==
Each month, law enforcement agencies report the number of known index crimes in their jurisdiction to the FBI.  This mainly includes crimes reported to the police by the general public, but may also include crimes that [[police officer]]s discover, and known through other sources.  Law enforcement agencies also report the number of crime cases [[Clearance rate|cleared]].

==UCR crime categories==
[[File:FBI UCR crime-clock 2014.jpg|thumb|[[FBI]] Crime Clock – 2014]]
[[Image:2004 UCR Overview.jpg|thumb|Violent and Property Crime Indexes per 100,000 population, 2004 Uniform Crime Report]]

For reporting purposes, criminal offenses are divided into two major groups: Part I offenses and Part II offenses.

In Part I, the UCR indexes reported incidents of '''index crimes''' which are broken into two categories: violent and property crimes. [[Aggravated assault]], [[rape|forcible rape]], [[murder]], and [[robbery]] are classified as violent while [[arson]], [[burglary]], [[larceny|larceny-theft]], and [[motor vehicle theft]] are classified as property crimes. These are reported via the document named Return A – Monthly Return of Offenses Known to the Police. Part 1 crimes are collectively known as Index crimes, this name is used because the crimes are considered quite serious, tend to be reported more reliably than others, and are reported directly to the police and not to a separate agency (ex- IRS) that doesn't necessarily contribute to the UCR.

In Part II, the following categories are tracked: simple assault, curfew offenses and loitering, embezzlement, forgery and counterfeiting, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence, drug offenses, fraud, gambling, liquor offenses, offenses against the family, prostitution, [[public drunkenness]], runaways, sex offenses, stolen property, vandalism, vagrancy, and weapons offenses.

Two property reports are also included with the Return A. The first is the Property Stolen by Classification report.  This report details the number of actual crimes of each type in the Return A and the monetary value of property stolen in conjunction with that crime.  Some offenses are reported in greater detail on this report than on the Return A.  For example, on the Report A, [[burglary|burglaries]] are divided into three categories: Forcible Entry, Unlawful Entry – No Force, and Attempted Forcible Entry.  On the Property Stolen by Classification report, burglaries are divided into six categories based on location type and the time of the offense.  Offenses are counted in residences with offense times of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Unknown Time and Non-residences with the same three time groupings.

The second property report is the Property Stolen by Type and Value report.  The monetary value of both stolen and recovered property are totaled and classified as one of eleven property types:
*[[Currency]], [[Banknote|Notes]], Etc.
*[[Jewelry]] and [[Precious metal|Precious Metals]]
*[[Clothing]] and [[Fur]]s
*Locally Stolen Motor Vehicles
*[[Office equipment|Office Equipment]]
*Televisions, Radios, Stereos, Etc.
*[[Firearm]]s
*[[Household goods]]
*[[Consumable goods]]
*[[Livestock]]
*Miscellaneous

The FBI began recording arson rates, as part of the UCR, in 1979.  This report details arsons of the following property types:
*Single Occupancy Residential (houses, townhouses, duplexes, etc.)
*Other Residential (apartments, tenements, flats, hotels, motels, dormitories, etc.)
*Storage (barns, garages, warehouses, etc.)
*Industrial/Manufacturing
*Other Commercial (stores, restaurants, offices, etc.)
*Community/Public (churches, jails, schools, colleges, hospitals, etc.)
*All Other Structures (out buildings, monuments, buildings under construction, etc.)
*Motor Vehicles (automobiles, trucks, buses, motorcycles, etc.)
*Other Mobile Property (trailers, recreational vehicles, airplanes, boats, etc.)
*Other (crops, timber, fences, signs, etc.)

==Advisory groups==
The Criminal Justice Information Systems Committees of the [[International Association of Chiefs of Police]] (IACP) and the [[National Sheriffs' Association]] (NSA) serve in an advisory capacity to the UCR Program and encourage local police departments and sheriff's departments to participate fully in the program.

In 1988, a Data Providers' Advisory Policy Board was established to provide input for UCR matters. The Board operated until 1993 when it combined with the National Crime Information Center Advisory Policy Board to form a single Advisory Policy Board (APB) to address all issues regarding the FBI's criminal justice information services. In addition, the Association of State UCR Programs (ASUCRP) focuses on UCR issues within individual state law enforcement associations and promotes interest in the UCR Program. These organizations foster widespread and responsible use of UCR statistics and assist data contributors when needed.

==Limitations==
The UCR itself warns that it reflects crime reports by police, not later adjudication.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Chipperfield, War Memorial and The Two Brewers - geograph.org.uk - 122311.jpg|thumb|[[Chipperfield]], [[Hertfordshire]]&lt;br /&gt;village green and war memorial]]

A '''village green''' is a [[commons|common]] open area within a [[village]] or other settlement. Traditionally, a village green was common [[pasture|grassland]] at the centre of a rural settlement used for grazing with a pond for watering cattle and other stock.

The village green also provided, and may still provide, an open-air meeting place for the local people, which may be used for public celebrations such as [[May Day]] festivities. The term is used more broadly to encompass woodland, moorland, sports grounds, buildings and roads.

==History==
[[File:House on Village Green, Melmerby - geograph.org.uk - 236245.jpg|thumb|Village green&lt;br /&gt;[[Melmerby, Cumbria]]]]
[[File:Stanford in the Vale village green (2002).jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Stanford in the Vale]], [[Oxfordshire]]]]
[[File:Pritzhagen 07.jpg|thumb|A large green in the village of Pritzhagen, Germany]]
Some historical village greens have been lost as a result of the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] and [[urbanization|urban development]]. Greens are now most likely to be found in the older villages of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, and older areas of the United States. Town expansion in the mid-20th century led in England to the formation of local [[conservation ethic|conservation]] societies, often centring on village green preservation, as celebrated and parodied in [[The Kinks]]' album ''[[The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society]]''. The [[Open Spaces Society]] is a present-day UK national campaigning body which continues this movement.

The term may apply to [[urban park]]s. In the United States, the most famous example{{cn|date=March 2017}} of a town green is probably the [[New Haven Green]] in [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]]. New Haven was founded by settlers from England and was the first planned city in the United States. Originally used for grazing livestock, the Green dates from the 1630s and is well preserved today despite lying at the heart of [[downtown New Haven|the city centre]]. The largest green in the U.S. is a mile in length, and can be found in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. One of the most unusual is the [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] Green in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], which was owned and cleared by the college in 1770. The college, not the town, still owns it and surrounded it with buildings as a sort of collegiate quadrangle in the 1930s, although its origin as a town green remains apparent.
A fine example of a traditional American town green exists in downtown [[Morristown, NJ]]. The [[Morristown Green]] dates from 1715 and has hosted events ranging from executions to clothing drives.

Apart from the general use of the term, ''village green'' has a specific legal meaning in England and Wales, and also includes the less common term ''town green''. Town and village greens were defined in the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]], as amended by the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]], as land:
# which has been allotted by or under any Act for the exercise or recreation of the inhabitants of any locality
# or on which the inhabitants of any locality have a customary right to indulge in lawful sports and pastimes
# or if it is land on which for not fewer than twenty years a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality, or of any neighbourhood within a locality, have indulged in lawful sports and pastimes as of right.

Registered greens are now governed by the [[Commons Act 2006]], but the fundamental test of whether land is a town and village green remains the same. Thus land can become a village green if it has been used for twenty years without force, secrecy or request (''nec vi, nec clam, nec precario'').&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the law on this, see Austen-Baker, R. and Mayfield, B.,"Uncommon Confusion: Parallel Jurisprudence in Town and Village Green Applications" [2012] Conveyancer 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Village green legislation is often used to try to frustrate development. Recent case law (''Oxfordshire County Council vs Oxford City Council and Robinson'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/25.html |title=Oxfordshire County Council v. Oxford City Council &amp; Ors (2005) and others [2006&amp;#93; UKHL 25 (24 May 2006) |publisher=Bailii.org |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes it clear that registration as a green would render any development which prevented continuing use of the green as a criminal activity under the [[Inclosure Act 1857]] and the [[Commons Act 1876]]. This leads to some most curious areas being claimed as village greens, sometimes with success. Recent examples include a bandstand,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iwight.com/council/committees/Human%20Resources%20and%20Misc%20Appeals/1-9-06/Paper%20B.htm&lt;/ref&gt; two lakes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-14043544 |title= Llyn Maelog lake on Anglesey given village green status |author= |date=7 July 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a beach.&lt;ref&gt;[2013] EWCA Civ 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open Spaces Society]] states that in 2005 there were about 3,650 registered greens in England covering {{convert|8150|acres|0|abbr=on}} and about 220 in [[Wales]] covering about {{convert|620|acres|0|abbr=on}}.

[[File:The large green village of Zuidlaren.JPG|thumb|A village green in Zuidlaren, [[Netherlands]]]]
[[File:Willerzie.jpg|thumb|The village green in Willerzie, [[Belgium]]]]
A notable example of a village green is that in the village of [[Finchingfield]] in Essex, England, which is said {{who|date=November 2012}} to be "the most photographed village in England". The green dominates the village, and slopes down to a duck pond, and is occasionally flooded after heavy rain. The small village of [[Car Colston]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], England, has two village greens, totaling 29 acres (12 ha).&lt;ref&gt;Good Pub Guide [http://www.thegoodpubguide.co.uk/pub/view/Royal-Oak-NG13-8JE Retrieved 2 April 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some greens that used to be a common or otherwise at the centre of a village have been swallowed up by a city growing around them. Sometimes they become a city park or a square, and manage to maintain a sense of place. London has several of these: [[Newington Green]] is a good example, with [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] anchoring the northern end.

There are two places in the United States called Village Green: [[Village Green-Green Ridge, Pennsylvania]], and [[Village Green, New York]]. Some [[New England]] towns, along with some areas settled by New Englanders such as the townships in the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]], refer to their [[town square]] as a village green. The village green of Bedford, New York, is preserved as part of [[Bedford Village Historic District]]. The only village green in the United States still used for agriculture lies in [[Lebanon, Connecticut]]. This green is also one of the largest in the nation.

In [[Indonesia]], especially in [[Java]], a similar place is called ''Alun-Alun''. It is a central part of Javanese village architecture and culture.

The northern part of the province of [[Drenthe]] in the [[Netherlands]] is also known for its village greens. [[Zuidlaren]] is the village with the largest number of village greens in the Netherlands.

The [[Błonia Park]], originally established in the Middle Ages, is an example of a large village green in [[Kraków]], Poland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13906">'''Visceral pain''' is pain that results from the activation of [[nociceptors]] of the thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal [[viscera]] (organs). Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), [[ischemia]] and [[inflammation]], but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to localize and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, changes in vital signs as well as emotional manifestations. The pain may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.&lt;ref&gt;Urch CE &amp; Suzuki R. Pathophysiology of somatic, visceral, and neuropathic cancer pain. In: Sykes N, Bennett MI &amp; Yuan C-S. Clinical pain management: Cancer pain. 2 ed. London: Hodder Arnold; {{ISBN|9780340940075}}. p. 3–12&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct structural lesions or biochemical abnormalities explain this type of pain in only a proportion of patients. These diseases are grouped under gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMD). Others can experience occasional visceral pains, often very intense in nature, without any evidence of structural, biochemical or histolopathologic reason for such symptoms. These diseases are grouped under [[functional gastrointestinal disorders]] (FGID) and the pathophysiology and treatment can vary greatly from GINMD. The two major single entities among functional disorders of the gut are [[functional dyspepsia]] and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;Gschossmann JM, Holtmann G, Mayer EA. Epidemiology and clinical phenomenology of visceral pain Schmerz. 2002 Dec;16(6):447-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visceral hypersensitivity'''&lt;!--per MOS:BOLD since term redirects here--&gt; is a term used to describe hypersensitive visceral pain perception, which is commonly experienced by individuals with [[functional gastrointestinal disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="FGID mast cell"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wouters MM, Vicario M, Santos J | title = The role of mast cells in functional GI disorders | journal = Gut | volume = 65| issue = | pages = 155–168| year = 2015 | pmid = 26194403 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309151 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

In the past viscera were considered insensitive to pain but now it is clear that pain from internal organs is widespread and that its social burden may surpass that of pain from superficial ([[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]) sources. Myocardial ischemia, the most frequent cause of cardiac pain, is the most common cause of death in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman DHS.

Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2001, pp 1309–1325&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys have shown prevalence rates among adults of 25% for intermittent abdominal pain and 20% for chest pain; 24% of women suffer from pelvic pain at any point in time. For over two-thirds of sufferers, pain is accepted as part of daily life and symptoms are self-managed; a small proportion defer to specialists for help.

== Clinical presentation ==

Visceral pain should be suspected when vague midline sensations of [[malaise]] are reported by a patient. True visceral pain is characterized as a vague, diffuse, and poorly defined sensation.&lt;ref name=twelve&gt;Procacci P, et al. In: Cervero F, Morrison JFB (Eds). Visceral Sensation, Progress in Brain Research, Vol. 67. Amsterdam: Elsevier, 1986, pp 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fourteen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vecchiet L | year = 1989 | title = Pain from renal/ureteral calculosis: evaluation of sensory thresholds in the lumbar area | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 289–295 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/0304-3959(89)90087-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of specific organ of origin, the pain is usually perceived in the midline spanning anywhere from the lower abdomen up to the chest. In the early phases the pain is perceived in the same general area and it has a temporal evolution, making the onset sensation insidious and difficult to identify.&lt;ref name=thirteen&gt;Giamberardino MA. ''Eur J Pain'' 1999; 3(2):77–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pain is typically associated with involvement of the [[autonomic nervous system]]. Some of these symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, vomit, changes in [[vital signs]] including [[blood pressure]], [[heart rate]] and/or temperature. Strong emotional reactions are also common presenting signs and may include anxiety, anguish and a sense of impending doom. Visceral pathology may also manifest only through emotional reactions and discomfort where no pain is reported. The intensity of visceral pain felt might have no relationship to the extent of internal injury.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen&gt;Cervero F" ''Gut'' 2000; 47:56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Visceral pain changes in nature as it progresses. Pain from a specific organ can be experienced, or "referred" to different sites of the body. There is no [[pathology]] or no cause for pain at these referred [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] sites however the pain will be experienced at this location, often with significant intensity. [[Referred pain]] is sharper, better localized, and less likely to be accompanied by autonomic or emotional signs.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

A good example of visceral pain that is common place and embodies the wide spectrum of clinical presentations discussed above is a [[myocardial infarction]] (MI), more commonly known as a heart attack. This pain is secondary to [[ischemia]] of the cardiac tissue. The most common presenting symptom is [[chest pain]] that is often described as tightness, pressure or squeezing. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, over several minutes and tends to be located in the central chest (overlying the [[sternum]]) although it can be experienced in the left chest, right chest, and even abdominal area. Associated symptoms, which are mostly autonomic in nature, include [[diaphoresis]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[palpitations]], and [[anxiety]] (which is often described as a sense of impending doom).&lt;ref&gt;Mallinson, T (2010). "Myocardial Infarction". Focus on First Aid (15): 15. Retrieved 2010-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Heart Attack Warning Signs. Retrieved November 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Referred pain is experienced most commonly radiating down the left arm however it can also radiate to the lower [[jaw]], [[neck]], [[back]] and [[epigastrium]]. Some patients, especially [[elderly]] and [[diabetics]], may present with what is known as a painless myocardial infarction or a "silent heart attack". A painless MI can present with all of the associated symptoms of a heart attack, including nausea, vomiting, anxiety, heaviness, or choking, but the classic chest pain described above is lacking.&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davis TM, Fortun P, Mulder J, Davis WA, Bruce DG | year = 2004 | title = Silent myocardial infarction and its prognosis in a community-based cohort of Type 2 diabetic patients: the Fremantle Diabetes Study | url = | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 47 | issue = 3| pages = 395–9 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-004-1344-4 | pmid = 14963648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is always important for not only the physician but also the patient to remember the dissociation between magnitude of injury to internal organs and the intensity of pain and how this can be potentially dangerous if overlooked, for example a silent heart attack.&lt;ref name=main&gt;Carr, D.B. (2005). "Visceral Pain" International Association for the Study of Pain. VXIII, No.6&lt;/ref&gt; More rarely intense visceral pain does not signify a significant pathologic process, for example intense gas pains.

== Neurobiology ==

The vague and poorly defined sensation as well as its temporal nature, characteristic of visceral pain, is due to the low density of sensory innervation of [[viscera]] and the extensive divergence of visceral input within the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt;&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;
The phenomenon of [[referred pain]] is secondary to the convergence of visceral [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent (sensory) nerve fibers]] entering the [[spinal cord]] at the same level as the superficial, [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] structures experiencing the pain. This leads to a misinterpretation of incoming signals by higher brain centers.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

== Treatment ==

There are two goals when treating visceral pain: to alleviate the current experience of pain and to address any underlying [[pathology]], if and when identifiable. Treatment of the pain in many circumstances should be deferred until the origin of the symptoms has been identified. Masking pain may confound the diagnostic process and delay the recognition of life-threatening conditions. Once a treatable condition has been identified there is no reason to withhold symptomatic treatment. Also, if cause for the pain is not found in reasonable time then symptomatic treatment of the pain could be of benefit to the patient in order to prevent long-term [[sensitization]] and provide immediate relief.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt;&lt;ref name=two&gt;Giamberardino MA. In: Devor M, et al. (Eds). Proceedings of the 9th World Congress on Pain, Progress in Pain Research and Management, Vol. 16. Seattle: IASP Press, 2000, pp 523–550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fourtyseven&gt;Song SO, Carr DB. Pain: Clin Updates 1999; VII:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptomatic treatment of visceral pain relies primarily upon [[pharmacotherapy]]. Since visceral pain can result secondary to a wide variety of causes, with or without associated pathology, a wide variety of pharmacological classes of drugs are used including a variety of [[analgesics]] (ex. [[opiates]], [[NSAIDs]], [[benzodiazepines]]), [[antispasmodics]] (ex. [[loperamide]]), [[antidepressants]] (ex. [[Tricyclic antidepressant|TCA]], [[SSRI]], [[SNRI]]) as well as others (ex. [[ketamine]], [[clonidine]], [[gabapentin]]). In addition, pharmacotherapy that targets the underlying cause of the pain can help alleviate symptoms due to lessening visceral nociceptive inputs.&lt;ref name=nine&gt;Loeser JD (Ed). Bonica's Management of Pain, 3rd ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[nitrates]] can reduce [[Angina pectoris|anginal pain]] by dilating the [[coronary arteries]] and thus reducing the [[ischemia]] causing the pain. The use of spasmolytics (antispasmodics) can help alleviate pain from a gastrointestinal obstruction by inhibiting the contraction of the gut.&lt;ref name=twelve /&gt; There are issues associated with pharmacotherapy that include [[side effect]]s (ex. constipation associated with opiate use), [[chemical dependence]] or [[addiction]], and inadequate pain relief.

Invasive therapies are in general reserved for patients in whom pharmacological and other non-invasive therapies are ineffective. A wide variety of interventions are available and shown to be effective, a few will be discussed here. Approximately 50–80% of [[pelvic]] [[cancer]] pain patients benefit from [[nerve block]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Patt RB. Cancer pain. Philadelphia: JB Lippincott; 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriquez-Bigas M, Petrelli NJ, Herrera L, West C. Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991;173:41–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nerve blocks offer temporary relief and typically involve injection of a nerve bundle with either a [[local anesthetic]], a [[steroid]], or both. Permanent nerve block can be produced by destruction of nerve tissue. Strong evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials support the use of [[neurolytic]] [[celiac plexus]] block to alleviate pain and reduce opioid consumption in patients with [[malignant]] pain originating from abdominal viscera such as the [[pancreas]].&lt;ref&gt;54. Eisenberg E, et al. Pain: Clin Updates 2005; XIII:5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurostimulation]], from a device such as a [[spinal cord stimulator]] (SCS), for refractory angina has been shown to be effective in several randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;Jessurun GA, et al. Eur J Pain 2003; 7(6):507–512.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diedrichs H, et al. Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med 2005; 6(1):7.&lt;/ref&gt; A SCS may also be used for other chronic pain conditions such as [[chronic pancreatitis]] and [[familial Mediterranean fever]]. Other devices that have shown benefit in reducing pain include [[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators]] (TENS), targeted field stimulation, both used for somatic [[hyperalgesic]] states, external [[Neuromodulation (medicine)|neuromodulation]], [[pulsed radiofrequency|pulsed radiofrequency ablation]] and [[neuraxial blockade|neuraxial]] drug delivery systems.&lt;ref name=main /&gt;&lt;ref name=painreview&gt;Knowles C.H., Aziz Q, "Basic and clinical aspects of gastrointestinal pain" PAIN 141 (2009) 191–209&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste minimisation''' is a set of processes and practices intended to reduce the amount of [[waste]] produced.  By reducing or eliminating the generation of harmful and persistent wastes, waste minimisation supports efforts to promote a more [[sustainable]] society.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|author=United States Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/ref&gt;  Waste minimisation involves redesigning products and processes and/or changing societal patterns of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] and production.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite web|author=Davidson, G.|date=2011|title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review.|publisher=Retrieved from https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most environmentally resourceful, [[economic efficiency|economically efficient]], and [[cost effective]] way to manage waste often is to not have to address the problem in the first place. Managers see waste minimisation as a primary focus for most [[waste management]] strategies. Proper waste treatment and disposal can require a significant amount of time and resources; therefore, the benefits of waste minimisation can be considerable if carried out in an effective, safe and sustainable manner.

Traditional waste management focuses on processing waste after it is created, concentrating on [[re-use]], [[recycling]],  and [[waste-to-energy]] conversion.&lt;ref name=Davidson/&gt; Waste minimisation involves efforts to avoid creating the waste during manufacturing.  To effectively implement waste minimisation the manager requires knowledge of the production process, [[life cycle assessment#Cradle-to-grave|cradle-to-grave analysis]] (the tracking of materials from their extraction to their return to earth) and details of the composition of the waste.

The main sources of waste [[Waste by country|vary from country to country]]. In the [[UK]], most waste comes from the construction and [[demolition]] of buildings, followed by [[mining]] and quarrying, industry and commerce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7009/7009.pdf ROYAL COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION: Urban Environment] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Household waste constitutes a relatively small proportion of all waste.  Industrial waste is often tied to requirements in the [[supply chain]].  For example, a company handling a product may insist that it should be shipped using particular packing because it fits downstream needs.

==Benefits==
Waste minimisation can [[environment protection|protect the environment]] and often turns out to have positive economic benefits.  Waste minimisation can improve:&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;
*Efficient production practices.  Waste minimisation can achieve more output of product per unit of input of [[raw material]]s.
*Economic returns.  More efficient use of products means reduced costs of purchasing new materials improving the financial performance of a company.
*[[Reputation|Public image]].  The environmental profile of a company is an important part of its overall reputation and waste minimisation reflects a proactive movement towards [[environmental protection]].
*Quality of products produced.  New innovation and technological practices can reduce waste generation and improve the quality of the inputs in the production phase.
*[[Environmental responsibility]].  Minimising or eliminating waste generation makes it easier to meet targets of environmental regulations, policies, and standards. The environmental impact of waste will be reduced.

==Industries==
In industry, using more efficient manufacturing processes and better materials generally reduces the production of waste. The application of waste minimisation techniques has led to the development of innovative and commercially successful replacement products.

Waste minimisation efforts often require investment, which is usually compensated by the savings. However, waste reduction in one part of the production process may create waste production in another part.

There are government incentives for waste minimisation, which focus on the environmental benefits of adopting waste minimisation strategies. In the [[UK]], several pilot schemes such as The Catalyst Project and the Dee Waste Minimisation Project, have shown the efficacy of such policies. Fourteen companies in [[Merseyside]] took part in the Catalyst Project; the project generated overall savings of £9 million and landfill waste was reduced by 12,000 tonnes per year. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Processes==

: 
* [[Reuse]] of scrap material
: Scraps can be immediately re-incorporated at the beginning of the manufacturing line so that they do not become a waste product. Many industries routinely do this; for example, [[paper mill]]s return any damaged rolls to the beginning of the production line, and in the manufacture of plastic items, off-cuts and scrap are re-incorporated into new products.
* Improved [[quality control]] and [[process monitoring]]
: Steps can be taken to ensure that the number of reject batches is kept to a minimum.  This is achieved by increasing the frequency of inspection and the number of points of inspection. For example, installing automated continuous monitoring equipment can help to identify production problems at an early stage.
* Waste exchanges
: This is where the waste product of one process becomes the raw material for a second process. Waste exchanges represent another way of reducing waste disposal volumes for waste that cannot be eliminated.
* Ship to [[point of use]]
: This involves making deliveries of incoming [[raw material]]s or components direct to the point where they are assembled or used in the manufacturing process to minimise handling and the use of [[protective wrapping]]s or enclosures.
* [[Zero waste]]
: This is a whole systems approach that aims to eliminate waste at the source and at all points down the supply chain, with the intention of producing no waste. It is a design philosophy which emphasizes waste prevention as opposed to end of pipe waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dickinson, J.|author2=Snow, W.K.|date=2001|last-author-amp=yes|title=The end of waste: Zero Waste by 2020.|url=http://www.zerowaste.co.nz/assets/Reports/TheEndofWaste.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product design===

Waste minimisation and resource maximisation for [[Manufacturing|manufactured products]] can most easily be done at the design stage. Reducing the number of [[wikt:component|component]]s used in a product or making the product easier to take apart can make it easier to be repaired or recycled at the end of its useful life.

In some cases, it may be best not to minimise the volume of [[raw material]]s used to make a product, but instead reduce the volume or [[toxicity]] of the waste created at the end of a product's life, or the environmental impact of the product's use.  (See section [[Waste minimisation#Durability|Durability]]).

====Fitting the intended use====
In this strategy, products and packages are optimally designed to meet their intended use.  This applies especially to packaging materials, which should only be as durable as necessary to serve their intended purpose. On the other hand, it could be more wasteful if food, which has consumed resources and energy in its production, is damaged and spoiled because of extreme measures to reduce the use of [[paper]], [[metal]]s, [[glass]] and [[plastic]]s in its packaging.

====Durability====
Improving [[durable goods|product durability]], such as extending a [[vacuum cleaner]]'s useful life to 15 years instead of 12, can reduce waste and usually much improves resource optimisation.

But in some cases it has a negative [[environmental impact]].  If a product is too durable, its replacement with more efficient technology is likely to be delayed.  For example, a washing machine produced 10 years ago may use twice as much water, detergent and energy as one produced today. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Therefore, extending an older machine's useful life may place a heavier burden on the environment than scrapping it, recycling its metal and buying a new model.  Similarly, older vehicles consume more fuel and produce more emissions than their modern counterparts.

Most proponents of waste minimisation consider that the way forward may be to view any manufactured product at the end of its useful life as a resource for recycling and reuse rather than waste.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Recycling a product is easier if it is constructed of fewer materials.  Car manufacturers have recently reduced the number of plastics used in their cars from twenty or more to three or four, {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} hence simplifying the recovery of plastics from scrapped cars. However, exceptions (like having a combination of paper and plastic or plastic coating on glass) do exist, and might enable a product to fulfill its role with the minimum of resources.

Making refillable glass [[bottle]]s strong enough to withstand several journeys between the [[consumer]] and the [[bottling plant]] requires making them thicker and so heavier, which increases the resources required to transport them. Since transport has a large environmental impact, careful evaluation is required of the number of return journeys bottles make.  If a refillable bottle is thrown away after being refilled only several times, the resources wasted may be greater than if the bottle had been designed for a single journey..

Many choices involve trade-offs of environmental impact, and often there is insufficient information to make informed decisions.

==Retail==
Various aspects of business practices affect waste, such as the use of [[disposable tableware]] in restaurants.
===Reusable shopping bags===
Reusable bags are a visible form of re-use, and some stores offer a "bag credit" for re-usable shopping bags, although at least [[Kroger|one chain]] reversed its policy, claiming "it was just a temporary bonus".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/kroger-ends-reusable-bag-discount Kroger ends reusable bag discount], WCPO TV, Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, one study suggests that a bag tax is a more effective incentive than a similar discount.&lt;ref name="brookingsbag"&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-a-bag-tax-works-better-than-a-reusable-bag-bonus/ Why a Bag Tax Works Better Than a Reusable Bag Bonus], Brookings Inst., 8-Jan-2014&lt;/ref&gt;.  (Of note, the before/after study compared a circumstance in which some stores offered a discount vs. a circumstance in which all stores applying the tax.)  While there is a minor inconvenience involved, this may remedy itself, as reusable bags are generally more convenient for carrying groceries.

==Households==
This section details some waste minimisation techniques for [[household]]ers.

Appropriate amounts and sizes can be chosen when purchasing goods; buying large containers of paint for a small decorating job or buying larger amounts of food than can be consumed create unnecessary waste. Also, if a pack or [[can (disambiguation)#Container|can]] is to be thrown away, any remaining contents must be removed before the container can be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html Removing food remains to reduce waste]&lt;/ref&gt;

Home [[composting]], the practice of turning kitchen and garden waste into compost can be considered waste minimisation.

The resources that households use can be reduced considerably by [[electricity consumption|using electricity]] thoughtfully (e.g. turning off lights and equipment when it is not needed) and by reducing the number of car journeys made. Individuals can reduce the amount of waste they create by buying fewer products and by buying products which last longer. Mending broken or worn items of clothing or equipment also contributes to minimising household waste. Individuals can minimise their water usage, and walk or cycle to their destination rather than using their car to save fuel and cut down emissions.

In a domestic situation, the potential for minimisation is often dictated by [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  Some people may view it as wasteful to purchase new products solely to follow [[fashion trend]]s when the older products are still usable.  Adults working full-time have little free time, and so may have to purchase more [[convenience food|convenient foods]] that require little preparation, or prefer disposable nappies if there is a baby in the family.

The amount of waste an individual produces is a small portion of all waste produced by society, and personal waste reduction can only make a small impact on overall waste volumes.  Yet, influence on policy can be exerted in other areas. Increased consumer awareness of the impact and power of certain purchasing decisions allows industry and individuals to change the total [[resource consumption]].  Consumers can influence manufacturers and distributors by avoiding buying products that do not have [[eco-labelling]], which is currently not mandatory, or choosing products that minimise the use of packaging. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Pullapart|PullApart]] combines both [[Natural environment|environmental]] and [[consumer]] packaging [[Statistical survey|surveys]], in a [[Curbside collection|curbside]] packaging [[recycling]] classification system to minimise waste. Where reuse schemes are available, consumers can be proactive and use them.

==Health-care facilities==

Health-care establishments are massive producers of waste.&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2011|title=Waste from Health Care facilities Fact Sheet No 253|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs253/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of health-care waste are:  hospitals, laboratories and research centres, mortuary and autopsy centres, animal research and testing laboratories, blood banks and collection services, and nursing homes for the elderly.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt;

Waste minimisation can offer many opportunities to these establishments to use fewer resources, be less wasteful and generate less hazardous waste.  Good management and control practices among health-care facilities can have a significant effect on the reduction of waste generated each day.

===Practices===

There are many examples of more efficient practices that can encourage waste minimization in healthcare establishments and research facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|date=2014|title=Waste minimization, recycling and reuse.|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/medicalwaste/058to060.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Source reduction'''
*Purchasing reductions which ensures the selection of supplies that are less wasteful or less hazardous.
*The use of physical rather than chemical cleaning methods such as steam disinfection instead of chemical disinfection.
*Preventing the unnecessary wastage of products in nursing and cleaning activities.

'''Management and control measures at hospital level'''
*Centralized purchasing of hazardous chemicals.
*Monitoring the flow of chemicals within the health care facility from receipt as a raw material to disposal as a hazardous waste.
*The careful separation of waste matter to help minimize the quantities of hazardous waste and disposal.

'''Stock management of chemical and pharmaceutical products'''
*Frequent ordering of relatively small quantities rather than large quantities at one time.
*Using the oldest batch of a product first to avoid expiration dates and unnecessary waste.
*Using all the contents of a container containing hazardous waste.
*Checking the expiry date of all products at the time of delivery.
