{{History of the Philippines}}

The '''Balangiga bells''' are three [[church bells]] taken by the [[United States Army]] from the town church of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] in the [[Philippines]] as [[war trophies]] after reprisals following the [[Balangiga massacre]] in 1901 during the [[Philippine-American War]]. One church bell is in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Camp Red Cloud]], their base in [[South Korea]],&lt;ref name="nene"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=Voluntary Return of One Balangiga Bell by US Seen |url=http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517125827/http://www.nenepimentel.org/news/20031002_Balangiga.asp |archivedate=2011-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="solving"&gt;{{cite web | last =Borrinaga | first =Rolando | title =Solving the Balangiga bell puzzle | url=http://www.geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html | accessdate = 2008-03-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022080959/http://geocities.com/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while two others are on a former base of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry Regiment]] at [[F.

The recovery of the bells had been sought by various individuals representing the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines]], the [[Government of the Philippines|Philippine government]] and the residents of Balangiga since the late 1950s. These efforts however, have been met with frustration until recently. As of November 2018, all three church bells are in the process of being repatriated back to the Philippines from the United States and South Korea.&lt;ref name=chua/&gt;

==Balangiga massacre==
{{Main|Balangiga massacre}}
On September 28, 1901, Filipino militants from the village of Balangiga ambushed Company C of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], while they were at breakfast, killing an estimated 48 and wounding 22 of the 78 men of the unit, with only four escaping unhurt. The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition. An estimated 20 to 25 of the villagers had died in the fighting, with a similar number of wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bautista |first=Veltisezar |title=The Balangiga, Samar, Massacre |url=http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226150445/http://www.filipinoamericans.net/balangiga_massacre.shtml |archivedate=2008-02-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reprisal, General [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered that Samar be turned into a "howling wilderness" and that any Filipino male above ten years of age capable of bearing arms be shot. From the burned-out Catholic town church, the Americans looted three bells which they took back to the United States as [[war booty]]. The [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]], however, maintains that the single bell in their possession was presented to the regiment by villagers when the unit left Balangiga on April 9, 1902.&lt;ref name="robson"&gt;{{cite news | last =Robson | first =Seth | title =Book casts doubt on bell's history | pages = | publisher =[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]] | date = 2004-07-07 |

Waller was acquitted of the charges. Smith was found guilty, admonished and retired from service, but charges were dropped shortly after. He was later hailed as a war hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Philippine Insurrection, 1899-1902: A Working Bibliography | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/mil_hist_inst/p/pi2.asc|website=Ibiblio.org | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bells==
After Balangiga became a separate parish on September 27, 1859, the town probably took four years to raise funds to acquire its first church bell. It was cast circa-1863 and bears what was initially believed to be an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[emblem]]; latter sources state that the bells are [[Franciscans|Franciscan]].&lt;ref name=chua/&gt; It has a mouth diameter of {{fraction|31|1|4}} inches and height of 30 inches. It is inscribed with a name, R. San Francisco, who was probably the parish priest at that time.&lt;ref name=solving1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/rolborr/balbellspuzzle.html|title=Solving the Balangiga bell puzzle|work=Banner article in the INQUIRER Visayas section, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Aug. 11, 2001, p. A14|publisher=[Banner article in the INQUIRER Visayas section, Philippine Daily Inquirer, Aug. 11, 2001, p. A14. Banner article in the INQUIRER Visayas section, Philippine Daily Inquirer, August 11, 2001, p. A14.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town may have acquired its second bell, cast circa-1889 and having a mouth diameter of {{fraction|27|3|4}} inches and height of {{fraction|27|1|2}} inches, in 1889 through the initiative of Fr. Agustin Delgado, whose name is inscribed on the bell.&lt;ref name=solving1 /&gt;

The third and smallest bell may have been acquired in 1895, through the initiative of Fr. Bernardo Aparecio. This is the bell now kept by the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[South Korea]]. Estimates of its size deduce a 23–24 inch height and a mouth diameter of about 20 inches. It bears the [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] emblem.&lt;ref name="solving"/&gt;

===Removal to the United States===
After the Balangiga incident, the town was recaptured on September 29, 1901 by 55 men of Company G, 9th Infantry. That unit departed the town the same day, and was replaced by 132 men from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment which garrisoned the town until relieved on October 18, 1901. When the 11th Infantry departed, they brought home the [[war trophies]]. These
included two of the bells removed from the burnt-down Balangiga Church, and a [[cannon]] from the plaza in front of the church. The bells were taken because one had been used by the insurgents to signal the attack on Company C, 9th Infantry.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

The 11th Infantry redeployed to [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort D.A. Russell]] in [[Wyoming]], arriving on March 23, 1904. On May 16, 1905, the Cheyenne Daily Leader newspaper reported that the cannon had been mounted on the parade ground near the flagpole along with other relics from the Philippines "...to include the famous bell which gave the signal for the massacre of a whole company. Two large bells three feet tall and a seven-foot cannon were proudly displayed in front of the flagpole on the parade ground of the fort".&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

A sign was installed over one of the bells that said;
{{quote|This bell hung in the church at Balangiga, Samar, PI, and rung the signal for the attack on Company C, 9th U.S. Infantry, Sept 29 [28], 1901. Taken by Company L, 11th Infantry and detachment of Company K, 11th Infantry, the first units to reach the scene after the massacre.&lt;ref name=annals&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/annalsofwyom59121987wyom|title=The F.E. Warren Air Force Base War Trophies from Balangiga, P.I|author=Gerald M. Adams|journal=Annals of Wyoming|volume=59|issue=1|date=Spring 1987|pages=29&amp;ndash;38}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The sign above the bell erroneously credited units of the 11th Infantry with being the first to reach Balangiga after the battle. After further research, the sign was changed in 1911 giving proper credit to Company G, 9th Infantry, for recapturing Balangiga.&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;

In 1927, Fort Russell was renamed Fort Francis E. Warren. On 7 October 1949, it became [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]]. 

In 1967, a curved red brick wall was constructed in the Warren AFB trophy park for the bells, with a bronze plaque on the wall between the bells telling the story of the massacre at Balangiga. {{as of|1987}}, a faint inscription was visible on the back of both bells, reading:
{{center|&lt;poem&gt;USED BY {{sic|PHILIP|PINOS}}
TO SOUND SIGNAL FOR MASSACRE
OF COMPANY "C" NINTH INFANTRY
AT BALANGIGA P.l.
28TH SEPTEMBER 1901&lt;ref name=annals /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

{{as of|2001}}, a glass case housed the bells along with the 400-year-old British [[Falconet (cannon)|Falcon cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mead |first=Griver |title=For Whom the Bells Toll |pages= |publisher=AsianWeek.com |date=2001-10-11 |url=http://asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827192806/http://www.asianweek.com/2001_10_05/news_bells.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Fact Sheets:F.E.

The third church bell which was in the possession of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th U.S. Infantry Regiment]] is kept at the 2nd Infantry Division Museum in [[Camp Red Cloud]], [[Uijeongbu]]. It had previously been displayed at the unit's [[Camp Hovey]] headquarters.&lt;ref name="robson"/&gt;

==Recovery attempts==
In the mid-1990s, during the term of [[Fidel Ramos]] as Philippine President, attempts were initiated by his government to recover one or more of the bells from [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |title=The Saga of the Balangiga Bells |url=http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121143002/http://davinci.rodal-intl.org:8020/rudy/filipinas/balangiga.html |archivedate=2010-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Bells of Balangiga Revisited | url=http://www.philnews.com/2005/da.html |website=Philnews.com| accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has been adamant that the bells are US government property, that it would take an [[Act of Congress]] to return them and that the Catholic Church has no say in the matter. For their part the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines]] hold the position that the bells are inappropriate as trophies of war.&lt;ref name="cbcp"/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] approved Senate Resolution No. 393, authored by [[Aquilino Pimentel Jr.]], urging the [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Arroyo]] administration to undertake formal negotiations with the United States for the return of the bells.&lt;ref name="nene"/&gt;

In 2005, the bishop of [[Borongan]], [[Samar]], Bishop Leonardo Medroso and Balangiga parish priest Saturnino Obzunar wrote an open letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]], the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|Helsinki Commission]], requesting them to facilitate the return of the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pilapil | first =Jaime | title =Balangiga bells to be returned to RP soon | pages = | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date = 2005-11-14 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news03_nov14_2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Wyoming Veterans’ Commission favored the return of the Filipino-American War relics, however, [[Wyoming]] Governor [[Dave Freudenthal]] stated that he disagreed with the Commission and opposed returning the bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lariosa |first=Joseph |title=US vets group wants to return Balangiga Bells to RP |pages= |publisher=The Filipino Express |date=2005-04-14 |url=http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |accessdate=2008-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316202735/http://www.filipinoexpress.com/19/16_news.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2005, United States Congressman [[Bob Filner]] had introduced H.Res.313, urging the President to authorize the transfer of ownership of one of the bells to the people of the Philippines. The resolution died on January 3, 2007, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[109th United States Congress]].

On September 26, 2006, United States Congressman Bob Filner, Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and Congressman [[Ed Case]] co-sponsored House Concurrent Resolution No. 481 urging the president of the United States to authorize the return of the church bells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Sampayan | first =Sonny | title =Bells of Balangiga Resolution filed in U.S. Congress | pages = | publisher =Samar News.com | date = 2006-09-29 | url =http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080313233923/http://www.samarnews.com/news_clips5/news85.htm| archivedate= 13 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution died on January 3, 2009, with the ''sine die'' adjournment of the [[110th United States Congress]].

In 2007, [[Napoleón Abueva]], the Philippines' [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] for sculpture, wrote American Ambassador to the Philippines [[Kristie Kenney]] asking for her help in the bells' recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Help return Balangiga bells | pages = | publisher =Philstar Global Corp. | date = 2007-07-26 | url =http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=8426 | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 25 of the same year, during the [[14th Congress of the Philippines]], Senator [[Manny Villar]] filed Senate Resolution No. 177, a resolution "expressing the sense of the Senate for the return to the Philippines of the Balangiga Bells which were taken by the US troops from the town of Balangiga, Province of Samar in 1901".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Villar |first=Manuel |title=14th Congress - Senate Resolution No. 177 |url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=14&amp;q=SRN-177 |accessdate=2008-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209031139/http://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=14&amp;q=SRN-177 |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The townspeople of Balangiga asked the United States to return their church bells after receiving relief from the U.S. military subsequent to [[Typhoon Haiyan]] hitting the town in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters please bells"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/21/us-philippines-typhoon-usa-idUSBRE9AK1CO20131121 | title=Please can we have our bells back?

In his second [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]] on July 24, 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] demanded the bells' return, citing ownership of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2017/07/24/duterte-us-return-balangiga-bells-554668 |title=Duterte to US: Return Balangiga bells |work=Sunstar Philippines |location=Manila |publisher=Sunstar Philippines |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.philippinerevolution.info/statements/20170801-balangigas-lasting-relevance-of-peoples-uprising-will-haunt-duterte|title= Balangiga’s lasting relevance of people’s uprising will haunt Duterte|publisher=Sunstar Philippines|date=August 1, 2017|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He however did not raise the issue in a bilateral meeting with US President [[Donald Trump]] held in November 2017 during the [[2017 ASEAN Summits|31st ASEAN Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Ranada | first =Pia | title =Duterte doesn't raise Balangiga bells with Trump | publisher =[[Rappler]] | date = 14 November 2017 | url =https://www.rappler.com/nation/188423-duterte-balangiga-bells-trump-bilateral-meeting-asean-summit-2017 | accessdate = 25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018 two US lawmakers, [[Randy Hultgren]] and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]], objected to the bells being returned to the Philippines due to the current human rights record established by Duterte's [[Philippine Drug War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Cabico | first =Gaea Katreena | title =US solons object return of Balangiga bells to Philippines due to human rights concerns | publisher =[[The Philippine Star]] | date = 7 February 2018 | url =https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/02/07/1785490/us-solons-object-return-balangiga-bells-philippines-due-human-rights-concerns | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential repatriation ==
In August 2018, the [[Embassy of the United States, Manila| US Embassy in the Philippines]] issued a statement that the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] had notified the [[United States Congress]] that it plans to return the bells to the Philippines at an unspecified date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Morales | first =Neil Jerome | title =U.S. to return colonization era church bells to the Philippines | publisher =[[Reuters]] | date = 12 August 2018 | url =https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-bells/u-s-to-return-colonization-era-church-bells-to-the-philippines-idUSKBN1KW0FT | accessdate = 12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, Dr. Rolando Borrinaga of the Philippines' [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] stated that the two bells at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base will be turned over to Philippine representatives on 15 November 2018. The third bell in South Korea is also ready for repatriation.&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite news | last=Tagala | first=Don | title =Balangiga Bells to begin journey home to Philippines | publisher =[[ABS-CBN News]] | date = 12 November 2018 | url =https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/12/18/us-to-return-balangiga-bells-to-philippines | accessdate = 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two bells in Wyoming will then be shipped to [[Philadelphia]] for restoration work before being sent to South Korea, where they will join the third bell.

The successful campaign to return the bells came about due to the support of veterans organizations, including the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and the [[American Legion]], according to Dr. Borrinaga.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1842">'''Bathroom privileges''' refers to the rules or the possibility of the use of a [[toilet (room)|toilet]]. Most commonly, the term is used in the following settings:

* In schools, it refers to permission for pupils to leave the classroom during lessons. Often this is associated with certain regulations, such as usage of the [[hall pass]]. Sometimes, no bathroom privileges are granted for certain periods of time at the beginning and the end of a lesson.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* As a [[doctor's prescription]], it refers to permission for a patient to use the facilities. This may be due to a [[medical condition]] requiring [[bed rest]] (e.g. high-risk pregnancy),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.wisc.edu/3345 Despite side effects, bed rest still common for high-risk pregnancy (June 10, 1998)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or the avoidance of certain [[defecation postures]] (e.g. sitting or squatting)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggalanti.com/field_reports/field_reports_filipino.html Galanti | Cultural Diversity in Healthcare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Still another example is "BRP for bowel movement only". On the other hand, if a patient has a [[communicable disease]], the physician may wish to restrict the chances of it spreading by disallowing them from using the shared toilet on the ward.
* At some workplaces, it refers to formal rules, e.g. the number and the duration of the usage of the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;"The agreement  covers everything from cigarette breaks to bathroom privileges"—describing a racetrack labor union contract in: T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">In [[telecommunications]], the '''carrier-to-noise ratio''', often written '''CNR''' or '''''C/N''''', is the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of a [[modulation|modulated]] signal. The term is used to distinguish the CNR of the radio frequency [[passband]] signal from the SNR of an analog [[base band]] message signal after [[demodulation]], for example an audio frequency analog message signal. If this distinction is not necessary, the term SNR is often used instead of CNR, with the same definition.

Digitally modulated signals (e.g. [[QAM]] or [[Phase-shift keying|PSK]]) are basically made of two [[Continuous wave|CW]] carriers (the [[In-phase and quadrature components|I and Q]] components, which are out-of-phase carriers). In fact, the information (bits or symbols) is carried by given combinations of phase and/or amplitude of the I and Q components. It is for this reason that, in the context of digital modulations, digitally modulated signals are usually referred to as carriers. Therefore, the term carrier-to-noise-ratio (CNR), instead of signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is preferred to express the signal quality when the signal has been digitally modulated.

High ''C/N'' ratios provide good quality of reception, for example low [[bit error rate]] (BER) of a digital message signal, or high SNR of an analog message signal.

==Definition==
The carrier-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the received modulated carrier signal [[Power (physics)|power]] ''C'' to the received noise power ''N'' after the receiver filters:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR} = \frac{C}{N}
&lt;/math&gt;.
When both carrier and noise are measured across the same [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]], this ratio can equivalently be given as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR} = \left( \frac{V_C}{V_N} \right) ^2
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;V_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; are the [[root mean square]] (RMS) voltage levels of the carrier signal and noise respectively.
 
''C''/''N'' ratios are often specified in [[decibel]]s (dB):
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac {C}{N} \right) = C_{dBm} - N_{dBm}
&lt;/math&gt;
or in term of voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{CNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{V_C}{V_N} \right)^2 = 20 \log_{10}\left( \frac {V_C}{V_N} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

==CNR measurements and estimation==

The ''C/N'' ratio is measured in a manner similar to the way the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (''S/N'') is measured, and both specifications give an indication of the quality of a communications channel.

In the famous [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]], the ''C/N'' ratio is equivalent to the ''S/N'' ratio. The ''C/N'' ratio resembles the [[carrier-to-interference ratio]] (''C/I'', '''CIR'''), and the [[carrier-to-noise-and-interference ratio]], ''C/(N+I)'' or '''CNIR'''.
 
''C/N'' estimators &lt;ref&gt;Islam2008&lt;/ref&gt; are needed to optimize the receiver performance. Typically, it is easier to measure  the total
power than the ratio of signal power to noise power (or noise power spectral density), and that is why CNR [[estimation]] techniques are timely and important.

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Crawl ratio''' is a term used in the automotive world to describe the highest [[gear ratio]] that a vehicle is capable of. Note that gear ratio, also known as speed ratio, of a gear train is defined as the ratio of the angular velocity of the input gear to the angular velocity of the output gear, and thus a higher gear ratio implies a larger speed reduction, i.e. the input speed is reduced more at the output. The highest gear ratio is obtained at either first gear or reverse gear, but only first gear is typically taken into consideration while talking about crawl ratio. A potentially confusing terminology is that although a better crawl ratio is achieved by a higher gear ratio, it is common to refer to a better crawl ratio as “lower crawl ratio” rather than “higher crawl ratio” as it is obtained by lowering the engine speed more.

The crawl ratio is aptly named because when a vehicle is driven using the lowest gear (i.e. first gear), it moves the slowest (i.e. crawl speed) at a given engine [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and thus produces the highest output [[torque]] (i.e. crawl torque) at the road [[wheel]]s due to conservation of power.

Since crawl ratio of a vehicle represents the total reduction of the engine speed until the road wheels, it is determined by combining the contributions of different elements on the entire [[drive train]], including [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] and [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]], both of which typically introduce a certain amount of speed reduction.

Since a lower crawl ratio (higher gear ratio) implies a larger output torque on the road wheels, it is desirable for vehicles that need to pull large loads, climb steep inclines, or drive over obstacles on the road or terrain, such as rocks, which is sometimes referred to as crawling over the rocks. Therefore, crawl ratios are most often discussed for large [[SUV]]s, [[truck]]s and [[off-road vehicle]]s.

Note that tire size (or dimensions of the road wheels) does not affect the gear ratio of a vehicle, and thus using a different size tire on the same vehicle does not affect the torque on the road wheels or the crawl ratio. However, for a given engine speed and a gear ratio, the output force on the road wheels decreases as the tire size increases. A lower force in turn decreases the acceleration of rotating wheels. Therefore, the smallest tires that are still big enough to drive over obstacles perform better for a given crawl ratio.

Crawl ratio can vary greatly among vehicles. Crawl ratios in the 60's (i.e. a gear ratio of 60:1) are quite capable; in the 80's, very respectable; in the 110's, impressive; and anything beyond the 130's is usually considered as the point of diminishing returns.

'''Cyphonism''' ([[Greek language|Gr]] {{Lang|el|κυφωνισμός}}, from {{Lang|el|κῡφός}}, "bent, crooked") was a form of punishment by the {{Lang|el|κύφων}} (''kyphon''), a sort of wooden [[pillory]] by which the neck of the malefactor was bent or weighed downward. Formerly, this term was widely believed to refer to a form of punishment in which the criminal's naked body was smeared with honey, and exposed him to flies, wasps, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12547">A '''day-fine''', '''day fine''', '''unit fine''' or '''structured fine''' is a unit of [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] payment that, above a minimum fine, is based on the offender's daily [[personal income]]. A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days, or with fines. As incarceration is a financial [[punishment]], in the effect of preventing work, a day-fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary. It is argued to be just, because if both high-income and low-income population are punished with the same jail time, they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss. An analogy may be drawn with [[income tax]], which is also proportional to the income, even [[progressive tax|progressively]].

Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland ({{lang-fi|päiväsakko}}), Estonia ({{lang-et|päevamäär}}), Sweden ({{lang-sv|dagsbot}}), Denmark ({{lang-da|dagbøde}}), Germany ({{lang-de|Tagessatz}}), Switzerland,  and Macao.

==Distribution==
Unit fine systems are common and standard in many jurisdictions across the world, notably in [[Fenno-Scandinavia]], where it originated in 1921 in [[Finland]], and in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}.

===Finland===
[[Image:Poliiseja ja rajavartijoita partioveneellä.jpg|thumb|right|Both police and the [[Finnish Border Guard]] can make a formal demand for fining a person or order a petty fine.]]
In [[Finland]], the day-fine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine. The system has been in use since 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Law 130/1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Suzanne Daley]]  |agency= |title=Speeding in Finland Can Cost a Fortune, if You Already Have One |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/world/europe/speeding-in-finland-can-cost-a-fortune-if-you-already-have-one.html |quote=In fact, the Finnish “day fine” system, also in use in some other Scandinavian countries, dates to the 1920s, when fines based on income were instituted for all manner of lesser crimes, such as petty theft and assault, and helped greatly reduce the prison population. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 25, 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine (''rikesakko'', ''ordningsbot'') such as minor traffic and water traffic violations,
[[litter]]ing, and breaches of public peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 Criminal Code (''Rikoslaki'' 39/1889)] Chapter 2a, 9 §] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt, but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1983/19830066 ''Laki rikesakkomenettelystä'', 6§ and 12 §.] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Valtionsyyttäjä Ari Kuusimäki ja kihlakunnansyyttäjät Johanna Hervonen sekä Tommi Hietanen.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish prosecutors have considerable judicial power in deciding fines. Here, prosecutors are arriving at a court of law.]]
Most infractions are punishable with a day-fine. For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison, the fine may be summarily ordered by the [[prosecutor]] if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case. The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined. The suspect has one week to contest the demand. If the suspect does not contest the demand, the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer. If the suspect contests the demand, the case may be taken to the [[Judicial system of Finland#District Courts|district court]] if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty. If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine, the case is always taken to the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1993/19930692 ''Laki rangaistusmääräysmenettelystä'' (692/1992)] Retrieved 9-27-2007 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine, the district court has a [[quorum]] with a single member.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1734/17340004000 ''Oikeudenkäymiskaari'' (4/1734)], Chapter 2, 6 §. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine is paid to the bank using a [[giro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oikeus.fi/oikeusrekisterikeskus/13536.htm Oikeusrekisterikeskus. ''Täytäntöönpano- ja perintäasiat''].

A Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 day-fine, up to a maximum of 120 day-fines. If several crimes are punished together, 240 day-fines may be sentenced. The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence, unless the prison sentence is probational. The minimum amount of a day-fine is 6 [[euro]]s. Usually, the day-fine is one half of daily disposable income. The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the person's monthly mean income during the year, after taxes, social security payments and a basic living allowance of €255 per month have been deducted. In addition, every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by €3. The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 ''Rikoslaki'' (39/1889), Chapter 2a].

Retrieved 27-9-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For speeding in traffic, however, the fine is at least as high as the petty fine, i.e. €115.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2001/20011037 ''Asetus päiväsakon rahamäärästä''], 7§. Retrieved 27-9-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person who is punished with a fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income. Lying about one's income ({{lang-fi|sakkovilppi}}, {{lang-sv|bötesfusk}}) is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1889/18890039001 ''Rikoslaki'' (39/1889)], Chapter 16, 6 §. Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police can, however, access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a real-time datalink, so the chance of lying successfully is minor. There is no maximum day-fine, which may lead to considerably high fines for high-income persons. For example, in 2001, a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros, received a relatively mild punishment of six day-fines, amounting €26,000, for driving though a red traffic light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/Nokian%20Ala-Pietil%C3%A4n%20208000%20markan%20sakot%20voivat%20viel%C3%A4%20nousta/art-1288335939159.html Nokian Ala-Pietilän 208000 markan sakot voivat vielä nousta] Iltasanomat 11-9-2001.

This has given rise to some criticism, most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament, avid motorist [[Klaus Bremer]] and other MPs of right-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/ptk_73_2000_ke_p_7.shtml ''Täysistunnon pöytäkirja PTK 73/2000 vp'' (The minutes of the plenary session of Finnish parliament, PTK 73/2000 vp.)] Retrieved 9-27-2007. {{fi icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615013709/http://www.riksdagen.fi/faktatmp/utatmp/akxtmp/ptk_73_2000_ke_p_7.shtml |date=June 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fines are subject to recovery proceedings. If the fines are still not paid, the court may convert them to a prison sentence. Three day-fines will be converted to one day of imprisonment, ignoring the remainder for any amount of day-fines not divisible by three, and the length of the sentence must be between 4 and 60 days. This "conversion punishment" ({{lang-fi|muuntorangaistus}}, {{lang-sv|förvandlingsstraff}}) is only ever applied to court-ordered fines, not those issued by police.

===India===

Day fines are a concept to which little thought has been given in India. Undeniably, prisons are overcrowded and disproportionately represent religious minorities and socio-economically vulnerable castes and tribal groups. It is however unclear how much of this is due to fines. The IPC provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for non-payment of fines. Where no upper monetary caps are specified, the IPC does not gives courts discretion to impose fines which are “unlimited” but not “excessive”. While specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the IPC, several underlying actions would need to be done before pressing day fines into service.

'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE, which conceived it as the [[rhetoric]]al practice of emulating, adapting, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; It is a departure from the concept of [[mimesis]] which only is concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==History==
Three centuries after Aristotle's ''Poetics'', from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of ''mimesis'' as a [[literary method]] had shifted from "imitation of nature" to "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' three volume work ''On mimesis'' (''On imitation''), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; For Dionysian ''imitatio'', the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"&gt;West (1979) pp.5–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that "everything has been said already", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not [[originality]], but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was [[Quintilian]], who shared with him the view of ''imitatio'' as the practice that leads to an [[History of ideas|historical progress]] of literature over time.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss ''imitation'' exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric.&lt;ref name="West79p5-8"/&gt; In Quintilian, and in [[classical rhetoric]] in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the [[four operations of quadripartita ratio]] that organize all the [[figures of speech]], defined as a "ready-made framework" of "relatively mechanical procedures" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008), quote from the summary: {{quotation|The variety of ways to adapt and enrich source texts, as discussed by Erasmus in De Copia Rerum, are discussed in chapter 5. [...] Classical rhetoric had already developed a theory of these kinds of intervention, drawing attention to the process of adaptation [...] If a topic had been treated by an earlier author, this was no reason to avoid it, but one had to try to emulate one's predecessor. The use of rhetoric enabled authors to discuss the same topic in several ways, to be little a great subject, and to accord greatness to something small, for example, or to renew the old, and express the new in an old-fashioned manner. [...] Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of rhetoric was taken by [[Erasmus]] in ''[[De Copia Rerum]]''.&lt;ref name="Jansen"/&gt;

== Mimesis ==
Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''[[mimesis]]'' formulated by [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors."&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; In [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[lyric poetry]], [[epic poetry]], drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of [[mimesis]].

The '''disquotational principle''' is a philosophical [[theorem]]{{Citation needed|reason=What/where is the proof?|date=January 2018}} which holds that a rational speaker will accept "''p''" if and only if he or she believes ''p''. The quotes indicate that the statement ''p'' [[use–mention distinction|is being treated as a sentence, and not as a proposition]]. This principle is presupposed by claims that hold that [[First-order_logic#Equality_and_its_axioms|substitution]] fails in certain [[intension]]al contexts.

==Overview==
Consider the following argument:
:(1) Sally accepts the assertion that "[[Cicero]] was a famous [[orator]]" while dissenting from the assertion that "Tully was a famous [[orator]]".
:(2) Cicero is Tully
:Therefore, (3) Sally believes that Tully was a famous orator.

To derive (3), we have to assume that when Sally accepts that "Cicero was a famous orator", she believes that Cicero was a famous orator. Then we can exchange Cicero for Tully, and derive (3). [[Bertrand Russell]] thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in [[intension]]al contexts.

In "A Puzzle about Belief,"&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "A Puzzle about Belief." First appeared in, ''Meaning and Use''. ed., A. Margalit. Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1979. pp. 239–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own, without appeal to the substitution principle, and that this may show that the problem lies with the former, and not the latter. There are various formulations of this argument.

Suppose that, Pierre, a Frenchman, comes to believe that (1) "''Londres est jolie''" (London is pretty), without ever having visited the city. Later in life, Pierre ends up living in London. He finds no French speakers there (he does not speak English yet), and everyone refers to the city as "London," not ''Londres''. He finds this city decidedly unattractive, for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive. Over time, he learns English, and formulates the belief that (2) "''London is not pretty''". Pierre never realizes that London is the English word for ''Londres''. Now with the disquotational principle, we can deduce from (1) that Pierre believes the proposition that ''Londres est jolie''. With a weak principle of translation (e.g., "a proposition in language A is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language B" [note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence]), we can now deduce that Pierre believes that London is pretty. But we can also deduce from (2) and the disquotational principle that Pierre believes that London is not pretty. These deductions can be made ''even though Pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs''. Without the disquotational principle, this contradiction could not be derived, because we would not be able to assume that (1) and (2) meant anything in particular.

This paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language. Suppose that Pierre assents to the proposition that "[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] had musical talent", perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist. With the disquotational principle, we can deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had musical talent. Now suppose that Pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman, [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]], without knowing that the two Paderewskis are the same man. Pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music, and this leads him to the belief that Paderewski had no musical talent. The disquotation principle allows us to deduce that Pierre believes the proposition that Paderewski had no musical talent. Using this principle, we have now deduced that Pierre believes that Paderewski had musical talent, and does not believe that Paderewski had musical talent, ''even though Pierre's beliefs were formed logically''.

'''Gapjil''' ([[Hangul]]: 갑질) refers to the arrogant and authoritarian attitude or actions of people in [[South Korea]] who have positions of power over others.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opendict.korean.go.kr/dictionary/view?sense_no=1295950&amp;viewType=confirm|title=우리말샘 - 내용 보기|publisher=opendict.korean.go.kr|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gapjil is a [[neologism]] made by combining the word '''Gap''' (갑; 甲)—which is used to introduce the first party in a contract, but also refers to a party's superior status—and '''jil''' (-질), a [[suffix]] that negatively refers to particular actions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.econovill.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=277288|title=끊이지 않는 '갑질'의 역사, 유형을 진단해 보면 - 이코노믹리뷰|date=2016-01-12|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2070466&amp;cid=55570&amp;categoryId=55570|title=갑을관계|access-date=2017-12-03|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a phenomenon associated with the hierarchical nature of Korean society and work culture—a structure which results in the social superiority of those with higher wealth. Various incidents, such as the [[nutrage|nut rage]], have brought this phenomenon to the attention of the world media.

== Causes ==
Song Jae-ryung, a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Kyung Hee University|Kyunghee University]], points out that Gapjil is not simply a matter of an individual's [[morality]], but a societal problem. As the bottom of Korean society is constituted by the repressive role of Gap and submissive attitude of Eul, individuals follow the [[culture]] of the elite. In other words, the cause of gapjil is a cultural tendency for people to merely perform the roles which are shaped by the high [[power distance]] in Korea. This is why an individual who was Eul in another situation is doing the same thing (gapjil) in another relationship when he or she becomes another Gap. In order to solve the gapjil problem, Prof. Song says, each individual needs to admit the social position that is different horizontally, not vertically, and the social atmosphere that fosters this awareness needs to be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kukinews.com/news/article.html?no=359870|title=[기획] "돈이면 다냐?" 갑갑한 대한민국… 갑(甲)질 공통점 살펴보니…|publisher=news.kukinews.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of gapjil ==
According to an article in Economic Review, a Korean magazine, there are some obvious types of gapjil depending on the context: owner gapjil, push-driven distribution gapjil, and passion-pay.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Owner gapjil ===
'Owner gapjil' is the most common type of gapjil, where representatives or [[Chaebol|executive family members of a company]] treat their employees with contempt, using abusive language or even assault. Owner gapjil reflects the mistaken view that employers can treat employees however they want because of the extreme vertical relationship between the two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 'Monggo Food' Kim Man-sik scandal ====
On 23 December 2015, there was a report that Kim Man-sik, honorary president of Monggo Food, had used abusive language and assaulted his [[chauffeur]] 'B'. The assaulted employee said, "President Kim indulges in violence and hurl abuses almost like a habit, if his mood is bad". After Monggo Food posted an apology on its website on 23 December, Kim Man-sik and Kim Hyeon-seung, CEO of the firm, apologized to the public and to the person directly involved, on 25 December in a press conference. Although there had been a disagreement with victims concerning a problem of reinstatement, an amicable settlement was made with the victims of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilyosisa.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=92779|title=몽고식품 '긴박했던 4박5일' 풀스토리 - 일요시사|date=2015-12-31|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2016, the Masan Branch of the Changwon District Public Prosecutor's Office requested that Kim Man-sik issue a summary order of 7,000,000 [[South Korean won|won]] (about 6,000 dollars as of July 2018) in fines relating to habitual assaults, violence and violation of labour standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sisafocus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=144705|title='회장님 갑질' 몽고식품 김만식 전 회장 벌금형|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'M&amp;M' Choi Cheol-won scandal ====
In October 2010, Choi Cheol-won, the CEO of M&amp;M, called a tank truck driver—who had gone on a demonstration in front of the [[SK Group|SK]] headquarters—to his office and assaulted them with such things as a baseball bat. As a result, the driver suffered injuries requiring two weeks of medical treatment. This incident was reported in the [[editorial]] program of [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], which aired on 28 November 2010. Huge amounts of public criticism, particularly resulting from a memorandum that had been written to certify that the driver was given 20,000,000 won (about 20,000 dollars as of July 2018) as compensation for the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/778110|title="SK 최태원 회장 사촌동생, 야구방망이로 노동자 폭행"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Choi Cheol-won had been charged on 30 November, the police started to investigate the scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00003&amp;news_seq_no=1016552|title=경찰 '맷값 폭행' 최철원 입국 통보 요청|publisher=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2011, the [[Seoul]] Central District [[Court]] sentenced him to 18 months in prison and the appellate tribunal sentenced him to 18 months in prison with three years of [[probation]] and 120 hours of community service. The judgement of the court's decision saying, "Social criticism is a reason for the sentence" caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fnnews.com/news/201102081101576523?t=y|title='맷값 폭행'최철원 징역 1년6월|date=2011-02-08|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 'Korean Air' Cho Hyun-min scandal ====
When [[Korean Air]] executive ‘Cho Hyun-min’ allegedly sprayed water on company's employees, foreign media paid attention. In March 2018, the allegations of yelling and spraying water to an advertising agent caused rising controversy. When concerns over Cho's behavior became widespread, Korean Air explained, “It is true that during the meeting, the water rose and splashed when the bucket fell on the floor, but it did not spray water on the staff”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}  Cho apologized for her behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2018/04/15/0302000000AEN20180415000800320.html|title=Korean Air heiress returns home amid probe into violent tantrum|work=Yonhap News Agency|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident caused many foreign media to start using the word "gapjil" directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/asia/nut-rage-sister-korean-air.html|title=Sister of Korean ‘Nut Rage’ Heiress Accused of Throwing Her Own Tantrum|last=Sang-Hun|first=Choe|date=2018-04-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Push-driven distribution gapjil ===
'Push-driven distribution gapjil' is a type of gapjil where large corporations make pressing delivery (or supply) demands to small businesses (franchises).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Namyang Dairy Products Corporation high-pressure sales to franchises scandal ====
[[File:Namyang logo.png|thumb|logo of Namyang]]
In May 2013, Namyang Co. was criticised following an accusation that the firm had pressed local franchises to buy products for a long time, as well as a tape-recording of rough words to local owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ktv.go.kr/content/view?content_id=462589|title='밀어내기' 전방위 조사···남양유업 '사과'|publisher=ktv.go.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namyang Co. caused more than 20 billion wons' worth (about 18 million dollars as of July 2018) of damage through illegal activities—such as high-pressure sales and shifting wages of salesmen to local franchises—for the past seven years, for which the Seoul Central District Court convicted it in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?code=940301&amp;artid=201401242119415|title=법원 "남양유업 '밀어내기' 모두 유죄 인정"|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this case, the chronic gapjil problem in Korean society became a public social issue. There was also a boycott against Namyang Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201305101519365078|title=남양유업 사과, 진정성이 없다 [YTN FM]|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hyundai Mobis high-pressure sales scandal ====
[[File:Hyundai Mobis Logo.svg|thumb|Hyundai Mobis Logo]]
In September 2017, [[Hyundai Mobis]] was suspected of pressure to achieve sales goals and forced sales by 1600 branches of local maintenance shops from January 2010 to November 2013. The manager of the local shops was pressed to buy unnecessary parts of an automobile under the name of "Random Sales" and "Negotiated Sales" in order to achieve the goal of the head office. Hyundai Mobis admitted carrying out these acts and since then has been establishing a plan to ensure they do not reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20170911/86278451/1|title=현대모비스 '물량 밀어내기' 혐의 인정… 공정위 "미흡하다"|date=2017-09-12|work=동아닷컴|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passion-pay ===
[[File:Lee Sang-Bong from acrofan.jpg|thumb|Lie Sang Bong]]
Passion-pay is a type of labour extortion where the corporation pays less than minimum wage, or even nothing, for the labor of young job seekers who have trouble finding a job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Lie Sang Bong Design Studio's passion-pay scandal ====

In January 2015, Lie Sang Bong design studio, which is managed by Korean fashion designer Lie Sang Bong, was embroiled in controversy about passion-pay. Although the studio imposed excessive workloads on workers, the studio offered relatively low wages: 100,000 won (about 100 dollars as of July 2018) for apprentices, 300,000 won (about 300 dollars) for interns and 1,100,000 won (about 1,100 dollars) for regular workers. After the controversy, Lie Sang Bong said "I deeply apologized to the youths of the fashion industry who get hurt with working environment and treatment, and I'll try to improve the overall problem of the fashion industry in this opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0103_201501151554510194|title='열정페이' 논란 이상봉 결국 사과|publisher=www.ytn.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seoul National University Hospital.jpg|thumb|Seoul National University Hospital]]

==== Seoul National University Hospital nurse passion-pay scandal ====
In September 2017, [[Seoul National University Hospital]] (SNUH) was in a controversy because it did passion-pay on newly graduated nurses for five years since 2012, for "probationary education period". It turned out that SNUH only paid 360,000 won (about 360 dollars as of July 2018) for 24 days work to 1,212 nurses in their period of education. Based on an eight hour working day, the sum of 360,000 won is equivalent to an hourly rate of 1,800 won (about 2 dollars), which is far below the [[minimum wage]] of 6,470 won (about 6 dollars). The hospital explained that they did not know whether they should pay full wages during the training session. In addition, they plan to provide retroactive payment to nurses under three years, which is a period appointed by the recent labor standard law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=0011807211&amp;code=61121211&amp;sid1=o|title=서울대병원 첫 월급 36만원…용돈보다 적은 간호사 열정페이|publisher=news.kmib.co.kr|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social responses ==
=== Boycott ===
[[Boycott]] can be defined as a movement of consumers' refusal to buy a particular item in order to accomplish a specific purpose.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1104927&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31614|title=불매운동|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike gapjil (which is a structural problem between 'Gap' and 'Eul', like the franchise-maker and the retailer), the boycott campaign showed that it can explode instantly when the problem touches consumer's feelings.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the-pr.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24561|title=갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알|date=2017-10-02|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because consumers think that not consuming products of gapjil firms is the best thing they can do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.insight.co.kr/news/78758|title=소비자 불매운동 불러온 대한민국 '갑질' 7|work=인사이트|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko-KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement suggests that the gapjil of company owners or executives is becoming a 'self-harm' activity which decreases corporate profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news2day.co.kr/82049|title=[뉴투기획] 똘똘 뭉친 소비자들, 갑질기업에 불매운동으로 응징|publisher=www.news2day.co.kr|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasize that in order to reduce corporate ethical problems, such as gapjil, consumers need to change their perception as a consumer in a larger frame of mind. Corporations will be changed when consumer involvement such as resentment at gapjil and boycott is increased.&lt;ref name="갑질과 불매는 비례하지 않는다? - 더피알"/&gt; A consumer movement group staged boycott campaigns and received favourable responses from consumers, but there has not yet been a massive and organised boycott.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 24-hour call center for reporting damages by gapjil ===
On 11 April 2016, the Korean [[civil society organisation]] Public Welfare Committee (PWC) opened a 24-hour [[call centre]] for reporting gapjil damages and behavior. It is operated for rooting out irregular practices. PWC explained that the purpose of the call center was to prevent gapjil behavior, which is prevalent in South Korean society, and to conduct criminal and civil measures through case verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/739236.html#csidxb1f9587a88ced499d98289a45266476|title="잘못된 갑질 신고하세요"시민단체 24시간 콜센터|date=2016-04-11|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governmental responses ==

=== Investigation of gapjil ===
[[File:Emblem of the Korea Fair Trade Commission (South Korea) (English).svg|thumb|Korean Fair Trade Commission Logo]]
After Kim Sang-jo was inaugurated as chairperson of the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean Fair Trade Commission]] (FTC), the FTC started an investigation of all industrial head offices and franchises to resolve all gapjil cases in four major areas: [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]], subcontract, and [[Franchising|franchise]].

Beginning 10 August 2017, the FTC began investigating the transactions between headquarters and agencies, which targeted about 4,800 headquarters, 70 franchises and group of franchises of all domestic industry. The investigation was conducted as a survey targeting the headquarters between August and September, and since then targeted the franchises and groups of franchises from September to December. The FTC said the purpose of the investigation was to secure basic data to prevent unfair trade practices between headquarters and franchises, in order to prepare policies and improve the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pressian.com/news/article.html?no=165286|title=공정위, '갑질' 정조준...70만개 대리점 전수조사|publisher=www.pressian.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ombudsman ===
In July 2017, the FTC established an [[ombudsman]] for permanent surveillance of protection measures about franchises. The ombudsman was organised with former and current merchants with experience in franchise trading and 13 members of the FTC. They planned to expand the members to 30, including wholesale, retail, and service sectors. The ombudsman regularly monitors trading practices in franchise sectors and reports to the FTC when signs of unfair trade are detected. In addition, they state their opinion in policy enforcement, and they suggest ideas to improve the system by collecting problems information on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/804522.html|title=프랜차이즈 갑질, 공정위가 상시 감시한다|date=2017-07-27|access-date=2017-11-05|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfair damage counseling center in Seoul ===
[[File:Seal of Seoul Metropolitan Government.png|thumb|Seal of Seoul|alt=|150x150px]]
For the first time in local government, the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] started to eradicate unfair practices in the franchise industry, declaring, "2016 economic democratisation city, Seoul". The Seoul Metropolitan Government has operated an unfair damage counselling centre, where anyone who suffered from unfair damages can report their case through the member's office.

Not only the franchiser who is operating the franchise but also an ex-franchiser and even a group of franchisers can report and gather unfair cases of members. When the report is received, first, the government identifies the exact facts of the incident through an in-depth consultation with the franchiser who reported the incident, then meeting with a group of franchisers. According to the issue, the government recommends to the headquarters of the franchise a voluntary corrective action or handles arrangements. Depending on the degree of violation of the law, the investigation request to the FTC or the prosecution are reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ecomedia.co.kr/news/newsview.php?ncode=1065594442127896|title=서울시, 프랜차이즈 가맹정 '갑(甲)질 피해' 실태점검|work=환경미디어}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media responses ==
In December 2014, the [[nut rage incident]] was covered by numerous international media, and gapjil reached a level of global prominence. In February 2015, the [[Reuters]] news agency reported about Korean gapjil culture and the judgement of the nut rage incident. According to the article, it seemed that Korean gapjil culture originates from a traditional vertical hierarchy in Korean society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-nuts-backlash/nut-rage-prompts-south-korea-to-consider-law-against-high-handed-conduct-idUSKBN0LJ05Z20150215|title='Nut rage' prompts South Korea to consider law against high-handed conduct|date=February 15, 2015|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, ''[[The Independent]]'', British newspaper, reported on the No-Look Pass issue of Korean politician [[Kim Moo-sung]], and pointed out that most gapjil is done by Korean adult men, especially middle aged men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/south-korean-politician-kim-moo-sung-suitcase-push-viral-video-entitled-middle-aged-men-a7753041.html|title=Politician's suitcase incident goes viral for summing up entitled middle-aged men|date=2017-05-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an essential component of the Dzogchen tradition for both the [[Bonpo]] and the [[Nyingmapa]].{{sfn|Rossi|1999|p=52}}{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354}} Knowledge of this ''Ground'' is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{refn|group=note|Wylie: rig pa; [[IAST]]: vidyā){{Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=336}}}}

==Etymology==
The {{bo|t=གཞི|w=gzhi}} has been rendered as 'Base', 'Basis', 'Ground' and 'Ground of Being' amongst other English glosses. According to [[Dudjom Rinpoche|Dudjom]] the original Sanskrit-term is ''āśraya'' ([[IAST]]; Sanskrit Devanagari: आश्रय; [[w:Etymology|Etymology]]: आ- √श्रि),{{sfn|Dudjom Rinpoche|Jikdrel Yeshe Dorje|1991|p=354 Index of Technical Terms}}{{refn|group=note|name="āśraya"|According to ''A Dictionary of Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2003, 2004&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://glossary.buddhistdoor.com/en/word/15491/asraya Charles Muller, Tokyo Gakuen University (1997), "āśraya"] accessed 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; "āśraya" is a synonym for ''[[ālaya-vijñāna]]'', the "store-house-consciousness. }} but it could also be ''sthāna''.

[[Sam van Schaik]] states that ''gzhi'' is to be distinguished from ''kun gzhi''. In the [[Menngagde|Seminal Heart]] series a distinction is made between ''kun gzhi'', c.q. ''ālaya'', "the base of it all", the samsaric basis of consciousness, of all the samsaric appearances; and ''gzhi'', "the nirvanic basis known as the ground."{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}{{refn|group=note|Sam van Schaik: "....the Seminal Heart distinction between two types of basis, the nirvanic basis known as the ground (gzhi) and the samsaric basis of consciousness, the ālaya (kun gzhi).{{sfn|Schaik|2004}}}}

==Three qualities==
[[File:Sam Taeguk.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Gankyil]]]]
According to the Dzogchen-teachings, the ''Ground'' or [[Buddha-nature]] has three qualities:{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Petit|1999|p=78-79}}
* ''ngo bo'', "essence", openness or emptiness ({{bo|w=ngo bo stong pa}}), 
* ''rang bzhin'', "nature", luminosity, lucidity or clarity (as in the [[luminous mind]] of the [[Five Pure Lights]]) ({{bo|w=rang bzhin gsal ba}}),
* ''thugs rje'', "power", universal [[Karuṇā|compassionate energy]] ({{bo|w=thugs rje kun khyab}}), unobstructed ({{bo|w=ma 'gags pa}}).

(In Goodman &amp; Davidson 1992,) Herbert V. Guenther points out that this ''Ground'' is both a static potential and a dynamic unfolding. They give a [[Process philosophy|process-orientated]] translation, to avoid any essentialist associations, since
{{quote|''ngo-bo'' (facticity) has nothing to do with nor can even be reduced to the (essentialist) categories of substance and quality; [...] ''rang-bzhin'' (actuality) remains open-dimensional, rather than being or turning into a rigid essence despite its being what it is; and that ''thugs-rje'' (resonance) is an atemporal sensitivity and response, rather than a distinct and narrowly circumscribed operation.{{sfn|Goodman|Davidson|1992|p=14}}}}

The 19th/20th-century Tibetan Buddhist scholar, Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal, sees the Buddha-nature as ultimate truth,&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; nirvana, which is constituted of profundity, primordial peace and radiance:
{{quote|Buddha-nature is immaculate. It is profound, serene, unfabricated suchness, an uncompounded expanse of luminosity; nonarising, unceasing, primordial peace, spontaneously present nirvana.&lt;ref&gt;Rabjam, Shechen (2007). ''The Great Medicine: Steps in Meditation on the Enlightened Mind''. Boston: Shambhala: p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The Prayer of Kuntuzangpo==
Beings are trapped in samsara by not recognizing the ground. The ''Prayer of Kuntuzangpo'' from the Gonpa Zangthal states:
{{quote|From the beginning you beings are deluded&lt;br /&gt;
Because you do not recognize&lt;br /&gt;
The awareness of the ground{{sfn|Ranjung Yeshe|2006|p=Chapter 9}}}}

{{double image|right| Harihara V&amp;A.jpg|180| Harihara Badami.jpg |135|Left: [[Vishnu]] (left half—blue) and [[Shiva]] (right half—white). Right:  A 6th-century Harihara [[murti]] in [[Badami cave temples]] of Karnataka.}}
'''Harihara''' ([[Sanskrit]]: हरिहर) is the fused representation of [[Vishnu]] (Hari) and [[Shiva]] (Hara) from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition. Also known as '''Shankaranarayana''' ("Shankara" is Shiva, and "Narayana" is Vishnu) like '''Brahmanarayana'''
(Half represents [[Brahma]] and half represents [[Vishnu]]), Harihara is thus revered by both [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavites]] and [[Shaivism|Shaivites]] as a form of the Supreme God. 

''Harihara'' is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called [[Brahman]]. This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and "oneness of all existence" is discussed as Harihara in the texts of [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;David Leeming (2001), A Dictionary of Asian Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195120530}}, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara, with one half of the image as Shiva and other half as Vishnu, are found in the surviving cave temples of India, such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th-century [[Badami cave temples]].&lt;ref&gt;Alice Boner (1990), Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807051}}, pages 89-95, 115-124, 174-184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TA Gopinatha Rao (1993), Elements of Hindu iconography, Vol 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120808775}}, pages 334-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:Indian god-sivakesava.JPG|thumb|[[Vishnu]] ( holding [[Sudarshana Chakra]]) and [[Shiva]] (lighter coloured half, wearing tiger skin,  holding [[Trishula]]) combined in a single Harihara [[murti]], sometimes referred to as ''Sivakesava''and "Haryadhamurti".]]
The diversity within Hinduism encourages a wide variety of beliefs and traditions, of which two important and large traditions are associated with Vishnu and Shiva. Some schools focus on Vishnu (including his associated [[avatar]]s such as Rama and Krishna) as the Supreme God, and others on Shiva (including his different avatars such as Mahadeva and Pashupata). The [[Puranas]] and various Hindu traditions treat both Shiva and Vishnu as being different aspects of the one [[Brahman]]. Harihara is a symbolic representation of this idea. A similar idea, called [[Ardhanarishvara]] or ''Naranari'', fuses masculine and feminine deities as one and equivalent representation in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Goldberg (2002), The Lord who is half woman: Ardhanārīśvara in Indian and feminist perspective, SUNY Press, {{ISBN|0-791453251}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on which scriptures (and translations) are quoted, evidence is available to support each of the different arguments. In most cases, even if one personality is taken as being superior over the other, much respect is still offered to both Vishnu and Shiva by the other's worshippers (i.e. Shiva is still regarded as being above the level of an ordinary [[jiva]] and 'the greatest of the Vaishnavas' by Vaishnavas who worship only Vishnu).&lt;ref&gt;"Lord Sambhu [Siva] the greatest of Vaishnavas and vice versa" from [http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 Bhag-Purana 12.13.16] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009160352/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/12/13/16/en1 |date=9 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One and the same===
[[Sivananda]] states: "Shiva and Vishnu are one and the same entity. They are essentially one and the same. They are the names given to the different aspects of the all-pervading Supreme [[Parabrahman]] the [[Supreme Being]] or the Absolute. ‘Sivasya hridayam vishnur-vishnoscha hridayam sivah—Vishnu is the heart of Shiva and likewise Shiva is the heart of Vishnu’."

[[Swaminarayan]] holds that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll], verses 47, 84, of their scripture, [[Shikshapatri]], [http://www.kakaji.org/shikshapatri_verses.asp?catid=viewAll] states, "And the oneness of [[Narayana]] and [[Shiva]] should be understood, as the Vedas have described both to be brahmaroopa, or form of [[Brahman]], i.e., [[Saguna Brahman]], indicating that Vishnu and Shiva are different forms of the one and same God.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=2&amp;MediaType= Swaminarayan Satsang - Scriptures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716171647/http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/index.asp?idCategory=2&amp;curPage=2&amp;MediaType= |date=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayansatsang.com/library/scriptures/scriptureexplanation.asp?IDProduct=762&amp;idcategory=2=&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Swaminarayan view is a minority view among Vaishnavites, but the dominant view in contemporary [[Hinduism]] which follows the [[Smarta]] view in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hinduism.iskcon.com/tradition/1204.htm Heart of Hinduism: The Smarta Tradition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Harihara is depicted in art as split down the middle, one half representing Shiva, the other half representing Vishnu.  The Shiva half will have the matted locks of a yogic master piled high on his head and sometimes will wear a tiger skin, reserved for the most revered ascetics.  Shiva's pale skin may be read as ash-covered in his role as an ascetic.  The Vishnu half will wear a tall [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and other [[jewelry]], representing his responsibility for maintaining world order.  Vishnu's black skin represents holiness.  Broadly, these distinctions serve to represent the duality of humble religious influence in the ascetic and authoritative secular power in the king or householder.&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Thousand Years of Art.  Phaidon Press Limited.  p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in other aspects Shiva also takes on the authoritative position of householder, a position which is [[Shiva#Ascetic versus householder|directly at odds]] with the ascetic position depicted in his Harihara manifestation.

Harihara has been part of temple iconography throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia, with some illustrations listed in the following table. In some states, the concept of Harihara appears through alternate names and its progeny; for example, temples incorporating [[Ayyappan]] and [[Shasta (deity)|Shasta]] deities in [[Kerala]] illustrate this Hindu tradition there since at least the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0816054589}}, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

In molecular [[spectroscopy]], a '''Jablonski diagram''' is a diagram that illustrates the [[electronic state]]s of a [[molecule]] and the transitions between them. The states are arranged vertically by energy and grouped horizontally by [[term symbol|spin multiplicity]]. [[Conical_intersection|Nonradiative transitions]] are indicated by squiggly arrows and [[Photoluminescence|radiative transitions]] by straight arrows. The vibrational ground states of each electronic state are indicated with thick lines, the higher vibrational states with thinner lines.&lt;ref&gt; P., Atkins, P., de Paula, J. ''Atkins' Physical Chemistry'', Oxford University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-879285-9}} &lt;/ref&gt;
The diagram is named after the Polish physicist [[Aleksander Jabłoński]].&lt;ref&gt;Jabłoński, Aleksander "Efficiency of Anti-Stokes Fluorescence in Dyes" Nature 1933, volume 131, pp. 839-840.  {{doi|10.1038/131839b0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transitions==
[[Image:Jablonski Diagram of Fluorescence Only.png|thumb|Jablonski diagram including vibrational levels for absorbance, non-radiative decay, and [[fluorescence]].]]
Radiative transitions involve the absorption, if the transition occurs to a higher energy level, or the emission, in the reverse case, of a [[photon]]. Nonradiative transitions arise through several different mechanisms, all differently labeled in the diagram. Relaxation of the excited state to its lowest vibrational level is called [[Vibrational energy relaxation|vibrational relaxation]]. This process involves the dissipation of energy from the molecule to its surroundings, and thus it cannot occur for isolated molecules. A second type of nonradiative transition is [[Internal conversion (chemistry)|internal conversion]] (IC), which occurs when a vibrational state of an electronically excited state can couple to a vibrational state of a lower electronic state. A third type is [[intersystem crossing]] (ISC); this is a transition to a state with a different spin multiplicity. In molecules with large [[spin-orbit coupling]], intersystem crossing is much more important than in molecules that exhibit only small spin-orbit coupling. ISC can be followed by [[phosphorescence]].

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4892">In [[conservation biology]], '''latent extinction risk''' is a measure of the potential for a species to become threatened.

Latent risk can most easily be described as the difference, or discrepancy, between the current observed extinction risk of a species (typically as quantified by the [[IUCN Red List]]) and the theoretical extinction risk of a species predicted by its biological or [[Biological life cycle|life history]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103"&gt;{{citation|last=Cardillo|first=M.|last2=Mace|first2=G. M.|last3=Gittleman|first3=J. L.|last4=Purvis|first4=A.|title=Latent extinction risk and the future battlegrounds of mammal conservation|year=2006|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=103|issue=11|pages=4157–61|doi=10.1073/pnas.0510541103|pmid=16537501|pmc=1449663}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation==
Because latent risk is the discrepancy between current and predicted risks, estimates of both of these values are required (See [[population modeling]] and [[population dynamics]]). Once these values are known, the latent extinction risk can be calculated as ''Predicted Risk - Current Risk = Latent Extinction Risk.''

When the latent extinction risk is a positive value, it indicates that a species is currently less threatened than its biology would suggest it ought to be. For example, a species may have several of the characteristics often found in threatened species, such as large body size, small geographic distribution, or low reproductive rate, but still be rated as "least concern" in the IUCN Red List. This may be because it has not yet been exposed to serious threatening processes such as [[Habitat conservation|habitat degradation]].

Conversely, negative values of latent risk indicate that a species is already more threatened than its biology would indicate, probably because it inhabits a part of the world where it has been exposed to extreme endangering processes.  Species with severely low negative values are usually listed as an [[endangered species]] and have associated recovery and conservation plans.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt;

==Limits==
One of the issues associated with latent extinction risk is its difficulty to calculate because of the limited availability of data for predicting extinction risk across large numbers of species.  Hence, the only study of latent risk to date &lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt; has focused on mammals, which are one of the best-studied groups of organisms.

==Effects on conservation==
A study of latent extinction risk in mammals identified a number of "hotspots" where the average value of latent risk for mammal species was unusually high.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0510541103" /&gt; This study suggested that these areas represented an opportunity for proactive conservation efforts, because these could become the "future battlegrounds of mammal conservation" if levels of human impact increase. Unexpectedly, the hotspots of mammal latent risk include large areas of Arctic America, where overall mammal diversity is not high, but where many species have the kind of biological traits (such as large body size and slow reproductive rate) that could render them extinction-prone. Another notable region of high latent risk for mammals is the island chain of Indonesia and Melanesia, where there are large numbers of restricted-range endemic species.

Because it is much more cost-effective to prevent species declines before they happen than to attempt to rescue species from the brink of extinction, latent risk hotspots could form part of a global scheme to prioritize areas for conservation effort, together with other kinds of priority areas such as biodiversity hotspots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78199">The hypothesis of '''linguistic relativity''' holds that the structure of a [[language]] affects its speakers' [[world view]] or [[cognition]]. Also known as the '''Sapir–Whorf hypothesis''', or '''Whorfianism''', the principle is often defined to include two versions: the ''strong hypothesis'' and the ''weak hypothesis'':
*The ''strong'' version says that language ''determines'' thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.
*The ''weak'' version says that linguistic categories and usage only ''influence'' thought and decisions.

The term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis" is considered a misnomer by linguists for several reasons: [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] never co-authored any works, and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.&lt;ref&gt;Hill &amp; Mannheim (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kennison |first=Shelia |year=2013 |title=Introduction to language development |location=Los Angeles |publisher=Sage }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers, such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], who saw language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology headed by [[Franz Boas]] and Edward Sapir also embraced forms of the idea to one degree or another, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koerner|first1=E. F. Konrad|title=The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: A Preliminary History and a Bibliographical Essay|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=December 1992|volume=2|issue=2|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Sapir in particular wrote more often against than in favor of anything like [[linguistic determinism]]. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be seen as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences in human cognition and behavior. [[Harry Hoijer]], another of Sapir's students, introduced the term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;"The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis", in Hoijer 1954:92–105&lt;/ref&gt; even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;This usage is now generally seen as a misnomer. As Jane Hill and Bruce Mannheim write: Yet, just as the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire the "Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis" is neither consistent with the writings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis (Hill &amp; Mannheim 1992, p386)&lt;/ref&gt; A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]]. Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by [[Roger Brown (psychologist)|Roger Brown]] and [[Eric Lenneberg]] who conducted experiments designed to find out whether [[color perception]] varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently. As the study of the universal nature of human language and cognition came into focus in the 1960s the idea of linguistic relativity fell out of favor among linguists. A 1969 study by [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] demonstrated the existence of universal semantic constraints in the field of colour terminology which were widely seen to discredit the existence of linguistic relativity in this domain, although this conclusion has been disputed by relativist researchers.

From the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts.&lt;ref name="Koerner"&gt;Koerner, E.F.K."Towards a full pedigree of the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis: from Locke to Lucy" Chapter in {{harvcoltxt|Pütz|Verspoor|2000|p=17}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wolf|Holmes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a balanced view of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better seen as arising from [[Connectionism|connectionist]] factors. Research is focused on exploring the ways and extent to which language influences thought.&lt;ref name="Koerner" /&gt; The principle of linguistic relativity and the relation between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and it has also inspired and coloured works of fiction and the invention of [[constructed language]]s.

== Forms ==

=== Linguistic determinism ===
{{Main|Linguistic determinism}}

The strongest form of the theory is linguistic determinism, which holds that language entirely determines the range of cognitive processes. The hypothesis of linguistic determinism is now generally agreed to be false.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}

=== Linguistic influence ===

This is the weaker form, proposing that language provides constraints in some areas of cognition, but that it is by no means determinative. Research on weaker forms has produced positive [[empirical evidence]] for a relationship.{{sfn|Ahearn|2011|page=69}}

== History ==

The idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. [[Plato]] argued against [[sophist]] thinkers such as [[Gorgias of Leontini]], who held that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should reflect these ideas as accurately as possible.&lt;ref name="McComiskey2002"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bruce |last=McComiskey|title=Gorgias and the New Sophistic Rhetoric|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s3T6LYkGOqUC}}|year=2002|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2397-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Plato, [[St. Augustine]], for example, held the view that language was merely labels applied to already existing concepts. This view remained prevalent throughout the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=2}} [[Roger Bacon]] held the opinion that language was but a veil covering up eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For [[Immanuel Kant]], language was but one of several tools used by humans to experience the world.

=== German Romantic philosophers ===

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of the existence of different national characters, or "''Volksgeister''", of different ethnic groups was the moving force behind the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism.

Although himself a Swede, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] inspired several of the German Romantics. As early as 1749, he alludes to something along the lines of linguistic relativity in commenting on a passage in the table of nations in the book of Genesis: {{quote|"Everyone according to his language, according to their families, as to their nations."[Genesis 10:5] This signifies that these were according to the genius of each;  "according to their language," according to the opinion of each.... "Language," in its inner meaning, signifies opinion, thus principles and persuasions. This is because there is a correspondence of the language with the intellectual part of man, or with his thought, like that of an effect with its cause.&lt;ref&gt; ''Arcana Coelestia'' section 1059. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1059. &lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1771 he spelled this out more explicitly: {{quote|There is a common genius prevailing among those who are subject to one king, and who consequently are under one constitutional law. Germany is divided into more governments than the neighboring kingdoms.... However, a common genius prevails everywhere among people speaking the same language.&lt;ref&gt; ''True Christian Religion'' section 813. http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=813. &lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:WilhelmvonHumboldt.jpg|thumb|[[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]]]
[[Johann Georg Hamann]] is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to speak of the concept of "the genius of a language."&lt;ref&gt; Robert L. Miller ''The Linguistic Relativity Principle and Humboldtian Ethnolinguistics'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Christina McAfee "The Linguistic Relativity Theory and Benjamin Lee Whorf," ''The McMaster Journal of Communication'' Vol. 1(2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In his "Essay Concerning an Academic Question," Hamann suggests that a people's language affects their worldview:
{{quote|The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality.&lt;ref&gt; Quoted in Bernard D. Den Ouden, ''Language and Creativity: An Interdisciplinary Essay in Chomskyan Humanism,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1820, [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] connected the study of language to the national romanticist program by proposing the view that language is the fabric of thought. Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker's native language.&lt;ref name="Trabant"&gt;Trabant, Jürgen."How relativistic are Humboldts "Weltansichten"?" in {{harvnb|Pütz|Verspoor|2000|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was part of a larger picture in which the world view of an ethnic nation, their "[[world view|Weltanschauung]]", was seen as being faithfully reflected in the grammar of their language. Von Humboldt argued that languages with an [[inflection]]al [[Morphological typology|morphological type]], such as German, English and the other [[Indo-European languages]], were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers over the speakers of less perfect languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in 1820:

{{quote|The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world.&lt;ref name="Trabant" /&gt;}}

=== Boas and Sapir ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Boas]]]]

[[File:Edward Sapir.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Sapir]]]]

The idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread in the early 20th century. American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]], for example, actively strove to eradicate [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a "civilized" way of life.{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=180}} The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this view was [[Franz Boas]].{{sfn|Seuren|1998|p=181}} While undertaking geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the [[Inuit]] people and decided to become an [[Ethnography|ethnographer]]. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture under study and to document verbal culture such as [[myth]]s and legends in the original language.

Boas:

{{quote|It does not seem likely [...] that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture, but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language."&lt;ref name="BOAS1911"&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=EnZC68mmRhQC}}|last=Boas |first=Franz|year=1911|title=Handbook of American Indian languages|volume=1|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 40. Washington: Government Print Office (Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology).}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Boas' student Edward Sapir reached back to the Humboldtian idea that languages contained the key to understanding the world views of peoples. He espoused the viewpoint that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.

Sapir:

{{quote|No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sapir |first=Edward|year=1929|title= The status of linguistics as a science|journal=Language|volume=5|doi=10.2307/409588|issue=4|page=207|jstor=409588}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, Sapir explicitly rejected strong [[linguistic determinism]] by stating, "It would be naïve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language."&lt;ref name="SapirSwadesh1946"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Edward |last1=Sapir|first2=Morris |last2=Swadesh |authorlink1=Morris Swadesh|title=American Indian Grammatical Categories|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wSYJMgEACAAJ|page=100}}|year=1946 |pp=100–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapir was explicit that the connections between language and culture were neither thoroughgoing nor particularly deep, if they existed at all:

{{quote|It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated. Totally unrelated languages share in one culture; closely related languages—even a single language—belong to distinct culture spheres. There are many excellent examples in Aboriginal America. The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified, as structurally specialized, a group as any that I know of. The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas... The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves.{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=213–4}}}}

Sapir offered similar observations about speakers of so-called "world" or [[modern language|"modern" languages]], noting, "possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America, but it is very clear that other factors, some of them rapidly cumulative, are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence. A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical, physical, and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area."{{sfn|Sapir|1921|p=215}}

While Sapir never made a point of studying directly how languages affected thought, some notion of (probably "weak") linguistic relativity underlay his basic understanding of language, and would be taken up by Whorf.

Drawing on influences such as Humboldt and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf, generally working in isolation from each other. Prominent in Germany from the late 1920s through into the 1960s were the strongly relativist theories of [[Leo Weisgerber]] and his key concept of a 'linguistic inter-world', mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language, in ways peculiar to that language.&lt;ref&gt;For a critique of Weisgerber, see, for example: Beat Lehmann (1998), ''ROT ist nicht ″rot″ ist nicht [rot]. Eine Bilanz und Neuinterpretation der linguistischen Relativitätstheorie''. Gunter Narr, Tübingen. pp. 58–80; Iwar Werlen (2002), 'Das Worten der Welt', in: ''Lexikologie ... Ein internationales Handbuch'', ed. by D. Alan Cruse et al., Walter de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York, 1. pp. 380–391.&lt;/ref&gt; Russian psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] read Sapir's work and experimentally studied the ways in which the development of concepts in children was influenced by structures given in language. His 1934 work "''Thought and Language''"&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, L. (1934/1986). Thought and language. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has been compared to Whorf's and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language's influence on cognition.{{sfn|Lucy|Wertsch|1987}} Drawing on Nietzsche's ideas of perspectivism [[Alfred Korzybski]] developed the theory of [[general semantics]] that has been compared to Whorf's notions of linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Pula|1992}} Though influential in their own right, this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity, which has tended to center on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf.

=== Benjamin Lee Whorf ===
{{Main|Benjamin Lee Whorf}}

More than any linguist, Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he called the "linguistic relativity principle".{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=214}} Studying [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] languages, he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language use differences affected perception. Whorf also examined how a scientific account of the world differed from a religious account, which led him to study the original languages of religious scripture and to write several anti-[[evolution]]ist pamphlets.{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} Whorf's opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention. Critics such as Lenneberg, [[Max Black|Black]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism, while [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]], [[Michael Silverstein|Silverstein]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] point to Whorf's explicit rejections of determinism, and where he contends that translation and commensuration is possible.

Although Whorf lacked an advanced degree in linguistics, his reputation reflects his acquired competence. His peers at [[Yale University]] considered the 'amateur' Whorf to be the best man available to take over Sapir's graduate seminar in Native American linguistics while Sapir was on sabbatical in 1937–38.{{sfn|Darnell|1990|p=380-81}} He was highly regarded by authorities such as Boas, Sapir, [[Leonard Bloomfield|Bloomfield]] and [[Alfred M. Tozzer|Tozzer]]. Indeed, [[John A. Lucy|Lucy]] wrote, "despite his 'amateur' status, Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists".{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=25}}

Detractors such as Lenneberg, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker|Pinker]] criticized him for insufficient clarity in his description of how language influences thought, and for not proving his conjectures. Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how 'exotic' grammatical traits were connected to what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought. In Whorf's words:

{{quote|We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language [...] all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=212–214}}}}

[[File:Whorf Shawnee Example.png|400px|thumb|Whorf's illustration of the difference between the English and Shawnee gestalt construction of cleaning a gun with a ramrod. From the article "Science and Linguistics", originally published in the ''MIT Technology Review'', 1940.]]

Among Whorf's best-known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where an indigenous language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages (Whorf used the acronym SAE "[[Standard Average European]]" to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well-studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less-studied languages).

One of Whorf's examples was the supposedly large number of words for [[Eskimo words for snow|'snow' in the Inuit language]], an example which later was contested as a misrepresentation.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}}

Another is the [[Hopi language]]'s words for water, one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water. These examples of [[polysemy]] served the double purpose of showing that indigenous languages sometimes made more fine grained semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.

Another example is from Whorf's experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector.{{sfn|Pullum|1991}} While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word ''empty'' in connection to the barrels had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg{{sfn|Lenneberg|1953}} as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word ''empty'' and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of [[circular reasoning]]. Pinker in ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.

Whorf's most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of [[Hopi time controversy|time as a conceptual category among the Hopi]].{{sfn|Whorf|1956}} He argued that in contrast to English and other [[Standard Average European|SAE languages]], Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like "three days" or "five years," but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to [[Hopi]] culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns. Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf's claims in 1980's era speakers, nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans. Malotki used evidence from archaeological data, calendars, historical documents, modern speech and concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested. Universalist scholars such as Pinker often see Malotki's study as a final refutation of Whorf's claim about Hopi, whereas relativist scholars such as [[John A Lucy|Lucy]] and Penny Lee criticized Malotki's study for mischaracterizing Whorf's claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that doesn't fit the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1996}} {{harvnb|Lee|1996}} {{harvnb|Leavitt|2011|pp=179–187}} {{harvnb|Lucy|1992b|p=286}} {{harvnb|Lucy|1996|p=43}} {{harvnb|Dinwoodie|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf died in 1941 at age 44, leaving multiple unpublished papers. His line of thought was continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and [[Dorothy D. Lee|Lee]] who both continued investigations into the effect of language on habitual thought, and [[George L. Trager|Trager]], who prepared a number of Whorf's papers for posthumous publishing. The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf's ideas to a larger public was the publication in 1956 of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled ''Language, Thought and Reality''.

=== Eric Lenneberg ===

In 1953, [[Eric Lenneberg]] criticised Whorf's examples from an objectivist view of language holding that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf's English descriptions of a Hopi speaker's view of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual ''use'' of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf's point was that while English speakers may be able to ''understand'' how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not ''think'' in that way.{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}

Lenneberg's main criticism of Whorf's works was that he never showed the connection between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such a connection required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior. They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954.

Since neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis, Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own. Their two tenets were (i) "the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities" and (ii) "language causes a particular cognitive structure".{{sfn|Brown|Lenneberg|1954|p=455,457}} Brown later developed them into the so-called "weak" and "strong" formulation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Structural differences between language systems will, in general, be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences, of an unspecified sort, in the native speakers of the language.
* The structure of anyone's native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language.{{sfn|Brown|1976|p=128}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Brown's formulations became widely known and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation, verging on linguistic determinism, was never advanced by either of them.

Since Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages, they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior.

They designed experiments involving the codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently ([[English language|English]] and [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) were asked to recognize colors. In this way, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuñi speakers who [[Distinguishing blue from green in language|classify green and blue together]] as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category.{{sfn|D'Andrade|1995|p= 185}} Brown and Lenneberg's study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology.

=== Universalist period ===
{{Main|Universalism |Universalism and relativism of color terminology}}

Lenneberg was also one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of [[Universal Grammar]], effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also holds the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain's universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=3, 6}}

Examples of universalist influence in the 1960s are the studies by [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay]] who continued Lenneberg's color research. They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming. For example, they found that even though languages have different color terminologies, they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others. They showed that in languages with few color terms, it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors, for example, languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black, white and red.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Gumperz|Levinson|1996|p=6}} Berlin and Kay's research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy, who argued that Berlin and Kay's conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information.{{sfn|Lucy|1992a}} This, Lucy argues, made them blind to the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity.

Other universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity, often attacking Whorf's specific points and examples. For example, Malotki's monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf's "timeless" interpretation of Hopi language and culture.{{sfn|Malotki|1983}}

Today many followers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity. For example, Pinker argues in ''The Language Instinct'' that thought is independent of language, that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought, and that human beings do not even think in "natural" language, i.e. any language that we actually communicate in; rather, we think in a meta-language, preceding any natural language, called "mentalese." Pinker attacks what he calls "Whorf's radical position," declaring, "the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make."{{sfn|Pinker|1994|p=60}}

Pinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against [[Strawman fallacy|strawmen]].{{sfn|Casasanto|2008|p=}}{{sfn|Lucy|1992a|p=}}{{sfn|Lakoff|1987|p=}}

=== Joshua Fishman's "Whorfianism of the third kind" ===

[[Joshua Aaron Fishman|Joshua Fishman]] argued that Whorf's true position was largely overlooked. In 1978, he suggested that Whorf was a "neo-[[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herderian]] champion"{{sfn|Fishman|1978}} and in 1982, he proposed "Whorfianism of the third kind" in an attempt to refocus linguists' attention on what he claimed was Whorf's real interest, namely the intrinsic value of "little peoples" and "little languages".{{sfn|Fishman|1982|p=5}} Whorf had criticized [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden]]'s [[Basic English]] thus:

{{quote|But to restrict thinking to the patterns merely of English […] is to lose a power of thought which, once lost, can never be regained. It is the 'plainest' English which contains the greatest number of unconscious assumptions about nature. […] We handle even our plain English with much greater effect if we direct it from the vantage point of a multilingual awareness.{{sfn|Whorf|1956|p=244}}}}

Where Brown's weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language ''influences'' thought and the strong version that language ''determines'' thought, Fishman's 'Whorfianism of the third kind' proposes that language ''is a key to culture''.

=== Cognitive linguistics ===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, advances in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[cognitive linguistics]] renewed interest in the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.{{sfn|Seidner|1982}} One of those who adopted a more Whorfian approach was [[George Lakoff]]. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different [[conceptual metaphor|cultural metaphors]] that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time with money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that way. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience, for example, metaphors likening ''up'' with ''good'' and ''bad'' with ''down''. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the "right to life" or the "right to choose"; or "illegal aliens" or "undocumented workers".

==== Parameters ====
In his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous things: What categories reveal about the mind,''{{sfn|Lakoff|1987}} Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf's views about how linguistic categorization reflects and/or influences mental categories. He concluded that the debate had been confused. He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity:
* The degree and depth of linguistic relativity. Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only deep differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice.
* Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve
* Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions
* Whether the focus of linguistic relativity is in language or in the brain
Lakoff concluded that many of Whorf's critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity, rendering their criticisms moot.

==== ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' ====
The publication of the 1996 anthology ''Rethinking Linguistic Relativity'' edited by [[John J. Gumperz|Gumperz]] and [[Stephen C. Levinson|Levinson]] began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that focused on cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on the linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories between languages. Separate studies by [[Melissa Bowerman|Bowerman]] and [[Dan Slobin|Slobin]] treated the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named "thinking for speaking" – the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, are the kinds of cognitive process that are at the root of linguistic relativity.

=== Refinements ===

Researchers such as [[Lera Boroditsky|Boroditsky]], Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine the interface between thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentner|first1=Dedre|last2=Boroditsky|first2=Lera|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=215–256|chapter=Individuation, relativity, and early word development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=Stephen|editor=Melissa Bowerman and Stephen Levinson|title=Language Acquisition and Conceptual Development|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-59659-6|pages=566–588|chapter=Covariation between spatial language and cognition, and its implications for language learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kay ultimately concluded that "[the] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Empirical research ==

Lucy identified three main strands of research into linguistic relativity.{{sfn|Lucy|1997}}

=== Structure-centered ===
The "structure-centered" approach starts with a language's structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf's observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy's research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the [[Mayan languages|Mayan language]] [[Yucatec Maya|Yucatec]] result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers.{{sfn|Lucy|1992b|p=}}

=== Domain-centered ===
The "domain-centered" approach selects a semantic domain and compares it across linguistic and cultural groups. It centered on color terminology, although this domain is acknowledged to be sub-optimal, because color perception, unlike other semantic domains, is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains.

Space is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=301}} Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors. For example, [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Yimithirr]] only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations&amp;nbsp;— the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as "north of the house", while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying "in front of the house" or "to the left of the house".{{sfn|Levinson|1996}}

=== Behavior-centered ===
The "behavior centered" approach starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system. Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers' use of the word 'empty' to describe the barrels containing only explosive vapors. Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counter-factual questions posed to them in a questionnaire. He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter-factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese. Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom's flawed translations.&lt;ref&gt;Au, Terry K, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002778490012X "Counterfactuals: In Reply to Alfred Bloom"], ''Cognition'', 17 (3), 1984:&lt;/ref&gt; Strømnes examined why Finnish factories had a higher occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones. He concluded that cognitive differences between the grammatical usage of Swedish [[prepositions]] and Finnish [[Case (linguistics)|cases]] could have caused Swedish factories to pay more attention to the work process while Finnish factory organizers paid more attention to the individual worker.{{sfn|Lucy|1997|p=304}}

[[Daniel Everett|Everett]]'s work on the [[Pirahã language]] of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Everett |first1=Daniel L. |year=2005 |title=Cultural constraints on grammar and cognition in Pirahã |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=621–646 |url=http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~kay/Everett.CA.Piraha.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2012 |doi=10.1086/431525}}&lt;/ref&gt; found several peculiarities that he interpreted as corresponding to linguistically rare features, such as a lack of numbers and color terms in the way those are otherwise defined and the absence of certain types of clauses.

Recent research with non-linguistic experiments in languages with different grammatical properties (e.g., languages with and without [[chinese classifier|numeral classifiers]] or with different gender grammar systems) showed that language differences in human categorization are due to such differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kou | first1 = J.

A study published by the [[American Psychological Association]]’s [[Journal of Experimental Psychology]] claimed that language can influence how you estimate time. The study focused on three groups, those who spoke only Swedish, those who spoke only Spanish and bilingual speakers who spoke both of those languages. Swedish speakers describe time using distance terms like "long" or "short" while Spanish speakers do it using volume related terms like "big" or "small". The researchers asked the participants to estimate how much time had passed while watching a line growing across a screen, or a container being filled, or both. The researches stated that "When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity." When the bilinguals where prompted with the word “duración” (the Spanish word for duration) they based their time estimates of how full the containers were, ignoring the growing lines. When prompted with the word “tid” (the Swedish word for duration) they estimated the time elapsed solely by the distance the lines had traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2017/05/your-perception-of-time-may-depend-on-the-language-you-speak/ |title=Your perception of time may depend on the language you speak |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierre |first=Kendra |url=http://www.popsci.com/language-time-perception#page-3 |title=The language you speak changes your perception of time |publisher=Popsci.com |date=2017-05-09 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color terminology ===
{{Main|Linguistic relativity and the color naming debate}}

Research continued after Lenneberg/Roberts and Brown/Lenneberg. The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers. Researchers attributed this to focal colors having higher codability than less focal colors, and not with linguistic relativity effects. Berlin/Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors.{{sfn|Berlin|Kay|1969}} This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology. Researchers such as Lucy,&lt;ref&gt;Lucy, J. A. (1997). The linguistics of "color". In C.L. Hardin &amp; L. Maffi (Eds.), Color categories in thought and language (pp. 320–436). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saunders | first1 = Barbara | year = 2000 | title = Revisiting Basic Color Terms | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 81–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Levinson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=3–55|doi=10.1525/jlin.2000.10.1.3|title=Yeli Dnye and the Theory of Basic Color Terms|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|volume=10|year=2000|last1=Levinson|first1=Stephen C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Berlin and Kay's study does not refute linguistic relativity in color naming, because of unsupported assumptions in their study (such as whether all cultures in fact have a clearly-defined category of "color") and because of related data problems. Researchers such as Maclaury continued investigation into color naming. Like Berlin and Kay, Maclaury concluded that the domain is governed mostly by physical-biological universals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Other domains ==

Linguistic relativity inspired others to consider whether thought could be influenced by manipulating language.

=== Science and philosophy ===

The question bears on philosophical, psychological, linguistic and anthropological questions.{{clarify|reason=what question?|date=May 2017}}

A major question is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share the same set of basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.

Multiple alternatives have advocates. The contrary [[Social constructivism|constructivist]] position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is [[idealist]], which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material strictures. Another is [[essentialism|essentialist]], which holds that essential differences{{clarify|reason=what essential differences|date=May 2017}} may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is [[relativist]] ([[Cultural relativism]]), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor more or less in accord with external reality.{{sfn|Leavitt|2011}}

Another debate considers whether thought is a form of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the [[philosophy of language]] the question addresses the relations between language, knowledge and the external world, and the concept of [[truth]]. Philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], Davidson, and [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]] see language as representing directly entities from the objective world and that categorization reflect that world. Other philosophers (e.g. Wittgenstein, [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], Searle, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary.

Another question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.{{clarify|reason=what is the relevance of this in the local context? Is this a true dichotomy?|date=May 2017}}

=== Therapy and self-development ===

Sapir/Whorf contemporary [[Alfred Korzybski]] was independently developing his theory of [[General Semantics|general semantics]], which was aimed at using language's influence on thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities. Korzybski's thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead's]] ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;ref name="Korzybski1949"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred |last=Korzybski|title=Time-binding: The General Theory : Two Papers 1924–1926|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3BvXAAAAMAAJ|page=5}}|year=1949|publisher=Institute of General Semantics|pages=(5), 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Korzybski was not aware of Sapir and Whorf's writings, the movement was followed by Whorf-admirer Stuart Chase, who fused Whorf's interest in cultural-linguistic variation with Korzybski's programme in his popular work "''The Tyranny of Words''". [[S. I. Hayakawa]] was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski's work, writing ''[[Language in Thought and Action]]''. The general semantics movement influenced the development of [[neurolinguistic programming]], another therapeutic technique that seeks to use awareness of language use to influence cognitive patterns.&lt;ref name="lisawake"&gt;{{cite book|first=Lisa |last=Wake|title=Neurolinguistic Psychotherapy: A Postmodern Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xmffzEo-qXIC}}|date=31 March 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-09482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korzybski independently described a "strong" version of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/articles/etc/40-1-read.pdf |doi= 10.5840/cpsem19828 |pages=101–107|title= "The Semiotic Aspect of Alfred Korzybski's General Semantics" |series= Semiotics |year= 1982 |last1= Read |first1= Allen Walker }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an habitual language has. It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves us through the mechanism of s[emantic] r[eactions] and that the structure which a language exhibits, and impresses upon us unconsciously, is automatically projected upon the world around us.|Korzybski (1930) &lt;ref name="Korzybski1958"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred |last=Korzybski|title=Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=KN5gvaDwrGcC|p=90}}|year=1958|publisher=Institute of GS|isbn=978-0-937298-01-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Artificial languages ===
{{Main|Constructed languages|Experimental languages}}

In their fiction, authors such as [[Ayn Rand]] and [[George Orwell]] explored how linguistic relativity might be exploited for political purposes. In Rand's [[Anthem (novella)|''Anthem'']], a fictive [[communist]] society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word "I" from the language.{{cn|date=October 2018}} In Orwell's ''[[1984 (book)|1984]]'' the authoritarian state created the language [[Newspeak]] to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government, or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed, by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor.{{sfn|Pinker|1994|loc=chap. 3}}

Others have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new, and perhaps better, ways of thinking. Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include [[Loglan]], explicitly designed by [[James Cooke Brown]] to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis, by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically. Speakers of [[Lojban]], an evolution of Loglan, report that they feel speaking the language enhances their ability for logical thinking{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. [[Suzette Haden Elgin]], who was involved in the early development of neurolinguistic programming, invented the language [[Láadan]] to explore linguistic relativity by making it easier to express what Elgin considered the female worldview, as opposed to [[Standard Average European]] languages which she considered to convey a "male centered" world view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= Okrent, Arika |title = In the Land of Invented Languages: Esperanto Rock Stars, Klingon Poets, Loglan Lovers, and the Mad Dreamers Who Tried to Build A Perfect Language |publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau |year=2009 |pages=208–257|isbn= 0-385-52788-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Quijada's language [[Ithkuil]] was designed to explore the limits of the number of cognitive categories a language can keep its speakers aware of at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foer|first=Joshua |title=UTOPIAN FOR BEGINNERS: An amateur linguist loses control of the language he invented|publisher=New York Times|date=December 24, 2012 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/24/121224fa_fact_foer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Sonja Lang's [[Toki Pona]] was developed according to a [[Taoism|Taoist]] point of view for exploring how (or if) such a language would direct human thought.&lt;ref&gt;''A Million Words and Counting: How Global English Is Rewriting the World'', Paul J. J. Payack, (C) 2007, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Programming languages ===

[[APL (programming language)|APL programming language]] originator [[Kenneth E. Iverson]] believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning it by name). His [[Turing award]] lecture, "Notation as a tool of thought", was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=444–465 |date=August 1980 |doi=10.1145/358896.358899 |title=Notation as a tool of thought |last1=Iverson |first1=Kenneth E. |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710183418/http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essays of [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] explore similar themes, such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called [[Blub paradox|''blub'' paradox]] (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called ''Blub'') says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will ''know'' that it is more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that ''writing'' in some language means ''thinking'' in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are "satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs".{{sfn|Graham|2004}}

In a 2003 presentation at an [[Open-source software|open source]] convention, [[Yukihiro Matsumoto]], creator of the [[programming language]] [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel ''[[Babel-17]]'', based on the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/slides/oscon2003/mgp00001.html|title=The Power and Philosophy of Ruby (or how to create Babel-17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In popular culture ===

[[Ted Chiang]]'s short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' developed the concept of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species which visits Earth. The aliens' biology contributes to their spoken and written languages, which are distinct. In the 2016 American film [[Arrival (film)|''Arrival'']], based on Chiang's short story, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the premise. The protagonist explains that "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The science behind the movie ‘Arrival’| work = Washington Post| accessdate = 2017-04-23| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-science-behind-the-movie-arrival/2016/11/14/5e344114-a6a7-11e6-ba59-a7d93165c6d4_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his science fiction novel ''[[The Languages of Pao]]'' the author [[Jack Vance]] describes how specialized languages are a major part of a strategy to create specific classes in a society, to enable the population to withstand occupation and develop itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7056">'''Nietzschean affirmation''' ({{lang-de|Bejahung}}), also known as '''affirmation of life''',&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Reginster, ''The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism'', Harvard University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in the [[philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The best example of this concept can be found in Nietzsche's ''The Will to Power'':

{{quote|If we affirm one single moment, we thus affirm not only ourselves but all existence. For nothing is self-sufficient, neither in us ourselves nor in things; and if our soul has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event—and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.|sign=Nietzsche, Friedrich|source=''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' ([[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] and [[R. J. Hollingdale]] translators). New York: Random House, 1967. pages 532–533&lt;ref&gt;Original German: ''Gesetzt, wir sagen Ja zu einem einzigen Augenblick, so haben wir damit nicht nur zu uns selbst, sondern zu allem Dasein Ja gesagt. Denn es steht Nichts für sich, weder in uns selbst noch in den Dingen: und wenn nur ein einziges Mal unsre Seele wie eine Saite vor Glück gezittert und getönt hat, so waren alle Ewigkeiten nöthig, um dies Eine Geschehen zu bedingen – und alle Ewigkeit war in diesem einzigen Augenblick unseres Jasagens gutgeheißen, erlöst, gerechtfertigt und bejaht.'' (''Wille zur Macht'', [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/6182/12 Nr. 1032].)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Opposition to Schopenhauer==
[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] wrote that Nietzsche "celebrates the Greeks who, facing up to the terrors of nature and history, did not seek refuge in "a [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]] negation of the will," as [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] did, but instead created [[Tragedy|tragedies]] in which life is affirmed as beautiful in spite of everything."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "Friedrich Nietzsche," vol. 5, Macmillan, New York, 1967, p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original German: "''buddhistischen Verneinung des Willens''" (Nietzsche, ''[[Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik]]'', [http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Nietzsche,+Friedrich/Die+Geburt+der+Trag%C3%B6die/Die+Geburt+der+Trag%C3%B6die+aus+dem+Geiste+der+Musik/1-10 § 7]).&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer’s negation of the will was a saying "no" to life and to the world, which he judged to be a scene of pain and [[evil]]. "[D]irectly against Schopenhauer’s place as the ultimate nay-sayer to life, Nietzsche positioned himself as the ultimate yes-sayer&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to Schopenhauer'', edited by Bart Vandenabeele, Part IV, ch. 19, article by [[Ken Gemes]] and [[Christopher Janaway]], "Life-Denial versus Life-Affirmation: Schopenhauer and Nietzsche on [[Pessimism]] and [[Asceticism]]," [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]], New York, 2012, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche’s affirmation of life's pain and evil, in opposition to Schopenhauer, resulted from an overflow of life.&lt;ref&gt;"I was the first to see the actual contrast: the degenerate instinct which turns upon life with  a subterranean lust of vengeance ([[Christianity]], Schopenhauer's philosophy, and in some respects too even [[Plato]]'s philosophy — in short, the whole of [[idealism]] in its typical forms), as opposed to a formula of the highest yea-saying to life, born of an abundance and a superabundance of life — a yea-saying free from all reserve, applying even to suffering, and guilt, and all that is questionable and strange in existence." (Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', Preface, § 5)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer’s advocacy of self-denial and negation of life was, according to Nietzsche, very harmful.&lt;ref&gt;"For me the issue was the value of morality—and in that matter I had to take issue almost alone with my great teacher Schopenhauer&amp;hellip;. The most specific issue was the worth of the 'unegoistic,' the instinct for pity, self-denial, self-sacrifice, something which Schopenhauer himself had painted with gold, deified, and projected into the next world for so long that it finally remained for him 'value in itself' and the reason why he said No to life and even to himself. But a constantly more fundamental suspicion of these very instincts voiced itself in me, a [[scepticism]] which always dug deeper! It was precisely here that I saw the great danger to humanity, its most sublime temptation and seduction." (Nietzsche, ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', "Why I Write Such Good Books," "The Birth of Tragedy," § 2.)&lt;/ref&gt; For his entire mature life, Nietzsche was concerned with the damage that he thought resulted from Schopenhauerian disgust with life and turning against the world.

==Derridean interpretation==
[[Jacques Derrida]] allocates this concept and applies it specifically to language, its structure and play. This application acknowledges that there is, in fact, no center or origin within language and its many parts, no firm ground from which to base any Truth or truths. This shock allows for two reactions in Derrida’s philosophy: the more negative, melancholic response, which he designates as Rousseauistic, or the more positive Nietzschean affirmation. [[Rousseau]]'s perspective focuses on deciphering the truth and [[origin of language]] and its many signs, an often exhaustive occupation. Derrida's response to Nietzsche, however, offers an active participation with these signs and arrives at, in Derridean philosophy, a more resolute response to language.

In "[[Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences|Structure, Sign, and Play]]", Derrida articulates Nietzsche’s perspective as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the joyous affirmation of the play of the world and of the innocence of becoming, the affirmation of a world of signs without fault, without truth, and without origin which is offered to an active interpretation.&lt;ref name="derrida"&gt;Derrida, Jacques. "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Humanities." ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. Trans. Alan Bass. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1978. 278–293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Essentially, Derrida not only fosters Nietzsche’s work but evolves it within the sphere of language; in doing so, Derrida acquires and employs Nietzsche’s optimism in his concept of play: "the ''substitution'' of ''given'' and ''existing'', ''present'', pieces" (292).&lt;ref name="derrida"/&gt; Much of this spirit resides in the abandonment of any sort of new [[humanism]]. This acceptance of the inevitable allows for considerable relief—evident in the designation of the loss of center as a non-center—as well as the opportunity to affirm and cultivate play, which enables humanity and the humanities "to pass beyond man and humanism" (292).&lt;ref name="derrida"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31519">A '''nuclear-free zone''' is an area in which [[nuclear weapons]] (see [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]) and [[nuclear power]] [[power station|plants]] are banned. The specific ramifications of these depend on the locale in question.

Nuclear-free zones usually neither address nor prohibit [[radiopharmaceuticals]] used in [[nuclear medicine]] even though many of them are produced in nuclear reactors. They typically do not prohibit other nuclear technologies such as [[cyclotrons]] used in particle physics.

Several sub-national authorities worldwide have declared themselves "nuclear-free". However, the label is often symbolic, as nuclear policy is usually determined and regulated at higher levels of government: nuclear weapons and components may traverse nuclear-free zones via military transport without the knowledge or consent of local authorities which had declared nuclear-free zones.

[[Palau]] became the first nuclear-free nation in 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Roger|last2=Roff|first2=Sue Rabbitt|title=Micronesia: the problem of Palau|date=1984|publisher=Minority Rights Group|location=London|isbn=9780946690145|page=13|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]] was the first Western-allied nation to legislate towards a [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|national nuclear free zone]] by effectively renouncing the [[nuclear deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lange|first=David|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way|year=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear-free zone by geographical areas==

===Australia===
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

Many Australian [[Local government in Australia|local government areas]] of Australia have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation; notable among these are [[Brisbane]], capital of Queensland, which has been nuclear weapon free since 1983, and the South and North Sydney councils. However the passage of such legislation is generally considered just a symbolic measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nuclear-free city? Afraid no|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/nuclearfree-city-afraid-not/2009/03/18/1237054855860.html|accessdate=6 Feb 2014|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of councils which have passed anti-nuclear weaponry legislation are members of the Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat which has 44 member councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | publisher=Australian Nuclear Free Zones and Toxic Industries Secretariat | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222201519/http://www2.hornsby.nsw.gov.au/ebp/ebp2001.nsf/21097a8176941d6e4a2564600016add3/b21f168f52a1fe494a2569d500238d0e/$FILE/flyer_algnfz.pdf | archivedate=22 February 2014 | title=[Untitled leaflet]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Austria===
Austria is a nuclear free zone, when a nuclear power station was built during the 1970s at [[Zwentendorf]], [[Austria]], start-up was prevented by a popular vote in 1978. The completed power plant is now marketed as a shooting location for film and television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-power-plant.net/index.php?lang=en&amp;item=location Zwentendorf – location&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 1997, the [[Parliament of Austria|Austrian Parliament]] voted unanimously to maintain the country's anti-nuclear policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/478/aai.html |publisher=WISE News Communique |date=September 26, 1997 |title=Coalition of Nuclear-Free Countries |accessdate=2006-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223141723/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/index.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww10.antenna.nl%2Fwise%2F478%2Faai.html |archivedate=February 23, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the headquarters of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] is located in Vienna, and the IAEA maintains nuclear laboratories both in Vienna and Seibersdorf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910162745/http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NA/NAAL/labmain.php |date=September 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAEA has also established programs to assist nuclear energy projects in developing countries.

Austria's anti-nuclear stance also causes tension with its nuclear neighbors. Vienna is located close to the Czech reactor at [[Temelin]], and four reactors are being built in neighboring Slovakia and two in neighboring Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16359991 | work=BBC News | title=Austria and Czech Republic divided over nuclear power | date=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria also draws from regional electricity grids, meaning it imports nuclear power, although chancellor Werner Faymann has pledged to eliminate Austria's reliance on foreign power by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.myeurop.info/2011/07/11/nucleaire-l-autriche-se-debranche-des-2015-2936 Nucléaire: l'Autriche se débranche dès 2015&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
[[Vancouver]] is a nuclear weapons free city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zoning &amp; Development Bylaw 3575, Section 10|url=http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/zoning/sec10.pdf|publisher=City of Vancouver|page=10.23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victoria, British Columbia]] is also a nuclear weapons free city. This has caused problems as nearby Esquimalt houses [[CFB Esquimalt]], Canada's Pacific naval base, which is used frequently by the [[United States Navy]]. The USN routinely sends ships or aircraft carriers loaded with nuclear weapons to Esquimalt. As a result, the ships are forced to dock out of the city limits as not to violate the city by-laws.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}The policy does not limit operations at [[TRIUMF]], Canada's national laboratory for nuclear and particle physics at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The province of [[British Columbia]] also bans mining for uranium, and the construction of nuclear power plants within its territorial limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html EnergyBC: Nuclear Power&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307170021/http://www.energybc.ca/profiles/nuclear.html |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nanaimo, British Columbia]], [[Kitimat, British Columbia]]; [[Red Deer, Alberta]], and [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] are also  nuclear weapons-free cities.

===Former Soviet Union===

====Central Asia====
{{Expand section|1=nuclear power|date=July 2017}}

All states of [[Central Asia]] have signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] and signed the [[Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone]] treaty. Thus, there are no technologies to create a weapon or enrich the particles, but in [[Tajikistan]], during the Soviet Union, such initiatives were brought to life, but with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the facilities were dismantled and moved to the [[Russian Federation]]. The Treaty came into force on 21 March 2009.

====Estonia====
{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
After Estonia [[Singing Revolution#Estonia|seceded from the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, Estonia became a nuclear-free country.  
The two land-based [[nuclear reactor]]s at the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Nuclear navy|nuclear submarine]] training centre in [[Paldiski]] were removed when Russia finally relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.
There are no nuclear power stations in Estonia.

===Japan===

{{main article|Japan's non-nuclear policy}}

As a resource-poor nation, Japan is heavily reliant on nuclear power, but its unique experience in [[World War II]] has led to the wholesale rejection of nuclear weapons, holding nuclear weapons shall not be manufactured in, possessed by, or allowed entry into Japan. These tenets, known as the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]], were first stated by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Eisaku Satō]] in 1967, and were adopted as a parliamentary resolution in 1971, though they have never formally been entered into law. They continue to reflect the attitudes of both government and the general public, who remain staunchly opposed to the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons.

The [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] have never made any attempt to manufacture or otherwise obtain nuclear arms, and no nuclear weapons are known to have been introduced into the Japanese [[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]] since the end of [[World War II]]. While the United States does not maintain nuclear bases within its military installations on the Home Islands, it is believed to have once stored weapons at [[Okinawa]], which remained under US administrative jurisdiction until 1972.

===Italy===
{{main article|Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987}}
Italy is a nuclear free zone since the Italian nuclear power referendum of November 1987. Following center-right parties' victory in the 2008 election, Italy's industry minister announced that the government scheduled the construction to start the first new Italian nuclear-powered plant by 2013. The announced project was paused in March 2011, after the Japanese earthquake, and scrapped after a referendum on 12–13 June 2011.

===New Zealand===
{{main article|New Zealand's nuclear-free zone}}

In 1984, Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using [[New Zealand]] ports or entering New Zealand waters.  Under the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"&gt;[http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/peace/nukefree.html Nuclear Free Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; territorial sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered ship free zones. It does not ban nuclear power stations. A research reactor was operated by the University of Canterbury until 1981. Official planning for a nuclear power station continued until the 1980s. A nuclear reactor provided electricity for McMurdo Station, in the New Zealand Antarctic Territory from 1962–1972.

The Act prohibits "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 miles (22.2 km) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" and bans the dumping of [[radioactive waste]] within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device."&lt;ref name="Nuclear Free Zone"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension Bill – Green Party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630032138/http://greens.org.nz/searchdocs/speech5334.html |date=2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with the firm policy of the United States to "neither confirm nor deny" whether particular naval vessels carry nuclear weapons, the Act effectively bars these ships from entering New Zealand waters.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite book

New Zealand's security treaty with the United States, [[ANZUS]], did not mention nuclear deterrence and did not require unconditional port access. However, after New Zealand refused entry to [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']], the [[United States]] government suspended its [[ANZUS]] obligations to New Zealand, seeing New Zealand's effective rejection of United States Navy vessels as voiding the treaty. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Lange Labour government]] did not see their stance as incompatible with the treaty and sought a compromise for over two years before passing the Act.&lt;ref name="Pugh"/&gt; Support for the non-nuclear policy was bolstered by the perceived over-reaction of the United States and by the [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] by [[DGSE|French spies]] while docked in [[Auckland]]. According to some commentators, the legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4150550.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lange's impact on NZ and world | date=August 14, 2005 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110518224427/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/08/asia/AS-GEN-New-Zealand-Nuclear-Landmark.php Nuclear threat continues to grow, New Zealand warns on anniversary of anti-nuclear law – International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand]]’s three decade [[anti-nuclear]] campaign is the only successful movement of its type in the world which resulted in the nation's nuclear-free zone status being enshrined in legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The nuclear-free zone law does not make building land-based nuclear power plants illegal. However, the relatively small [[Electricity sector in New Zealand|electricity system]], abundance of other resources to generate electricity, and public opposition has meant a nuclear power plant has never gone beyond the investigation phase – a nuclear power plant was proposed north of [[Auckland]] in the early 1970s, but the discovery of large natural gas reserves in [[Taranaki region|Taranaki]] saw the proposal shelved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf97.html|title=Nuclear Energy Prospects in New Zealand|publisher=World Nuclear Association|date=April 2009|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nordic countries===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
Nuclear weapons-free Nordic (''Finn. Ydinaseeton Pohjola'') was an initiative by the [[President of Finland]] [[Urho Kekkonen]] for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the [[Nordic countries]]. The aim was to prevent the Nordic countries from becoming a nuclear battleground and a route for [[cruise missile]]s in the event of a nuclear war between the [[Soviet Union]] and [[NATO]].

Nuclear energy, however, is used in both [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

===Palau===
[[Palau]] adopted its first constitution in July 1979, stating that the Micronesian country would be "nuclear-free". The United States told the Palauan government that this constitution was likely incompatible with the [[Compact of Free Association]]. The Palauan government submitted a revised version of the constitution  without the "nuclear-free" clause the following October. The Palauan people rejected the revised document and instated the original constitution in July 1980.&lt;ref name="Palau"/&gt; Seven years later, however, the Palauan people voted to overturn their nuclear-free status out of "economic survival".&lt;ref name="NY Times Palau"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/07/world/palau-drops-nuclear-free-status.html |title=Palau Drops Nuclear-Free Status |date=7 August 1987 |publisher=AP |work=The New York Times |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The Nuclear Free Zone Movement in the [[United Kingdom]] was very strong in early 1980s; up to two hundred local authorities including [[county council]]s, [[Districts of England|district council]]s and [[city council]]s such as the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) (before its abolition) declared themselves to be 'nuclear free'. The first 'nuclear-free zone' in the UK was [[Manchester City Council]] in 1980 – this still exists to this day.  Wales became 'nuclear free' on 23 February 1982 after Clwyd County Council declared itself 'nuclear free' and the Nuclear Free Wales Declaration was made.  This policy was legally underpinned by Section 137 of the Local Government Act, which allowed local authorities to spend a small amount on whatever members considered was in the interest of their area or a part of their area.

UK nuclear-free local authorities refused to take part in civil defence exercises relating to nuclear war, which they thought were futile. The non-cooperation of the nuclear-free zone authorities was the main reason for the cancellation of the national 'Hard Rock' [[civil defence]] exercise in July 1982.  In England and Wales 24 of the 54 county councils refused to participate and seven more co-operated only in a half-hearted way.&lt;ref&gt;Bolsover, Philip, "A victory – and a new development", in Minnion, J., and Bolsover, P., ''The CND Story'', London: Alison and Busby, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen as a victory for the [[Peace movement#United Kingdom|British Peace movement]] against the policies of [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Generally, nuclear-free zones were predominantly [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] controlled councils but [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and even a few [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] councillors were often active in this respect too.

===United States===

A number of towns, cities and counties in the [[United States]] established themselves as Nuclear-Free Zones in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The first was [[Missoula, Montana]]. In the November 1978 general election, Missoula voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative in the form of a land-use ordinance establishing the entirety of Missoula County as a "'nuclear free' zoning district" banning all nuclear facilities except those for medical purposes. (In the same election, Montana voters approved a statewide initiative by a 2–1 margin barring nuclear facilities or reactors without strict state-enforced regulatory standards and ratification by popular referendum, and in a follow-up 1980 initiative, Montanans narrowly voted to ban the disposal of nuclear waste.) That Missoula's measure was originally drafted as a zoning ordinance legally enforceable by the county planning department apparently created the popular term "Nuclear Free Zone" adopted as the name of the local political action group sponsoring the initiative and later used by other jurisdictions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the Missoula zoning ordinance, see Missoula Independent, Nov. 30, 2000, at: http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/reading-the-sign/Content?oid=1133059.

Subsequently, the tiny town of [[Garrett Park, Maryland]], attracted worldwide attention with its referendum in May, 1982. The following year, [[Takoma Park, Maryland]], was officially declared a nuclear-free zone in 1983 by then-mayor Sam Abbott. A citizen committee of the local city council continues to monitor city contracts. The city cannot hold contracts with any company associated with any aspect of nuclear weapons without a waiver from the citizen committee. In September 2005, Takoma Park took a stand against the transportation of high-level nuclear waste through the City. It voted to amend its Nuclear-Free Zone Ordinance to give its citizen committee responsibility to collect information and from this information and from consultations with individuals and organizations involved in the transportation of high-level nuclear waste, to advise the City on how to promote the safety and welfare of its citizens from harmful exposure to high-level nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Takoma Park's nuclear-free history see: {{cite web |url=http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628032216/http://www.takomaparkmd.gov/committees/nfz/nftpc.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known nuclear-free community is [[Berkeley, California]], whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons-related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure. The City of Berkeley has posted signs at city limits proclaiming its nuclear free status. The ordinance specifies possible fines for such activities within its borders. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] is deeply involved in the [[history of nuclear weapons]], and the [[University of California]] system until recently managed operations at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], a U.S. nuclear weapons design laboratory, and continues to manage the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. At the time of the passage of the act, the University operated a nuclear reactor for research purposes, the [[Etcheverry Hall|Etcheverry Reactor]], which it continued to operate after the act went into effect. The University of California, as a state institution, is not subject to Berkeley's municipal regulations, including the ban. Berkeley also has major freeway and train lines which are used in transporting nuclear materials.

On November 14, 1984 the [[Davis, California]] [[City Council]] declared the city to be a nuclear-free zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daviswiki.org/Nuclear_Free_Zone Nuclear Free Zone – Davis Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis has major freeway and train arteries running through it which are used for transporting nuclear materials.  The [[University of California]], with a campus at [[University of California, Davis|Davis]], runs a research reactor at the nearby former [[McClellan Air Force Base]], as well as workers who are involved with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On November 8, 1988 the city of [[Oakland, California]] passed "Measure T" with 57% of the vote, making that city a nuclear free zone.  Under Ordinance No. 11062 CMS then passed on December 6, 1988, the city is restricted from doing business with ''"any entity knowingly engaged in nuclear weapons work and any of its agents, subsidiaries or affiliates which are engaged in nuclear weapons work."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/obra/raillineremoval/Schedule%20P%20-%20Nuclear%20Free.pdf Schedule P, City of Oakland, rev. 7/30/01] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526022607/http://www.oaklandnet.com/government/obra/raillineremoval/Schedule%20P%20-%20Nuclear%20Free.pdf |date=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure was invalidated in federal court, on the grounds that it interfered with the Federal Government's constitutional authority over national defense and atomic energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/us/a-nuclear-free-zone-is-ruled-to-be-invalid.html A Nuclear-Free Zone Is Ruled to Be Invalid, New York Times/AP, 4/28/90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/334/3337.html Guardian (US), 23 May 1990, p7, via WISE Nuclear Issues Information Service] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611125759/http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/334/3337.html |date=June 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue being Oakland is a major port, and like Berkeley, and Davis, has major freeway and train arteries running through it.  In 1992, the Oakland City Council unanimously reinstated modified elements of the older ordinance, reportedly bringing the total number of Nuclear Free Zones in the United States at that time to 188, with a total population of over 17 million in 27 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18768942.html Oakland City Council Reinstates Nuclear-Free Policy, US Newswire 7/3/92, via Highbeam]{{dead link|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red boxes represent [[circuit breaker]]s, grey lines represent three-phase bus and interconnecting conductors, the orange circle represents an [[electric generator]], the green spiral is an [[inductor]], and the three overlapping blue circles represent a double-wound [[transformer]] with a tertiary winding.]]
In [[power engineering]], a '''one-line diagram''' or '''single-line diagram''' ('''SLD''') is a simplified notation for representing a [[three-phase]] power system.&lt;ref name=csd&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The one-line diagram has its largest application in [[Power flow study|power flow studies]]. Electrical elements such as circuit breakers, transformers, capacitors, [[Busbar|bus bars]], and conductors are shown by standardized schematic symbols.&lt;ref name=csd/&gt; Instead of representing each of three phases with a separate line or terminal, only one conductor is represented. It is a form of [[block diagram]] graphically depicting the paths for power flow between entities of the system. Elements on the diagram do not represent the physical size or location of the electrical equipment, but it is a common convention to organize the diagram with the same left-to-right, top-to-bottom  sequence as the [[switchgear]] or other apparatus represented. A one-line diagram can also be used to show a high level view of conduit runs for a [[Power-line_communication|PLC]] control system.

==Balanced systems==
The theory of three-phase power systems tells us that as long as the [[Electrical load|load]]s on each of the three phases are balanced, we can consider each phase separately.&lt;ref name=guile_paterson&gt;

A one-line diagram is usually used along with other notational simplifications, such as the [[per-unit system]].

A secondary advantage to using a one-line diagram is that the simpler diagram leaves more space for non-electrical, such as [[Energy economics|economic]], information to be included.

==Unbalanced systems==
When using the method of [[symmetrical components]], separate one-line diagrams are made for each of the positive, negative and zero-sequence systems. This simplifies the analysis of unbalanced conditions of a polyphase system. Items that have different impedances for the different [[phase sequence]]s are identified on the diagrams.  For example, in general a [[Electric generator|generator]] will have different positive and negative sequence impedance, and certain transformer winding connections block zero-sequence currents. The unbalanced system can be resolved into three single line diagrams for each sequence, and interconnected to show how the unbalanced components add in each part of the system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20309">'''Operad theory''' is a field of [[mathematics]] concerned with prototypical [[algebra over a field|algebras]] that model properties such as [[commutativity]] or [[anticommutativity]] as well as various amounts of [[associativity]]. Operads generalize the various [[associativity]] properties already observed in [[Algebra over a field|algebras]] and [[coalgebra]]s such as [[Lie algebra]]s or [[Poisson algebra]]s by modeling computational trees within the algebra. Algebras are to operads as [[group representation]]s are to [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. An operad can be seen as a set of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, which can be composed one with others. They form a [[Category theory|category-theoretic]] analog of [[universal algebra]].

Operads originate in [[algebraic topology]] from the study of iterated [[loop space]]s by [[Michael Boardman|J. Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer M.

==Definition==

===Non-symmetric operad===
A '''non-symmetric operad''' (sometimes called an '''operad without permutations''', or a '''non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''plain''' operad) consists of the following:
* a sequence &lt;math&gt;(P(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; of sets, whose elements are called ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary operations'',
* an element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; called the ''identity'',
* for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_1,\ldots,k_n&lt;/math&gt;, a ''composition'' function

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\circ: P(n)\times P(k_1)\times\cdots\times P(k_n) &amp; \to P(k_1+\cdots+k_n)\\
(\theta,\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n) &amp; \mapsto \theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following coherence axioms:
* ''identity'': &lt;math&gt;\theta\circ(1,\ldots,1)=\theta=1\circ\theta&lt;/math&gt;
* ''associativity'':
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \theta \circ (\theta_1 \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}), \ldots, \theta_n \circ (\theta_{n,1}, \ldots,\theta_{n,k_n})) \\
= {} &amp; (\theta \circ (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n)) \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,k_n})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the number of arguments corresponds to the arities of the operations).

Alternatively, a plain operad is a [[multicategory (category theory)|multicategory]] with one object.

===Symmetric operad===
A '''symmetric operad''' (often just called '''operad''') is a non-symmetric operad &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as above, together with a right action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the above associative and identity axioms, as well as

*''equivariance'': given permutations &lt;math&gt;s_i \in \Sigma_{k_i}, t\in \Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\theta*t)\circ(\theta_{t_1},\ldots,\theta_{t_n}) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*t; \\[2pt]
&amp; \theta\circ(\theta_1*s_1,\ldots,\theta_n*s_n) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*(s_1,\ldots,s_n)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
(where by [[abuse of notation]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of the first equivariance relation is the element
of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{k_1+\dots+k_n}&lt;/math&gt; that acts on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots , k_1+\dots +k_n\}&lt;/math&gt; by breaking it into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks, the first of size &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, the second of size &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, through the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th block of size &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt;, and then permutes these &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

The permutation actions in this definition are vital to most applications, including the original application to loop spaces.

=== Morphisms ===
A '''morphism of operads''' &lt;math&gt;f:P\to Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;(f_n:P(n)\to Q(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;
which:
* preserves the identity: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves composition: for every ''n''-ary operation &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and operations &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 , \ldots , \theta_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
f(\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))
= f(\theta)\circ(f(\theta_1),\ldots,f(\theta_n))
&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves the permutation actions: &lt;math&gt;f(x*s)=f(x)*s&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In other categories ===
We have so far considered only operads in the [[Category theory|category]] of sets. It is actually possible to define operads in any [[symmetric monoidal category]] (or, for non-symmetric operads, any [[monoidal category]]).

A common example would be given by the category of [[topological space]], with the monoidal product given by the [[Cartesian product]]. In this case, a topological operad is given by a sequence of ''spaces'' (instead of sets) &lt;math&gt;\{ P(n) \}_{n \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;. The structure maps of the operad (the composition and the actions of the symmetric groups) must then be assumed to be continuous. The result is called a ''topological operad''. Similarly, in the definition of a morphism, it would be necessary to assume that the maps involved are continuous.

Other common settings to define operads include, for example, [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[chain complex]]es, [[groupoid]]s (or even the category of categories itself), [[coalgebra]]s, etc.

== Understanding the axioms ==

===Associativity axiom===
"Associativity" means that ''composition'' of operations is associative
(the function &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is associative), analogous to the axiom in category theory that &lt;math&gt;f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;; it does ''not'' mean that the operations ''themselves'' are associative as operations.
Compare with the [[#Associative_operad|associative operad]], below.

Associativity in operad theory means that one can write [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] involving operations without ambiguity from the omitted compositions, just as associativity for operations allows one to write products without ambiguity from the omitted parentheses.

For instance, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation, which is written as &lt;math&gt;\theta(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(ab)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; may or may not be associative.

Then what is commonly written &lt;math&gt;((ab)c)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguously written operadically as &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ (\theta,1)&lt;/math&gt; . This sends &lt;math&gt;(a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(ab,c)&lt;/math&gt; (apply &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the first two, and the identity on the third), and then the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the left "multiplies" &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
This is clearer when depicted as a tree:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose1.svg|Tree before composition]]

which yields a 3-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose2.svg|Tree after composition]]
{{Clear}}

However, the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is ''a priori'' ambiguous:
it could mean &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ ((\theta,1) \circ ((\theta,1),1))&lt;/math&gt;, if the inner compositions are performed first, or it could mean &lt;math&gt;(\theta \circ (\theta,1)) \circ ((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;,
if the outer compositions are performed first (operations are read from right to left).
Writing &lt;math&gt;x=\theta, y=(\theta,1), z=((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;, this is &lt;math&gt;x \circ (y \circ z)&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;(x \circ y) \circ z&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the tree is missing "vertical parentheses":

[[File:OperadTreeCompose3.svg|Tree before composition]]

If the top two rows of operations are composed first (puts an upward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;(ab)c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the inner composition first), the following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose4.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation.
As an annotated expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(ab)c\cdot d} \circ ((\theta_{ab \cdot c},1_d) \circ ((\theta_{a\cdot b},1_c),1_d))&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

If the bottom two rows of operations are composed first (puts a downward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;ab\quad c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the outer composition first), following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose6.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

The operad axiom of associativity is that ''these yield the same result,'' and thus that the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous.

===Identity axiom===
The identity axiom (for a binary operation) can be visualized in a tree as:

[[Image:OperadIdentityAxiom.svg|The axiom of identity in an operad]]

meaning that the three operations obtained are equal: pre- or post- composing with the identity makes no difference. Note that, as for categories, &lt;math&gt;1 \circ 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is a corollary of the identity axiom.

==="Little something" operads===
A '''little discs operad''' or, '''little balls operad''' or, more specifically, the '''little ''n''-discs operad''' is a topological operad defined in terms of configurations of disjoint ''n''-dimensional [[disc (mathematics)|disc]]s inside a unit ''n''-disc centered in the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The operadic composition for little 2-discs is illustrated in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giachetta, Luigi Mangiarotti, [[Sardanashvily|Gennadi Sardanashvily]] (2005) ''Geometric and Algebraic Topological Methods in Quantum Mechanics,'' {{isbn|981-256-129-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLbisfrkWpoC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=%22Little+discs+operad%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NNKTqHPeX7&amp;sig=KVdeG4dbMj1GfggbYd3zeNVs_zQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA474,M1 pp. 474,475]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the '''little ''n''-cubes operad''' or the '''little intervals operad''' (initially called little ''n''-cubes [[PRO (category theory)|PROP]]s) was defined by [[Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer Vogt]]  in a similar way, in terms of configurations of disjoint [[axis-aligned]] ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]]s (n-dimensional [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]]) inside the [[unit hypercube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Axiomatic, Enriched and Motivic Homotopy Theory|last=Greenlees|first=J.

===Associative operad===
Another class of examples of operads are those capturing the structures of algebraic structures, such as associative algebras, commutative algebras and Lie algebras. Each of these can be exhibited as a finitely presented operad, in each of these three generated by binary operations.

Thus, the associative operad is generated by a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the condition that
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\circ(\psi,1)=\psi\circ(1,\psi).&lt;/math&gt;

This condition ''does'' correspond to [[associativity]] of the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;; writing &lt;math&gt;\psi(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; multiplicatively, the above condition is &lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt;. This associativity of the ''operation'' should not be confused with associativity of ''composition''; see the [[#Axiom_of_associativity|axiom of associativity]], above.

This operad is [[terminal object|terminal]] in the category of non-symmetric operads, as it has exactly one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n,'' corresponding to the unambiguous product of ''n'' terms: &lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is sometimes written as 1 by category theorists (by analogy with the one-point set, which is terminal in the category of sets).

===Terminal symmetric operad===
The terminal symmetric operad is the operad whose algebras are commutative monoids, which also has one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n'', with each &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; acting trivially; this triviality corresponds to commutativity, and whose ''n''-ary operation is the unambiguous product of ''n''-terms, where order does not matter:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n = x_{\sigma(1)} \dotsb x_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
for any permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Operads from the symmetric and braid groups===
There is an operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The composite &lt;math&gt;\sigma \circ (\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n)&lt;/math&gt; permutes its inputs in blocks according to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and within blocks according to the appropriate &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, there is a non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Artin [[braid group]] &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, this non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad has the structure of a braided operad, which generalizes the notion of an operad from symmetric to braid groups.

===Linear algebra===
In [[linear algebra]], one can consider vector spaces to be algebras over the operad &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; (the infinite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]], so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes [[linear combinations]]: the vector &lt;math&gt;(2,3,-5,0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; for instance corresponds to the linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;2v_1 + 3v_2 -5v_3 + 0v_4 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can consider [[affine combination]]s, [[conical combination]]s, and [[convex combination]]s to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded [[convex polytope]] is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.

This point of view formalizes the notion that linear combinations are the most general sort of operation on a vector space – saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that ''all possible'' algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations. The basic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are a [[generating set]] for the operad of all linear combinations, while the linear combinations operad canonically encodes all possible operations on a vector space.

{{personal finance}}
A '''pawnbroker'''  is an individual or business ('''pawnshop''' or '''pawn shop''') that offers [[secured loan]]s to people, with items of [[personal property]] used as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]. The items having been ''pawned'' to the broker are themselves called [[pledge (law)|''pledges'' or ''pawns'']], or simply the collateral. While many items can be pawned, pawnshops typically accept jewelry, musical instruments, home audio equipment, computers, video game systems, televisions, cameras, power tools, firearms, and other relatively valuable items as collateral.

[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Camden High Street, London.JPG|thumb|A [[London]] shop displays the traditional pawnbroker's sign.]]

If an item is pawned for a loan (colloquially "hocked" or "popped"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|pop}}&lt;/ref&gt;), within a certain contractual period of time the pawner may redeem it for the amount of the loan plus some agreed-upon amount for [[interest]]. The amount of time, and rate of interest, is governed by law and by the pawnbroker's policies. If the loan is not paid (or extended, if applicable) within the time period, the pawned item will be offered for sale to other customers by the pawnbroker. Unlike other lenders, the pawnbroker does not report the defaulted loan on the customer's credit report, since the pawnbroker has physical possession of the item and may recoup the loan value through outright sale of the item. The pawnbroker also sells items that have been sold outright to them by customers. Some pawnshops are willing to trade items in their shop for items brought to them by customers.

==Business model==

===Assessment of items===
The pawning process begins when a customer brings an item into a pawn shop. Common items pawned (or, in some instances, sold outright) by customers include [[jewelry]], [[electronics]], collectibles, [[musical instruments]], [[tools]], and (depending on local regulations) [[firearms]]. [[Gold]], [[silver]], and [[platinum]] are popular items—which are often purchased, even if in the form of broken jewelry of little value. Metal can still be sold in bulk to a [[bullion]] dealer or [[smelter]] for the value by weight of the component metals. Similarly, jewelry that contains genuine [[gemstones]], even if broken or missing pieces, have value.

The pawnbroker assumes the risk that an item might have been stolen. However, laws in many jurisdictions protect both the community and broker from ''unknowingly'' [[handling stolen goods]] (also known as ''fencing''). These laws often require that the pawnbroker establish positive identification of the seller through photo identification (such as a driver's license or government-issued [[identity document]]), as well as a holding period placed on an item purchased by a pawnbroker (to allow time for local law enforcement authorities to track stolen items). In some jurisdictions, pawnshops must give a list of all newly pawned items and any associated serial number to police, so the police can determine if any of the items have been reported stolen. Many police departments advise burglary or robbery victims to visit local pawnshops to see if they can locate stolen items. Some pawnshops set up their own screening criteria to avoid buying stolen property.

The pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the [[used good]]s market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.

To assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks ("blue books"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake [[Rolex]] watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it.  The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.

===Determining amount of loan===
To determine the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner needs to take into account several factors. A key factor is the predicted resale value of the item. This is often thought of in terms of a range, with the low point being the [[wholesale]] value of the used good, in the case that the pawnshop is unable to sell it to pawnshop customers, and they decide to sell it to a wholesale merchant of used goods. The higher point in the range is the retail sale price in the pawnshop. For example, a five-year-old laptop may have been bought by the customer for $1000. However, as a used item in a pawnshop, it might only fetch $250 as a purchase price in the pawnshop, because the customers will be wary that it might be a [[lemon market|"lemon"]] that the seller is getting rid of because it has some hard-to-detect problem, and because pawnshops do not typically offer a warranty with goods sold. Used electronics wholesalers will buy the laptop from the pawnshop owner for $100 to $150. The wholesaler pays a lower price than the retail value because they have the added cost of hiring electronics technicians who overhaul and repair the items so that they can be sold in used electronics stores.

The pawnshop owner also takes into account their knowledge of [[supply and demand]] for the item in question to determine if they think that they will end up selling the laptop for $100 to a wholesaler or $250 to a pawnshop customer. If the pawnshop owner believes that the local market for used laptops is saturated (overloaded with used laptops), they may fear that they will only get $100 for the laptop if they have to unload it to a wholesaler. With that figure in mind as the expected revenue, the pawnshop owner has to factor in the overhead costs of the store (rent, heat, electricity, phone connection, yellow pages advertisement, website costs, staff costs, insurance, alarm system, items lost when they are confiscated by police, etc.), and a profit for the business. As such, the customer who comes in with this laptop that they paid $1000 for when it was new may be offered as little as $50 by the pawnshop owner, who is taking into account all of the risk and cost factors.

In determining the amount of the loan, the pawnshop owner also assesses the likelihood that the customer will pay the interest for several weeks or months and then return to repay the loan and reclaim the item. Since the key to the pawnshop business model is making interest off the loaned money, pawnshop owners want to accept items that the customer is likely to want to recover, after having paid interest for a period on the loan. If, in an extreme case, a pawnshop only accepted items that customers had no interest in ever reclaiming, it would not make any money from interest, and the store would in effect become a second hand dealer.  Determining if the customer is likely to return to reclaim an item is a subjective decision, and the pawnshop owner may take many factors into account. For example, if a young able-bodied man comes into the pawnshop to pawn an electric wheelchair (perhaps claiming it to be the possession of his late grandparent), the pawnshop owner may doubt that the item will be redeemed. On the other hand, if a middle aged man pawns a top quality set of golf clubs, the pawnshop owner may assess it as more credible that he will return for the items.  Some customers may attempt to persuade the pawnshop owner that the item in question is important to them ("that necklace belonged to my grandmother, so I will certainly return for it") as a means of obtaining a loan.  Other customers return to the same store, repeatedly pawn the same item(s) as a way of borrowing money, and return to pay the interest and recover the item(s) before the end of the loan period; thus, the pawnbroker knows that redemption is likely and will therefore make the loan.

The saleability of the item and the amount that the customer wants for it are also factored into the pawnbroker's assessment; if a customer offers a very salable item at a low price, the pawnbroker may accept it even if it is unlikely that the customer will return, because the pawnshop can turn around a quick profit on the item. However, if a customer offers an extremely low price the pawnbroker may turn down the offer, because this suggests that the item may either be counterfeit or stolen.

In some countries e.g. Sweden there is legislation to prevent the pawn broker from making unfair profits ([[usury]] due to financial distress or ignorance of the customer) at the expense of the customer by low evaluation on their collaterals. It is stated that the pawn broker may not keep the collateral but must sell them at public [[auction]]. Any excess after paying the loan, the interest and auction costs must be paid to the customer. If the item does not fetch a price that will cover these expenses the pawn broker may keep the item and sell it through other channels. Despite this protection, the cost for the customer to borrow money this way will be high, and if he cannot redeem the collateral it would in many cases be better to sell the goods directly.

===Inventory management===
Pawnshops have to be careful to manage how many new items they accept as pawns: either too little inventory or too much is bad. A pawnshop might have too little inventory if, for example, it mostly buys jewels and gold that it resells or smelts—or perhaps the pawnshop owner quickly sells most items through specialty shops (e.g., musical instruments to music stores, stereos to used hi-fi audio stores, etc.). In this case, the pawnshop is less interesting to customers, because it is mostly empty.

On the other extreme, a pawnshop with a huge inventory has several disadvantages. If the store is crammed with used athletic gear, old stereos, and old tools, the store owner must spend time and money shelving and sorting items, displaying them on different stands or in glass cases, and monitoring customers to prevent [[shoplifting]]. If there are too many low-value, poor quality items, such as old toasters, scratched-up 20-year-old TVs, and worn-out sports gear piled into cardboard boxes, the store may begin to look more like a [[rummage sale]] or [[flea market]].  Small, high-value items such as iPod players or cell phones must be in locked glass display cases, which means the owner may need additional staff to unlock the cabinets for items customers want to examine. As a store fills with items, an owner must protect inventory theft by hiring staff to supervise the different areas or install security cameras and alarms. Too much unsold inventory means that the store has not been able to realize value from these items to provide cash to lend.

The better option lies in the middle: a store with a moderate amount of good quality, brand-name items arranged neatly in the display windows attracts passersby, who are more likely to enter and shop. If items are attractively laid out in display cases and shelves, the pawnshop looks more professional and reputable. Once passersby start shopping in the store, they may be more inclined to pawn or sell their own items to the pawnshop. Some pawnshop owners prevent cluttered look by storing overstocked items, or less attractive items such as snow tires, in a back room or basement. Some pawnshop companies operate a chain of stores in a state or province. This way, they can balance inventory between stores. For example, they can move some of a rural store's surfeit of fishing gear to an urban store.

Some stores also slim down inventory by selling items to specialty retailers. A pawnshop in a low-income neighborhood that pays a customer $300 for a power amplifier with a used value of $2000 may find the unit hard to sell alongside much less expensive merchandise. They may sell the amplifier to a used audio equipment store whose customers expect higher end equipment. Some pawnshops sell specialty items online, on  [[eBay]] or other websites. A specialty item such as a high-end model railroad set may not sell in the store for its "blue book" value. On an online auction, it stands a good chance of bringing a good price.

Another growing trend in the industry is vehicle pawn or auto pawning. This form of Pawnbroking works like a traditional pawn loan, however these stores only accept vehicles as security. Many stores are also accepting "Title Loans", where you can pawn the ownership or "Title" documents of your vehicle. This essentially means that the pawnbroker owns your car while you drive it, and you regain ownership once you pay back your loan. 

===Auxiliary operations===
While the main business activities of a pawnshop are lending money for interest based on valuable items that customers bring in, some pawnshops also undertake other business activities, such as selling brand-new retail items that are in demand in the neighborhood of the store. Depending on where a pawnshop is located, these other retail items may range from musical instruments to firearms. Some pawnbrokers also sell brand-new self-defense items such as pepper spray or stun guns.

Many pawnshops will also trade used items, as long as the transaction turns a profit for pawn shop. In cases where the pawnshop buys items outright, the money is not a loan; it is a straight payment for the item.  On sales, the pawnshop may offer [[layaway]] plans, subject to conditions (down payment, regular payments, and forfeiture of previously paid amounts if the item is not paid off).

Some pawnshops may keep a few unusual, high value items on display to capture the interests of passersby, such as a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle; the owner is not typically expecting to sell these items. Other activities carried out by pawnshops are financial services including fee-based check cashing, [[payday loan]]s, vehicle title or house title loans, and currency exchange services.

===Upscale pawnshops===
Upscale pawnshops began to appear in the early 20th century, often referred to as "loan offices", since the term “pawn shop” had a very negative historical reputation at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=D1uBNDvz4XsC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=upscale+pawnshops#v=onepage&amp;q=upscale%20pawnshops&amp;f=false |page=66 and 70–72 |title=In Hock: Pawning in America from Independence through the Great Depression |publisher=University of Chicago Press |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |year=2009 |author=Wendy A.

These objects can include wine collections, jewelry, large diamonds, fine art, cars, and unique memorabilia. Loans are often sought to deal with business revenue shortfalls and other expensive fiscal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-07-15/pawn-shops-going-upscale/56225816/1 |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |title=Pawn shops are going upscale for affluent clients |date=July 15, 2012 |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |author=Russ Wiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upscale pawnshops have also been featured in reality television.

===Industry===
In the US, there are over 11,000 pawnbrokers and an industry revenue of $14.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Pawn Shops Industry Sails Through The Recession|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/5/prweb9529413.htm|website=prweb.com|publisher=[[Cision]]|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US industry serves 30 million customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pawn Industry Statistics|url=https://www.nationalpawnbrokers.org/about/pawn-industry-faqs/|website=nationalpawnbrokers.org|publisher=National Pawn Brokers Association|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of pawnbroking}}
In the west, pawnbroking existed in the Ancient Greek and Roman Empires. Most contemporary [[Western law]] on the subject is derived from the Roman jurisprudence. As the empire spread its culture, pawnbroking went with it. Likewise, in the East, the business model existed in China 1500 years ago in [[Buddhist_temple|Buddhist monasteries]] no different from today, through the ages strictly regulated by Imperial or other authorities.

[[File:Pawnshop with sign in usa.jpg|thumb|left|Modern pawnbroker storefront.]]

In spite of early [[Roman Catholic Church]] prohibitions against charging [[interest]] on [[loan]]s, there is some evidence that the [[Franciscans]] were permitted to begin the practice as an aid to the poor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gregg|first=Samuel|date=2016|title=How Medieval Monks Changed the Face of Banking|journal=American Banker|volume=1 no. 88|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pawn brokerage arrived in England with [[William the Conqueror]]. In 1338, Edward III pawned his jewels to raise money for his war with France. King Henry V did much the same in 1415. The Lombards were not a popular class, and [[Henry VII Tudor|Henry VII]] harried them a good deal. In 1603 an ''Act against Brokers'' was passed and remained on the statute-book until 1872. It was aimed at the many counterfeit brokers in London. This type of broker was evidently regarded as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]].
[[File:Provident Loan Society Essex Houston jeh.jpg|thumb|[[Provident Loan Society]] of New York, a charitable pawnbroker]]

Crusaders, predominantly in France, brokered their land holdings to monasteries and diocese for funds to supply, outfit, and transport their armies to the Holy Land. Instead of outright repayment the Church reaped a certain amount of crop returns for a certain amount of seasons, which could additionally be re-exchanged in a type of equity.

A pawnbroker can also be a charity. In 1450, Barnaba Manassei, a [[Franciscan]] monk, began the Monte di Pietà movement in [[Perugia]], Italy. It provided financial assistance in the form of no-interest loans secured with pawned items.  Instead of interest, the Monte di Pietà urged borrowers to make donations to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].  It spread through Italy, then to other parts of Europe. The first Monte de Piedad organization in Spain was founded in [[Madrid]], and from there the idea was transferred to [[New Spain]] by Pedro Romero de Terreros, the Count of Santa Maria de Regla&lt;ref name="Ficachi"&gt;{{cite web|author=Leon Teutli Ficachi |url=http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |format=PDF |title=Nacional Monte de Piedad |accessdate=2008-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219125044/http://www.anahuac.mx/clares/archivos/nacionalmontedepiedad.pdf |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Order of Calatrava|Knight of Calatrava]].&lt;ref name="EncMex"/&gt; The [[Nacional Monte de Piedad]] is a charitable institution and pawn shop whose main office is located just off the [[Zocalo]], or main plaza of [[Mexico City]].

==Symbol==
[[File:Pawnbroker-traditional-symbol.svg|80px|framed|Symbol of pawnbrokers.]]
[[File:Pawnbroker's sign, Queen Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Pawnbroker's sign in [[Edinburgh]] Scotland]]

The pawnbrokers' symbol is three spheres suspended from a bar. The three sphere symbol is attributed to the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence, Italy]], owing to its symbolic meaning of Lombard.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2017}} This refers to the [[Regions of Italy|Italian region]] of [[Lombardy]], where pawn shop banking originated under the name of [[Lombard banking]]. The three golden spheres were originally a symbol medieval Lombard merchants hung in front of their houses, and not the arms of the Medici family. It has been conjectured that the golden spheres were originally three flat yellow effigies of [[bezant]]s, or gold coins, laid heraldically upon a [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] field, but that they were converted into spheres to better attract attention.

Most European towns called the pawn shop the "Lombard". The [[Lombards|House of Lombard]] was a banking community in medieval [[London, England]]. According to legend, a Medici employed by [[Charlemagne]] slew a giant using three bags of rocks. The three-ball symbol became the family crest. Since the Medicis were so successful in the financial, banking, and moneylending industries, other families also adopted the symbol. Throughout the Middle Ages, [[heraldry|coats of arms]] bore three balls, orbs, plates, discs, coins and more as symbols of monetary success.

[[Saint Nicholas]] is the patron saint of pawnbrokers. The symbol has also been attributed to the story of Nicholas giving a poor man's three daughters each a [[bag of gold]] so they could get [[Marriage|married]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202075513/http://www.history.com/shows/pawn-stars/articles/pawn-stats |date=February 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Asia==

[[File:Hk wan chai tram ways 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pawn shop in Hong Kong]]
[[File:Hong Kong Pawn Shop Logo.jpg|float|thumb|A typical Hong Kong pawn shop sign: a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]].]]

In [[Hong Kong]] the practice follows the Chinese tradition, and the counter of the shop is typically higher than the average person for security. A customer can only hold up his hand to offer belongings and there is a wooden screen between the door and the counter for customers' privacy. The symbol of a pawn shop in Hong Kong is a [[bat]] holding a [[coin]] ({{zh|蝠鼠吊金錢}}, [[Cantonese]]: ''fūk syú diu gām chín''). The bat signifies fortune and the coin signifies benefits. In Japan, the usual symbol for a pawn shop is a circled number seven (7) because "shichi", the Japanese word for seven, sounds similar to the word for "pawn" ({{lang|ja|質}}).

The majority of pawnbrokers in Malaysia, a multi-race country wherein [[Malaysian Chinese]] consists 25% of the population, are managed by Malaysian Chinese. In Malay, pawn is called "pajak gadai". A valid and licensed pawnshop in Malaysia must always declare themselves as a "pajak gadai" or a pawn shop for their company registration. They must also fulfill the requirements of the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] which states the pawn counter must not be higher than 4 feet, is bullet-proof, has stainless-steel counters/doors, strong rooms with automatic locks, safes, equipped with fully computerized system, CCTV, alarm, and pawnbroker insurance.

In the [[Philippines]], the operation of pawnshops is managed by private businesses and is duly regulated by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]. Pawn shops usually accept gold jewelry, appliances, gadgets, etc. Many pawn shops in the Philippines have adapted other services into their nationwide branches like [[Tambunting Pawnshop]]. Services like international and domestic [[remittance]], [[insurance]], bills payment, [[Business-to-business|b2b]] money collection, e-loading for mobile phones, ticketing, and even banking are not unusual to see in a regular Filipino pawn shop.  [[Pawnhero]] is an online Filipino pawnshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/technology/news/85763-pawnhero-philippines-launch|title=PawnHero's online pawnshop goes live in the Philippines|website=Rappler|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the Marwari [[Jain]] community pioneered the pawnbroking business, but today others are involved; the work is done by many agents called "saudagar". Instead of working from a shop, they go to needy people's homes and motivate them to become involved in the business. Pawn shops are often run as part of jewelry stores. Gold, silver, and diamonds are frequently accepted as collateral.

Pawnbroking is also a traditional trade in [[Thailand]], where pawn shops are run both privately and by local governments.

In [[Sri Lanka]], pawnbroking is a lucrative business engaged in by specialized pawnbrokers as well as commercial banks and other finance companies.

In [[Indonesia]], there is a state-owned company called [[Pegadaian]] which provides a range of conventional and Sharia-compliant pawnbroking services across the archipelago. The company accepts high-value items such as gold, motor vehicles, and other expensive items as collateral. In addition to pawnbroking activities, the company provides a range of other services, such as a safe deposit box and gold trading services.

[[Image:Focal stability.png|thumb|300px|right|Phase space of a dynamic system with focal instability, showing one phase space trajectory]] 
In [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical system theory]], a '''phase space''' is a [[Space (mathematics)|space]] in which all possible states of a [[system]] are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space. For [[classical mechanics|mechanical systems]], the phase space usually consists of all possible values of [[position (vector)|position]] and [[momentum]] variables.  The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Willard Gibbs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nolte | first1 = D. D. | title = The tangled tale of phase space | doi = 10.1063/1.3397041 | journal = Physics Today | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 33–38| year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2010PhT....63d..33N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In a phase space, every [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] or [[parameter]] of the system is represented as an axis of a multidimensional space; a one-dimensional system is called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], while a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]]. For every possible state of the system, or allowed combination of values of the system's parameters, a point is included in the multidimensional space. The system's evolving state over time traces a path (a '''phase space trajectory''' for the system) through the high-dimensional space. The phase space trajectory represents the set of states compatible with starting from one particular [[initial condition]], located in the full phase space that represents the set of states compatible with starting from ''any'' initial condition.   As a whole, the phase diagram represents all that the system can be, and its shape can easily elucidate qualities of the system that might not be obvious otherwise. A phase space may contain a great number of dimensions. For instance, a gas containing many molecules may require a separate dimension for each particle's ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' positions and momenta (6 dimensions for an idealized monatomic gas), and for more complex molecular systems additional dimensions are required to describe vibrational modes of the molecular bonds, as well as spin around 3 axes. Phase spaces are easier to use when analyzing behavior of mechanical systems restricted to motion around and along various axes of rotation or translation - e.g. in robotics, like analyzing the range of motion of a [[robotic arm]] or determining the optimal path to achieve a particular position/momentum result.

===Conjugate momentarily===
[[File:Hamiltonian flow classical.gif|frame|left|Evolution of an [[statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of classical systems in phase space (top). The systems are a massive particle in a one-dimensional potential well (red curve, lower figure). The initially compact ensemble becomes swirled up over time.]]

In classical mechanics, any choice of [[generalized coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; for the position (i.e. coordinates on [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]) defines [[conjugate momentum|conjugate generalized momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which together define co-ordinates on phase space. More abstractly, in classical mechanics phase space is the [[cotangent bundle]] of configuration space, and in this interpretation the procedure above expresses that a choice of local coordinates on configuration space induces a choice of natural local [[Darboux coordinates]] for the standard [[symplectic structure]] on a cotangent space.

===Statistical ensembles in phase space===
The motion of an [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] of systems in this space is studied by classical [[statistical mechanics]]. The local density of points in such systems obeys [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's Theorem]], and so can be taken as constant. Within the context of a model system in classical mechanics, the phase space coordinates of the system at any given time are composed of all of the system's dynamic variables.  Because of this, it is possible to calculate the state of the system at any given time in the future or the past, through integration of Hamilton's or Lagrange's equations of motion.

== Examples ==
[[File:Pendulum phase portrait illustration.svg|430px|left|thumbnail|Illustration of how a phase portrait would be constructed for the motion of a simple [[pendulum]].]]
[[File:PenduleEspaceDesPhases.png|thumb|right|Time-series flow in phase space specified by the differential equation of a [[pendulum]]. The X axis corresponds to the pendulum's position, and the Y axis its speed.]]

=== Low dimensions ===
{{main|phase line (mathematics)|phase plane}}

For simple systems, there may be as few as one or two degrees of freedom. One degree of freedom occurs when one has an [[Autonomous system (mathematics)|autonomous]] [[ordinary differential equation]] in a single variable, &lt;math&gt;dy/dt = f(y),&lt;/math&gt; with the resulting one-dimensional system being called a [[Phase line (mathematics)|phase line]], and the qualitative behaviour of the system being immediately visible from the phase line. The simplest non-trivial examples are the [[exponential growth model]]/decay (one unstable/stable equilibrium) and the [[logistic growth model]] (two equilibria, one stable, one unstable).

The phase space of a two-dimensional system is called a [[phase plane]], which occurs in classical mechanics for a single particle moving in one dimension, and where the two variables are position and velocity. In this case, a sketch of the [[phase portrait]] may give qualitative information about the dynamics of the system, such as the [[limit cycle]] of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]] shown in the diagram.

Here, the horizontal axis gives the position and vertical axis the velocity.  As the system evolves, its state follows one of the lines (trajectories) on the phase diagram.
[[Image:Limitcycle.svg|thumb|340px|right|[[Phase portrait]] of the [[Van der Pol oscillator]]]]

=== Chaos theory ===
Classic examples of phase diagrams from [[chaos theory]] are :
* the [[Lorenz attractor]]
* population growth (i.e. [[logistic map]])
* parameter plane of [[complex quadratic polynomial]]s with [[Mandelbrot set]].

==Phase plot==
A plot of position and momentum variables as a function of time is sometimes called a '''phase plot''' or a '''phase diagram'''. [[Phase diagram]], however, is more usually reserved in the [[Outline of physical science|physical sciences]] for a diagram showing the various regions of stability of the thermodynamic phases of a chemical system, which consists of [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and composition.

==Quantum mechanics==
In [[quantum mechanics]], the coordinates ''p'' and ''q'' of phase space normally become [[hermitian operators]] in a [[Hilbert space]].

But they may alternatively retain their classical interpretation, provided  functions of them compose in novel algebraic ways (through [[Moyal product|Groenewold's 1946 star product]]), consistent with the [[uncertainty principle]] of quantum mechanics. 
Every quantum mechanical [[observable]] corresponds to a unique function or [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] on phase space, and vice versa, as specified by [[Hermann Weyl]] (1927) and supplemented by [[John von Neumann]] (1931); [[Eugene Wigner]] (1932); and, in a grand synthesis, by [[Hilbrand J. Groenewold|H J Groenewold]] (1946). 
With [[José Enrique Moyal|J E Moyal]] (1949), these completed the foundations of  the '''[[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics''', a complete and logically autonomous reformulation of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Zachos | first2 = C. K. | doi = 10.1142/S2251158X12000069 | title = Quantum Mechanics in Phase Space | journal = Asia Pacific Physics Newsletter | volume = 01 | pages = 37 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | arxiv = 1104.5269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Its modern abstractions include [[deformation quantization]] and [[geometric quantization]].)
 
Expectation values in phase-space quantization are obtained isomorphically to tracing operator observables with the density matrix in Hilbert space: they are obtained by phase-space integrals of observables, with the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]] effectively serving as a measure.

Thus, by expressing quantum mechanics in phase space (the same ambit as for classical mechanics), the [[Wigner–Weyl transform|Weyl map]] facilitates recognition of quantum mechanics as a [[Deformation theory|'''deformation''']] (generalization) of classical mechanics, with deformation parameter ''[[Reduced Planck constant|ħ]]/S'', where ''S'' is the [[Action (physics)|action]] of the relevant process. (Other familiar deformations in physics involve the deformation of classical Newtonian into [[Special relativity|relativistic mechanics]], with deformation parameter ''v''/''c'';{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} or the deformation of Newtonian gravity into [[General Relativity]], with deformation parameter [[Schwarzschild radius]]/characteristic-dimension.){{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Classical expressions, observables, and operations (such as Poisson brackets) are modified by ħ-dependent quantum corrections, as the conventional commutative multiplication applying in classical mechanics is generalized to the noncommutative star-multiplication characterizing quantum mechanics and underlying its uncertainty principle.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
&lt;!-- [[Thermodynamic phase space]] redirects here]] --&gt;
In [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]] contexts, the term phase space has two meanings: It is used in the same sense as in classical mechanics. If a thermodynamic system consists of ''N'' particles, then a point in the 6''N''-dimensional phase space describes the dynamic state of every particle in that system, as each particle is associated with three position variables and three momentum variables. In this sense, as long as the particles are [[Gibbs paradox|distinguishable]], a point in phase space is said to be a [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstate]] of the system. (For [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] a microstate will consist of a set of ''N''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt; points, corresponding to all possible exchanges of the ''N'' particles.)  ''N'' is typically on the order of [[Avogadro's number]], thus describing the system at a microscopic level is often impractical. This leads  to the use of phase space in a different sense.

The phase space can also refer to the space that is parametrized by the ''macroscopic'' states of the system, such as pressure, temperature, etc. For instance, one may view the pressure-volume diagram or entropy-temperature diagrams as describing part of this phase space. A point in this phase space is correspondingly called a macrostate. There may easily be more than one microstate with the same macrostate. For example, for a fixed temperature, the system could have many dynamic configurations at the microscopic level. When used in this sense, a phase is a region of phase space where the system in question is in, for example, the [[liquid]] phase, or [[solid]] phase, etc.

Since there are many more microstates than macrostates, the phase space in the first sense is usually a [[manifold]] of much larger dimensions than in the second sense. Clearly, many more parameters are required to register every detail of the system down to the molecular or atomic scale than to simply specify, say, the temperature or the pressure of the system.

==Optics==
Phase space is extensively used in [[nonimaging optics]],&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt; the branch of optics devoted to illumination. It is also an important concept in [[Hamiltonian optics]].

== Phase integral ==
In classical statistical mechanics (continuous energies) the concept of phase space provides a classical analog to the [[Partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] (sum over states) known as the phase integral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurendeau |first=Normand M. |title=Statistical Thermodynamics: Fundamentals and Applications |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-84635-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of summing the Boltzmann factor over discretely spaced energy states (defined by
appropriate integer [[quantum numbers]] for each degree of freedom) one may integrate over continuous phase space.  Such integration essentially consists of two parts: integration of the momentum component of all degrees of freedom (momentum space) and integration of the position component of all degrees of freedom (configuration space).  Once the phase integral is known, it may be related to the classical partition function by multiplication of a normalization constant representing the number of [[quantum energy states]] per unit phase space. This normalization constant is simply the inverse of [[Planck's constant]] raised to a power equal to the number of degrees of freedom for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|title=Configuration integral|last=Vu-Quoc|first=L.|year=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29|archivedate=April 28, 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18856">In [[mathematics]] and [[classical mechanics]], the '''Poisson bracket''' is an important [[binary operation]] in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]], playing a central role in Hamilton's equations of motion, which govern the time evolution of a Hamiltonian [[dynamical system]]. The Poisson bracket also distinguishes a certain class of coordinate transformations, called ''[[canonical transformations]]'', which map [[Canonical coordinates|canonical coordinate systems]] into canonical coordinate systems. A "canonical coordinate system" consists of canonical position and momentum variables (below symbolized by &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, respectively) that satisfy canonical Poisson bracket relations. The set of possible canonical transformations is always very rich. For instance, it is often possible to choose the Hamiltonian itself &lt;math&gt;H =H(q, p; t)&lt;/math&gt; as one of the new canonical momentum coordinates.

In a more general sense, the Poisson bracket is used to define a [[Poisson algebra]], of which the algebra of functions on a [[Poisson manifold]] is a special case. There are other general examples, as well: it occurs in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s, where the [[tensor algebra]] of a Lie algebra forms a Poisson algebra; a detailed construction of how this comes about is given in the [[universal enveloping algebra]] article. Quantum deformations of the universal enveloping algebra lead to the notion of [[quantum group]]s.

All of these objects are named in honour of [[Siméon Denis Poisson]].

==Properties==
Given two functions &lt;math&gt;f,\ g&lt;/math&gt; that depend on [[phase space]] and time, their Poisson bracket &lt;math&gt;\{f, g\}&lt;/math&gt; is another function that depends on phase space and time. The following rules hold for any three functions &lt;math&gt;f,\, g,\, h&lt;/math&gt; of phase space and time:
;[[Anticommutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = -\{g, f\}&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Bilinearity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{af + bg, h\} = a\{f, h\} + b\{g, h\}, \quad \{h, af + bg\} = a\{h, f\} + b\{h, g\}, \quad a, b \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Product rule|Leibniz's rule]]: &lt;math&gt;\{fg, h\} = \{f, h\}g + f\{g, h\}&lt;/math&gt;
;[[Jacobi identity]]: &lt;math&gt;\{f, \{g, h\}\} + \{g, \{h, f\}\} +  \{h, \{f, g\}\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Also, if a function &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is constant over phase space (but may depend on time), then &lt;math&gt;\{f,\, k\} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition in canonical coordinates==
In [[canonical coordinates]] (also known as [[Darboux coordinates]]) &lt;math&gt; (q_i,\, p_i)&lt;/math&gt; on the [[phase space]], given two functions &lt;math&gt; f(p_i,\, q_i, t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g(p_i,\, q_i, t)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;&lt;math&gt; f(p_i,\, q_i,\, t)&lt;/math&gt; means &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the &lt;math&gt;2N + 1&lt;/math&gt; independent variables: momentum, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;{{sub|1…N}}; position, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;{{sub|1…N}}; and time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Poisson bracket takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial q_{i}} \frac{\partial g}{\partial p_{i}} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i} \frac{\partial g}{\partial q_i}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Poisson brackets of the canonical coordinates are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{q_i,q_j\} &amp;= 0 \\
  \{p_i,p_j\} &amp;= 0 \\
  \{q_i,p_j\} &amp;= \delta_{ij}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;''{{sub|ij}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Hamilton's equations of motion==
[[Hamilton's equations of motion]] have an equivalent expression in terms of the Poisson bracket. This may be most directly demonstrated in an explicit coordinate frame. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f(p, q, t)&lt;/math&gt; is a function on the manifold. Then from the multivariable [[chain rule]],

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} f(p, q, t) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\mathrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac {\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\mathrm{d}p}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Further, one may take &lt;math&gt;p=p(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q=q(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be solutions to [[Hamilton's equations]]; that is,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
  \dot{q} =  \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \{q, H\} \\ 
  \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} = \{p, H\}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac {\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} f(p, q, t) &amp;= \frac{\partial f}{\partial q} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} \\
                                             &amp;= \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the time evolution of a function {{mvar|f}} on a [[symplectic manifold]] can be given as a [[flow (mathematics)|one-parameter family]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s (i.e., [[canonical transformations]], area-preserving diffeomorphisms), with the time ''t'' being the parameter:  Hamiltonian motion is a canonical transformation generated by the Hamiltonian. That is, Poisson brackets are preserved in it, so that ''any time t'' in the solution to Hamilton's equations, 

: &lt;math&gt; q(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \} ) q(0), \quad  p(t) = \exp (-t \{ H, \cdot \}) p(0) &lt;/math&gt;, 

can serve as the bracket coordinates. ''Poisson brackets are [[Canonical transformation|canonical invariants]]''.

Dropping the coordinates, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} f = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \{H, \cdot\}\right)f~.&lt;/math&gt;

The operator in the convective part of the derivative, {{mvar|i}}''L&amp;#770;'' = {{math|−{''H'', •} }}, is sometimes referred to  as the Liouvillian (see [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)]]).

==Constants of motion==
An [[integrable dynamical system]] will have [[constants of motion]] in addition to the energy. Such constants of motion will commute with the Hamiltonian under the Poisson bracket. Suppose some function &lt;math&gt;f(p, q)&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of motion. This implies that if &lt;math&gt;p(t), q(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[trajectory]] or solution to  the [[Hamilton's equations of motion]], then

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{\text{d}f}{\text{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;

along that trajectory. Then

:&lt;math&gt;0 = \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t} f(p,q) = \{f, H\} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}=\{f, H\}&lt;/math&gt;

where, as above, the intermediate step follows by applying the equations of motion and we supposed that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not explicitly depend on time. This equation is known as the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]]. The content of [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] is that the time evolution of a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] (or "[[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]" on the phase space) is given by the above.

If the Poisson bracket of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes (&lt;math&gt;\{f,g\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;), then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''in involution'''.  In order for a Hamiltonian system to be [[completely integrable]], &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; independent constants of motion must be in [[Distribution (differential geometry)#Involutive distributions|mutual involution]], where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of degrees of freedom.

Furthermore, according to the '''Poisson's Theorem''', if two quantities &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are explicitly time independent (&lt;math&gt;A(p, q), B(p, q)&lt;/math&gt;) constants of motion, so is their Poisson bracket &lt;math&gt;\{A,\, B\}&lt;/math&gt;. This does not always supply a useful result, however, since the number of possible constants of motion is limited (&lt;math&gt;2n - 1&lt;/math&gt; for a system with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom), and so the result may be trivial (a constant, or a function of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.)

==The Poisson bracket in coordinate-free language==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be   [[symplectic manifold]], that is, a [[manifold]] equipped with a [[symplectic form]]: a [[Differential form|2-form]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; which is both '''closed''' (i.e., its  [[exterior derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\text{d} \omega&lt;/math&gt; vanishes) and '''non-degenerate'''.  For example, in the treatment above, take &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{2n}&lt;/math&gt; and take

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{d} q_i \wedge \text{d} p_i.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \iota_v \omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interior product]] or [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] operation defined by &lt;math&gt; (\iota_v \omega)(w) =  \omega(v,\, w)&lt;/math&gt;, then non-degeneracy is equivalent to saying that for every one-form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique vector field &lt;math&gt;\Omega_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega =  \alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{\text{d} H} = \omega^{-1}(\text{d} H)&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Hamiltonian vector field]] &lt;math&gt;X_H&lt;/math&gt; can be defined to be &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{\text{d} H}&lt;/math&gt;.  It is easy to see that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  X_{p_i} &amp;=  \frac{\partial}{\partial q_i} \\
  X_{q_i} &amp;= -\frac{\partial}{\partial p_i}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Poisson bracket''' &lt;math&gt;\ \{\cdot,\, \cdot\} &lt;/math&gt; on (''M'', ω) is a [[bilinear map|bilinear operation]] on [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, defined by &lt;math&gt; \{f,\, g\} \;=\; \omega(X_f,\, X_g) &lt;/math&gt;; the Poisson bracket of two functions on ''M'' is itself a function on ''M''.  The Poisson bracket is antisymmetric because:

:&lt;math&gt;\{f, g\} = \omega(X_f, X_g) = -\omega(X_g, X_f) = -\{g, f\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore,

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{f, g\} &amp;= \omega(X_f, X_g) = \omega(\Omega_{df}, X_g) \\
           &amp;= (\iota_{\Omega_{df}}\omega)(X_g) = df(X_g) \\
           &amp;= X_gf = \mathcal{L}_{X_g} f
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;f'' denotes the vector field ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' applied to the function ''f'' as a directional derivative, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{X_g} f&lt;/math&gt; denotes the (entirely equivalent) [[Lie derivative]] of the function ''f''.

If α is an arbitrary one-form on ''M'', the vector field Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; generates (at least locally) a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the boundary condition &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(0) = x&lt;/math&gt; and the first-order differential equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi_x}{dt} = \left. \Omega_\alpha \right|_{\phi_x(t)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt; \phi_x(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be [[symplectomorphism]]s ([[canonical transformation]]s) for every ''t'' as a function of ''x'' if and only if &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;; when this is true, Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is called a [[symplectic vector field]].  Recalling [[Cartan's identity]] &lt;math&gt;  \mathcal{L}_X\omega \;=\; d (\iota_X \omega) \,+\, \iota_X d\omega&lt;/math&gt; and ''d''ω = 0, it follows that &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\Omega_\alpha}\omega \;=\; d\left(\iota_{\Omega_\alpha} \omega\right) \;=\; d\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Ω&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is a symplectic vector field if and only if α is a [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed form]].  Since &lt;math&gt; d(df) \;=\; d^2f \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that every Hamiltonian vector field ''X&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a symplectic vector field, and that the Hamiltonian flow consists of canonical transformations.  From {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} above, under the Hamiltonian flow ''X&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}f(\phi_x(t)) = X_Hf = \{f,H\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a fundamental result in Hamiltonian mechanics, governing the time evolution of functions defined on phase space.  As noted above, when ''{f,H} = 0'', ''f'' is a constant of motion of the system.  In addition, in canonical coordinates (with &lt;math&gt; \{p_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \{q_i,q_j\} \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{q_i,\, p_j\} \;=\; \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;), Hamilton's equations for the time evolution of the system follow immediately from this formula.

It also follows from {{EquationNote|1|(1)}} that the Poisson bracket is a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]; that is, it satisfies a non-commutative version of Leibniz's [[product rule]]:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\{fg,h\} = f\{g,h\} + g\{f,h\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\{f,gh\} = g\{f,h\} + h\{f,g\}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

The Poisson bracket is intimately connected to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] of the Hamiltonian vector fields.  Because the Lie derivative is a derivation,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = \iota_{\mathcal L_vw}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega = \iota_{[v,w]}\omega + \iota_w\mathcal L_v\omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus if ''v'' and ''w'' are symplectic, using &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_v\omega \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt;, Cartan's identity, and the fact that &lt;math&gt;\iota_w\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a closed form,

:&lt;math&gt;\iota_{[v,w]}\omega = \mathcal L_v\iota_w\omega = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) + \iota_vd(\iota_w\omega) = d(\iota_v\iota_w\omega) = d(\omega(w,v)).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;[v,w] = X_{\omega(w,v)}&lt;/math&gt;, so that
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;[X_f,X_g] = X_{\omega(X_g,X_f)} = -X_{\omega(X_f,X_g)} = -X_{\{f,g\}}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Thus, the Poisson bracket on functions corresponds to the Lie bracket of the associated Hamiltonian vector fields.  We have also shown that the Lie bracket of two symplectic vector fields is a Hamiltonian vector field and hence is also symplectic.  In the language of [[abstract algebra]], the symplectic vector fields form a [[subalgebra]] of the [[Lie algebra]] of smooth vector fields on ''M'', and the Hamiltonian vector fields form an [[algebraic ideal|ideal]] of this subalgebra.  The symplectic vector fields are the Lie algebra of the (infinite-dimensional) [[Lie group]] of [[symplectomorphism]]s of ''M''.

It is widely asserted that the [[Jacobi identity]] for the Poisson bracket,

:&lt;math&gt;\ \{f,\{g,h\}\} + \{g,\{h,f\}\} + \{h,\{f,g\}\} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

follows from the corresponding identity for the Lie bracket of vector fields, but this is true only up to a locally constant function.  However, to prove the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket, it is [[Jacobi identity#Examples|sufficient]] to show that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_{\{f,g\}}=[\operatorname{ad}_f,\operatorname{ad}_g]&lt;/math&gt;

where the operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g&lt;/math&gt; on smooth functions on ''M'' is defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g(\cdot) \;=\; \{\cdot,\, g\}&lt;/math&gt; and the bracket on the right-hand side is the commutator of operators, &lt;math&gt; [\operatorname A,\, \operatorname B] \;=\; \operatorname A\operatorname B - \operatorname B\operatorname A&lt;/math&gt;.  By {{EquationNote|1|(1)}}, the operator &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}_g&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the operator ''X&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The proof of the Jacobi identity follows from {{EquationNote|3|(3)}} because the Lie bracket of vector fields is just their commutator as differential operators.

The [[Algebra over a field|algebra]] of smooth functions on M, together with the Poisson bracket forms a [[Poisson algebra]], because it is a [[Lie algebra]] under the Poisson bracket, which additionally satisfies Leibniz's rule {{EquationNote|2|(2)}}.  We have shown that every [[symplectic manifold]] is a [[Poisson manifold]], that is a manifold with a "curly-bracket" operator on smooth functions such that the smooth functions form a Poisson algebra.  However, not every Poisson manifold arises in this way, because Poisson manifolds allow for degeneracy which cannot arise in the symplectic case.

==A result on conjugate momenta==
Given a smooth [[vector field]] ''X'' on the configuration space, let ''P&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' be its [[conjugate momentum]]. The conjugate momentum mapping is a [[Lie algebra]] anti-homomorphism from the Poisson bracket to the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\{P_X, P_Y\} = -P_{[X, Y]}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This important result is worth a short proof. Write a vector field ''X'' at point ''q'' in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] as

:&lt;math&gt;X_q = \sum_i X^i(q) \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{\partial}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt; is the local coordinate frame. The conjugate momentum to ''X'' has the expression

:&lt;math&gt;P_X(q, p) = \sum_i X^i(q) \;p_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the momentum functions conjugate to the coordinates. One then has, for a point ''(q,p)'' in the [[phase space]],

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \{P_X,P_Y\}(q,p) &amp;=  \sum_i \sum_j \left\{ X^i(q) \;p_i, Y^j(q)\; p_j \right\} \\
                   &amp;=  \sum_{ij} p_i Y^j(q) \frac{\partial X^i}{\partial q^j} -  p_j X^i(q) \frac{\partial Y^j}{\partial q^i} \\
                   &amp;= -\sum_i p_i \; [X, Y]^i(q) \\
                   &amp;= - P_{[X, Y]}(q, p). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above holds for all ''(q, p)'', giving the desired result.

==Quantization==
Poisson brackets [[Deformation theory|deform]] to [[Moyal bracket]]s upon [[Weyl quantization|quantization]], that is, they generalize to a different Lie algebra, the [[Moyal bracket|Moyal algebra]], or, equivalently in [[Hilbert space]], quantum [[commutator]]s. The Wigner-İnönü [[group contraction]] of these (the classical limit, {{math|ħ → 0}})  yields the above Lie algebra.

To state this more explicitly and precisely, the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the [[Heisenberg algebra]] is the [[Weyl algebra]] (modulo the relation that the center be the unit). The Moyal product is then a special case of the star product on the algebra of symbols. An explicit definition of the algebra of symbols, and the star product is given in the article on the [[universal enveloping algebra]].

'''Predictive coding''' models suggest that the [[brain]] is constantly generating and updating hypotheses that predict sensory input at varying levels of abstraction. This framework is in contrast to the view that the brain integrates exteroceptive information through a predominantly feedforward process, with feedback connections playing a more minor role in cortical processing.

==Origins==

Theoretical ancestors to predictive coding date back as early as 1860 with Helmholz’s concept of [[unconscious inference]] (Clark, 2013). Unconscious inference refers to the idea that the human brain fills in visual information to make sense of a scene. For example, if something is relatively smaller than another object in the visual field, the brain uses that information as a likely cue of depth, such that the perceiver ultimately (and involuntarily) experiences depth. The understanding of perception as the interaction between sensory stimuli (bottom-up) and conceptual knowledge (top-down) continued to be established by [[Jerome Bruner (psychologist)]] who, starting in the 1940s, studied the ways in which needs, motivations and expectations influence perception, research that came to be known as 'New Look' psychology. In 1981, [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart|Rumelhart]] in their seminal paper examined the interaction between processing features (lines and contours) which form letters, which in turn form words. While the features suggest the presence of a word, they found that when letters were situated in the context of a word, people were able to identify them faster than when they were situated in a non-word without semantic context. McClelland and Rumelhart’s parallel processing model describes perception as the meeting of top-down (conceptual) and bottom-up (sensory) elements.

In the late 1990s, the idea of top-down and bottom-up processing was translated into a computational model of vision by [[Rajesh Rao|Rao]] and [[Dana H. Ballard|Ballard]] (1999). Their paper demonstrated that there could be a generative model of a scene (top-down processing), which would receive feedback via error signals (how much the visual input varied from the prediction), which would subsequently lead to updating the prediction. The computational model was able to replicate well-established receptive field effects, as well as less understood extra-classical receptive field effects such as end-stopping. Today, the fields of computer science and cognitive science incorporate these same concepts to create the multilayer generative models that underlie machine learning and neural nets ([[Geoff Hinton|Hinton]], 2010).

== General framework ==

Most of the research literature in the field has been about [[sensory perception]], particularly vision, which is more easily conceptualized. However, the predictive coding framework could also be applied to different neural systems. Taking the sensory system as an example, the brain solves the seemingly intractable problem of modelling distal causes of sensory input through a version of [[Bayesian inference]]. It does this by modelling predictions of lower-level sensory inputs via backward connections from relatively higher levels in a cortical hierarchy (Clark, 2013). 
Constrained by the statistical regularities of the outside world (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress sensory inputs rising up from lower levels. A comparison between predictions (priors) and sensory input (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts sensory input in the future.

If, instead, the model accurately predicts driving sensory signals, activity at higher levels cancels out activity at lower levels, and the posterior probability of the model is increased. Thus, predictive coding inverts the conventional view of perception as a mostly bottom-up process, suggesting that it is largely constrained by prior predictions, where signals from the external world only shape perception to the extent that they are propagated up the cortical hierarchy in the form of prediction error.

===Precision weighting===
 
Expectations about the precision (or inverse variance) of incoming sensory input are crucial for effectively minimizing prediction error in that the expected precision of a given prediction error can inform confidence in that error, which influences the extent to which the error is weighted in updating predictions (Feldman &amp; Friston, 2010). Given that the world we live in is loaded with [[statistical noise]], precision expectations must be represented as part of the brain’s generative models, and they should be able to flexibly adapt to changing contexts. For instance, the expected precision of visual prediction errors likely varies between dawn and dusk, such that greater conditional confidence is assigned to errors in broad daylight than errors in prediction at nightfall (Hohwy, 2012). It has recently been proposed that such weighting of prediction errors in proportion to their estimated precision is, in essence, attention (Friston, 2009), and that the process of devoting attention may be neurobiologically accomplished by ascending reticular activating systems (ARAS) optimizing the “gain” of prediction error units.

===Active inference===

The same principle of prediction error minimization has been used to provide an account of behavior in which motor actions are not commands but descending proprioceptive predictions. In this scheme of [[active inference]], classical reflex arcs are coordinated so as to selectively sample sensory input in ways that better fulfill predictions, thereby minimizing proprioceptive prediction errors (Friston, 2009). Indeed, Adams et al. (2013) review evidence suggesting that this view of hierarchical predictive coding in the motor system provides a principled and neurally plausible framework for explaining the agranular organization of the motor cortex. This view suggests that “perceptual and motor systems should not be regarded as separate but instead as a single active inference machine that tries to predict its sensory input in all domains:  visual, auditory, somatosensory, interoceptive and, in the case of the motor system, proprioceptive” (Adams, Shipp, &amp; Friston, 2013).

==Neural theory in predictive coding==

Evaluating the empirical evidence that suggests a neurologically plausible basis for predictive coding is a broad and varied task. For one thing, and according to the model, predictive coding occurs at every iterative step in the perceptual and cognitive processes; accordingly, manifestations of predictive coding in the brain include genetics, specific cytoarchitecture of cells, systemic networks of neurons, and whole brain analyses. Due to this range of specificity, different methods of investigating the neural mechanisms of predictive coding have been applied, where available; more generally, however, and at least as it relates to humans, there are significant methodological limitations to investigating the potential evidence and much of the work is based on computational modeling of microcircuits in the brain. Notwithstanding, there has been substantial (theoretical) work that has been applied to understanding predictive coding mechanisms in the brain. This section will focus on specific evidence as it relates to the predictive coding phenomenon, rather than analogues, such as homeostasis (which are, nonetheless, integral to our overall understanding of Bayesian inference but already supported heavily; see Clark, 2012 for a review).

Much of the early work that applied a predictive coding framework to neural mechanisms came from sensory neurons, particularly in the visual cortex (e.g., Rao and Ballard, 1999; Bolz &amp; Gilbert, 1986).

More generally, however, what seems to be required by the theory are (at least) two types of neurons (at every level of the perceptual hierarchy): one set of neurons that encode incoming sensory input, so called feed-forward projections; one set of neurons that send down predictions, so called feed-backward projections. It is important to note that these neurons must also carry properties of error detection; which class of neurons has these properties is still up for debate (see Koster-Hale &amp; Saxe, 2013; Seth, 2013). These sort of neurons have found support in superficial and non-superficial pyramidal neurons.

At a more whole-brain level, there is evidence that different cortical layers (aka laminae) may facilitate the integration of feedforward and feed-backward projections across hierarchies. These cortical layers, divided into granular, agranular, and dysgranular, which house the subpopulations of neurons mentioned above, are divided into 6 main layers. The cytoarchitecture within these layers are the same, but they differ across layers. For example, layer 4 of the granular cortex contain granule cells which are excitatory and distribute thalamocortical inputs to the rest of the cortex. According to one model: &lt;blockquote&gt;

“...prediction neurons... in deep layers of agranular cortex drive active inference by sending sensory predictions via projections ...to supragranular layers of dysgranular and granular sensory cortices. Prediction-error neurons ….in the supragranular layers of granular cortex compute the difference between the predicted and received sensory signal, and send prediction-error signals via projections...back to the deep layers of agranular cortical regions. Precision cells … tune the gain on predictions and prediction error dynamically, thereby giving these signals reduced (or, in some cases, greater) weight depending on the relative confidence in the descending predictions or the reliability of incoming sensory signals.” (Barrett &amp; Simmons, 2015)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In sum, the neural evidence is still in its infancy.

==Applying predictive coding==

===Perception===

The empirical evidence for predictive coding is most robust for perceptual processing. As early as 1999, Rao and Ballard proposed a hierarchical [[visual processing]] model in which higher-order visual cortical area sends down predictions and the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities (Rao and Ballard, 1999). According to this model, each level in the hierarchical model network (except the lowest level, which represents the image) attempts to predict the responses at the next lower level via feedback connections, and the error signal is used to correct the estimate of the input signal at each level concurrently (Rao and Ballard, 1999). Emberson et al. established the top-down modulation in infants using a cross-modal audiovisual omission paradigm, determining that even infant brains have expectation about future sensory input that is carried downstream from visual cortices and are capable of expectation-based feedback (Emberson et al., 2015). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data showed that infant [[occipital cortex]] responded to unexpected visual omission (with no visual information input) but not to expected visual omission. These results establish that in a hierarchically organized perception system, higher-order neurons send down predictions to lower-order neurons, which in turn sends back up the prediction error signal.

===Interoception===

There have been several competing models for the role of predictive coding in [[interoception]].

In 2013, Anil Seth proposed that our subjective feeling states, otherwise known as emotions, are generated by predictive models that is built actively of causal interoceptive appraisals.
In relation to how we attribute internal states of others to causes, Sasha Ondobaka, James Kilner, and Karl Friston (2015) proposed that the free energy principle requires the brain to produce a continuous series of predictions with the goal of reducing the amount of prediction error that manifests as “free energy”. These errors are then used to model anticipatory information about what the state of the outside world will be and attributions of causes of that world state, including understanding of causes of others’ behavior. This is especially necessary because, to create these attributions, our multimodal sensory systems need interoceptive predictions to organize themselves. Therefore, Ondobaka posits that predictive coding is key to understanding other people’s internal states.

In 2015, Lisa Barrett and W. Kyle Simmons (2015) proposed the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding model, a framework that unifies Bayesian active inference principles with a physiological framework of corticocortical connections. Using this model, they posited that agranular visceromotor cortices are responsible for generating predictions about interoception, thus, defining the experience of interoception.

In 2017, contrary to the inductive notion that emotion categories  are biologically distinct, Barrett (2017) proposed the theory of constructed emotion, which is the account that a biological emotion category is constructed based on a conceptual category--the accumulation of instances sharing a goal. In a predictive coding model, Barrett hypothesizes that, in interoception, our brains regulate our bodies by activating "embodied simulations" (full-bodied representations of sensory experience) to anticipate what our brains predict that the external world will throw at us sensorially and how we will respond to it with action. These simulations are either preserved if, based on our brain's predictions, they prepare us well for what actually subsequently occurs in the external world, or they, and our predictions, are adjusted to compensate for the their error in comparison to what actually occurs in the external world and how well-prepared we were for it. Then, in a trial-error-adjust process, our bodies find similarities in goals among certain successful anticipatory simulations and group them together under conceptual categories. Every time a new experience arises, our brains use this past trial-error-adjust history to match the new experience to one of the categories of accumulated corrected simulations that is shares the most similarity with. Then, they apply the corrected simulation of that category to the new experience in the hopes of preparing our bodies for the rest of the experience. If it does not, the prediction, the simulation, and perhaps the boundaries of the conceptual category are revised in the hopes of higher accuracy next time, and the process continues. Barrett hypothesizes that, when prediction error for a certain category of simulations for x-like experiences is minimized, what results is a correction-informed simulation that the body will reenact for every x-like experience, resulting in a correction-informed full-bodied representation of sensory experience--an emotion. In this sense, Barrett proposes that we construct our emotions because the conceptual category framework our brains use to compare new experiences, and to pick the appropriate predictive sensory simulation to activate, is built on the go.

===Challenges===

As a mechanistic theory, predictive coding has not been mapped out physiologically on the neuronal level. One of the biggest challenges to the theory has been the imprecision of exactly how prediction error minimization works (Kogo &amp; Trengove, 2015). In some studies, the increase in BOLD signal has been interpreted as error signal while in others it indicates changes in the input representation (Kogo &amp; Trengove, 2015). A crucial question that needs to be addressed is what exactly constitutes error signal and how it is computed at each level of information processing (Bastos et al., 2012). Another challenge that has been posed is predictive coding’s computational tractability. According to Kwisthout and Rooij, the subcomputation in each level of the predictive coding framework potentially hides a computationally intractable problem, which amounts to “intractable hurdles” that computational modelers have yet to overcome (Kwisthout &amp; Rooij, 2013). Ransom and Fazelpour (2015) indicate "Three Problems for the Predictive Coding Theory of Attention".

Future research could focus on clarifying the neurophysiological mechanism and computational model of predictive coding.

'''Proactive policing''' is the practice of deterring criminal activity by showing police presence and engaging the public to learn their concerns, thereby preventing crime from taking place in the first place. In contrast, responding to a complaint after a crime has been committed is reactive policing.&lt;ref name=ankony1&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officers' Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement." ''Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management,'' vol. 22. no. 2 (1999): 120-32.[http://www.robertankony.net/publications/impact-perceived]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2017 report by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], there is "evidence that a number of proactive policing practices are successful in reducing crime and disorder, at least in the short term, and that most of these strategies do not harm communities' attitudes toward police. However, the effects of proactive policing on other important outcomes—such as on the legality of police behavior and on racially biased behavior—are unclear because of gaps in research... Moreover, evidence on many proactive strategies is limited to near-term, localized impacts. Little is known about the strategies' long-term effects on crime or other outcomes, and about whether and to what extent they will offer crime control benefits at a larger jurisdictional level—for example, across an entire precinct or city."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24928/proactive-policing-effects-on-crime-and-communities|title=Proactive Policing: Effects on Crime and Communities|last=Crime|first=Committee on Proactive Policing: Effects on|last2=Communities|last3=Liberties|first3=and Civil|last4=Justice|first4=Committee on Law and|last5=Education|first5=Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and|last6=Sciences|first6=National Academies of|last7=Engineering|last8=Medicine|first8=and|date=2017-11-09|isbn=9780309467100|language=en|doi=10.17226/24928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:California Highway Patrol.jpg|left|thumb|California Highway Patrol]]

Individual officers wields an enormous amount of discretion in enforcing the law (esp, non-dispatched runs like traffic enforcement or street crime). What is surprising is the public belief that police are usually eager and motivated to do their job. Thus, when a particular crime problem becomes apparent, it is often approached by monetary related arguments, such as the need for more police, equipment, training etc.; rather than by non-monetary related approaches, such as recognizing how a high perception of [[social alienation|alienation]] among police officers from the citizens of the community where they patrol reduces morale and spawns police indifference, inactivity, and apathy.&lt;ref name=ankony2&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Community Alienation and Its Impact on Police," ''Police Chief,'' Oct. 1999: 150-53. [http://www.robertankony.net/publications/the-impact-of-community-alienation-on-police-officers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of alienation is especially relevant as the contemporary [[community policing]] movement emphasizes proactive law enforcement strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Bobinsky, Robert, "Reflections on Community-Oriented Policing," FBI Law Enforcement Journal Bulletin, Mar. 1994: 15-19.[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147475NCJRS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mastrofski, Stephen, Robert Worden, and Jeffery Snipes, "Law Enforcement in a time of Community Policing, " ''Criminology'' (Nov. 1995):539-563.&lt;/ref&gt; Effective community policing requires that police officers work closely with local citizens in designing and implementing a variety of proactive crime prevention and control measures. To accomplish these initiatives, it is crucial that officers feel closely integrated with the majority of citizens in the community they serve. Typically, this means that officers perceive themselves as sharing important community values and beliefs and ''being confident of community support'' in the decisions they make.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

As the perception of community alienation increases among police officers, their sense of confidence or mastery in decision making will decrease, and so too their motivation for proactive enforcement. The impact of highly publicized "pro-police" verdicts of brutality incidents (i.e., Rodney King, Los Angeles 1991; Malice Green, Detroit 1992; O.J. Simpson, Los Angeles 1994; Michael Brown, Ferguson 2014; Eric Garner, New York 2014; and Freddie Gray, Baltimore 2015) are related to the level of perceived alienation experienced by police and thus their willingness to respond proactively to serious crime.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mortaz, C., "Alienation among Police Officers," Journal of Police Science and Administration, Mar. 1983: 23-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, M, "Alienation among Veteran Police Officers," ''Police Chief,'' Feb. 1987: 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The New National Crime Wave," ''Wall Street Journal'', Ms. Mac Donald, May 30, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; FBI Director James Comey and DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg suggested the "[[Ferguson effect]]" as the cause to recent spikes in crime in several large cities, especially Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kevin, "DEA chief: Comey 'spot on' linking Ferguson impact to crime surge," ''USA Today'', November 4, 2015. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/04/comey-chuck-rosenberg-dea-ferguson/75160884/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists, alienation is a condition in social relationships reflected by a low degree of integration or common values and a high degree of distance or isolation between individuals, or between an individual and a group of people in a community or work environment. Alienation is closely aligned with the concept of mastery. Mastery is typically defined as a state of mind in which an individual feels autonomous and experiences confidence in his or her ability, skill, and knowledge to control or influence external events. The greater the level of alienation an individual experiences in a community or work setting, the weaker will be their sense of mastery.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

For police officers, a strong sense of mastery is particularly vital in relation to proactive law enforcement. Proactive enforcement is usually defined as the predisposition of a police officer to be actively involved in preventing and investigating crime. Because police patrol work is highly unsupervised, most officers have considerable discretion or personal initiative regarding their level of proactive behavior on the streets. Again, it would seem logical that the stronger the level of perceived community alienation among police officers, the weaker will be their sense of mastery and motivation to engage in proactive law enforcement behavior.&lt;ref name=ankony2/&gt;

==Elements==

Proactive policing is closely related to the practice of community policing.&lt;ref&gt;Burden, O. "Community Policing," ''National Fraternal Order of Police Journal,'' Fall/Winter: 31-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Community policing's goal is "problem solving." Community policing emphasizes proactive enforcement that proposes street crime can be reduced through greater community involvement and integration between citizens and police. Community policing departments and officers must commit time to develop a "partnership" with the community to: 1) Prevent and counter crime; 2) Maintain order; and 3) Reduce the fear of crime.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt; Police organization is decentralized with every police officer and detective having a neighborhood to patrol with agreed upon goals and objectives to solve. Police officers must feel integrated with the majority of the citizens of the community where they patrol, and that they perceive themselves as sharing similar values and beliefs so they are confident in their decision making ability. Each police officer must get out of their cars (not just drive by and grin and wave) to visit with citizens and businesses to learn the residents concerns and show they're a friend and protector—in contrast to "strict law enforcement" or "reactive policing" which doesn't view the citizens as customers.&lt;ref name=ankony1/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some people argue that policing should rightfully be restricted to reactive policing with a corollary that proactive policing is improper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reason.com/archives/2013/03/27/when-proactive-policing-becomes-harassme|title=When Proactive Policing Becomes Harassment|work=Reason.com|date=2013-03-27|first=Jacob|last=Sullum}}&lt;/ref&gt; if not illegal.

A '''process reference model''' is a [[Conceptual model|model]] that has generic functionality and can be used more than once in different models. The creator of a process model benefits from existing process reference models by not needing to reinvent the process model but only reusing it as a starting point in creating a process model for a specific purpose.

==Process model reuse==
During the identification of processes ideal for reuse, the designer needs to (1) Get approval (2) Provide Organization Scope Context and (3) Identify Process [[Standardization]] Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Marne de Vries, Alta van der Merwe, Paula Kotze and Aurona Gerber. (2011) A Method for Identifying Process Reuse Opportunities to Enhance the Operating Model. 2011 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1867">In [[mathematics]], more precisely in [[algebra]], a '''prosolvable group''' (less common: '''prosoluble group''') is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is [[isomorphic]] to the [[inverse limit]] of an [[inverse system]] of [[solvable group]]s. Equivalently, a group is called '''prosolvable''', if, viewed as a [[topological group]], every [[open neighborhood]] of the identity contains a [[normal subgroup]] whose corresponding [[quotient group]] is a solvable group.

== Examples ==
* Let ''p'' be a [[prime]], and denote the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[p-adic numbers]], as usually, by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[Galois group]] &lt;math&gt;\text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p/\mathbf{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbf{Q}}_p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[algebraic closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;, is prosolvable. This follows from the fact that, for any finite [[Galois extension]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_p&lt;/math&gt;, the Galois group &lt;math&gt;\text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as [[semidirect product]] &lt;math&gt;\text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_p)=(R \rtimes Q) \rtimes P&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; cyclic of order &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; [[cyclic group|cyclic]] of order dividing &lt;math&gt;p^f-1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-power order. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\text{Gal}(L/\mathbf{Q}_p)&lt;/math&gt; is solvable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Boston|first=Nigel|title=The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|year=2003|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]]|location=Madison, Wisconsin, USA |url=http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012''' (Republic Act No. 10354), informally known as the '''Reproductive Health Law''' or '''RH Law''', is a [[law]] in the [[Philippines]], which guarantees universal access to methods on [[contraception]], fertility control, [[sexual education]], and maternal care.

While there is general agreement about its provisions on maternal and child health, there is great debate on its mandate that the Philippine government and the private sector will fund and undertake widespread distribution of family planning devices such as [[condoms]], [[birth control pill]]s, and [[IUD]]s, as the government continues to disseminate information on their use through all health care centers.

Passage of the legislation was controversial and highly divisive, with tambays, academics, religious institutions, and major political figures declaring their support or opposition while it was pending in the legislature. Heated debates and rallies both supporting and opposing the RH Bill took place nationwide.

The Supreme Court delayed implementation of the law in March 2013 in response to challenges. On April 3,2014, the Court ruled that the law was "not unconstitutional" but struck down eight provisions partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/54946-supreme-court-rh-law-constitutional | title=SC declares RH law constitutional | work=[[Rappler]] | date=April 8, 2014 | accessdate=April 8, 2014 | author=Bernal, Buena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate Policy Brief titled "Promoting Reproductive Health", the history of reproductive health in the Philippines dates back to 1967 when leaders of 12 countries including the Philippines' [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed the Declaration on Population.&lt;ref name="declaration" /&gt;&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The Philippines agreed that the population problem should be considered as the principal element for long-term economic development. Thus, the Population Commission was created to push for a lower family size norm and provide information and services to lower fertility rates.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

Starting 1967, the [[USAID]] began shouldering 80% of the total family planning commodities (contraceptives) of the country, which amounted to $3 million annually. In 1975, the United States adopted as its policy the [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]]: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200). The policy gives "paramount importance" to population control measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries, including the Philippines to control rapid population growth which they deem to be inimical to the sociopolitical national interests of the United States, since the "U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad", and these countries can produce destabilizing opposition forces against the United States. It recommends the U.S. leadership to "influence national leaders" and that "improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&lt;ref name=nssm200 /&gt;

Different presidents had different points of emphasis. President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] pushed for a systematic distribution of contraceptives all over the country, a policy that was called "coercive", by its leading administrator.&lt;ref name=delosreyes02 /&gt; The [[Cory Aquino|Corazon Aquino]] administration focused on giving couples the right to have the number of children they prefer, while [[Fidel V. Ramos]] shifted from population control to population management. [[Joseph Estrada]] used mixed methods of reducing fertility rates, while [[Rvee Jude A. Olandsca]] focused on mainstreaming [[natural family planning]], while stating that contraceptives are openly sold in the country.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In 1989, the Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development (PLCPD) was established, "dedicated to the formulation of viable public policies requiring legislation on population management and socio-economic development".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 2000, the Philippines signed the [[Millennium Declaration]] and committed to attain the MDGs by 2015, including promoting [[gender equality]] and health. In 2003 USAID started its phase out of a 33-year-old program by which free contraceptives were given to the country. Aid recipients such as the Philippines faced the challenge to fund its own contraception program. In 2004 the Department of Health introduced the Philippines Contraceptive Self-Reliance Strategy, arranging for the replacement of these donations with domestically provided contraceptives.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

In August 2010, the government announced a collaborative work with the USAID in implementing a comprehensive marketing and communications strategy in favor of family planning called ''May Plano Sila''.

==== Summary of major provisions ====
The bill mandates the government to "promote, without biases, all effective natural and modern methods of family planning that are medically safe and legal."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politics.inquirer.net/politics/view/20110131-317656/RH-bill-OKd-at-House-committee-level |title=RH bill OK’d at House committee level |last1=Dalangin-Fernandez |first1=Lira |date=1 February 2011 |work=politics.inquirer.net |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although abortion is recognized as illegal and punishable by law, the bill states that “the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner”.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill calls for a "multi-dimensional approach" integrates a component of family planning and responsible parenthood into all government anti-poverty programs.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt; Age-appropriate reproductive health and sexuality education is required from grade five to fourth year high school using "life-skills and other approaches."&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The bill also mandates the [[Department of Labor and Employment (Philippines)|Department of Labor and Employment]] to guarantee the reproductive health rights of its female employees. Companies with fewer than 200 workers are required to enter into partnership with health care providers in their area for the delivery of reproductive health services.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Employers with more than 200 employees shall provide reproductive health services to all employees in their own respective health facilities. Those with fewer than 200 workers shall enter into partnerships with health professionals for the delivery of reproductive health services. Employers shall inform employees of the availability of family planning. They are also obliged to monitor pregnant working employees among their workforce and ensure they are provided paid half-day prenatal medical leaves for each month of the pregnancy period that they are employed.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

The national government and local governments will ensure the availability of reproductive health care services like family planning and [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

Any person or public official who prohibits or restricts the delivery of legal and medically safe reproductive health care services will be meted penalty by imprisonment or a fine.&lt;ref name="consolidation-inq" /&gt;

== Support ==

Free choice regarding reproductive health enables people, especially the poor, to have the number of children they want and can feasibly care and provide for. There are several studies cited by those who support the bill:
*Economic studies, especially the experience in Asia,&lt;ref name="SOE2008" /&gt; show that rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;
*Poverty incidence is higher among big families.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt; Smaller families and wider birth intervals could allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;
*Studies show that 44% of the pregnancies in the poorest [[Quantile|quintile]] are unanticipated, and among the poorest women who would like to avoid pregnancy, at least 41% do not use any contraceptive method because of lack of information or access&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method"&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;
*Use of contraception, which the [[World Health Organization]] has listed as [[essential medicine]]s,&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; will lower the rate of abortions as it has done in other parts of the world, according to the [[Guttmacher Institute]]&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;
*An SWS survey of 2008 showed that 71% of the respondents are in favor of the bill&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Opponents of the bill argue that:

*People's freedom to access contraceptives is not restricted by any opposing law, being available in family planning NGOs, stores, etc. The country is not a [[welfare state]]: taxpayer's money should not be used for personal practices that are harmful and immoral; it can be used to inform people of the harm of BCPs.
*The penal provisions constitute a violation of free choice and conscience, and establishes [[religious persecution]]&lt;ref name=ocampo&gt;{{Cite news

President Aquino stated he was not an author of the bill. He also stated that he gives full support to a firm population policy, educating parents to be responsible, providing contraceptives to those who ask for them, but he refuses to promote contraceptive use. He said that his position "is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health".&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt;&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

== Economic and demographic premises ==

The Philippines is the 39th most densely populated country, with a density over 335 per square kilometer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/geography/population_density_persons_per_sq_km_2011_0.html |title=Population density - Persons per sq km 2011 country ranks, By Rank |publisher=Photius.com |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the population growth rate is 1.9% (2010 Census),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/pressrelease/2012/pr1227tx.html |title=THE 2010 CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING REVEALS THE PHILIPPINE POPULATION AT 92.34 MILLION |publisher=Census.gov.ph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.957% (2010 est. by [[CIA World Factbook]]), or 1.85% (2005–2010 high variant estimate by the UN Population Division, ''World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision'') coming from 3.1 in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The 2013 [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) is 3.20 births per woman, from a TFR of 7 in 1960.&lt;ref name=factbook&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rp.html | title= The World Factbook – Philippines | publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency &lt;!-- | accessdate=2013 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the total fertility rate for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, which is about one third the TFR of the poorest quintile (5.9 children per woman). The TFR for women with college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only an elementary education (4.5 children per woman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=643267&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 |title=EU hopes Congress will approve RH bill |last1=Lee Brago |first1=Pia |date=28 December 2010 |publisher=Philippine Star |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressman Lagman states that the bill "recognizes the verifiable link between a huge population and poverty. Unbridled population growth stunts socioeconomic development and aggravates poverty".&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

The [[University of the Philippines]] School of Economics presented two papers in support of the bill:  ''Population and Poverty: the Real Score'' (2004), and ''Population, Poverty, Politics and the Reproductive Health Bill'' (2008). According to these economists, which include [[Solita Monsod]], [[Gerardo Sicat]], Cayetano Paderanga, Ernesto M. Pernia, and Stella Alabastro-Quimbo, "rapid population growth and high fertility rates, especially among the poor, do exacerbate poverty and make it harder for the government to address it", while at the same time clarifying that it would be "extreme" to view "population growth as the principal cause of poverty that would justify the government resorting to draconian and coercive measures to deal with the problem (e.g., denial of basic services and subsidies to families with more than two children)". They illustrate the connection between rapid population growth and poverty by comparing the economic growth and population growth rates of Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, wherein the first two grew more rapidly than the Philippines due to lower population growth rates.&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt; They stressed that "the experience from across Asia indicates that a population policy cum government-funded [family planning] program has been a critical complement to sound economic policy and poverty reduction".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;

In ''Population and Poverty'', Aniceto Orbeta, Jr., showed that poverty incidence is higher among big families: 57.3% of Filipino families with seven children are in poverty while only 23.8% of families who have two children live below the poverty threshold.&lt;ref name=orbeta2003 /&gt;
[[File:Philippines poverty.png|thumb|right|150px|Percentage of population living below poverty line (2003). Darker areas mean more poverty.]]
Proponents argue that smaller families and wider birth intervals resulting from the use of contraceptives allow families to invest more in each child’s education, health, nutrition and eventually reduce poverty and hunger at the household level.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; At the national level, fertility reduction cuts the cost of social services with fewer people attending school or seeking medical care and as demand eases for housing, transportation, jobs, water, food, and other natural resources.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SOE2004 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] in 2004 also listed a large population as one of the major causes of poverty in the country, together with weak macroeconomic management, employment issues, an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda, governance issues including corruption.&lt;ref name=adb2004 /&gt;

=== Criticism of premises ===

Opponents refer to a 2003 study of [[Rand Corporation]], which concluded that "there is little cross-country evidence that population growth impedes or promotes economic growth...population neutralism has in fact been the predominant school in thinking among academics about population growth for the last half-century". For example, the 1992 study of [[Ross Levine]] and David Renelt, which covered 119 countries over 30 years (versus a [[University of the Philippines]] study of 3 countries over a few years). The RAND study also said that a large population can promote growth given the right fundamentals.&lt;ref name=rand2003 /&gt; Thus, they refer to the [[HSBC]] 2012 projection for 2050 that the Philippines will be 16th largest economy due to its large growing population, and those whose populations are decreasing will suffer decline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/wider-world-in-2050.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent development, two authors of the Reproductive Health Bill changed their stand on the provisions of the bill regarding population and development. Reps. Emerciana de Jesus and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]] wanted to delete three provisions which state that "gender equality and women empowerment are central elements of reproductive health and population and development", which integrate responsible parenthood and family planning programs into anti-poverty initiatives, and which name the Population Commission as a coordinating body. The two party-list representatives strongly state that poverty is not due to over-population but because of inequality and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calonzo|first=Andreo|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/222199/nation/2-rh-authors-want-population-control-provisions-scrapped|title=2 RH authors want population control provisions scrapped|publisher=GMA News Online|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in July 2012 said that Aquino's "promotion of a 'reproductive health' bill is jarring" since it could lead to "a demographic trap of too few workers. The Philippines doesn't have too many people, it has too few pro-growth policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443570904577544542963426800 |title=Review &amp; Outlook: Keeping the Philippine Dream Alive - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing the bill, Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] wrote that it is "truly disingenuous for anyone to proceed on the premise that the poor are to blame for the nation’s poverty:. He emphasized that the government should apply the principle of first things first and focus on the root causes of the poverty (e.g., poor governance, corruption) and apply many other alternatives to solve the problem (e.g., giving up [[pork barrel]], raising tax collection efficiency).&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

== Maternal health and deaths ==
Maternal deaths in the Philippines, according to the [[World Health Organization]], is at 5.7 per day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/49029/studies-show-maternal-deaths-in-philippines-in-decline |title=Studies show maternal deaths in Philippines in decline &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-08-28 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; not 10–11 deaths a day, as per the proponents who repeated these numbers "to drive home the point".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CBCP for Life |url=http://cbcpforlife.com/?p=5375 |title=Year-ender report: The crusade for a culture of life, Part 2 |publisher=Cbcpforlife.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=784230&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Pass the RH bill now - FROM THE STANDS By Domini M. Torrevillas - The Philippine Star » News » Opinion |publisher=Philstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proponents state that the passage of the RH Bill would mean:
*Access to information on natural and modern family planning
*Improvement of maternal, infant, and child health and nutrition
*Promotion of breast feeding
*Prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications
*Improvement of adolescent and youth health
*Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections, HIV/AIDS and other STDs
*Elimination of violence against women
*Counseling on sexuality and sexual and reproductive health
*Treatment of breast and reproductive tract cancers
*Male involvement and participation in reproductive health issues
*Prevention and treatment of infertility
*Reproductive health education for the youth

The Department of Health states that family planning can reduce maternal mortality by about 32%.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt; The bill is "meant to prevent maternal deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth", said Clara Padilla of Engender Rights. She reported that every day, "there are 11 women dying while giving birth in the Philippines. These preventable deaths could have been avoided if more Filipino women have access to reproductive health information and healthcare".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The key to solving maternal deaths, according to the ''Senate Policy Brief'' on reproductive health, is the establishment of [[birthing center]]s.&lt;ref name=senatepb2009 /&gt;

The [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) stated in their Position Paper that the goal of reducing the rise of maternal and child deaths "could be attained by improving maternal and child health care without the necessity of distributing contraceptives. The millions of funds intended for the contraceptive devices may just well be applied in improving the skills of our health workers in reducing maternal and child mortality in the Philippines".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

=== Magna Carta for Women ===

Senator Majority Floor Leader [[Tito Sotto]] said that the RH Bill is redundant to a 2009 law referred to as the Magna Carta for Women, which contains reproductive health provisions, asking the Senate to drop the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/230182/news/nation/sotto-asks-senate-to-scrap-redundant-rh-bill |title=Sotto asks Senate to scrap ‘redundant’ RH bill &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online &amp;#124; The Go-To Site for Filipinos Everywhere |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unmet need ===

Using data from the 2008 National Demographic and Health Survey, Lagman stated that "Twenty-two percent of married Filipino women have an unmet need for family planning services, an increase by more than one-third since the 2003 National Demographic and Housing Survey". "Our women are having more children than they desire, as seen in the gap between desired fertility (2.5 children) and actual fertility (3.5 children), implying a significant unmet need for reproductive health services", state some [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors. The Bill provides that "the State shall assist couples, parents and individuals to achieve their desired family size within the context of responsible parenthood for sustainable development and encourage them to have two children as the ideal family size."&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

Writing against the bill, [[Bernardo Villegas]] wrote about the ''Myth of Unmet Family Planning Needs'', citing development economist [[Lant Pritchett]] who said that the term "unmet need" is an elitist construct, an imposition of a need on the poor, disrespectful of their real preferences. Pritchett said that it is "based on a discrepancy...identified by the analyst through the comparison of responses to items in separate blocks of the questionnaire" and is "an inference on the part of the researcher, not a condition reported by the respondents themselves". Pritchett argued this term is applied to women who are not sexually active, are infecund, whose husband is absent, etc., thus bloating the numbers to favor the pharmaceutical companies and those with a population control agenda. Villegas stressed: "Because [the poor] have been deprived of the infrastructures they need, such as farm-to-market roads, [[irrigation]] systems, post-harvest facilities and other support services that the State neglected to provide them, the only economic resources they have are their children". He also challenged that he is willing to bet that if the government will provide cash money to the poor to buy condoms, the poor will use the cash for food and basic needs, thus exploding the myth.&lt;ref name=villegasunmet /&gt;

=== Access ===

One of the main concerns of the proponents is the perceived lack of access to family planning devices such as contraceptives and sterilization. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Pilule contraceptive.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Combined oral contraceptive pill|Birth control pill]]]]
The UP School of Economics argues, in contrast, that there is lack of access especially for poor people, because contraceptive use is extremely low among them and "among the poorest families, 22% of married women of reproductive age express a desire to avoid pregnancies but are still not using any family planning method".&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; They say that lack of access leads to a number of serious problems which demand attention: (1) "too many and too {{sic|hide=y|closely|-}}spaced children raises the risk of illness and premature deaths (for mother and child alike)," (2) "the health risks associated with mistimed and unwanted pregnancies are higher for adolescent mothers, as they are more likely to have complications during labor," (3) women who have mistimed pregnancies are "constrained to rely more on public education and health services and other publicly provided goods and services", further complicating limited public resources, (4) families are not able to achieve their desired family size. Thus the UP economists "strongly and unequivocally support" the thrust of the bill to enable "couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to carry out their decisions”.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt; Proponents argue that government-funded access is the key to breaking the inter-generational poverty that many people are trapped in.&lt;ref name=SOE2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

=== Natural family planning ===

Proponents of the bill contend that "natural family planning methods have not proven to be as reliable as artificial means of birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plcpd.com/rh-in-the-news/rh-bill-authors-agree-to-make-sex-education-optional/ |title=RH bill authors agree to make sex education optional &amp;#124; Philippine Legislators Committee on Population and Development Foundation, Inc |publisher=Plcpd.com |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abortion ==

=== Abortifacient issue ===

According to the RH bill, one of its components is "prevention of abortion and management of post-abortion complications". It provides that "the government shall ensure that all women needing care for post-abortion complications shall be treated and counseled in a humane, non-judgmental and compassionate manner". It also states that "abortion remains a crime and is punishable", as the Constitution declares that “the State shall equally protect the life of the mother and the life of the unborn from [[Fertilisation|conception]]”.&lt;ref name=jlp-law /&gt;

The position of the [[Philippine Medical Association]] (PMA) "is founded strongly on the principle that 'life or conception begins at fertilization' at that moment where there is fusion or union of the sperm and the egg and thus a human person or human being already does exist at the moment of fertilization". The PMA condemns abortifacients that "destroys the fertilized egg or the embryo" and "abhors any procedure...or medication that will interrupt any stage of fertilization and prevents its normal, physiological, uninterrupted growth to adulthood".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;

Jo Imbong, founder of the Abay Pamilya Foundation, reported that "Lagman said in a House hearing that the bill would protect human life 'from implantation' ",&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt; and not from fertilization, noting at the same time that the Records of the Constitutional Commission state that “Human life begins at fertilization”.&lt;ref name=Imbong2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CC1986 /&gt;

[[File:Blastocyst, day 5.JPG|thumb|5-day old human embryo called a [[blastocyst]], which comprises 70–100 cells.]]

=== Contraception and abortion relationship ===

Proponents argue that research by the [[Guttmacher Institute]], involved in advancing international reproductive health, reveals that the use of contraceptives can reduce abortion rates by 85%. Proponents such as 14 [[Ateneo de Manila University]] professors, argued thus: "Studies show that the majority of women who go for an abortion are married or in a consensual union (91%), the mother of three or more children (57%), and poor (68%) (Juarez, Cabigon, and Singh 2005). For these women, terminating a pregnancy is an anguished choice they make in the face of severe constraints. When women who had attempted an abortion were asked their reasons for doing so, their top three responses were: they could not afford the economic cost of raising another child (72%); their pregnancy occurred too soon after the last one (57%); and they already have enough children (54%). One in ten women (13%) who had attempted an abortion revealed that this was because her pregnancy resulted from forced sex (ibid.). Thus, for these women, abortion has become a family planning method, in the absence of information on and access to any reliable means to prevent an unplanned and unwanted pregnancy".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

The bill, said Clara Padilla of EnGender Rights Inc, will "help reduce the number of abortions by providing increased access to information and services on modern contraceptive methods, that in turn will reduce the number of unwanted—and often aborted—pregnancies".&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt;

Both sides of the debate accuse the other side of deception and misleading the public. The pro-RH people accuse the anti-RH group of misleading the public by calling the bill an abortion bill, when the bill states that abortion remains a crime and is punishable. The anti-RH advocates accuse the RH supporters of hiding from the public the international population control agenda which includes abortion and they refer to U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton who said that RH includes abortion.&lt;ref name=clintonrep /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=730979&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=64 |title=Jose Sison, Opposing something wrong, Philippine Star |work=The Philippine Star |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fr.

== Contraceptives ==

=== Morality and social effects ===

{{POV section|date=January 2013}}

Fourteen professors from [[Ateneo de Manila University]], a prominent Catholic University, considering the empirical evidence of the dire socioeconomic conditions of the Filipino poor, urged that the bill be passed to help them. They argued: "As Catholics and Filipinos, we share the hope and mission of building a Church of the Poor. We are thus deeply disturbed and saddened by calls made by some members of the Catholic Church to reject a proposed legislation that promises to improve the wellbeing of Filipino families, especially the lives of women, children, adolescents, and the poor". They announced that "Catholic social teachings recognize the primacy of the well-formed conscience over wooden compliance to directives from political and religious authorities", urging Catholic authorities to withdraw their opposition the bill.&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Citing Catholic documents and scientific studies, they reasoned that "the RH Bill is pro-life, pro-women, pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-informed choice". They emphasized that the bill "promotes quality of life, by enabling couples, especially the poor, to bring into the world only the number of children they believe they can care for and nurture to become healthy and productive members of our society".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt; Thus, they called their paper "Catholics Can Support the RH Bill in Good Conscience".&lt;ref name=ateneoprof2008 /&gt;

In response, the Ateneo administration announced its unity with Catholic teaching and that it had "serious objections to the present bill".&lt;ref name=Ateneoadmin /&gt;

Proponents such as Lagman also stressed that official Catholic teaching itself, expressed in the Encyclical ''Humanae Vitae'' issued only forty years ago in 1964, is not infallible.&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt; He said that the Papal Commission on Birth Control, which included ranking prelates and theologians, recommended that the Church change its teaching on contraception as it concluded that “the regulation of conception appears necessary for many couples who wish to achieve a responsible, open and reasonable parenthood in today’s circumstances”. The editorial of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'', moreover, stated that Catholic teaching is "only" a religious teaching and should not be imposed with intolerance on a secular state.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Opponents argue that misery is not the result of the church which they say is the largest charitable organization in the world, but of a breakdown in moral sense that gives order to society, nor does misery come from parents who bring up children in faithfulness, discipline, love and respect for life, but from those who strip human beings of moral dignity and responsibility, by treating them as mere machines, which they believe contraception does.&lt;ref name=ratzinger /&gt;

=== Health reasons ===

Stating that contraception is a lie and "against the beginning of new life", the [[Philippine Medical Association]] also stressed that the "health risks of contraception to women are considerable; the list of side effects is long, and includes high blood pressure, strokes, increased incidence of some forms of cancer".&lt;ref name="pmapp" /&gt;
	 	
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|right|170px|While the [[World Health Organization]] acknowledges the possible negative side effects of the pill, it still defines it as an [[essential medicine]].]]

Proponents such as E. Ansioco of Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines argued that "The World Health Organization (WHO) includes contraceptives in its Model Lists of Essential Drugs" and thus are safe medicines.&lt;ref name=Angsioco2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=essentialmed2010 /&gt; "Medical and scientific evidence," says the main proponent, "shows that all the possible medical risks connected with contraceptives are infinitely lower than the risks of an actual pregnancy and everyday activities...The risk of dying within a year of using pills is 1 in 200,000. The risk of dying from a vasectomy is 1 in 1 million and the risk of dying from using an IUD is 1 in 10 million...But the risk of dying from a pregnancy is 1 in 10,000."&lt;ref name=Lagman2008 /&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===

The RH bill provides for "prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other, STIs/STDs", especially since the number of HIV cases among the young nearly tripled from 41 in 2007 to 110 in 2008.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010 /&gt; Proponents emphasized that RH will help in stemming the AIDS epidemic that is worsening in the Philippines. Lagman explained that "Globally, the new number of reported cases of HIV infections and deaths has dropped by nearly 20 percent. It is therefore both ironic and tragic that the Philippines’ trajectory is towards the other direction. Our country’s HIV/AIDS statistics have increased by 30 percent!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcellagman.com.ph/speeches/house/271-world-aids-celebration.html |title=World AIDS Celebration |publisher=Edcellagman.com.ph |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary among the means is distribution of condoms. The proponents applauded government efforts last February 2010 when it distributed condoms in some areas of Manila.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Opinion polls and TV debates ==

Proponents refer to many surveys conducted by two prominent locally based organizations (SWS and Pulse Asia) which show majority support for the bill. A survey conducted in 2008 by the [[Social Weather Stations]], commissioned by the Forum for Family Planning and Development (FFPD), a non-government advocacy group, showed that 68 percent of Filipinos agree that there should be a law requiring government to distribute legal contraceptives.&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; SWS President and RH Bill proponent, ''Mahar Mangahas'' reported that the "survey found 71 percent in favor [of the RH Bill], 21 percent undecided, and a mere 8 percent opposed. Among those who originally knew of the bill, the score is 84 percent in favor, and 6 percent opposed. Among those who learned of the bill for the first time because of the survey, the score is 59 percent in favor, versus 11 percent opposed.&lt;ref name=sws2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sisante2008 /&gt; Pulse Asia reported that in an October 2008 survey "most Filipinos are aware of the reproductive health bill pending at the House of Representatives (68%) and are in favor of the bill (63%)".&lt;ref name=pulseasia2008 /&gt; In December 2010, Pulse Asia announced based on the results of an October 2010 survey, 69% of the Filipinos are in favor of the bill.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

President of Prolife Philippines, [[Lito Atienza]], said that the surveys conducted by SWS and Pulse Asia were misleading, because the participants were not fully informed of the bill, were merely aware of it, and informed that it was about health and "modern methods". Instead he referred to the Filipino Family survey of December 2009 conducted by the HB&amp;A International (an affiliate of [[Louis Harris &amp; Associates]]) together with the personnel of Asia Research Organization (the Philippine affiliate of [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup International]]). The survey concluded that 92% of people in metropolitan Manila rejected the bill, "85 percent are not aware that once passed the RH bill would allow teenagers to secure 'abortifacient devices and substances' without their parents’ knowledge and consent....90 percent do not agree that Congress should appropriate P2 billion to the detriment of other essential medicines for free children’s vaccinations, treatment of dreaded diseases and other more important health and medical concerns."&lt;ref name=standard2010 /&gt; Mangahas acknowledged that the SWS surveys did not include the penalties.&lt;ref name=compromise /&gt;

A TV Debate was also hosted by [[ABS-CBN Network|ABS-CBN]] last May 2011. Leaders of both sides, including Rep. Lagman and Rep. Golez were present. According to the ABS-CBN news which reported on the results: "In the SMS poll, 69.58% of votes cast reject the RH bill while 30.42% support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malig |first=Jojo |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/05/08/11/philippines-still-divided-reproductive-health-bill |title=Philippines still divided on reproductive health bill &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the separate online poll held on the Harapan microsite that livestreamed the debate, majority voted against the bill at the very end of the debate.{{Dubious|date=August 2012}}

On TV5's Debate ''Hamon sa Pagbabago'' on August 21, 2011, the studio audience voted 100% against the bill, while 58.7% of the viewers voted against the RH Bill via text messaging, versus 41.3% in favor.&lt;ref&gt;TV5 Debate, Hamon sa Pagbabago, 21 August 2011, hosted by Ricardo "Dong" Puno and Luchi Cruz-Valdez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The online poll conducted by the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' published on May 18, 2011, showed that 56% were against the RH Bill, while 44% were in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=522&amp;articleid=687349 |title=Philstar poll on RH Bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late 2010, there were rallies for and against the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/probinsiya/669859/2-dakma-sa-p1m-botya|title=2 dakma sa P.1M botya|first=Ni Boy|last=Cruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by noli --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2011/03/santo-papa-umapela-sa-mga-pinoy-na-ipagtanggol-ang-buhay/ |title=Santo Papa umapela sa mga Pinoy na ipagtanggol ang buhay &amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=26 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/local-news/20000-join-rally-vs-rh-bill |title=20,000 join rally vs RH bill |publisher=Sun.Star |date=23 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=656684 |title=Thousands join anti-RH Bill rally – The Freeman » The Freeman Sections » Cebu News |work=The Philippine Star |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws |title=7 Bataan barangays follow Ayala Alabang, pass own RH laws – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012005912/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110328-328023/7-Bataan-%20%20barangays-follow-Ayala-Alabang-pass-own-RH-laws# |archive-date=2012-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20110313-325287/Thousands-in-Laguna-Quezon-Leyte-march-vs-RH-bill |title=Thousands in Laguna, Quezon, Leyte march vs RH bill – INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloilonewstoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1002:we-need-to-debate-on-rh-bill-says-garin&amp;catid=98:local-news |title=We need to debate on RH Bill, says Garin &amp;#124; The News Today |publisher=Iloilonewstoday.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/02/16/11/rh-bill-activists-hold-rally-house-oks-rh-budget |title=RH bill activists hold rally; House OKs RH budget &amp;#124; ABS-CBN News &amp;#124; Latest Philippine Headlines, Breaking News, Video, Analysis, Features |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/110157/1000-women-march-to-mendiola-for-reproductive-health-bill |title=1,000 women march to Mendiola for Reproductive Health bill &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/103857/no-delay-but-rh-bill-won%E2%80%99t-be-passed-this-year%E2%80%94enrile |title=No delay but RH bill won’t be passed this year—Enrile &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Penalties ==

There is mandatory sexuality education starting grade 5, and "malicious disinformation" is penalized.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; All health care service providers which provide reproductive health services, including faith-based hospital administrators, may be imprisoned or fined if they refuse to provide family planning services such as [[tubal ligation]] and [[vasectomy]]. The same may happen to employers who do not provide free services to employees.&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Imprisonment ranges from one to six months or a fine ranging from ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).&lt;ref name="bills" /&gt; Former Finance Secretary [[Roberto de Ocampo]] stated that these punitive provisions "are tantamount to an affront to civil liberties and smack of religious persecution".&lt;ref name=ocampo /&gt;

Defending the bill, [[Felipe Medalla]], former dean of the [[University of the Philippines School of Economics]], said that "although the poor’s access to family planning services can be improved even without the law, the absence of the law makes it easier to block the program".{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Separation of church and state ==

The head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[Philippines]], [[Archbishop]] [[Luis Antonio Tagle]] opposes the Reproductive Health Bill, along with [[abortion]] and [[contraception]]. Because 81% of Filipinos are Catholics, the Catholic Church exerts a strong influence in public and moral life. Its staunch opposition to the bill has drawn the controversy among non-Catholics and Catholics alike who support the bill whereby many invoke the principle of [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="CAS2" /&gt;

Fr. Joaquin Bernas, S.J, one of the drafters of the [[Philippine Constitution]] and a prominent lawyer and writer, explained that the concept of separation of church and state is directed towards the state, rather than the church, as it is a political concept. Technically it means "non-establishment of religion," as the Constitution states, "No law shall be passed respecting an establishment of religion." It means that the state should be guided by the principle that it should support no specific religion and so government funding should not be allocated for building churches or mosques and not favor any particular religion. It does not prevent the church, parents, supervisors, teachers and other moral educators from expressing their views and educating their wards on the morality of their personal and social actions. The Catholic Church also states that their stand is based on secular reasons and natural law that are both acceptable to non-Catholics as well. Proponents, on the other hand, state that the church should not meddle in matters of the state and should focus on religious matters, not political matters.&lt;ref name="CAS" /&gt;

== Culture war and its implications ==

[[File:UN-millenium-goals.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Millennium Development Goals at the UN]]
The national debate is seen as part of a wider [[culture war]].&lt;ref name=carrol2009 /&gt; Passing it or not passing it of the bill has negative implications depending on the views. Proponents state that the not passing the bill will make the Philippines no longer be a backward state and unable to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goal]]s, especially the points on poverty alleviation and maternal health. It will mean reneging on international commitments and will slow down modernization. Also, the poor will not have free access to family planning support that many have want, and thus will have more children than they can care for and will not have the money to invest in education to break the intergenerational poverty they are trapped in. Proponents also accuse the Catholic Church of holding the Philippines "hostage" and violating the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="quiros" /&gt; They argue that a decreased population growth will lead to improved [[quality of life]] and economic development.

== Financials ==

Department of Health is proposing 13.7 billion pesos to be fund the RH Bill if it is passed in 2012, according to Senator [[Pia Cayetano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/70387/%E2%80%98doh-proposed-nearly-p14-billion-to-fund-rh-bill-in-2012%E2%80%99 |title=‘DOH proposed nearly P14 billion to fund RH bill in 2012’ &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filipinos for Life, an anti-abortion organization, claimed that the bill was funded by foreign population control groups, a claim that Rep. [[Edcel Lagman]] denied as "an old yarn which is destitute of factual basis", saying that the lobby opposing the bill was the one which was backed by the "wealthy Catholic hierarchy with the aid of dozens of lay organizations”.&lt;ref name="interaksyon.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dalangin |first=Lira |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/18863/no-foreign-funding-for-rh-lobby----lagman |title=No foreign funding for RH lobby - Lagman |publisher=InterAksyon.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Nine Legislators (Y9L)—including Aliah Dimaporo, [[Lucy Torres-Gomez]], Karlo Alexei Nograles—said that “The proposed P3 billion appropriation for the RH bill, if put towards education, can help secure the future of young Filipinos. That amount can build 4,644 new classrooms…or it can subsidize the college education of 300,000 scholars—a chance for underprivileged student achievers to earn their diploma”.&lt;ref name="tdz" /&gt;

Lagman on the other hand said that both these priorities are important but with a burgeoning population the budget will become even tighter, thus population growth is a major issue.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== International reactions ==

=== European Union ===

[[European Union]] Ambassador to the Philippines Alistair MacDonald said "We have all seen the figures on illegal abortion a year in the Philippines and I very much hope that both Houses of Congress will take these issues into account in producing a reproductive health legislation which will really help people make their own choices and to provide for their families".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

MacDonald said that lack of effective access to reproductive health services in the Philippines was "antithetical" to the country’s struggle against poverty and "It seems to me extremely unlikely that the Philippines will be able to meet its commitment under the MDGs under the present policy".&lt;ref name=EU /&gt; MacDonald noted that the [[total fertility rate]] for the richest quintile of the population is 2.0, while the total fertility rate of the poorest quintile is 5.9. The total fertility rate for women with a college education is 2.3, about half that of women with only elementary education (4.5). He mentioned that the lack of access to RH services is anti-women, citing the slow decline in the maternal mortality ratio in the Philippines. He also said surveys suggest that the total wanted fertility rate for the Philippines is 2.4 children, or below the actual TFR of 3.3 children.&lt;ref name=EU /&gt;

== Status ==

=== Legislature ===
On January 31, 2011, six different bills were consolidated into a single RH Bill which was then unanimously approved for plenary debate by the House Committee on Population and Family Relations. On February 7, 2011, the bill was scheduled to go before the House Appropriations Committee. On February 16, 2011, the bill was endorsed by the House Appropriations Committee with amendment and referred back to the Population Committee for finalizing the language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== President and Cabinet ===
&lt;!-- [[File:Noynoy Aquino.jpg|thumb|right|150px|President [[Noynoy Aquino]] before the elections: "I will not promote it". He is strongly pushing for the passage of the RH Bill.{{Weasel-inline|date=August 2012}}]] --&gt;
President [[Noynoy Aquino]] during the presidential campaign said that it confounds him why he is always associated with the RH Bill and reiterated that he is neither an author nor a co-author and did not sign the committee report regarding the bill. He said that "he will fully support the crafting of a firm policy that will address the serious problem on population"&lt;ref name=pdivarious /&gt; At the same time, Aquino said that "artificial contraception was a matter of choice and conscience and that health professionals who fool people into using artificial contraceptives should be penalized. As a Catholic, Aquino said he himself was not promoting artificial contraception but believes that the government should be able to provide it to Filipinos who ask for it". Aquino stressed, "I’m a Catholic, I'm not promoting it. My position is more aptly called responsible parenthood rather than reproductive health."&lt;ref name=tubeza /&gt;

According to [[Rina Jimenez David]] who is pro-RH, during the “Women Deliver Philippines” Conference held September 2010, [[Dinky Soliman]], Aquino's Secretary of Social Welfare and Development, said that "choice and access” constituted the keystone of the Aquino government’s policy, reiterating the administration’s support for the pending reproductive health bills.&lt;ref name=jimenezsept10 /&gt;

On December 2010, the Cabinet and the CBCP agreed to have a joint campaign providing full information on the advantages and risks of contraceptives, natural and artificial family planning and responsible parenthood. They have established a technical working group for this purpose. They also agreed that government will not be an "instrument to enforce or violate the conscience of the people about these issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- Uploaded by remate.tonight --&gt; by |url=http://www.remate.ph/2010/12/cbcp-palace-to-launch-info-drive-on-family-planning/ |title=CBCP, Palace to launch info drive on family planning&amp;#124; Remate |publisher=Remate.ph |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by April 2011 Aquino has given his full support to the entire RH Bill in a speech at the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] and promised to push for its passage even at the "risk of excommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mogato |first=Manuel |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/04/17/11/aquino-risks-church-ire-reproductive-health-bill |title=Aquino risks Church ire on reproductive health bill |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compromise and alternatives ===
Senate President [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Congressman [[Roilo Golez]] and Buhay party-list separately filed bills that seek to restrict abortion and birth control use. These bills have been seen either as a nullification of the RH Bill, its alternative, or as a way of achieving unity among the populace, since the RH Bill proponents have stated their concern in preventing abortion.

Presidential candidate [[Gilbert Teodoro]] or Gibo suggested a cash transfer from the government to individuals wanting access to family planning methods, whether natural or artificial. The individuals can then make use of the cash they receive to purchase birth control devices they may choose, thus guaranteeing freedom of choice.&lt;ref name="villegas0410" /&gt;

The Loyola School of Theology and the John J. Carroll Institute on State and Church Issues issued nine talking points on the RH Bill. Among other points, they proposed a study on the meaning of conception in the Constitution, and if it means fertilization, abortifacients "are to be banned even now and regardless of whether the RH Bill is passed". They also proposed "parallel programs for providing information and training, one for Natural Family Planning (NFP) and another for artificial methods of family planning".&lt;ref name="LST" /&gt; Columnist Jose Sison of the ''[[Philippine Star]]'' criticized that "a Catholic School of theology has actually proposed in public, the use of tax payers’ money to train Filipinos to employ methods that are objectively and intrinsically evil" and cites "empirical evidence and scientific proofs confirming the harmful and evil effects of contraceptives to individuals and to society."&lt;ref name=Sagalosison /&gt;

=== Other events 2010–2012 ===
In September 2010, Aquino, during this visit to the United States, reiterated his stand that he is in favor of responsible parenthood and respects the decision of each couple as to the number of children they want, and if they need the government support for contraception, the government will provide it. This statement has created a furor as Catholic church leaders say that Aquino has sold out the Filipino soul in exchange for some "measly" aid from the United States. The President of the Catholic Bishops Conference said that there could be an excommunication of the President if he continues his stance. Pro-RH Bill snators encouraged the President to be steadfast to do his duties towards the state. The President's spokesperson [[Edwin Lacierda]] explained that the President "has not changed his stand" and is reaching out to the prelates and said that he has not made any decision in support of the Reproductive Health Bill as he was still studying the document. Lacierda said that the Executive Branch "is not involved in the passage of the RH bill, saying the measure's fate rests solely on the legislative branch."

[[Filipino Freethinkers]], an association of agnostics, atheists, progressives, etc., very active in the fight in favor of the RH bill, stepped up the pressure, creating more controversy that fired up renewed interest in the bill on both sides. On September 30, 2010, one of the freethinkers, Carlos Celdran staged a protest action against the Catholic Church, holding a sign which read "DAMASO," a reference to the villainous, corrupt clergyman [[Father Dámaso]] of the novel ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' by Filipino revolutionary writer [[Jose Rizal]], and shouting "stop getting involved in politics!" A fan page, Free Carlos Celdran was created in [[Facebook]], which generated 23,808 fans in 24 hours. Francisco Montalvan of the ''Inquirer'' said that in the end the Damasos are the scheming, corrupt and deceptive people, implying that the "pro-death advocates" are these, while the Cardinal Rosales who started a nationwide fund for the poor is very far from Damaso. Meanwhile, the [[Imam]] Council of the Philippines, the top leaders of the Moslem population which at 4.5 million constitutes 5% of the Philippine population, declared that they are against contraceptives since using them "underestimates God" and "makes one lose morality in the process."

During the first public hearing on 24 Nov, the chair of the Committee on Population handling the bill said that there is no instruction from the Speaker of the House to expedite the bill. Upon the call of anti-RH congressmen, the Committee Chair decided to refer the bill also to the Committee on Health since the bill is about Reproductive Health. Leader of the pro-RH group, Elizabeth Ansioco, said that the bill is doomed if it is referred to the Committee on Health. Anti-RH Deputy Speaker Congressman Pablo Garcia said the members of the Committee on Health knew of the WHO announcement on the carcinogenicity of combined estrogen-progestogen oral contraceptives.

House Speaker Belmonte said that Congress is not likely to rush the legislation of the bill and will tackle it in plenary early next year. Belmonte said it is better that highly contentious bills be given more attention.

On 3 December, the Senate cut the proposed budget of P 880M for contraceptives down to P 8M for condoms since other contraceptives violated the Constitution's ban on abortifacients, and Senator Tito Sotto III said that his constituents never asked for contraceptives.

On 27 July 2012, the Speaker of the House decided to put to a vote, by August 7, 2012, on whether the debates have to be terminated.  Meanwhile, six co-authors of the bill withdrew support, with the head of the minority group of the house declaring that eight of their group are withdrawing their previous support for the bill.&lt;ref name="philstar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/article.aspx?publicationsubcategoryid=200&amp;articleid=832879 |title=House minority group no longer supports RH bill » Nation » News &amp;#124; Philippine News |publisher=philstar.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional approval and presidential assent ===
At 3 in the morning on December 13, 2012, the House of Representatives voted on second reading in favor of the bill with 113–109 while five representatives abstained. In the upper house, the Senate voted, on December 18, 2012, to pass the bill on second reading with 13–8, while Senators [[Sergio Osmeña, III|Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Lito Lapid]] were absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326013/congress-passes-rh-bill |title=Congress passes RH Bill |author1=Cathy C.

On the same day, both houses passed the bill on the third and final reading. Members of the House of Representatives voted 133–79, while seven representatives abstained. The Senate registered 13–8, the same result as the second reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/manila/local-news/2012/12/17/congress-passes-rh-bill-258805 |title=House, Senate approve reproductive health bill on final reading |date=December 17, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 19, 2012, both versions of the bill were passed to the Bicameral Committee to produce a final version to be signed by the President Aquino. The committee quickly passed the bill in just one session. It was transmitted back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, which both ratified the bill, with the Senate voting 11–5 in favor of ratification, and the House of Representatives voting via [[voice vote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/326881/rh-bill-passes-bicam |title=RH Bill passes bicam |author=Maila Ager |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |title=Senate, House ratify bicameral panel version of RH Bill |author1=Karl John Reyes |author2=Lira Dalangin Fernandez |publisher=InterAKSYON |work=[[Associated Broadcasting Company|TV5]] |date=December 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222043804/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/50815/senate-ratifies-bicam-report-on-rh-bill-by-a-vote-of-11-5 |archivedate=December 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2012, President Aquino signed the bill into law, codifying the bill as Republic Act No. 10354, otherwise known as the "Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012". News of the signing was announced by House Majority Leader [[Neptali Gonzales II]] on December 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/18728-aquino-signs-rh-bill-into-law |title=President Aquino signs RH bill into law |author=Angela Casauay |publisher=Rappler.com |work=Rappler |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supreme Court challenge and delay of implementation ===
In response to petitions challenging the law's constitutionality, the Supreme Court voted 10-5 on March 19, 2013 to issue a status quo ante order halting the implementation of the law for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Court halts RH law for 4 months

Oral arguments were set for June 18 but postponed until July 9 after the Supreme Court received additional petitions and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |title=SC postpones RH law oral arguments

|newspaper=GMA News Online
|date=June 4, 2013
|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During oral arguments, several justices indicated that the court "does not seem to be the right forum–at least for now." Ir could not settle medical issues, such as whether any contraceptives to be made available were actually abortifacients. Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno said the court might have no choice but to exercise "judicial restraint" on the 15 petitions opposing the law.&lt;ref name=sc-july-9-2013&gt;

|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, the justices voted 8-7 to extend the status quo ante order, which would have expired the next day "until further orders effective immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Supreme Court extends order stopping RH law|date = July 16, 2013|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/317652/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-order-stopping-rh-law|accessdate = August 18, 2013|work = GMA News Online|author=Mark Merueñas}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oral arguments concluded on August 27, with the petitioners against and for the law being instructed to submit memorandums within 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;

On April 8, 2014, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. The justices, however, struck down eight provisions of the law partially or in full.&lt;ref name="Rappler1" /&gt;

In 2015, the Supreme Court's issued a temporary restraining order on certain provisions of the law, forbidding the distribution of contraceptive implants.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/philippines-intensify-drive-offering-free-contraceptives-081710742.html|title=Philippines to offer free contraceptives to 6 million women|author=[[Associated Press]]|website=yahoo.com|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the restraining order on certain methods of contraception, in September 2018, President Duterte decided to ensure, within 2018, free contraception for 6 million women with unmet needs for modern family planning - in 2018, for 2 million women identified as poor, and later for further 4 million women.&lt;ref name="ap-2017-01-11"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">'''Reynolds analogy''' is popularly known to relate laminar momentum and heat transfer.&lt;ref name=Gean&gt;Geankoplis, C.J. ''Transport processes and separation process principles'' (2003), Fourth Edition, p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main assumption is that heat flux q/A in a turbulent system is analogous to momentum flux τ, which suggests that the ratio τ/(q/A) must be constant for all radial positions.

The complete Reynolds analogy* is:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{f}{2} = \frac{h}{C_p\times G} = \frac{k'_c}{V_{av}} &lt;/math&gt;

Experimental data for gas streams agree approximately with above equation if the [[Schmidt number|Schmidt]] and [[Prandtl number|Prandtl]] numbers are near 1.0 and only [[skin friction]] is present in flow past a flat plate or inside a pipe. When liquids are present and/or  [[form drag]] is present, the analogy is conventionally known to be invalid.&lt;ref name=Gean/&gt;

In 2008, the qualitative form of validity of Reynolds' analogy was re-visited for laminar flow of incompressible fluid with variable dynamic viscosity (μ).&lt;ref name=Mah&gt;Mahulikar, S.P., &amp; Herwig, H., 'Fluid friction in incompressible laminar convection: Reynolds' analogy revisited for variable fluid properties,' ''European Physical Journal B: Condensed Matter &amp; Complex Systems'', '''62(1)''', (2008), pp. 77-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was shown that the inverse dependence of Reynolds number (''Re'') and skin friction coefficient(''c''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) is the basis for validity of the Reynolds’ analogy, in laminar convective flows with constant &amp; variable μ.  For μ = const. it reduces to the popular form of Stanton number (''St'') increasing with increasing ''Re'', whereas for variable μ it reduces to ''St'' increasing with decreasing ''Re''.  Consequently, the Chilton-Colburn analogy of ''St''•''Pr''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; increasing with increasing ''c''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; is qualitatively valid whenever the
Reynolds’ analogy is valid.  Further, the validity of the Reynolds’ analogy is linked to the applicability of Prigogine's Theorem of Minimum Entropy Production.&lt;ref&gt;Prigogine, I. ''Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes'' (1961), Interscience Publishers, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, Reynolds' analogy is valid for flows that are close to developed, for whom, changes in the gradients of field variables (velocity &amp; temperature) along the flow are small.&lt;ref name=Mah/&gt;

'''Right-wing terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] motivated by a variety of ideologies and beliefs, including [[Islamophobia]], [[anti-communism]], [[neo-fascism]] and [[neo-Nazism]]. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} Modern radical right-wing terrorism first appeared in [[Western Europe]] in the 1970s and it first appeared in [[Eastern Europe]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=57}}

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with [[nationalism|nationalist]] or [[fascism|fascist]]-oriented regimes.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} The core of this movement includes [[white power skinhead|neo-fascist skinheads]], [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]], youth sympathisers and intellectual guides who believe that the state must rid itself of foreign elements in order to protect its ''rightful'' citizens.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|pp=57-58}} However, they usually lack a rigid ideology.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=58}}

== Causes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Armin Falk and colleagues suggests that Right-Wing Extremist Crime (REC), which includes anti-foreigner and racist motivations, is associated with unemployment rates (261). Consequently, as unemployment rates increase, REC also increases. This correlation can be found in several countries including Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with individuals, rather unemployment impacts society's humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism. Meaning, as unemployment rates increase, humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism decrease according to Falk. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a functionalist perspective on employment. Ferrante defines a functionalist approach as "how the parts of society contribute in expected and unexpected way of maintain an existing social order" (26). Work and employment serve several functions for society (University of Minnesota 12.2). The University of Minnesota Library suggests that employment provides workers with an income and also contributes to their self-identity and fulfillment (12.2). When employment is low, this leads to a perceived threat towards self-identity and fulfillment which can then lead to a larger possibility for right-wing terrorism to occur.

A second cause of right-wing terrorism as Thomas Greven suggests, is [[populism]], or more accurately, [[right-wing populism]]. Jan-Werner Muller describes populism as a form of [[identity politics]] that is inherently anti-establishment and anti-pluralist (3). More simply put, populism supports the advancement of 'the average citizen', and it does not support the agendas of the privileged elite.  Furthermore, Greven defines right-wing populist as those who support [[ethnocentrism]], and [[opposition to immigration|oppose immigration]] (3).  Right-wing populist policies that have recently been covered in the media include the [[Executive Order 13769]], which is the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries to the United States, and the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump]] which proposes that a wall should be built between the United States and Mexico in order to prevent illegal immigrants from coming to the United States. Greven suggests that immigration policy not only threatens economic competition, but also threatens traditional values and identities (5).  Due to the ethnocentric motivations behind these policies, they are classified as right-wing populism. Because right-wing populism creates a climate of 'us versus them', terrorism is more likely to occur according to Greven. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a conflict perspective. Ferrante explains the conflict perspective as a focus on conflict regarding scarce resources and the strategies advantaged groups used to perpetuate social agreement arrangements from which they benefit (30). When people feel as though their traditional values are being threatened by the social elite who contribute to the rise in immigration, conflict ensues, and terrorism follows.

In 1993 [[Chris Hani]], the General Secretary of the [[South African Communist Party]] was murdered by Polish-born far-right anti-Communist [[Janusz Waluś]] who had been lent a firearm by far-right pro-Apartheid MP [[Clive Derby-Lewis]].
The [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]], a neo-Nazi paramilitary organisation, has often been described as terrorist. 
In 2010 South African authorities foiled a plot by far-right terrorists to commit attacks as revenge for the murder of [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], seizing explosives and firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/07/south-africa-white-extremist-bomb|title=South African police foil white extremist bomb plot|first=David|last=Smith|date=7 May 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military government]], some right-wing military engaged in violent repression. The [[Riocentro#1981 May Day Attack|Riocentro 1981 May Day Attack]] was a bombing attempt that happened on the night of April 30, 1981. Severe casualties were suffered by the terrorists. While an NGO held a fundraiser fighting for democracy and free elections and celebrating the upcoming holiday, a bomb exploded at Riocentro parking area killing army seargent Guilherme Pereira do Rosário and severely wounding captain Wilson Dias Machado, who survived the bomb explosion. The bomb exploded inside a car where both were preparing it. Rosário died instantaneously. They were the only casualties.

The [[Para-SAR]] example&lt;ref name="para-sar2-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brasileiros magazine|url=http://brasileiros.com.br/2014/03/o-paraquedista-que-evitou-um-banho-de-sangue/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="para-sar1-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatos magazine|date=June 1, 1985|url=http://www.arqanalagoa.ufscar.br/pdf/recortes/R04927.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed by [[Brazilian Air Force]] captain Sérgio Ribeiro Miranda de Carvalho in 1968 before it reached the execution phase as it was made public to the press after a meeting with his superior Brigadier General João Paulo Burnier and chief of Para-SAR unity. Burnier discussed a secret plan to bomb a dense traffic area of [[Rio de Janeiro]] known as "[[Gasômetro]]" during commute and later claim that Communists were the perpetrators. He expected to be able to run a witch-hunt against the growing political military opposition. Burnier also mentioned his intentions on making the Para-SAR, a [[Brazilian Air Force]] rescue unity, a tool for eliminating some military government political oppositors throwing them to the sea at a wide distance of the coast. On both of these events, no military involved on these actions or planning was arrested, charged or faced retaliation from the [[Brazilian military government]]. The only exception is captain Sérgio de Carvalho which had to leave the air force for facing his superiors retaliation after whistleblowing brigadier Burnier's plan.

====Reconstruction era====
The term "''white terrorism''" is used by scholars to label terrorism committed against [[African Americans]] during the [[Reconstruction era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schenk|first1=David H.|title=Freedmen with Firearms: White Terrorism and Black Disarmament During Reconstruction|journal=Gettysburg College Journal of the Civil War Era|volume=4|date=April 30, 2014|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=gcjcwe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butchart, Ronald E.

====Pre-2001====
According to [[George Michael (professor)|George Michael]], "right-wing terrorism and violence has a long history in America".{{sfn|Michael|2003|p=114}} Right-wing violent incidents  began to outnumber [[Marxism|Marxist]] incidents in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;International Foundation for Protection Officers. 2003. ''The Protection Officer Training Manual''. Butterworth-Heinemann. {{ISBN|0-750-67456-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} Michael observes the waning of [[left-wing terrorism]] accompanying the rise of right-wing terrorism, with a noticeable "convergence" of the goals of [[Islamism|militant Islam]] with those of the [[Far-right politics|extreme right]]. Islamic studies scholar Youssef M. Choueiri classified [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalist]] movements involving revivalism, reformism, and radicalism as within the scope of "[[right-wing politics]]".&lt;ref&gt;Choueiri, Youssef M. 2010.

During the 1980s, more than 75 right-wing extremists were prosecuted in the United States for acts of terrorism, carrying out six attacks.{{sfn|Smith|1994|pp=25–26}} In 1983, [[Gordon Kahl]], a [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] activist, killed two federal marshals and he was later killed by police.

[[Eric Rudolph]] executed a series of terrorist attacks between 1996 and 1998. He carried out the 1996 [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]]—which claimed two lives and injured 111—aiming to cancel the games, claiming they promoted global socialism and to embarrass the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4600480|title=Full Text of Eric Rudolph's Confession|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolph confessed to bombing an abortion clinic in Sandy Springs, an Atlanta suburb, on January 16, 1997, the Otherside Lounge, an Atlanta lesbian bar, on February 21, 1997, injuring five and an [[abortion clinic]] in Birmingham, Alabama on January 29, 1998, killing Birmingham police officer and part-time clinic security guard Robert Sanderson and critically injuring nurse Emily Lyons.

As of October 2018, the [[New America Foundation]] placed the number killed in terrorist attacks in the United States since 9/11 as follows: 104 killed in jihadist terrorist attacks, 86 killed in far-right attacks, and 8 killed in [[Black separatism|black separatist]]/[[Black nationalism|nationalist]]/[[Black supremacy|supremacist]] attacks.&lt;ref name="NewAmericaTally"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Depth: Terrorism in America After 9/11: Part IV.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Count of "victims killed" and "victims wounded" excludes attackers.

A report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', published on November 25, 2018, showed violent right-wing-related incidents up, and left-wing-related incidents down.  Total domestic terrorism incidents was down to 41 in 2001, from a high of 468 in 1970, but then went up to 65 in 2017. Of those 65 events in 2017, 36 were right-wing-related (with 11 fatalities), 10 were left-wing-related (with 6 fatalities), 7 were related to Islamist extremism (with 16 fatalities), and 12, including the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], were categorized as "Other/Unknown" (with 62 fatalities, including 58 from the Las Vegas incident). The report found that 2018 was a particularly deadly year, with 11 people dying in the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]], 2 others in an incident in Kentucky, and two more in a [[2018 Tallahassee shooting|shooting in Tallasshee]].  All three incidents were right-wing related.&lt;ref name=wapo112518&gt;Lowery, Wesley; Kindy, Kimberly; and Ba Tran, Andrew (November 25, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-united-states-right-wing-violence-is-on-the-rise/2018/11/25/61f7f24a-deb4-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html "In the United States, right-wing violence is on the rise"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Post'' reported that the upsurge in right-wing violence began during the [[Barack Obama administration]] and picked up steam under the presidency of [[Donald Trump]], whose remarks after the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlotteville, Virginia]] in 2017 that there were "some very fine people on both sides" is widely seen as giving confidence to the right that the administration looked favorably on their goals, providing them with "tacit support". A former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, is quoted as saying that "[political leaders] from the White House down, used to serve as a check on conduct and speech that was abhorrent to most people. I see that eroding. ... The current political rhetoric is at least enabling, and certainly not discouraging, violence."&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

According to analysis by the newspaper of data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]], 92 of 263 domestic terrorism events &amp;ndash; 35% &amp;ndash;  that occurred from 2010 to 2017 were right-wing related, while 38 (14%) were Islamist extremist-related, and 34 (13%) were left-wing related.   Not only that, but a criminologist from [[John Jay College]] stated that right-wing attacks were statistically more likely to result in fatalities.&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

== Europe ==

===Denmark===
Neo-Nazis were suspected to have perpetrated the [[1992 Copenhagen bombing]], in which the office of a left-wing socialist party was attacked, killing one of its members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.b.dk/nationalt/afdoed-nynazist-haevdes-at-staa-bag-brevbombe?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In the town of [[Toulon]], a far-right extremist group called SOS-France existed. On 18 August 1986, four members were driving a car carrying explosives, apparently in an attempt to bomb the offices of [[SOS Racisme]]. However it exploded while they were still in it, killing all four of them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apnews.com/b94eda4f669fd78ae616120b07cf66e8&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Nazi members of the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] were responsible for a pair of [[1988 Cannes and Nice attacks|anti-immigrant terror bombings]] in 1988. Sonacotra hostels in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and Cannes were bombed, killing Romanian immigrant George Iordachescu and injuring 16 people, mostly Tunisians. In an attempt to [[False flag|frame Jewish extremists]] for the Cagnes-sur-Mer bombing, the terrorists left leaflets bearing [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and the name [[Masada]] at the scene, with the message "To destroy [[Israel]], Islam has chosen the sword. For this choice, Islam will perish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Steven|title=Immigrant Hostel Bombed in France|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/world/immigrant-hostel-bombed-in-france.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=20 December 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2008, members of the neo-Nazi Nomad 88 group fired with machine guns at people from their car in [[Saint-Michel-sur-Orge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/06/03/un-groupuscule-neonazi-a-l-origine-d-une-fusillade_1053066_3224.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/essonne/le-groupuscule-neonazi-decide-de-s-autodissoudre-04-06-2008-3298544168.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in the aftermath of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], six mosques and a restaurant were attacked in acts deemed as right-wing terrorism by authorities.&lt;ref name="Europol16"/&gt; The acts included grenade throwing, shooting, and use of an [[improvised explosive device]].

=== Germany ===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Germany|Terrorism in Germany}}

In 1980, a [[Oktoberfest terror attack|right-wing terrorist attack in Munich, Germany]] killed the attacker and 12 other people, injuring 215. Fears of an ongoing campaign of major right-wing terrorist attacks did not materialize.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p=45}}

In addition to several bank robberies, the German [[National Socialist Underground]] was responsible for the [[Bosphorus serial murders]] (2000–2006), the [[2004 Cologne bombing]] and the murder of policewoman [[Michéle Kiesewetter]] in 2007. In November 2011, two members of the National Socialist Underground committed suicide after a bank robbery and a third member was arrested some days later.

Right-wing extremist offenses in Germany rose sharply in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"&gt;Carla Bleiker, [http://www.dw.com/en/sharp-rise-in-right-wing-crime-in-germany-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/a-19041652 Sharp rise in right-wing crime in Germany just 'the tip of the iceberg'],  [[Deutsche Welle]] (February 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the German government tallied 316 violent xenophobic offences in 2014 and 612 such offenses in 2015.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"/&gt;

In August 2014, a group of four Germans founded a [[Munich]]-based far-right terrorist group, the {{ill|Oldschool Society|de}}.  The group, which held racist, antisemitic, and anti-Muslim views, eventually attracted 30 members.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/germany-far-right-terrorist-group-four-jailed Four jailed in Germany for forming far-right terrorist group] (March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; They stockpiled weapons and explosives and plotted to attack a refugee shelter in [[Saxony]],&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; but the group's leaders were arrested in May 2015 before carrying out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brady, [http://www.dw.com/en/oldschool-society-neo-nazis-go-on-trial-for-refugee-home-attacks/a-19217024 'Oldschool Society' neo-Nazis go on trial for refugee home attacks], [[Deutsche Welle]] (April 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 four of the group's leaders were sentenced to prison terms.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; The perpetrator of the [[2016 Munich shooting]] also had far-right views.

=== Italy ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy endured the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterized by frequent terrorist attacks: between 1969 and 1982, the nation suffered 8,800 terrorist attacks, in which a total of 351 people were killed and 768 were injured.&lt;ref name="Hof"&gt;Tobias Hof, "The Success of Italian Anti-terrorism Policy" in ''An International History of Terrorism: Western and Non-Western Experiences'' (editors Jussi M. Hanhimäki &amp; Bernhard Blumenau: Routledge, 2013), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist attacks have been both ascribed to the far-left and the far-right, yet a lot of terrorist attacks remain without a clear culprit and a lot of people have claimed the authorship of them is to be ascribed to rogue members of the Italian secret service. Even some of the terrorist attacks ascribed to a particular political group may be in reality the work of these rogue agents: this has been claimed, among many others, by [[Francesco Cossiga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2006/11/21/italia/politica/cossiga-le-spie-ve-le-racconto-io-pAUXKv2TCn4Yp824sScL1O/pagina.html |title=Cossiga: «Le spie?

The [[Years of Lead]] are considered to have begun with the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in [[Milan]] in December 1969,&lt;ref name="Hof"/&gt; perpetrated by [[Ordine Nuovo]], a right-wing [[neofascist]] group.&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;Richard McHugh, "Ordine Nuovo" in ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism'', 2d ed. (editor Gus Martin: SAGE Publications, 2011), pp. 451-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed, and 90 injured, in the bombing.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;

In July 1970, this same group carried out a bombing on a train going from Rome to Messina, killing six and wounding almost 100.  The group also carried out the [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]] in 1974, killing eight antifascist activists.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt; Perhaps the most infamous right-wing terrorist attack in post-war Italy is the  [[August 1980 Bologna bombing]], in which neo-fascist [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] ("Armed Revolutionary Nuclei"), an Ordine Nuovo offshoot, killed 85 people and injured 200 at the [[Bologna Centrale railway station|Bologna railroad station]].&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Four-Convicted-Of-Mass-Murder-In-Italian-Bombing-That-Killed-85/id-370c14ae3f77e87d266b0257bf7d2f62 Four Convicted of Mass Murder in Italian Bombing that Killed 85], Associated Press (July 11, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Fioravanti]], Francesca Mambro, and two others were convicted of mass murder in the attacks,&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"/&gt; although both have always denied any connection with them.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Cento Bull &amp; Philip Cooke, ''Ending Terrorism in Italy'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Hanley, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-accidental-terrorist-1259973.html The accidental terrorist], ''Independent'' (May 5, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, a gunman targeted Senegalese peddlers in [[Florence]], killing two and injuring three others before killing himself.&lt;ref name="LinksFarRight"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19366000 | publisher=BBC News | title=Viewpoint: Killer Breivik's links with far right | date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kington"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/23/ezra-pound-daughter-italian-fascist | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Kington | title=Ezra Pound's daughter aims to stop Italian fascist group using father's name | date=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrator was a sympathizer of [[CasaPound]],&lt;ref name="LinksFarRight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kington"/&gt; which is a neo-fascist party that Italian judges have recognized as not posing a threat to public or private safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Altri articoli dalla categoria &amp;raquo; |url=http://www.repubblica.it/politica/2016/02/01/news/casapound_polizia-132480295/ |title=La polizia "promuove" CasaPound: "La violenza?

First he bombed several government buildings in [[Oslo]], killing eight people and injuring more than 30. After the bombings, he went to [[Utøya]] island in a fake police uniform and began firing on people attending a political youth camp for the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Worker's Youth League]] (AUF), a left-wing political party, killing 68 and injuring more than 60.

===Poland===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Poland}}
Despite the country being nearly ethnically and religiously homogenous, Polish far-right targets, via propaganda or physical violence, religious and ethnic minorities such as Jews, [[Romani people]], people with darker complexion or Middle Eastern appearance.

{{Theosophy}}
'''Root races''' are stages in human [[evolution]] in the [[esoteric cosmology]] of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], as described in her book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888). These races existed mainly on [[Lost lands|now-lost continents]]. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably [[William Scott-Elliot]] in ''The Story of Atlantis'' (1896) and ''The Lost Lemuria'' (1904). [[Annie Besant]] further developed the model in [[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: Whence, How and Whither'']] (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] obtained by "astral clairvoyance". Further elaboration was provided by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in ''Atlantis and Lemuria'' (1904).&lt;ref&gt;''Atlantis and Lemuria, The Submerged Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Cosmic Memory (Prehistory of Earth and Man), Aus der Akasha-Chronik.'' Rudolf Steiner (Written 1904; GA 11 / Bn 11)[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/] English Edition, trans. Max Gysi [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA011/English/TPS1911/GA011_cover.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races, '''Epochs''' (Steiner felt that the term "race" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).

==Sources==
According to historian [[James Webb (historian)|James Webb]], the [[occult]] concept of succeeding [[prehistory|prehistoric]] races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author [[Antoine Fabre d'Olivet]] in his ''Histoire philosophique du genre humain'' (1824).&lt;ref&gt;James Webb, ''The Occult Underground'', Open Court, La Salle 1974, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book [[Oera Linda]], which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Jensma, Goffe (November 2007), "How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science. The Oera Linda Book as a New Age Bible", Fabula 48 (3–4): 229–249&lt;/ref&gt; Also prior to Blavatsky, the root races were described by the English theosophist [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883).

==Locations of the proposed former continents==
Some post-theosophical writers, attempting to reconcile current geological science with some earlier theosophical teachings, have equated [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] with the former [[supercontinent]] of [[Gondwana]], but this is not theosophy. Early theosophical teachings agree with the original statements of [[Eduard Suess]], who argued that Gondwanaland consisted of parts of the present continents in their present positions, but joined to one another by other lands that have since been submerged. This is also the position of Master [[Samael Aun Weor]].

[[Atlantis]], in the Theosophical cosmology, was a continent that covered a significant part of what is now the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;See L. Sprague de Camp, ''Lost Continents: The Atlantis Theme in History, Science, and Literature'', Dover Publications, 1970 for a scientific analysis of the concept of lost continents.&lt;/ref&gt; The large continent of Atlantis is said to have "first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas and islands". When the main part of Atlantis began to sink, Atlantean settlers migrated to the new lands which were rising to the east, west, and south. These new lands became the Americas, Africa, parts of Asia, and the present European countries, stretching from the [[Ural Mountains]] of Russia, westward to include the islands of Ireland and Britain, and even farther westward than that in former times. Some emigrants from the remaining islands in the Atlantic settled on new islands to the east which later consolidated into what is now the district of the Abyssinian highlands and lands somewhat to the north. Atlantis perished through flooding and submergence in 9,564 BC,&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt; and its destruction is explained by claiming successive disturbances in the axial rotation of Earth which caused [[earthquake]]s, which led to the sudden sinking of Atlantis.

==Root races, epochs and sub-races==

According to Blavatsky's writings, there will be seven root races assembled for our Earth; each root race is divided into seven subraces.  Only five root races have appeared so far;{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} the sixth is expected to emerge in the 28th century. [[Francis Bacon]] (whom theosophy considers to be the legendary [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|Count of St. Germain]]) in his work ''The New Atlantis'' (1627) describes a potential future civilisation which lives on a land called Bensalem.

===The first root race (Polarian)===

The first root race was "[[Etheric plane|ethereal]]", i.e. they were composed of etheric matter.  They reproduced by dividing like an [[amoeba]].  Earth was still cooling at that time. The first mountain to arise out of the stormy primeval ocean was [[Mount Meru]].&lt;ref name="Powell-31"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 188-192. (Ch. 31. "The Earth: The first root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The second root race (Hyperborean)===
The second root race lived in [[Hyperborea]]. The second root race was colored golden yellow.  Hyperborea included what is now Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Northern Asia and [[Kamchatka]].  The climate was [[Tropical climate|tropical]] because Earth had not yet developed an axial tilt.  The esoteric name of their continent is ''Plaksha'';&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; they called themselves the ''Kimpurshas''.  They reproduced by [[budding]].&lt;ref name="Powell-32"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-196. (Ch. 32. "The Earth: The second root-race.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The third root race (Lemurian)===
[[File:Map of Lemuria.jpg|thumb|Map of Lemuria superimposed over the modern continents from William Scott-Elliot, ''The Story of Atlantis and Lost Lemuria''.]]
The third root race, the Lemurian lived in [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]].  The esoteric name of Lemuria is ''Shalmali''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt; Lemuria, according to Theosophists, existed in a large part of what is now the Indian Ocean including Australia and extending into the South Pacific Ocean; its last remnants are the Australian continent, the island of [[New Guinea]], and the island of [[Madagascar]].  Lemuria sank gradually and was eventually destroyed by incessantly erupting volcanoes.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 193-215. (Ch. 33. "The Earth: The third root-race: Lemurian.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was thought by geologists that the [[Age of the Earth|age of the earth]] was only about 200 million years (because [[radioactive dating]] had not yet come into use), so the [[geological epoch]]s were believed to have occurred at a much later time than is thought to be the case today.  According to traditional Theosophy, the Lemurian root race began 34½ million years ago, in the middle of what was then believed to be the [[Jurassic]]; thus, the people of Lemuria coexisted with the [[dinosaur]]s. The Lemurian race was much taller and bigger than our current race.{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=236}} The first three subraces of the Lemurians reproduced by laying eggs, but the fourth subrace, beginning 16½ million years ago, began to reproduce like modern humans.&lt;ref name="Powell-33"/&gt; As Lemuria was slowly submerged due to volcanic eruptions, the Lemurians colonized the areas surrounding Lemuria, i.e. Africa, Southern India and the East Indies. The descendants of the Lemurian root race, according to traditional Theosophy, include the [[Capoid race]], the [[Bantu people|Congoid race]], the [[Dravidians]], and the [[Australoid race]].

===The fourth root race (Atlantean)===
This race inhabited Atlantis.

====Subraces of the Atlantean root race====

The fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 219-224. Ch. 35. "The fourth (Atlantean) root-race: The Rmoahal".&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace, [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Chankshusha Manu]], which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north.  The esoteric name of [[Atlantis]] is ''Kusha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 55-59. (Ch. 11. "Races and Sub-races".)&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantean root race had [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the [[Color terminology for race|red]] [[American Indian race|American Indian]], [[Color terminology for race|brown]] [[Malayan race|Malayan]], and [[Color terminology for race|yellow]] [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]] races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were
#the Rmoahal
#the Tlavati ([[Cro-Magnon]]s)
#the [[Toltec]] (a term which Theosophists use as a synonym for the Atlantean ancestors of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]])
#the [[Turanian]]
#the original [[Semites]] (i.e. [[Phoenicians]])
#the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]]s, and
#the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]], which migrated to and colonized [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], and [[Southeast Asia]].

The descendants of the Atlanteans according to traditional Theosophy include those of the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]], the [[Malayan race]], and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian race]] as well as some people of what in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was called the "[[Olive skin|olive-skinned]]" [[Mediterranean race]].&lt;ref name="Powell-35"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-36"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 25-26.

====The civilization of Atlantis====
{{anchor|civil-atl}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Maitreya (Theosophy)]] --&gt;
{{Main|Atlantis}}

During the long period of time when Atlantis was ruled by the Toltecs (the ancestors of the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Amerindians]]), the civilization of Atlantis was at its height. This was the period between about 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, called the ''[[Golden Age]] of Atlantis''. The Atlanteans had many luxuries and conveniences. Their capital city was called ''The City of the Golden Gates''. At its height, it had two million inhabitants. There were extensive [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s leading to the city from a mountain lake. The Atlanteans had [[airship]]s powered by the [[vril]] that could seat two to eight people. The [[economic system]] was [[Socialism|socialist]] like that of the [[Incas]]. Atlanteans were the first to develop organized warfare. The military deployed vril-powered air battleships that contained 50 to 100 fighting men. These air battleships deployed [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]] bombs. The [[infantry]] fired fire-tipped arrows. The Toltecs on Atlantis worshipped the [[Sun worship|Sun]] in temples as grand as those of [[ancient Egypt]] that were decorated in bright colors. The sacred word used in [[meditation]] was [[Tau]] (this was the equivalent of the Aryan sacred word [[Om]]). As noted above, the Toltecs colonized all of North America and South America and thus became the people we know as the Amerindians.&lt;ref name=Powell-37&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 227-236. (Ch. 37. "The Third Atlantean Subrace: The Toltec".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Powell-38&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 237-251. (Ch. 38. "The Civilization of Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The downfall of Atlantis started when some of the Toltecs began to practice [[black magic]] about 850,000 BC, corrupted by the dragon "Thevetat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations | first=Joscelyn | last=Godwin | publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co | year=2010 | isbn=1594772622 | page=68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remembered as [[Devadatta]], the opponent of [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Five Years of Theosophy | editor=George Robert Snow Mead | publisher=Echo Library | year=2007 | isbn=1406815284 | page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The people began to become selfish and [[Economic materialism|materialistic]]. Soon thereafter, the Turanians (the ancestors of the people we now know as the [[Turkic peoples]]) became dominant in much of Atlantis. The Turanians continued the practice of black magic which reached its height about 250,000 BC and continued until the final sinking of Atlantis, although they were opposed by [[Magic (paranormal)|white magic]]ians. The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] incarnated as the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC to oppose the black magicians.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 127-137. (Ch. 9 "Black Magic in Atlantis".)&lt;/ref&gt; The black magicians used [[magical spell]]s to breed human-animal [[Chimera (genetics)#Chimeras in research|chimeras]] to use as [[sex slave]]s. They also had an army composed of chimeras that were composites composed of a human body with the heads of fierce predators such as lions, tigers and bears, that ate enemy corpses on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Besant-127"/&gt; The war between the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians continued until the end of Atlantis. The [[Ascended master|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] [[telepathy|telepathically]] warned their disciples (the white magicians) to flee Atlantis in ships while there was still time to get out before the final [[wiktionary:Cataclysm|cataclysm]]. As noted above, the final sudden submergence of Atlantis due to earthquakes occurred in 9,564 BC .&lt;ref name="Powell-50"/&gt;

==={{anchor|aryas}}The fifth root race (Aryan)&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] [[Aryan]] --&gt;===

====Early beginnings of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky asserted humanity was in the fifth root race, the [[Aryan race]], which Theosophists believe to have emerged from the previous fourth root race (Atlantean root race) beginning about 100,000 years ago in Atlantis.  (According to Powell, when Madame Blavatsky stated the Aryan root race was 1,000,000 years old, she meant that the [[soul]]s of the people that later physically incarnated as the first Aryans about 100,000 years ago began to incarnate in the bodies of Atlanteans 1,000,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Powell-37/&gt; However, another way of interpreting this is that Nature began to create the Aryan race before the final cataclysms.) Theosophists believe the Aryan root race was physically progenerated by the [[Manu (Theosophy)#Theosophy|Vaivasvatu Manu]], one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]].  The present-day ethnic group most closely related to the new race is the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]].  The small band of only 9,000 people constituting the then small Aryan root race migrated out of Atlantis in 79,797 BC. The [[bard]]s of the new [[White people|white]] root-race poetically referred to the new race as being ''moon-colored''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. and Besant, Annie ''Main: Whence, How, and Whither?'' Wheaton, Illinois:1913 Theosophical Press Pages 249-254&lt;/ref&gt; A small group of these Aryan migrants from Atlantis split from the main body of migrants and went south to the shore of an inland sea in what was then a verdant and lush [[Sahara]] where they founded the "City of the Sun". The main body of migrants continued onwards to an island called the "white island" in the middle of what was then an inland sea in what is now the [[Gobi desert]], where they established the "City of the Bridge".&lt;ref name="Powell-45"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 282-286. (Ch. 45. "The Beginnings of the Fifth (Aryan) Root Race".)&lt;/ref&gt; (The "City of the Bridge" was constructed directly below the [[Etheric plane|etheric]] city called [[Shamballa]] where Theosophists believe the governing [[deity]] of Earth, [[Sanat Kumara]], dwells; thus, the ongoing evolution of the Aryan root race has been divinely guided by the being Theosophists call "The Lord of the World".)

The esoteric name of the whole of the present land surface of Earth, i.e. the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]], the Americas, the Australian continent and Antarctica taken as a whole is ''Krauncha''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

Generally speaking, a large percentage of the people who live in the time of the period of the fifth root race are part of the fifth root race. However Blavatsky also opines that some [[Semitic peoples]] have become "degenerate in spirituality".  She asserted that some peoples descended from the Lemurians are "semi-animal creatures".  These latter include "the [[Tasmanian Aborigines|Tasmanians]], a portion of the [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]] and a mountain tribe in China." There are also "considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the [[Veddhas]] of [[Ceylon]], most of the remaining [[Australian Aborigines|Australians]], [[Bushmen]], [[Negritos]], [[Andaman Islanders]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. 2, p. 195f.&lt;/ref&gt; All these aforementioned groups mentioned by Blavatsky except the purported "wild men of Borneo" (not to be confused with the famous circus duo, the [[Wild Men of Borneo]]) are part of what was in the late 19th and most of the 20th century was called the [[Australoid race]] (except for the [[Bushmen]], part of the [[Capoid race]]), both of which races, as noted above, were believed by traditional Theosophists to have been descended from the Lemurians.

====Subraces of the Aryan root race====

Blavatsky described the fifth root race with the following words: ''"The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock&amp;nbsp;– the Fifth Root-Race&amp;nbsp;– and spring from one single progenitor'',&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', vol. 2, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; which Hindus call [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]. Theosophists believe that each root race has a separate and distinct progenitor.

The subraces of the Aryan Fifth Root Race include the first subrace, the [[Indo-Aryans|Hindu]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" on the white island in the middle of the Gobi inland sea to [[India]] in 60,000 BC; the second subrace, the [[Arabs|Arabian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Arabia]] in 40,000 BC; the third subrace, the [[Iranian peoples|Persian]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Persia]] in 30,000 BC; the fourth subrace, the [[Celts]], which migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to [[Western Europe]] beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Mycenaeans|Mycenaean Greeks]] are regarded as an offshoot of the Celtic subrace that colonized Southeast Europe); and the fifth subrace, the [[Teutons|Teutonic]], which also migrated from the "City of the Bridge" to what is now Germany beginning in 20,000 BC (the [[Slav]]s are regarded as an offshoot of the Teutonic subrace that colonized Russia and surrounding areas).&lt;ref name="Powell-50"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 308-316. (Ch. 50. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Keltic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-46"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 287-289. (Ch. 46. "The City of the Bridge".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-47"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 290-294. (Ch. 47. "The first Aryan sub-race: The Hindu, B.C. 60,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-48"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 295-301. (Ch. 48. "The second Aryan sub-race: The Arabian, B.C. 40,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-49"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 302-307. (Ch. 49. "The third Aryan sub-race: The Iranian, B.C. 30,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell-51"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 317-320. (Ch. 51. "The fourth Aryan sub-race: The Teutonic, B.C. 20,000".)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The emergence of the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race====

According to Blavatsky the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will begin to evolve in the area of the United States in the early 21st century.  This sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will be called the ''Australo-American subrace'' and is believed by Theosophists to be now arising from the Teutonic subrace of the Aryan root race in Australia and in the Western United States (many individuals of the new subrace will be born in [[California]]) and its surrounding nearby areas (i.e., the Australo-American subrace is in arising from the [[European Americans|Anglo-American]], [[English Canadians|Anglo-Canadian]], [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Australian]] and presumably also the [[New Zealand European|Anglo-New Zealander]] [[ethnic group]]s).&lt;ref name="Powell-52"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 326-330. (Ch. 52 "The Aryan Sixth Sub-Race").&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth or Australo-American sub-race will "possess certain [[psychic powers]], and for this the [[pituitary body]] will be developed, thus giving an additional sense, that of cognising [[Aura (paranormal)|astral emotions]] in the ordinary waking consciousness. We may say that in general the sixth sub-race will bring in wisdom and intuition, blending all that is best in the intelligence of the fifth subrace and the emotion of the fourth."&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

===The sixth root race===

According to [[C. W. Leadbeater]], a colony will be established in [[Baja California]] by the [[Theosophical Society]] under the guidance of the [[Ascended masters|Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in the 28th century for the intensive selective [[Eugenics|eugenic]] breeding of the sixth root race.  The Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]] will physically incarnate in order to be the [[Manu (Theosophy)|Manu]] ("progenitor") of this new root race.&lt;ref name="Besant-353"&gt;Besant/Leadbeater, ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'', p. 353-495.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the world will be powered by [[nuclear power]] and there will be a single [[world government]] led by a person who will be the reincarnation of [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="Besant-353"/&gt; Tens of thousands of years in the future, a new continent will arise in the Pacific Ocean that will be the future home of the sixth root race.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"&gt;Powell, ''The Solar System'', p. 330-347. (Ch. 54. "The sixth and seventh root-races.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]] west of the [[San Andreas Fault]] will break off from the mainland of North America and become the [[Island of California]] off the eastern coast of the new continent.&lt;ref name="Powell-52"/&gt;

====Subraces of the sixth root race====

[[Victor Skumin]] proposed a [[definition]] and classification of '''''Homo spiritalis''''' ([[Latin]]: "spiritual man"), the sixth root race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Victor Skumin|Skumin]] |first=V.

===The seventh root race===

The seventh root race will arise from the seventh subrace of the sixth root race on the future continent that the sixth root race will be living on that will arise from the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt; The continent they will inhabit is esoterically called ''[[Pushkara]]''.&lt;ref name="Powell-11"/&gt;

==Migration to Mercury==

It is believed by some [[Neo-Theosophy|Neo-Theosophists]] that after the present [[Round (Theosophy)|round]] of human spiritual evolution by reincarnation of [[soul]]s in root races is completed several dozen million years from now, the human race will migrate to the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to continue its spiritual and physical evolution.&lt;ref name="Powell-54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theosophical belief in the brotherhood of humanity==

Modern writers within theosophy or influenced by theosophy defend Blavatsky's use of the terms Aryan race and root race as "not connected to demagogic ideas".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} They say{{who|date=September 2014}} that the classification of humanity into races is still practiced today and that Blavatsky and subsequent [[esoteric]] philosophers who expressed similar lines of thought intended a Universal Brotherhood of humanity. Yet root race philosophy is not void of directly biologically racial elements.

Blavatsky promulgated her ideology in a layered, multidimensional style and way, and paradoxical truth was key to her metaphysics. Seemingly paradoxical statements underpin root race theoretic philosophy existing beyond bifurcations of "liberal" or "illiberal" notions. Blavatsky wrote that, while "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence"&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy'', Section 3&lt;/ref&gt;—nevertheless, in ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky posits: "Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence." The interrelationship between spirituality and root race developmental history is nonlinear and complex. Thus: "Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (The Chinese, Africans, etc.,.) gradually brought the worship back." &lt;ref name="doctrine"&gt;Blavatsky, Helena, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol. 2, Page  294. [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd2-1-17.htm Online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is "To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".{{sfn|Blavatsky|1962|loc=Section 3}}

Cranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind.{{sfn|Cranston|1995|p=400}} {{sfn|Blavatsky|1888b|loc=Stanza IX}}

In [[religion]] and [[ethics]], the '''inviolability''' or '''sanctity of life''' is a principle of implied protection regarding aspects of [[sentience|sentient]] life that are said to be holy, [[sacred]], or otherwise of such [[Value theory|value]] that they are not to be violated. This can be applied to both animals and humans, for instance in religions that practice [[Ahimsa]], as both are seen as holy and worthy of life.

The concept of inviolability is an important tie between the ethics of religion and the ethics of law, as each seeks justification for its principles as based on both purity and natural concept, as well as in universality of application.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Christianity and abortion}}
The phrase ''sanctity of life'' refers to the idea that human life is [[sacred]], [[holy]], and precious, argued mainly by the [[pro-life]] side in political and [[Morality|moral]] debates over such controversial issues as [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[euthanasia]], [[embryonic stem-cell research]], and the "[[right to die]]" in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]] and other [[English-speaking countries]]. (Comparable phrases are also used in other languages.) Although the phrase was used primarily in the 19th century in [[Protestant]] discourse, after [[World War II]] the phrase has been used in [[Catholic moral theology]] and, following ''[[Roe v.

In Western thought, sanctity of life is usually applied solely to the human species ([[anthropocentrism]], sometimes called [[dominionism]]), in marked contrast to many schools of [[Eastern philosophy]], which often hold that all animal life is sacred―in some cases to such a degree that, for example, practitioners of [[Jainism]] carry brushes with which to sweep insects from their path, lest they inadvertently tread upon them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Carlin]], American social critic and author, challenged this viewpoint in his 1996 album and HBO special ''[[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|Back in Town]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lybio.net/george-carlin-pro-life-abortion-and-the-sanctity-of-life/comedy/|title=George Carlin: Pro Life, Abortion, And The Sanctity Of Life|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of '''self-confidence'''  self-assurance in one's personal judgment, ability, [[Power (sociology)|power]], etc. One increases self-confidence from experiences of having mastered particular activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6IyqCNBD6oIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hewitt,+John+P.+(2009).+Oxford+Handbook+of+Positive+Psychology.+Oxford+University+Press.+pp.+217%E2%80%93224.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKg-Lcoc_QAhVkwVQKHU_LCtYQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|last=Snyder|first=C.

Self-confidence is not the same as [[self-esteem]], which is an evaluation of one’s own worth, whereas self-confidence is more specifically trust in one’s ability to achieve some goal, which one meta-analysis suggested is similar to generalization of [[self-efficacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Judge|first=Timothy A.|last2=Erez|first2=Amir|last3=Bono|first3=Joyce E.|last4=Thoresen|first4=Carl J.|date=2002-09-01|title=Are measures of self-esteem, neuroticism, locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy indicators of a common core construct?|url= |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=83|issue=3|pages=693–710|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.693|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and many others after him have emphasized the need to distinguish between self-confidence as a generalized personality characteristic, and self-confidence with respect to a specific task, ability or challenge (i.e. self-efficacy).  Self-confidence typically refers to general self-confidence. This is different from self-efficacy, which psychologist [[Albert Bandura]] has defined as a “belief in one’s ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social cognitive theory.

Psychologists have long noted that a person can possess self-confidence that he or she can complete a specific task (self-efficacy) (e.g. cook a good meal or write a good novel) even though they may lack general self-confidence, or conversely be self-confident though they lack the self-efficacy to achieve a particular task (e.g. write a novel). These two types of self-confidence are, however, correlated with each other, and for this reason can be easily conflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Raymond|date=1964-05-01|title=The obstinate audience: The influence process from the point of view of social communication |url= |journal=American Psychologist|language=English|volume=19|issue=5|pages=319–328|doi=10.1037/h0042851|issn=1935-990X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ideas about the causes and effects of self-confidence have appeared in English language publications describing characteristics of a sacrilegious attitude toward God,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Some Thoughts Concerning the present Revival of Religion in New-England.|last=Edwards, J., &amp; Wesley, J.|first=|publisher=S.

In 1890, the philosopher [[William James]] in his ''[[The Principles of Psychology|Principles of Psychology]]'' wrote, “Believe what is in the line of your needs, for only by such belief is the need fulled ... Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment,” expressing how self-confidence could be a virtue. That same year, Dr. Frederick Needham in his presidential address to the opening of the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]’s Section of Psychology praised a progressive new architecture of an asylum accommodation for insane patients as increasing their self-confidence by offering them greater “liberty of action, extended exercise, and occupation, thus generating self-confidence and becoming, not only excellent tests of the sanity of the patient, but operating powerfully in promoting recovery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needham|first=Frederick|date=1890-08-09|title=An Address Delivered at the Opening of the Section of Psychology|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=1545|pages=325–330|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2207994|pmid=20753102|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1545.325}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, he seemed to early on suggest that self-confidence may bear a scientific relation to mental health.

With the arrival of [[World War I]], psychologists praised self-confidence as greatly decreasing nervous tension, allaying fear, and ridding the battlefield of terror; they argued that soldiers who cultivated a strong and healthy body would also acquire greater self-confidence while fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Charles|date=1917-01-01|title=From Home to the Charge: A Psychological Study of the Soldier|jstor=1413607|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=28|issue=3|pages=315–348|doi=10.2307/1413607}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the [[Temperance movement|Temperance social reform movement]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; of the 1920s, psychologists associated self-confidence in men with remaining at home and taking care of the family when they were not working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Mary P.|date=1918-01-01|title=Alcohol and Social Case Work|jstor=1014456|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=77|pages=154–159|doi=10.1177/000271621807700116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Great Depression]], Philip Eisenberg and Paul Lazerfeld noted how a sudden negative change in one’s circumstances, especially a loss of a job, could lead to decreased self-confidence, but more commonly if the jobless person believes the fault of his unemployment is his. They also noted how if individuals do not have a job long enough, they became apathetic and lost all self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=P.|last2=Lazarsfeld|first2=P.

In 1943, [[Abraham Maslow]] in his paper “A Theory of Human Motivation” argued that an individual only was motivated to acquire self-confidence (one component of “esteem”) after he or she had achieved what they needed for physiological survival, safety, and love and belonging. He claimed that satisfaction of self-esteem led to feelings of self-confidence that, once attained, led to a desire for “[[self-actualization]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=A.

Some studies suggest various factors within and beyond an individual's control that affect their self-confidence. Hippel and Trivers propose that people will deceive themselves about their own positive qualities and negative qualities of others so that they can display greater self-confidence than they might otherwise feel, thereby enabling them to advance socially and materially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hippel|first=William von|last2=Trivers|first2=Robert|date=2011-02-01|title=The evolution and psychology of self-deception|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/the-evolution-and-psychology-of-self-deception/B87968EC4A6B4DC93A21C217ABC13E13|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1017/S0140525X10001354|issn=1469-1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have found that new information about an individual’s performance interacts with an individual’s prior self-confidence about their ability to perform. If that particular information is negative feedback, this may interact with a negative affective state (low self-confidence) causing the individual to become demoralized, which in turn induces a self-defeating attitude that increases the likelihood of failure in the future more than if they did not lack self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cervone|first=Daniel|last2=Kopp|first2=Deborah A.|last3=Schaumann|first3=Linda|last4=Scott|first4=Walter D.|date=1994-09-01|title=Mood, self-efficacy, and performance standards: Lower moods induce higher standards for performance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=67|issue=3|pages=499–512|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.499|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright, J.

A meta-analysis of 12 articles found that generally when individuals attribute their success to a stable cause (a matter under their control) they are less likely to be confident about being successful in the future. If an individual attributes their failure to an unstable cause (a factor beyond their control, like a sudden and unexpected storm) they are less likely to be confident about succeeding in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weiner, Bernard|first=|year=1985|title=An attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion|url=|journal=Psychological Review|volume=92 |issue=4|pages=548–573|via=|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.92.4.548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if an individual believes he/she and/or others failed to achieve a goal (e.g. give up smoking) because of a factor that was beyond their control, he or she is more likely to be more self-confident that he or she can achieve the goal in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eiser|first=J.

=== Variation between different categorical groups ===
Social scientists have found ways in which self-confidence seems to operate differently within various groups in society.

==== Children ====
In children, self-confidence emerges differently than adults. For example, Fenton suggested that only children as a group are more self-confident than other children.&lt;ref name="Fenton 546–556"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fenton|first=Norman|title=The Only Child |journal=The Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=35|issue=4|pages=546–556|doi=10.1080/08856559.1928.10532171|year=1928}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zimmerman claimed that if children are self-confident they can learn they are more likely to sacrifice immediate recreational time for possible rewards in the future. enhancing their self-regulative capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Barry J.|date=1990-01-01|title=Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Achievement: An Overview |journal=Educational Psychologist|volume=25|issue=1|pages=3–17|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2501_2|issn=0046-1520}}&lt;/ref&gt; By adolescence, youth that have little contact with friends tend to have low self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Kathleen J.|date=1984-03-01|title=The self-concept and social adaptation of hyperactive children in adolescence |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology|volume=13|issue=1|pages=50–55|doi=10.1080/15374418409533169|issn=0047-228X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful performance of children in music also increases feelings of self-confidence, increasing motivation for study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clift, S., Hancox, G., Staricoff, R., &amp; Whitmore, C.|first=|year=2008|title=Singing and health: A systematic mapping and review of non-clinical research.|url=|journal=Sidney de Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health: Canterbury Christ Church University.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hallam|first=Susan|date=2010-08-01|title=The power of music: Its impact on the intellectual, social and personal development of children and young people |journal=International Journal of Music Education|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=269–289|doi=10.1177/0255761410370658|issn=0255-7614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Students ====
Many studies focus on students in school.

In one study of UCLA students, males (compared to females) and adolescents with more siblings (compared to those with less) were more self-confident. Individuals who were self-confident specifically in the academic domain were more likely to be happy but higher general self-confidence was not correlated with happiness.

==== Men versus women ====
In the aftermath of the first wave of feminism and women’s role in the labor force during the World War, Maslow argued that some women who possessed a more “dominant” personality were more self-confident and therefore would aspire to and achieve more intellectually than those that had a less “dominant” personality—even if they had the same level of intelligence as the “less dominant” women. However, Phillip Eisenberg later found the same dynamic among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maslow|first=A. H.|title=Dominance, Personality, and Social Behavior in Women |journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–39|doi=10.1080/00224545.1939.9713343|year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common finding is that males who have low generalized self-confidence are more easily persuaded than males of high generalized self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SOk8TFBYWHIC&amp;pg=PA222 |title=Documents of Gestalt Psychology|last=Henle|first=Mary|date=1961-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|last2=Lundy|first2=Richard M.|date=1957-03-01|title=Personality Characteristics Related to Susceptibility to Influence by Peers or Authority Figures |journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=306–316|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1957.tb01529.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janis|first=Irving L|date=1954-06-01|title=Personality Correlates of Susceptibility To Persuasion |journal=Journal of Personality|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=504–518|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1954.tb01870.x|issn=1467-6494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found that women who are either high or low in general self-confidence are more likely to be persuaded to change their opinion than women with medium self-confidence.

Furthermore, women who initially had low self-confidence are likely to experience a larger drop of self-confidence after separation from their children than women with relatively higher self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seashore, M.

==== Self-confidence in different cultures ====
Some have suggested that self-confidence is more adaptive in cultures where people are not very concerned about maintaining harmonious relationships. But in cultures that value positive feelings and self-confidence  less, maintenance of smooth interpersonal relationships are more important, and therefore self-criticism and a concern to save face is more adaptive. For example, Suh et al. (1998) argue that East Asians are not as concerned as maintaining self-confidence as Americans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Suh|first1=E.|last2=Diener|first2=E.|last3=Oishi|first3=S.|last4=Triandis|first4=H.

==== Athletes ====
Many sports psychologists have noted the importance of self-confidence in winning athletic competitions. Amongst athletes, gymnasts who tend to talk to themselves in an instructional format tended to be more self-confident than gymnasts that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=Michael J.|last2=Avener|first2=Marshall|title=Psychology of the elite athlete: An exploratory study|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01173634|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=135–141|doi=10.1007/BF01173634|issn=0147-5916|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that self-confidence is also one of the most influential factors in how well an athlete performs in a competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craft, L.

(2005) make the distinction between "robust confidence" which leads to tough thinking, and "resilient confidence" which involves over-coming self doubts and maintaining self-focus and generates "tough thinking."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These traits enable athletes to "bounce back from adversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galli, N., &amp; Vealey, R.

However feedback from their team members in the form of emotional and informational support reduces the extent to which stresses in sports reduces their self-confidence.  At high levels of support, performance related stress does not affect self-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Paul|last2=Rees|first2=Tim|date=2010-01-01|title=Perceived social support from team-mates: Direct and stress-buffering effects on self-confidence |journal=European Journal of Sport Science|volume=10|issue=1|pages=59–67|doi=10.1080/17461390903049998|issn=1746-1391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measures ==
One of the earliest measures of self-confidence used a 12-point scale centered on zero, ranging from a minimum score characterizing someone who is  “timid and self-distrustful, Shy, never makes decisions, self effacing” to an upper extreme score representing someone who is “able to make decisions, absolutely confident and sure of his own decisions and opinions.”&lt;ref name="Fenton 546–556"/&gt;

Some have measured self-confidence as a simple construct divided into affective and cognitive components: anxiety as an affective aspect and self-evaluations of proficiency as a cognitive component.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clément|first=Richard|last2=Kruidenier|first2=Bastian G.|date=1983-09-01|title=Orientations in Second Language Acquisition: I. the Effects of Ethnic Ty, Milieu, and Target Language on Their Emergence |journal=Language Learning|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=273–291|doi=10.1111/j.1467-1770.1983.tb00542.x|issn=1467-9922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more context-based Personal Evaluation Inventory (PEI), developed by Shrauger (1995), measures specific self-esteem and self-confidence in different aspects (speaking in public spaces, academic performance, physical appearance, romantic relationships, social interactions, athletic ability, and general self-confidence score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrauger|first=J. Sidney|last2=Schohn|first2=Mary|date=1995-09-01|title=Self-Confidence in College Students: Conceptualization, Measurement, and Behavioral Implications |journal=Assessment|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=255–278|doi=10.1177/1073191195002003006|issn=1073-1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other surveys have also measured self-confidence in a similar way by evoking examples of more concrete activities (e.g. making new friends, keeping up with course demands, managing time wisely, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) measures on a scale of 1 to 4 how confident athletes feel about winning an upcoming match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tim|last2=Freeman|first2=Paul|date=2007-07-01|title=The effects of perceived and received support on self-confidence |journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=25|issue=9|pages=1057–1065|doi=10.1080/02640410600982279|issn=0264-0414|pmid=17497407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Trait Robustness of Sports-Confidence Inventory (TROSCI) requires respondents to provide numerical answers on a nine-point scale answering such questions about how much one's self-confidence goes up and down, and how sensitive one's self-confidence is to performance and negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beattie|first=Stuart|last2=Hardy|first2=Lew|last3=Savage|first3=Jennifer|last4=Woodman|first4=Tim|last5=Callow|first5=Nichola|date=2011-03-01|title=Development and validation of a trait measure of robustness of self-confidence |journal=Psychology of Sport and Exercise|volume=12|issue=2|pages=184–191|doi=10.1016/j.psychsport.2010.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, skeptical about the reliability of such self-report indices, have measured self-confidence by having examiners assess non-verbal cues of subjects, measuring on a scale of 1 to 5 whether the individual
# maintains frequent eye contact or almost completely avoids eye contact,
# engages in little or no fidgeting, or, a lot of fidgeting,
# seldom or frequently uses self-comforting gestures (e.g. stroking hair or chin, arms around self),
# sits up straight facing the experimenter, or, sits hunched over or rigidly without facing the experimenter,
# has a natural facial expression, or, grimaces,
# does not twiddle hands, or, frequently twiddles something in their hand, or,
# uses body and hand gestures to emphasize a point, or, never uses hand or body gestures to emphasize a point or makes inappropriate gestures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Various systemic-level theories and concepts related to self-confidence ==
Various systemic theories exist that are related to self-confidence.

== Wheel of Wellness ==
The Wheel of Wellness was the first theoretical model of Wellness based in [[counseling theory]]. It is a model based on [[Alfred Adler|Adler]]'s individual psychology and cross-disciplinary research on characteristics of healthy people who live longer and with a higher [[quality of life]]. The Wheel of Wellness includes five life tasks that relate to each other: [[spirituality]], self-direction, work and leisure, friendship, and love. There are 15 subtasks of self-direction areas: sense of worth, sense of control, realistic beliefs, emotional awareness and coping, [[problem solving]] and [[creativity]], sense of [[humor]], nutrition, exercise, self-care, [[stress management]], [[gender identity]], and [[cultural identity]]. There are also five second-order factors, the Creative Self, Coping Self, Social Self, Essential Self, and Physical Self, which allow exploration of the meaning of wellness within the total self. In order to achieve a high self-esteem, it is essential to focus on identifying strengths, positive assets, and resources related to each component of the Wellness model and using these strengths to cope with life challenges.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Jane|last2=Willise|first2=John|last3=Villalba|first3=Jose|date=1 January 2011|title=Promoting Self-Esteem in Adolescents: The Influence of Wellness Factors|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=89|pages=28–30|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6678.2011.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implicit vs. explicit==
Implicitly measured self-esteem has been found to be weakly correlated with explicitly measured self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}{{clarify|reason=how are these things actually measured?|date=September 2018}} This leads some critics{{who|date=September 2018}} to assume that explicit and implicit self-confidence are two completely different types of self-esteem. Therefore, this has drawn the conclusion that one will either have a distinct, unconscious self-esteem OR they will consciously misrepresent how they feel about themselves. Recent studies have shown that implicit self-esteem doesn't particularly tap into the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], rather that people consciously overreport their levels of self-esteem. Another possibility is that implicit measurement may be assessing a different aspect of conscious self-esteem altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Timko|first=Alix |author2=England, Erica |author3=Herbert, James |author4=Foreman, Evan |title=The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure as a measure of Self-Esteem|journal=The Psychological Record|date=Fall 2010|volume=60|issue=4|pages=679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaccurate self-evaluation is commonly observed in healthy populations. In the extreme, large differences between oneʼs [[self-perception]] and oneʼs actual behavior is a hallmark of a number of disorders that have important implications for understanding treatment seeking and compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beer|first=J.|author2=Lombardo M |author3=Bhanji J. |title=Roles of Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Orbitofrontal Cortex in Self-evaluation|journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]]|date=September 2010|volume=22|issue=9|pages=2108–2119|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-control''', an aspect of [[inhibitory control]], is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and [[behavior]] in the face of temptations and impulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/the-nurture-versus-biosocial-debate-in-criminology/n11.xml | title=Chapter 10: Low Self-Control Is a Brain-Based Disorder | publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd | accessdate=4 May 2014 | author=Matt DeLisi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking “outside the box,” seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... Self-control is the aspect of inhibitory control that involves control over one’s behavior and control over one’s emotions in the service of controlling one’s behavior.
See 2nd Nephi 2:27 Self-control is about resisting temptations and not acting impulsively. The temptation resisted might be to indulge in pleasures when one should not (e.g., to indulge in a romantic fling if you are married or to eat sweets if you are trying to lose weight), to overindulge, or to stray from the straight and narrow (e.g., to cheat or steal). Or the temptation might be to impulsively react (e.g., reflexively striking back at someone who has hurt your feelings) or to do or take what you want without regard for social norms (e.g., butting in line or grabbing another child’s toy).&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of self-control is having the discipline to stay on task despite distractions and completing a task despite temptations to give up, to move on to more interesting work, or to have a good time instead. This involves making yourself do something or keep at something though you would rather be doing something else. It is related to the final aspect of self-control—delaying gratification (Mischel et al. 1989)—making yourself forgo an immediate pleasure for a greater reward later (often termed delay discounting by neuroscientists and learning theorists; Louie &amp; Glimcher 2010, Rachlin et al. 1991). Without the discipline to complete what one started and delay gratification, no one would ever complete a long, time-consuming task such as writing a dissertation, running a marathon, or starting a new business.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[executive function]], self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific [[goal]]s.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timpano  |first1=K.

(Muraven, M., Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Tice, D. M.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-control is also a key concept in the [[General Theory of Crime|general theory of crime]], a major theory in [[criminology]]. The theory was developed by [[Michael R. Gottfredson|Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] in their book titled ''A General Theory of Crime'', published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General Theory of Crime|last=Gottfredson|first=Michael|last2=Hirschi|first2=Travis|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. The general theory of crime holds that self-control is established in early childhood through three major factors: the strength of the parent-to-child emotional bond, adequate supervision by parents, parents' ability to recognize punishable behavior, and appropriate discipline by parents.

==Research==

===Counteractive===

Desire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kavanagh |first1= D.J. |last2= Andrade |first2= J. |last3=May |first3=J. |title= Imaginary relish and exquisite torture: The elaborated intrusion theory of desire |journal= Psychological Review |year=2005 |volume=112 |issue= 2 |pages= 446–467 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.112.2.446 |pmid= 15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual’s values or other self-regulatory goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=W. |last2=Baumeister |first2=R.F. |last3=Forster |first3=G. |last4= Vohs |first4=K.D. |title= Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study on desire, conflict, and self-control |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume= 102 |issue=6 |pages= 1318–1335 |doi= 10.1037/a0026545 |pmid= 22149456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hofmann |first1= W. |last2= Van Dillen |first2= L. |year=2012 |title= Desire: The new hot spot in self-control research |url = |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume= 21 |issue=5 |pages= 317–322 |doi= 10.1177/0963721412453587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmann|first1=W.|last2=Vohs |first2= K.D. |last3=Baumeister |first3= R.F. |title=What people desire, feel conflicted about, and try to resist in everyday life|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=6|pages=582–588|doi=10.1177/0956797612437426|pmid=22547657}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has many implications related to self-control and the everyday things that interfere with people’s ability to stay on task. This is a big reason why self-control is considered to be a public speaker's worst nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel (1998). "Working with Emotional Intelligence", p. 73.

Desires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = W. | last2 = Baumesiter | first2 = R.F. | last3 = Forster | first3 = G. | last4 = Vohs | first4 = K.D. | year = 2012 | title = Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study of desire, conflict, and self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1318–1335 | doi=10.1037/a0026545| pmid = 22149456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myrseth | first1 = K. O.

One of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one’s budget on eating out can be an symptom of a lack of self control.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. (2017). Self-Rationing Efficiency of Repeated Eating-Out Expenses: Does Experience Matter?. Journal of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Research, 41(3), 259-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroese | first1 = M.F. | last2 = Evers | first2 = C. | last3 = de Ridder | first3 = T.D. | year = 2013 | title = If it's good it must be bad: The indirect effect of temptation strength on self-control through perceived unhealthiness | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 522–524 | doi=10.1016/j.eatbeh.2013.07.006| pmid = 24183149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long-term values.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbach, A. 2008 pp. 281-294"/&gt;

===Satiation===
The decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&amp;Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redden | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Haws | first2 = K.L. | year = 2013 | title = Healthy satiation: The role of decreasing desire in effective self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 1100–1114 | doi=10.1086/667362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construal levels===
Thinking that is characterized by high [[construals]], whenever individuals "are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them",&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense.  Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of "why?" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by "how?" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an [[Implicit Association Test]], people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with "bad," and healthy choices (such as apples) with "good" than those in the low-level condition.  Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fujita | first1 = K. | last2 = Han | first2 = H. | year = 2009 | title = Moving Beyond Deliberative Control of Impulses: The Effect of Construal Levels on Evaluative Associations in Self-Control Conflicts | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 799–804 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02372.x | pmid = 19493322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human and non-human===
Positive correlation between [[language|linguistic capability]] and self-control has been inferred from experiments with [[common chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boysen ST |author2=Berntson GG |title=Responses to quantity: perceptual versus cognitive mechanisms in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Journal of experimental psychology. Animal behavior processes |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=82–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7844508 |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.21.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beran MJ |author2=Savage-Rumbaugh ES |author3=Pate JL |author4=Rumbaugh DM |title=Delay of gratification in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=119–276 |year=1999 |pmid=10086230 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199903)34:2&lt;119::aid-dev5&gt;3.0.co;2-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human self-control research is typically  modeled by using a [[token economy]] system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, [[positive reinforcer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page = 305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period (Hyten et al. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyten C., Madden G. J., Field D. P. | year = 1994 | title = Exchange delays and impulsive choice in adult humans | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 225–233 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1994.62-225| pmid = 7964366 | last2 = Madden | last3 = Field | pmc=1334459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an "exchange period" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females.  (Jackson &amp; Hackenberg 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson K., Hackenberg T. D. | year = 1996 | title = Token reinforcement, choice, and self-control in pigeons | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1996.66-29| pmid = 8755699 | pmc = 1284552 | last2 = Hackenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children.  She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below.

Most of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than [[impulsiveness]]. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.

Self-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health.

When looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as “[[John Henryism]]” posits that when goal-oriented, success-minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can—like the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition—work themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on "John Henryism" as the cause of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamblin|first1=James|title=The Paradox of Effort|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/the-health-cost-of-upward-mobility/398486/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"&gt;Logue, A.W. (1995).

== Skinner's survey of techniques ==

[[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''Science and Human Behavior'' provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical restraint and physical aid ===

The manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include clapping one’s hand over one’s own mouth, placing one’s hand in one’s pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‘bridge’ hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing the stimulus ===

Manipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit.&lt;ref name="May 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=May |first=Jon |last2=Andrade |first2=Jackie |last3=Panabokke |first3=Nathalie |last4=Kavanagh |first4=David |title=Images of desire: Cognitive models of craving |journal=Memory |date=July 2004 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=447–461 |doi=10.1080/09658210444000061 |pmid=15493072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofmann |first=W. |last2=Van Dillen |first2=L. |title=Desire: The New Hot Spot in Self-Control Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=2012 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=317–322 |doi=10.1177/0963721412453587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="May 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt; Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.

=== Depriving and satiating ===
Deprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it | page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson, e. K., | year = 2001| title = The Psychology of BF Skinner | page = 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert.

One may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free "junk food" is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=David J.|author2=Andrade, Jackie |author3=May, Jon |title=Imaginary Relish and Exquisite Torture: The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire|journal=Psychological Review|year=2005|volume=112|issue=2|pages=446–467|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.2.446|pmid=15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as "a game of tennis" or "a telephone ringing." After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005" /&gt; That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.

=== Manipulating emotional conditions ===

We manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson. E. K., | year = 2001 | title= The Psychology of BF Skinner| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the "mood" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, treating an activity as "work" or "fun" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/656576 |title=Work or Fun? How Task Construal and Completion Influence Regulatory Behavior |year=2011 |last1=Laran |first1=Juliano |last2=Janiszewski |first2=Chris |journal=The Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=967–983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Deutsch |first2=Roland |last3=Lancaster |first3=Katie |last4= Banaji |first4=Mahzarin R. |title=Cooling the heat of temptation: Mental self-control and the automatic evaluation of tempting stimuli |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=2010 |issue=40 |pages=17–25 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010" /&gt; This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.

=== Using aversive stimulation ===

Aversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to all methods of self-management,  there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.

=== Drugs ===

Certain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[amphetamine]], improve [[inhibitory control]] in general and are used to treat ADHD.&lt;ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol. Psychiatry | volume = 77 | issue = 11 | pages = 940–950 | year = June 2015 | pmid = 25499957 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.09.013 | quote = The procognitive actions of psychostimulants are only associated with low doses. Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&amp;nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function). This information has potentially important clinical implications as well as relevance for public health policy regarding the widespread clinical use of psychostimulants and for the development of novel pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions associated with PFC dysregulation.&amp;nbsp;... In particular, in both animals and humans, lower doses maximally improve performance in tests of working memory and response inhibition, whereas maximal suppression of overt behavior and facilitation of attentional processes occurs at higher doses. | pmc=4377121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

=== Operant conditioning ===

[[Operant conditioning]] sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as [[positive punishment]] and negative punishment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is "silly" or "stupid", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased. Another example of operant conditioning can be seen in the form of quitting a habit such as smoking. By using this technique to quit smoking, self-discipline must be displayed as the smoker must stop giving into their addiction.

=== Punishment ===

Self-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.&lt;ref name="Skinner237"&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self-control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.&lt;ref&gt;Logue, Self Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today 34-77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Doing something else" ===

Skinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Walden Two 1948&lt;/ref&gt; When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response.

==Brain regions involved==
[[Functional imaging]] of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (dlPFC), a part of the [[frontal lobe]].  This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/27/34/9141 | pmid = 17715350 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0924-07.2007 | volume=27 | issue=34 | title=To do or not to do: the neural signature of self-control |date=August 2007 | journal=J. Neurosci. | pages=9141–5 | author=Brass M, Haggard P| last2 = Haggard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control occurs through the  top-down inhibition of [[premotor cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kühn | first1 = S | last2 = Haggard | first2 = P | last3 = Brass | first3 = M | year = 2009 | title = Intentional inhibition: How the "veto-area" exerts control | url = | journal = Hum Brain Mapp. | volume = 30 | issue = 9| pages = 2834–2843 | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20711 | pmid = 19072994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=B.T.|author2=D'Esposito, M.|title=Searching for "the top" in top-down control|journal=Neuron|year=2005|volume=48|pages=535–538|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.002|pmid=16301170|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudsen|first=E.I.|title=Fundamental components of attention|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2007|volume=30|pages=57–78|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094256|pmid=17417935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dillen|first=L.F.|author2=Koole, S.L. |title=Clearing the mind: A working memory model distraction from negative mood|journal=Emotion|year=2007|volume=7|issue=4|pages=715–723|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.4.715|pmid=18039038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person’s learning history.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=W.|author2=Friese, M. |author3=Strack, F. |title=Impulse and self-control from a dual-systems perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=162–176|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application.
Much of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning.

Many of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders.

There is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control.

===Prefrontal cortex===

The prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orbitofrontal cortex]] cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd A. Hare ''et al.'' use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare’s study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC.&lt;ref name="Hare 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=646–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1168450 |title=Self-Control in Decision-Making Involves Modulation of the vmPFC Valuation System |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=T. A. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. F. |last3=Rangel |first3=A. |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5927 |pmid=19407204|bibcode=2009Sci...324..646H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcomes as determining whether a choice is made===

[[Alexandra W. Logue]] is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made.  Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self-control.  A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses.

Outcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes.  There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value.  Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision.

Finally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises.  For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice.  Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action.  A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time.  When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning.  Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] studied [[locus of control]] and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level.  Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B., (1975) A Specific Study of the Effects of Three Modes of Counseling on the Academic Achievement and Internal External Locus of Control of High-Risk College Freshmen.

===Physiology of behavior===

Many things affect one's ability to exert self-control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient [[glucose]] levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Gailliot M.T., Baumeister R.F., DeWall C.

Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose.&lt;ref name=GailliotBaumeister2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beedie|first=Christopher|author2=Andrew M. Lane |title=The Role of Glucose in Self-Control: Another Look at the Evidence and an Alternative Conceptualization|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=May 2012|volume=16|issue=2|pages=143–153|accessdate=2012-10-20|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51624108_The_role_of_glucose_in_self-control_another_look_at_the_evidence_and_an_alternative_conceptualization/file/d922b4f7237654925c.pdf|doi=10.1177/1088868311419817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Mischel Experiments ==
In the 1960s, [[Walter Mischel]] tested four-year-old children for self-control in "The Marshmallow Test": the children were each given a [[marshmallow]] and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W., Shoda, Yth the members of the original study whom he was able to find. His reported results appear to show that the life-expectancy of the group was more strongly correlated with their assessed self-control level than anything else&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the book "The Attitude Factor" by Thomas Blakeslee&lt;/ref&gt;

A strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on "hot" and "cool" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's "cool features" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The "hot features" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self-control is more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Casey |first=B.J |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=May 28, 2011 |volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14998–5003 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1108561108 |pmid=21876169 |last2=Somerville |first2=L.

Years later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40's. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Patricia |title=At the Vortex of Self-Control: [The Arts/Cultural Desk] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Self-control was also negatively correlated with [[sociotropy]]&lt;ref name="sato-2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sato | first1 = T. | last2 = Harman | first2 = B.

== Ego depletion ==
{{main article|Ego depletion}}

There's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt;. However, belief that will-power is infinite &lt;ref&gt;journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610384745&lt;/ref&gt; or self-reinforcing &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function.

Exerting self-control through the [[executive functions]] in [[decision making]] is held in some theories to [[ego depletion|deplete]] one's ability to do so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vohs KD, Baumeister RF, Schmeichel BJ, Twenge JM, Nelson NM, Tice DM |title=Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: a limited-resource account of decision making, f-regulation, and active initiative |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=883–98 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18444745 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.883 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp945883.pdf|format=PDF|last2=Baumeister |last3=Schmeichel |last4=Twenge |last5=Nelson |last6=Tice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual’s self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author = Hagger M.S., Wood C., Stiff C., Chatzisarantis N.L. | title = Ego depletion and the strength model of self control: A meta-analysis |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 136| issue = 4 | pages = 495–525 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1037/a0019486 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=e1c32b5b-858d-4cd4-88de-266f63ddb869%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWNvb2tpZSxpcCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zODQxOTIzOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=2010-12718-004 | pmid=20565167| last2 = Wood | last3 = Stiff | last4 = Chatzisarantis }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author =Denson, T.F., Capper, M.

One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujita|first=Kentaro|author2=Trope, Yaacov |author3=Liberman, Nira |author4= Levin-Sagi, Maya |title=Construal levels and self-control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=90|issue=3|pages=351–367|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.3.351|pmid=16594824 |pmc=3153425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from "not at all bad" to "very bad." The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006" /&gt; This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long-term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.

== Kelly McGonigal's approach ==

[[Kelly McGonigal]] defines willpower as "the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it." It consists of three competing elements: 1) I will – the ability to do what you need to do; 2) I won’t – the other side of self-control; the ability to resist temptation; and 3) I want – your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"&gt;McGonigal, K. (2012). The willpower instinct: How self-control works, why it matters and what you can do to get more of it.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt; Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"/&gt;

'''Shangri-La''' is a fictional place described in the 1933 [[novel]] ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' by British author [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]]. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a [[lamasery]], enclosed in the western end of the [[Kunlun Mountains]]. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, particularly a mythical Himalayan [[utopia]] – a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. In the novel, the people who live at Shangri-La are almost immortal, living hundreds of years beyond the normal lifespan and only very slowly aging in appearance. The name also evokes the imagery of the [[exoticism]] of [[the Orient]].

In the ancient Tibetan scriptures, the existence of seven such places is mentioned as ''Nghe-Beyul Khembalung''.&lt;ref name="National Park brochure"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shrestha |first=Dr. Tirtha Bahadur |author2=Joshi, Rabindra Man |author3=Sangam, Khagendra
|title=The Makalu-Barun National Park &amp; Buffer Zone Brochure |publisher=Makalu-Barun National Park |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khembalung is one of several ''[[beyul]]s'' (hidden lands similar to Shangri-La) believed to have been created by [[Padmasambhava]] in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century as idyllic, sacred places of refuge for Buddhists during times of strife (Reinhard, 1978).

==Etymology==
The phrase "Shangri-La" most probably comes from the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''{{lang|bo|ཞང་}}'',"Shang" – a district of [[Ü-Tsang]], north of [[Tashilhunpo]]&lt;ref&gt;Chandra Das – Tibetan English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;" + ''{{lang|bo|རི}}'', pronounced "ri", "Mountain" = "Shang Mountain" + ''{{lang|bo|ལ}}'', Mountain Pass, which suggests that the area is accessed to, or is named by, "Shang Mountain Pass".

While the name Shangri-La is of relatively recent origin, the concept previously existed.
* Some scholars believe that the Shangri-La story owes a literary debt to [[Shambhala]], a mythical kingdom in Tibetan [[Buddhist]] tradition, which was sought by Eastern and Western explorers.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"&gt;{{cite book |last=LePage |first=Victoria |authorlink= |year=1996|title=Shambhala: The Fascinating Truth Behind The Myth Of Shangri-La |edition=|url= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have debunked the myth of Shangri-La and argued that this has less to do with an unexplored place and is more connected to a fantasy of the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Peter (1989).

In China, the poet [[Tao Yuanming]] of the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265–420&amp;nbsp;CE) described a kind of Shangri-La in his work ''[[The Peach Blossom Spring|The Tale of the Peach Blossom Spring]]'' ({{zh|t=桃花源記|p=Táohuā Yuán Jì}}). The story goes that there was a fisherman from [[Wuling]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}}, who came across a beautiful peach grove, and he discovered happy and content people who lived completely cut off from the troubles in the outside world since the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–207&amp;nbsp;BCE).&lt;ref name="Peach Colony"&gt;{{cite web

[[Shambhala]] is a core concept in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] that describes a realm of harmony between man and nature that is also connected with the Kalachakra or "wheel of time". The Shambhala ideal is described in detail in the [[Shambhala Sutra]], a historical text written by the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth Panchen Lama (1737–1780)]] which describes some of the Shambhala locations as being in [[Ngari]], the western prefecture of [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition&gt;[[Laurence Brahm|Brahm, Laurence]]. (2004). ''Shambhala Sutrah'' (film expedition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"&gt;Stein, R. A. (1972). ''Tibetan Civilization'', pp.&amp;nbsp;88–89. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-0806-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|0-8047-0901-7}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore from the [[Altai Mountains]] describe [[Gora Belukha|Mount Belukha]] as a gateway to [[Shambhala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-asia/mysteries-kingdom-shambhala-001529|title=Mysteries of the Kingdom of Shambhala|first=|last=aprilholloway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kun Lun Mountains]] (崑崙山) offer another possible place for valleys like the Shangri-La, since Hilton specifically described the “Kuen-Lun” mountains as its likely location in the book, however, Hilton is not known to have visited or studied the area.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Parts of the [[Kun Lun Mountains|Kun Lun]] lie within [[Ngari]], mentioned in the [[Shambhala]] Sutra.&lt;ref name="LePage_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_1972"/&gt;

===Possible sources for Hilton===
In a ''New York Times'' interview in 1936, Hilton states that he used "Tibetan material" from the [[British Museum]], particularly the travelogue of two French priests, [[Evariste Regis Huc]] and [[Joseph Gabet]], to provide the Tibetan cultural and Buddhist spiritual inspiration for Shangri-La.&lt;ref name="McRae"&gt;Michael McRae. (2002). ''The Siege of Shangri-La: The Quest for Tibet's Sacred Hidden Paradise''. New York: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;B.R. Crisler. (1936). Film gossip of the week. ''The New York Times'', 26&amp;nbsp;July 1936, section&amp;nbsp;9, page&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Huc and Gabet travelled a roundtrip between Beijing and Lhasa in 1844–1846 on a route more than {{convert|250|km}} north of Yunnan. Their famous travelogue, first published in French in 1850,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc. (1850). ''Souvenirs d'un&amp;nbsp;voyage dans la&amp;nbsp;Tartarie, le&amp;nbsp;Thibet et la&amp;nbsp;Chine pendant les&amp;nbsp;annees 1844, 1845, et 1846''. Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; went through many editions in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Mille. (1953). A selective survey of literature on Tibet. ''American Political Science Review'', 47&amp;nbsp;(4): 1135–1151.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular "condensed translation" was published in England in 1928,&lt;ref&gt;Evariste Regis Huc &amp; Joseph Gabet. (1928). ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China, 1844–1846''. Edited and translated by William Hazlitt. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; at the time that Hilton would have been gathering inspiration for – or perhaps writing – ''Lost Horizon''.

===Current claimants===
Today various places, such as parts of southern [[Kham]] in northwestern [[Yunnan]] province, including the tourist destinations of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]]{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and Zhongdian, claim the title. In modern China, [[Zhongdian]] county was renamed Xiānggélǐlā (香格里拉, Shangri-La in Chinese) in 2001, to attract tourists.

Hilton visited the [[Hunza Valley]] in northern [[Pakistan]], close to the Chinese border, a few years before ''Lost Horizon'' was published; hence it is a popularly believed inspiration for Hilton's physical description of Shangri-La.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Shangri-la Valley |date=20 June 2006 |accessdate=2006-07-29 |publisher=Adventure Tours Pakistan |url=http://www.atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083212/http://atp.com.pk/tours/Shangri-La%20Valley.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being an isolated green valley surrounded by mountains, enclosed on the western end of the Himalayas, it closely matches the description in the novel; also, in an ironic reversal on the story, due to increased exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation, inhabitants of the high-altitude parts of the valley appear to age quickly.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, because the Hunza Valley does not have [[Tibetan culture]] and lacks Buddhist religion, it could not have been the inspiration for the cultural context for Hilton's [[Lost Horizon|story]].

Places like [[Sichuan]] and [[Tibet]] also claim the real Shangri-La was in its{{where|date=January 2014}} territory. In 2001, [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] put forward a proposal that the three regions optimise all Shangri-La tourism resources and promote them as one. After failed attempts to establish a China Shangri-la Ecological Tourism Zone in 2002 and 2003, government representatives of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region signed a declaration of co-operation in 2004. Also in 2001, [[Zhongdian]] County in northwestern [[Yunnan]] officially renamed itself [[Shangri-La County]].

===Recent searches and documentaries===
American explorers [[Ted Vaill]] and [[Peter Klika]] visited the [[Muli Tibetan Autonomous County|Muli]] area of southern [[Sichuan Province]] in 1999, and claimed that the Muli [[monastery]] in this remote region was the model for James Hilton's Shangri-La, which they thought Hilton learned about from articles on this area in several ''National Geographic'' magazine articles in the late 1920s and early 1930s written by Austrian-American explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/tibet/1402958/Could-this-be-the-way-to-Shangri-La.html "Could This Be the Way to Shangri-La?"] by Timothy Carroll (29&amp;nbsp;July 2002). ''Electronic Telegraph''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaill completed a film based on their research, "Finding Shangri-La", which debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. However, Michael McRae unearthed an obscure James Hilton interview from a ''[[New York Times]]'' gossip column where he reveals his cultural inspiration for Shangri-La and, if it is any place, it is more than 250&amp;nbsp;km north of Muli on the route travelled by Huc and Gabet.&lt;ref name="McRae"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Between 2002–2004 a series of expeditions were led by author and film maker Laurence Brahm in western China which determined that the Shangri-La mythical location in Hilton's book ''[[Lost Horizon]]'' was based on references to northern [[Yunnan]] Province from articles published by National Geographic's first resident explorer [[Joseph Rock]].&lt;ref name=Brahm_film_expedition/&gt;

On 2&amp;nbsp;December 2010, [[OPB]] televised one of [[Martin Yan]]'s ''[[Hidden China]]'' episodes, "Life in Shangri-La", in which Yan said that "Shangri-La" is the actual name of a [[Shangri-La County|real town]] in the hilly and mountainous region in northwestern [[Yunnan]] Province, frequented by both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and Tibetan locals. Martin Yan visited arts and craft shops, local farmers as they harvest crops, and sampled their cuisine.

Television presenter and historian [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], in the "Shangri-La" episode of the BBC documentary series ''In Search of Myths and Heroes'', suggests that the legendary Shangri-La is the abandoned city of [[Tsaparang]] in upper [[Satluj]] valley, and that its two great temples were once home to the kings of [[Guge]] in modern Tibet.
The Travel Channel recently aired an episode of Expedition Unknown that followed host Josh Gates to Nepal and its surrounding areas in search of Shangri-La. His findings are not necessarily proof that Shangri-La is or was real. However, the sky caves that are found do represent some interesting facts.

{{references|section|date=November 2018}}
{{originalresearch|section|date=November 2018}}
[[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" contains the following lyrics: "Like Shangri-La beneath the summer moon / I will return again / As the dust that floats finds you / We're movin' through Kashmir."

"Shangri-La" is a song written by Ray Davies of The Kinks. The song appeared on the 1969 concept album, ''[[Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)]]''. The song's inspiration can be traced back to when the band visited the Davies brothers' sister, Rose, and her family in Australia, the "designed community" that the family lived in serving as the initial lyrical inspiration.

Shangri-La also appears in the Oasis song "Idler's Dream", B-side to ''[[The Hindu Times]]''. The lyrics appear as: 
"And as I close my eyes,
And the sky turns red
I realise just what you are.
You're an idler's dream,
and you're singing Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la
Shangri-la."

"Going to Shangri-La" is a song from Atlanta Rhythm Section

“This is Shangri-La” is a song on the album [[Apple (album)|''Apple'']] by [[Mother Love Bone]].

On 15 May 2017, Korean boyband [[VIXX]] released their song "Shangri-La" together with their 4th mini album, which has the same name.

The AC/DC song "Sin City" on the 1978 ''Powerage'' album, Shangri-la is mentioned with the lyrics "Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangrila"

Shangri-La is mentioned in the song “[[Dr. Feelgood (song)|Dr. Feelgood]]” by [[Mötley Crüe]], from the album of the same name. Shangri-La is included in the lyric “He’ll tell you he’s the king of these Barrio streets, movin’ up to Shangri-La”.

[[Stevie Nicks]]’ solo album ''[[Trouble in Shangri-La]]'' was released on May 1, 2001. Cover art features an oriental setting showing Nicks with her back to the camera looking out over an ocean.

English rock band [[Arctic Monkeys]] mentioned Shangri-La in the song "[[Suck It and See]]", from their fourth studio album, released on 6 June 2011 by Domino Recording Company. The lyrics appear as: 
"Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh"

==Usage==
Shangri-La is often used in a similar context to "[[Garden of Eden]]," to represent a paradise hidden from modern man. It is sometimes used as an analogy for a lifelong quest or something elusive that is much sought. For a man who spends his life obsessively looking for a cure to a disease, such a cure could be said to be that man's "Shangri-La." It also might be used to represent perfection that is sought by man in the form of love, happiness, or [[Utopia]]n ideals. It may be used in this context alongside other mythical and famous examples of somewhat similar metaphors such as [[El Dorado]], [[The Fountain of Youth]], and [[The Holy Grail]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Founding Member ===
McNamee is a founder, board member and vice president of the Taos Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Institute|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taos Institute is a nonprofit educational organization dedicated to the development of social constructionist theory and practices for purposes of world benefit. With over two hundred Associates around the world, the Taos Institute achieves their educational ends through conferences, workshops, publications, a Ph.D. program, distance learning programs, newsletters, learning networks, and web-based offerings. The Taos Institute also engages in [[collaborative partnership]]s with other national and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Constructionist theory and practice locates the source of meaning, value, and action in relational process.  Through our shared constructions of the real, the rational and the good, communities are formed and ways of life secured.  New ways of life can also be envisioned and created through relational processes. And when communities conflict, it is also through such process that peace may best be restored.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taos Mission Statement|url=http://www.taosinstitute.net/Websites/taos/images/AboutAbout/taos_mission_statement.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
Awards received by McNamee include Class of 1944 Professorship at the University of New Hampshire (2001-2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unh.edu/news/news_releases/2001/september/em_20010907mcnamee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Lindberg Award for Outstanding Scholar/Teacher in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire (2007–2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lindberg Award|url=http://www.unh.edu/liberal-arts/faculty/lindberg_2007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Sheila was added to the Fulbright Specialists Roster (2012-2017) and received a Fulbright Specialist Grant to work with faculty and students at the University of Caldas in Manizales, Colombia (May–June, 2012), exploring social constructionist theory and practice in social work, family development, social sciences, social research, conflict resolution, and mediation.
&lt;br /&gt;
:''"Rather than approach conflict and problem solving with the goal of minimizing differences among perspectives and working toward consensus, we must develop processes for creating a system of co-existence and collaboration that entails incommensurate but respected positions of difference. If you understand how communication creates a way of seeing the world, you can understand how those different views are internally coherent; starting from this position, we invite ourselves and others to become curious about our differences (first) rather than judgmental."'' said McNamee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universidad de Caldas Press Release|url=http://www.ucaldas.edu.co/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7270:-sheila-mcnamee-comparte-su-experiencia-en-comunicacion-en-u-de-caldas&amp;catid=419:universidad-al-dia&amp;Itemid=1039|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Author ===

Sheila McNamee is the author of several books on social construction.

Sheila co-authored ''Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue'' (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relational Responsibility: Resources for Sustainable Dialogue|year=1999|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-1094-8|author=Sheila McNamee|author2=Kenneth J. Gergen }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Kenneth Gergen. In ''Relational Responsibility'', Sheila and Ken question the tradition of individual responsibility and transform the concept of responsibility by giving centre stage to the relational process rather than to the individual - replacing alienation and isolation with meaningful dialogue.

McNamee co-authored ''Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Social Change: A Relational Constructionist Approach|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-80671-8|author=McNamee, S.|author2=Hosking, D.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2012) with Dian Marie Hosking. In this book, Sheila and Dian Marie bridge scholarly forms of inquiry and practitioners’ daily activities. They introduce inquiry as a process of relational construction, offering resources to practitioners who want to reflect on how their work generates practical effects. Sheila and Diane Marie lay out relational constructionist premises and explore these in terms of their generative possibilities both for inquiry and social change work.

{{SikhBeliefs}}
'''Simran''' ({{lang-pa|ਸਿਮਰਨ}}, {{lang-hi|सिमरण, सिमरन }}) is a Punjabi word derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa|स्मरण}} (''smaraṇa'', "the act of remembrance, reminiscence, and recollection") which leads to the realization of what may be the highest aspect and purpose in one's life. It is the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God, thus used for introducing [[spirituality]]. This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oshoworld.com/discourses/audio_hindi.asp?album_id=36 Ek Omkaar Satnam Audio Discourse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gurmukhi ==

''Simran'' is a commonly used term as a verb in [[Gurmukhi]], which refers to 'meditating' of the [[Nām]], the ultimate feeling of Ultimate. Sikhism is a distinct contemporary faith, whereby the Realization of God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals that have recently become the business of avaricious priests and that would impede the pure search for truth in Sikhism.

It says in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] that through Simran one is purified and attains [[salvation]] or '[[Moksha|mukti]]'. This is because 'si-mar' means 'to die over', thus indicating to death of ego, allowing truth [[two truths|ultimate truth]] or [[Sat (Sanskrit)|sat]] to appear.

On page 202 of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], [[Guru]]ji writes:

{{Quote|Meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace.&lt;br&gt;(simar simar sukh paa-i-aa.) }}

This hymn teaches a person who wishes to gain from this human life, one must attain a higher spiritual state by become free of attachment by realizing that all that is, is empty. Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and [[two truths|ultimate truth]] to the person who earnestly seeks it:

[[Guru Ram Das]] says in ''Sarang ki var'' ([[Guru Granth Sahib]], 1242):

{{Quote|[[Nām]], the incorruptible is beyond our comprehending.

At the same time, it is our constant companion and preserves all creation. Therefore, truth will disclose itself unto us and lets us perceive it in our hearts. It is through earnestness that we can meet with such a truth.|}}

== Sant Mat ==

In [[Sant Mat]] the word Simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the [[mantra]] given by the [[Satguru]] during [[initiation]]. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during [[meditation]] and also outside it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kirpalsingh-teachings.org/index.php/en/books-sant-kirpal-singh/jap-ji-the-message-of-guru-nanak/602-simran-what-it-means-and-its-uses.html Simran What it means and its uses], by [[Kirpal Singh]].&lt;/ref&gt; however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due to breaking out of monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only till the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.

'''Social protection''', as defined by the [[United Nations Research Institute For Social Development]], is concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people’s [[well being]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating [[Poverty]] and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social protection consists of policies and programs designed to reduce [[poverty]] and vulnerability by promoting efficient [[labour market]]s, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to manage economic and social risks, such as [[unemployment]], [[social exclusion|exclusion]], sickness, [[disability]] and old age.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank. 2001. Social Protection Sector Strategy Paper: From Safety Net to Springboard. Washington DC, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common types of social protection:

*'''Labor market interventions''' are policies and programs designed to promote employment, the efficient operation of labor markets and the protection of workers.
*'''[[Social insurance]]''' mitigates risks associated with unemployment, ill health, disability, work-related injury and old age, such as health insurance or unemployment insurance.
*'''[[Social safety net|Social assistance]]''' is when resources, either cash or in-kind, are transferred to vulnerable individuals or households with no other means of adequate support, including single parents, the homeless, or the physically or mentally challenged.

==History of social protection==
Traditionally, social protection has been used in the [[European welfare state]] and other parts of the developed world to maintain a certain living standard, and address transient poverty.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combati
ng Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first examples of state-provided social protection can be tracked to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]], who expanded a program for free grain to include more poor citizens of the empire. In addition, he instituted public funds to support poor children.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Mason.  “Trajan”. Encyclopædia Britannica.  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/602150/Trajan#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Trajan%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Organized [[welfare]] was not common until the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  It was during this period that in both Germany and Great Britain, welfare systems were established to target the working classes (see [[National Insurance]]).&lt;ref&gt;“The Liberal reforms 1906-1914”.  BBC. http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/liberalreformsrev2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The United States followed several years later, during the [[Great Depression]], with emergency relief for those struck the hardest.  However, modern social protection has grown to envelop a much broader range of issues and purposes; it is now being used as a policy approach in developing nations, to address issues of persistent poverty and target structural causes.  Moreover, it is designed to lift recipients out of poverty, rather than exclusively providing passive protection against contingencies .&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD). 2010.  Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy and Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; social protection has rapidly been used in trying to reduce and ultimately eliminate poverty and suffering in developing countries (mostly in Africa), so to enhance and promote economic and social growth.

==Types of social protection==

===Labor market Interventions===
Labor market interventions, consisting of both active and passive policies, provide protection for the poor who are capable of gaining employment. Passive programs, such as unemployment insurance, income support and changes in labor legislation, allieviate the financial needs of the unemployed but are not designed to improve their employability.&lt;ref&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social-protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; A European Union-funded research as part of the DRIVERS project revealed a linear
relationship between investments in national active labour market policies (specifically those directed towards integrating vulnerable groups into employment) and quality of work. It found that European countries with more active labour market policies seem to have healthier, less stressed workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health-gradient.eu/lower-education-leads-to-a-more-stressful-working-life-labour-market-policies-can-mitigate-this/|title=Health Gradient - EuroHealthNet|website=health-gradient.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, active programs focus on directly increasing the access of unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. Labor. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]   (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/labor.asp)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Active labour market policies]] (ALMPs) are used to reduce the risk of unemployment and to increase the earnings capacity of workers.  ALMPs have two basic objectives: (1) economic, by increasing the ability of the unemployed to find jobs, and increase productivity and earnings; and (2) social, by improving the inclusion and participation of productive employment. These programs have the ability to increase employment opportunities and address the social problems that often accompany high unemployment.  Active policies are a way of reversing the negative effects of industrial restructuring in transition economies and to help integrate vulnerable people furthest from the labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/
EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html)&lt;/ref&gt;  ALMPs are often targeted to the long-term unemployed, workers in poor families, and particular groups with labor market disadvantages. These programs have important social, as well as economic, objectives.  Active labor market programs include a wide range of activities to stimulate employment and productivity such as:
*'''Employment services.''' These services include counseling, placement assistance, job matching, labor exchanges, and other related services to improve the functioning of the labor market.
*'''Job Training'''. This includes training/retraining for the unemployed, workers in mass layoffs and youth to increase the quantity of work supply.
*'''Direct employment generation''' The promotion of small and medium enterprises (e.g., public works projects, subsidies) to increase labor demand.&lt;ref&gt;Betcherman, G., Olivas, K. and Dar, A., 2004, ‘Impacts of Active Labor Market Programs: New Evidence from Evaluations with Particular Attention to Developing and Transition Countries’, Social Protection Discussion Paper Series no. 0402, World Bank, Washington&lt;/ref&gt;
A common issue in implementing successful labor market interventions is how to incorporate the informal economy, which comprises a significant portion of the workforce in developing countries.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Governance and Social Development Resource Centre. [Date accessed October 31, 2010]  (http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/social protection/types-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt; Informal employment comprises between half and three quarters of non-agricultural employment in the majority of these countries. The proportion of informal employment increases when agriculture is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;International Labour Organization. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.ilo.org/public/english/protection/secsoc/areas/policy/informal.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most informal workers are not covered by social security schemes, occupational safety and health measures, working conditions regulations and have limited access to health services and work-related measures of social protection.  Labor market interventions work to integrate the different strategies to prevent and compensate occupational and social risks in the informal economy.  The strategies that include measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, F., 2009, ‘Social Protection and the Informal Economy: Linkages and Good Practices for Poverty Reduction and Empowerment’, in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ‘Promoting Pro-Poor Growth: Social Protection’, OECD, Paris, pp.69-88&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, public expenditure on labor market policy (LMP) interventions falls within three main categories:
*'''Labor Market Services (1)''' 
*'''Total LMP Measures (2-7)'''
training (2),
job rotation &amp; job sharing (3),
employment incentives (4),
supported employment &amp; rehabilitation (5),
direct job creation (6),
start-up incentives (7),

*'''Total LMP supports (8-9)'''
out-of-work income maintenance and support (8),
early retirement (9)

===Social insurance===
{{Main|Social insurance}}
Social insurance schemes are contributory programs that protect beneficiaries from catastrophic expenses in exchange for regular payments of premiums.   Health costs can be very high, so health insurance schemes are a popular way reducing risk in the event of shock.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, an individual with low income may not be able to afford insurance.  Some argue that insurance schemes should be complemented with social assistance.   Community-based health insurance allows pooling in settings where institutional capacity is too weak to organize nationwide risk-pooling, especially in low-income countries, making insurance more affordable.  In risk-sharing schemes, the insurance premium is unrelated to the likelihood that the beneficiary will fall ill and benefits are provided on the basis of need.&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, M., 2002, ‘Reduction of Catastrophic Health Care Expenditures by a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme in Gujarat, India: Current Experiences and Challenges’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, vol. 80, no. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social assistance===
[[Social assistance]] schemes comprise programs designed to help the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable individuals]] ( i.e., those with no other means of support such as single parent households, victims of natural disasters or civil conflict, handicapped people, or the destitute poor), households and communities to meet a [[Social floor]] and improve living standards.  These programs consist of all forms of public action, government and non-government, that are designed to transfer resources, either cash or in-kind (e.g. food transfers), to eligible vulnerable and deprived persons.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, F., 2001, 'Social Assistance - Theoretical Background', in 'Social Protection in the Asia and Pacific', ed. I. Ortiz, Asian Development Bank, Manila, ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  Social assistance interventions may include:
*'''[[Welfare]] and social services''' to highly vulnerable groups such as the physically or mentally disabled, orphans, or substance abusers.
*'''Cash or in-kind transfers''' such as [[Ration stamp|food stamps]] and family allowances.
*'''Temporary subsidies''' such as life-line tariffs, housing subsidies, or support of lower prices of staple food in times of crisis.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Asian Development Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://www.adb.org/SocialProtection/default.asp)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==Policy issues==

===Universalism vs. Targeting===
There are two main schools of thought concerning scope of social protection.  Universalism argues that each person, by merit of simply being a citizen should be entitled to benefits from social protection programs.  Such a policy would avoid [[means-testing]] and any conditionalities such as work requirements.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;   One of the greatest benefits to this policy perspective is social solidarity, since everyone contributes collaboratively to a system that everyone also benefits from.  [[Social security]] is one such example.  Moreover, economists have argued that universalism is an investment in human capital that aids the development of a nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Mares, I. 2007. “The economic consequences of the welfare state”.  International Social Security Review, Vol. 60, No. 2/3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; considers social protection from this perspective, describing existing schemes around the world and presenting simulation data on the potential costs.
Opponents would argue that universalism is cost-ineffective and unfairly distorts individual efforts. Such an argument points toward targeting as a better solution.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Sen, Amartya. 1999. Development as Freedom. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a case, the question arises of who should be the target population that receives benefits from social programs.

===Targeting income vs. capabilities===
Net income is the simplest method of determining a needy population.  Some states use a [[Guaranteed Minimum Income]] system, in which all members of a state receive sufficient income to live on, so long as they meet certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;“History of Basic Income”.  Basic Income Earth Network. http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html#history {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621140909/http://www.basicincome.org/bien/aboutbasicincome.html |date=2008-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the [[capabilities approach]] argue that income is easier to misrepresent, and moreover, fails to target the root causal factors of poverty.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Hence, they recommend targeting a minimum level of basic capabilities that will impact [[quality of life]], such as institutional improvements like health and education. Policy examples might include a [[social floor]].&lt;ref&gt;ILO Social Protection Floors Recommendation No. 202 (2012) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:3065524 ILO Recommendation No. 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of provision===
Social protection is an expensive and difficult endeavor, by any means; the question remains how best to implement programs that effectively aid the people who need it the most.  Currently, there are a number of mechanisms that provide social protection in various nations. These policies and instruments vary according to country context. In some nations, governments are strongly involved in the provision of social protection, following a [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.  There are also nations which are characterized by dualism, in which there is state-provided protection for those who work in the formal sector, but little to no protection for those who work in the [[informal sector]].  Finally, there are nations in which the economy is largely agrarian, and a great majority of the population works in the informal economy.  In those countries that have only residual social protection coverage and weak state capacity,social protection is mainly provided by non-governmental means such as kin, [[NGO]]s, and individual philanthropic donations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==National programs==

===Developmentalism===
In [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the government provides extensive support for public programs, following the [[developmentalism]] model, in which social protection is seen as a tool to promote economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Kwon, Huck-Ju. 2009. “The reform of the developmental welfare state in East Asia”. International Journal of Social Welfare.  Volume 18, pages S12–S21, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualism===
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[South Africa]], there is a dualist structure of protected formal sector workers and marginalized informal sector workers.,&lt;ref&gt;Lo Vuolo, Barbeito. 1998. Models of stratification via pension policy. The case of Argentina. LASA Conference, Nov. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo, José Antonio. 2008. “The Latin American Economic Boom”Revista de Ciencia Política, Volume 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrarian-Informal===
In nations such as [[India]] and [[Tanzania]], governments struggle to provide adequate social protection, and citizens must instead depend on non-state actors and informal provisioning.

==Donor approaches==
International donors and organizations have influenced social protection approaches both at the level of policy discourse and program design and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;See Brunori and O'Reilly (2011) for a review(http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/29495/)&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though The World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) are the major donors and the lead organizations in the field, other organizations are also concerned with social protection.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton(http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/a-global-review-of-social-protection)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The World Bank]] is a source of financial and technical assistance for developing countries. In order to identify social risks and potential responses, The World Bank developed a tool called “[[Social Risk Management]]” (SRM).  The SRM framework includes interventions that focus on managing risks before shocks occur.  It is based on two assessments: (1) the poor are most exposed to diverse risks, and (2) the poor have the fewest tools to deal with these risks.  The main elements of the SRM framework are:
*''Risk reduction'' measures that focus on reducing risks in the labor market.
*''Risk mitigation'' measures to deal with anticipated shock.
*''Risk coping'' mechanisms to relieve the impact of risk after its occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank. Social Protection. [Date accessed October 31, 2010] (http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSOCIALPROTECTION/EXTLM/0,,contentMDK:20223809~menuPK:7109967~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:390615,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) brings 30 democratic countries together to seek answers to common problems and coordinate domestic and international policies.  The [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) of the OECD is responsible for the Poverty Network (POVNET) that has become very influential on policy development.  The DAC-POVNET focuses on the following areas:
*Poverty reduction
*[http://www.oecd.org/document/1/0,3746,en_2649_34621_36573761_1_1_1_1,00.html Pro-poor growth]

The [[International Labour Organization]], which covers both issues of social security and labor protection, has been the [[United Nations]] agency responsible for setting norms and standards at work.  Currently the ILO focuses, amongst others, on the following strategies: 
*Extending social protection to all
*Promoting decent working conditions
*Providing programs for informal and migrant workers &lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. and Kabeer, N., 2009, ‘Socio-economic Security over the Life Course: A Global Review of Social Protection’, Institute of Development Studies, Brighton&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The word ‘dynamics’ appears frequently in discussions and writing about strategy, and is used in two distinct, though equally important senses.

The '''dynamics of strategy and performance''' concerns the ‘content’ of strategy – initiatives, choices, policies and decisions adopted in an attempt to improve performance, and the results that arise from these managerial behaviors.

The '''dynamic model of the strategy process''' is a way of understanding how strategic actions occur. It recognizes that [[strategic planning]] is dynamic, that is, strategy-making involves a complex pattern of actions and reactions. It is partially planned and partially unplanned.

A literature search shows the first of these senses to be both the earliest and most widely used meaning of ‘strategy dynamics’, though that is not to diminish the importance of the dynamic view of the strategy process.

== Static models of strategy and performance ==

The static assessment of strategy and performance, and its tools and frameworks dominate research, 
textbooks and practice in the field. They stem from a presumption dating back to before the 1980s that market and industry conditions determine how firms in a sector perform on average, and the scope for any firm to do better or worse than that average. E.g. the airline industry is notoriously unprofitable, but some firms are spectacularly profitable exceptions.

The ‘industry forces’ paradigm was established most firmly by [[Michael Porter]], (1980) in his seminal book ‘Competitive Strategy’, the ideas of which still form the basis of strategy analysis in many consulting firms and investment companies.
[[Richard Rumelt]] (1991) was amongst the first to challenge this presumption of the power of ‘industry forces’, and it has since become well understood that business factors are more important drivers of performance than are industry factors – in essence, this means you can do well in difficult industries, and struggle in industries where others do well. Although the relative importance of industry factors and firm-specific factors continues to be researched, the debate is now essentially over – management of strategy matters.

The increasing interest in how some businesses in an industry perform better than others led to the emergence of the ‘[[resource based view]]’ (RBV) of strategy ([[Birger Wernerfelt|Wernerfelt]], 1984;  Barney, 1991; [[Robert McQueen Grant|Grant]], 1991), which seeks to discover the firm-specific sources of superior performance – an interest that has increasingly come to dominate research.

== The need for a dynamic model of strategy and performance ==

The debate about the relative influence of industry and business factors on performance, and the RBV-based explanations for superior performance both, however, pass over a more serious problem. This concerns exactly what the ‘performance’ ''is'' that management seeks to improve. Would you prefer, for example, (A) to make $15m per year indefinitely, or (B) $12m this year, increasing by 20% a year, starting with the same resources?

Nearly half a century ago, [[Edith Penrose]] (1959) pointed out that superior profitability (e.g. return on sales or return on assets) was neither interesting to investors – who value the prospect of increasing future cash flows – nor sustainable over time. Profitability is not entirely unimportant – it does after all provide the investment in new resources to enable growth to occur. More recently, [[Rugman]] and [[Verbeke]] (2002) have reviewed the implications of this observation for research in strategy. [[Richard Rumelt]] (2007) has again raised the importance of making progress with the issue of strategy dynamics, describing it as still ‘the next frontier … underresearched, underwritten about, and underunderstood’.

The essential problem is that tools explaining why firm A performs better than firm B at a point in time are unlikely to explain why firm B is growing its performance more rapidly than firm A.

This is not just of theoretical concern, but matters to executives too – efforts by the management of firm B to match A’s profitability could well destroy its ability to grow profits, for example. A further practical problem is that many of the static frameworks do not provide sufficiently fine-grained guidance on strategy to help raise performance. For example, an investigation that identifies an attractive opportunity to serve a specific market segment with specific products or services, delivered in a particular way is unlikely to yield fundamentally different answers from one year to the next. Yet strategic management has much to do from month to month to ensure the business system develops strongly so as to take that opportunity quickly and safely.
What is needed, is a set of tools that explain how performance changes over time, and how to improve its future trajectory – i.e. a dynamic model of strategy and performance. 
&lt;!----------------------------------PICTURE------------------------------------&gt;
&lt;div style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;[[Image:Why Where How performance over time.png|alt text {20}x{20}px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;

==A possible dynamic model of strategy and performance==

To develop a dynamic model of strategy and performance requires components that explain how factors change over time. Most of the relationships on which business analysis are based describe relationships that are static and stable over time. For example, “profits = revenue minus costs”, or “market share = our sales divided by total market size” are relationships that are true. Static strategy tools seek to solve the strategy problem by extending this set of stable relationships, e.g. “profitability = some complex function of product development capability”.
Since a company’s sales clearly change over time, there must be something further back up the causal chain that makes this happen. One such item is ‘customers’ – if the firm has more customers now than last month, then (everything else being equal), it will have more sales and profits.

The number of ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be calculated from anything else. It is one example of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or statistical observation, but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.
Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time:
* ''Time compression diseconomies'' i.e. it takes time to accumulate resources.
* ''Asset Mass Efficiencies'' ‘the more you have, the faster you can get more’..
* ''Interconnectedness of Asset Stocks'' .. building one resource depends on other resources already in place.
* ''Asset erosion'' .. tangible and intangible assets alike deteriorate unless effort and expenditure are committed to maintaining them
* ''Causal ambiguity'' .. it can be hard to work out, even for the firm who owns a resource, why exactly it accumulates and depletes at the rate it does.

The consequences of these features is that relationships in a business system are highly non-linear. Statistical analysis will not, then, be able meaningfully to confirm any causal explanation for the number of customers at any moment in time. If that is true then statistical analysis also cannot say anything useful about any performance that depends on customers or on other accumulating asset-stocks – which is always the case.

Fortunately, a method known as [[system dynamics]] captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).
The asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources [things we have] and capabilities [things we are good at doing]. This makes it possible to connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization [the ‘VRIO’ criteria] can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability. Yet day-to-day performance must reflect the simple, tangible resources such as customers, capacity and cash. VRIO resources may be important also, but it is not possible to trace a causal path from reputation or product development capability to performance outcomes without going via the tangible resources of customers and cash.

Warren (2002, 2007) brought together the specification of resources [tangible and intangible] and capabilities with the math of system dynamics to assemble a framework for strategy dynamics and performance with the following elements:
* Performance, ''P'', at time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', discretionary management choices, ''M'', and exogenous factors, ''E'', at that time (Equation 1).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(1)	''P''(''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'')'', ''M''(''t''), ''E''(''t'')} &lt;/div&gt;
* The current quantity of each resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t'' is its level at time ''t-1'' plus or minus any resource-flows that have occurred between ''t-1'' and ''t'' (Equation 2).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(2)	''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t'') = ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''t-1'') +/- &lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') &lt;/div&gt;
* The change in quantity of ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' between time ''t-1'' and time ''t'' is a function of the quantity of resources ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' at time ''t-1'', including that of resource ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' itself, on management choices, ''M'', and on exogenous factors ''E'' at that time (Equation 3).
&lt;div
style="float:center;width:350px;margin-left:2.3em;text-align:center"&gt;(3)	&lt;math&gt;\bigtriangleup&lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1'' .. ''t'') = f{''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), .. ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t-1''), ''M''(''t-1''), ''E''(''t-1'')} &lt;/div&gt;

This set of relationships gives rise to an ‘architecture’ that depicts, both graphically and mathematically, the core of how a business or other organization develops and performs over time. To this can be added other important extensions, including :
* the consequence of resources varying in one or more qualities or ‘attributes’ [e.g. customer size, staff experience]
* the development of resources through stages [disloyal and loyal customers, junior and senior staff]
* rivalry for any resource that may be contested [customers clearly, but also possibly staff and other factors]
* intangible factors [e.g. reputation, staff skills]
* capabilities [e.g. product development, selling]

== The Static Model of the Strategy Process ==

According to many introductory strategy textbooks, strategic thinking can be divided into two segments : strategy formulation and strategy implementation. Strategy formulation is done first, followed by implementation.

Strategy formulation involves:
# Doing a situation analysis: both internal and external; both micro-environmental and macro-environmental.
# Concurrent with this assessment, objectives are set. This involves crafting vision statements (long term), mission statements (medium term), overall corporate objectives (both financial and strategic), strategic business unit objectives (both financial and strategic), and tactical objectives.
#  These objectives should, in the light of the situation analysis, suggest a strategic plan. The plan provides the details of how to obtain these goals.
This three-step strategy formation process is sometimes referred to as determining where you are now, determining where you want to go, and then determining how to get there.

The next phase, according to this linear model is the implementation of the strategy. This involves:
* Allocation of sufficient resources (financial, personnel, time, computer system support)
* Establishing a chain of command or some alternative structure (such as [[cross-functional team]]s)
* Assigning responsibility of specific tasks or processes to specific individuals or groups
* Managing the process. This includes monitoring results, comparing to benchmarks and best practices, evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of the process, controlling for variances, and  making adjustments to the process as necessary.
* When implementing specific programs, this involves acquiring the requisite resources, developing the process, training, process testing, documentation, and integration with (and/or conversion from) legacy processes

==The Dynamic Model of the Strategy Process==

Several theorists have recognized a problem with this static model of the strategy process: it is not how strategy is developed in real life.  Strategy is actually a dynamic and interactive process. Some of the earliest challenges to the planned strategy approach came from [[Charles Lindblom|Linblom]] in the 1960s and [[James Brian Quinn|Quinn]] in the 1980s.

[[Charles Lindblom]] (1959) claimed that strategy is a fragmented process of serial and incremental decisions. He viewed strategy as an informal process of mutual adjustment with little apparent coordination.

[[James Brian Quinn]] (1978) developed an approach that he called "logical incrementalism". He claimed that strategic management involves guiding actions and events towards a conscious strategy in a step-by-step process. Managers nurture and promote strategies that are themselves changing. In regard to the nature of strategic management he says: "''Constantly integrating the simultaneous incremental process of strategy formulation and implementation is the central art of effective strategic management''." (page 145). Whereas Lindblom saw strategy as a disjointed process without conscious direction, Quinn saw the process as fluid but controllable.

Joseph Bower (1970) and [[Robert Burgelman]] (1980) took this one step further. Not only are strategic decisions made incrementally rather than as part of a grand unified vision, but according to them, this multitude of small decisions are made by numerous people in all sections and levels of the organization.

[[Henry Mintzberg]] (1978) made a distinction between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy. Emergent strategy originates not in the mind of the strategist, but in the interaction of the organization with its environment. He claims that emergent strategies tend to exhibit a type of convergence in which ideas and actions from multiple sources integrate into a pattern. This is a form of [[organizational learning]], in fact, on this view, organizational learning is one of the core functions of any business enterprise (See [[Peter Senge]]'s ''[[The Fifth Discipline]]'' (1990).)

[[Constantinos Markides]] (1999) describes strategy formation and implementation as an ongoing, never-ending, integrated process requiring continuous reassessment and [[reform]]ation.

A particularly insightful model of strategy process dynamics comes from [[J. Moncrieff]] (1999). He recognized that strategy is partially deliberate and partially unplanned, though whether the resulting performance is better for being planned or not is unclear. The unplanned element comes from two sources : “emergent strategies” result from the emergence of opportunities and threats in the environment and “Strategies in action” are ad hoc actions by many people from all parts of the organization. These multitudes of small actions are typically not intentional, not teleological, not formal, and not even recognized as strategic. They are emergent from within the organization, in much the same way as “emergent strategies” are emergent from the environment. However, it is again not clear whether, or under what circumstances, strategies would be better if more planned.

In this model, strategy is both planned and emergent, dynamic, and interactive. Five general processes interact. They are strategic intention, the organization's response to emergent environmental issues, the dynamics of the actions of individuals within the organization, the alignment of action with strategic intent, and strategic learning.

The alignment of action with strategic intent (the top line in the diagram), is the blending of strategic intent, emergent strategies, and strategies in action, to produce strategic outcomes. The continuous monitoring of these strategic outcomes produces strategic learning (the bottom line in the diagram). This learning comprises feedback into internal processes, the environment, and strategic intentions.  Thus the complete system amounts to a triad of continuously self-regulating feedback loops. Actually, quasi self-regulating is a more appropriate term since the feedback loops can be ignored by the organization. The system is self-adjusting only to the extent that the organization is prepared to learn from the strategic outcomes it creates. This requires effective leadership and an agile, questioning, corporate culture. In this model, the distinction between strategy formation and strategy implementation disappears.

==Criticisms of Dynamic Strategy Process Models==

Some detractors claim that these models are too complex to teach. No one will understand the model until they see it in action. Accordingly, the two part linear categorization scheme is probably more valuable in textbooks and lectures.

Also, there are some implementation decisions that do not fit a dynamic model. They include specific project implementations. In these cases implementation is exclusively tactical and often routinized. Strategic intent and dynamic interactions influence the decision only indirectly.

A '''superorganism''' or '''supraorganism''' (the latter is less frequently used but more [[etymologically]] correct)&lt;ref&gt;Lüttge, Ulrich (ed.); Cánovas, Francisco M. (ed.); Matyssek, Rainer (ed.). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mNBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA223 Progress in Botany 77]. Springer, 2016, p. 223. “Note that etymologically, the Latin word ‘supra’ means ‘higher’ in the sense of ordination, whereas ‘super’ implies a spatial order. Thus, in contrast to the mainly used notion of ‘superorganism’, we prefer to stay with the notion of a ‘supraorganism’.”&lt;/ref&gt; or '''extended organism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Scott Turner|Turner, J. Scott]] 2016. Semiotics of a superorganism. ''Biosemiotics'' 9: 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of [[Synergy|synergistically]] interacting organisms of the same [[species]]. A [[Community (ecology)|community]] of synergistically interacting organisms of different species is called a [[holobiont]].

==Concept==

The term superorganism is used most often to describe a [[social unit]] of [[eusociality|eusocial]] animals, where [[division of labour]] is highly specialised and where individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods.  [[Ants]] are the best-known example of such a superorganism. A superorganism can be defined as "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=98 |isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food and [[antipredator adaptation|avoiding predators]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Deneubourg JL, etal | year=1989 |title=The Self-Organizing Exploratory Pattern of the Argentine Ant |journal=[[Journal of lnsect Behavior]] |volume=3 |pages=159–168 |doi=10.1007/BF01417909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=O'Shea-Wheller TA, etal | year=2015 |title=Differentiated Anti-Predation Responses in a Superorganism|journal=[[PLOS ONE]] |volume=11 |page=e0141012 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or bees choosing a new nest site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Britton NF, etal | year=2002 |title=Deciding on a new home: how do honeybees agree?|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=269 |pages=1383–1388 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2001|pmc=1691030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superorganisms tend to exhibit [[homeostasis]], [[power law]] scaling, persistent disequilibrium and emergent behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://longnow.org/seminars/02014/nov/12/technium-unbound/ Technium Unbound, SALT The Long Now Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1789 by [[James Hutton]], the "father of geology", to refer to [[Earth]] in the context of [[geophysiology]]. The [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]],&lt;ref&gt;''Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth'', James Lovelock, Oxford University Press, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lynn Margulis]] as well as the work of Hutton, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] and [[Guy Murchie]], have suggested that the [[biosphere]] itself can be considered a superorganism, although this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |date=2013|title=On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view relates to [[systems theory]] and the dynamics of a [[complex system]].

The concept of a superorganism raises the question of what is to be considered an [[Individualism|individual]]. Toby Tyrrell's critique of the Gaia hypothesis argues that Earth's climate system does not resemble an animal's physiological system. Planetary biospheres are not tightly regulated in the same way that animal bodies are: "planets, unlike animals, are not products of evolution. Therefore we are entitled to be highly skeptical (or even outright dismissive) about whether to expect something akin to a "superorganism"". He concludes that "the superorganism analogy is unwarranted".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tyrrell |first=Toby |authorlink= |date= 2013|title= On Gaia: A Critical Investigation of the Relationship between Life and Earth |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9959.html |location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=209 |isbn=9780691121581 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Gaia is another systemic level of integration in Nature, precisely has properties that cannot be inferred from their components.&lt;ref&gt;Una revolución en la Evolución.

== In social theory ==

The nineteenth century thinker [[Herbert Spencer]] coined the term ''super-organic'' to focus on social organization (the first chapter of his ''Principles of [[Sociology]]'' is entitled "Super-organic Evolution"&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 1. "The Data of Sociology", Herbert Spencer, 1876&lt;/ref&gt;), though this was apparently a distinction between the organic and the social, ''not'' an identity: Spencer explored the [[holism in science|holistic]] nature of society as a [[social organism]] while distinguishing the ways in which society did not behave like an organism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Principles of Sociology'', Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter II, "A Society Is an Organism" (sections 222 and 223), Herbert Spencer, 1876&lt;/ref&gt; For Spencer, the super-organic was an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of interacting organisms, that is, human beings. And, as has been argued by D. C. Phillips, there is a "difference between emergence and reductionism".&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Thought in Social Science'', D. C. Phillips, Stanford University Press, 1976, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Carl Menger]] expanded upon the evolutionary nature of much social growth, but without ever abandoning [[methodological individualism]]. Many social institutions arose, Menger argued, not as "the result of socially teleological causes, but the unintended result of innumerable efforts of economic subjects pursuing 'individual' interests".&lt;ref&gt;''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics'', Carl Menger, Louis Schneider (translator), New York University Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer and Menger both argued that because it is individuals who choose and act, any social whole should be considered less than an organism, though Menger emphasized this more emphatically. Spencer used the organistic idea to engage in extended analysis of [[social structure]], conceding that it was primarily an analogy. So, for Spencer, the idea of the super-organic best designated a distinct level of [[social reality]] above that of biology and psychology, and not a one-to-one identity with an organism. Nevertheless, Spencer maintained that "every organism of appreciable size is a society", which has suggested to some that the issue may be terminological.&lt;ref&gt;''The Political Philosophy of Herbert Spencer'', Tim S. Gray, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''superorganic'' was adopted by the  anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns of Culture'', Ruth Benedict, Houghton Mifflin, 1934, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;  Social aspects of the superorganism concept are analysed in Marshall (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A. (2002).  ''[http://www.icpress.co.uk/books/histsci/p268.html The Unity of Nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706184310/http://www.icpress.co.uk/books/histsci/p268.html |date=2007-07-06 }}'', Imperial College Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, recent work in social psychology has offered the superorganism metaphor as a unifying framework to understand diverse aspects of human sociality, such as religion, conformity, and social identity processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kesebir, Selin.

==In cybernetics==

Superorganisms are important in [[cybernetics]], particularly [[biocybernetics]].  They exhibit a form of "distributed intelligence", a system in which many individual agents with limited intelligence and information are able to pool resources to accomplish a goal beyond the capabilities of the individuals. Existence of such [[behavior]] in organisms has many implications for military and management applications, and is being actively researched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Kevin |title=Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Boston |year=1994 |pages=251|isbn=0-201-48340-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If Col. Thorpe [of the US [[DARPA]]] has his way, the four divisions of the US military and hundreds of industrial subcontractors will become a single interconnected superorganism. The immediate step to this world of distributed intelligence is an engineering protocol developed by a consortium of defense simulation centers in Orlando Florida ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Table of Opposites''' ({{lang-el|συστοιχία}} ''sustoichia'')&lt;ref&gt;Barry Sandywell, ''Presocratic Reflexivity: The Construction of Philosophical Discourse c. 600-450 B.C.: Logological Investigations: Volume Three'', Routledge, 2002, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Pythagoras]] is the oldest surviving of many such tables propounded by philosophers.  [[Aristotle]] is the main source of our knowledge of the Pythagorean table.

Here follows a rough translation of the Table of Opposites, although like all translations the precise meaning does not necessarily carry over from the original Greek.  For example, "crooked" has connotations in English that it may lack in the original.

* finite, infinite
* odd, even
* one, many
* right, left
* rest, motion
* straight, crooked
* [[light and darkness|light, darkness]]
* [[good and evil|good, evil]]
* square, oblong

Some sources add:

* male, female

Of these nine or ten opposites, many philosophers have seized on the third pair as one of the most profound questions in philosophy.  Is the universe one?  Then how is it diverse?  Is the universe many?  Then how is it unified?  This has historically been known as the [[mereology|problem of the one and the many]], about which no small amount of ink has been spilled.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5894">'''Truthmaker theory''' is "the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth-ma/ Truthmaker Theory – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''truthmaker''' for a [[truthbearer]] is that entity in virtue of which the truthbearer is true. Philosophers have speculated on the question whether every truthbearer requires a truthmaker.  [[Parmenides]]' classic claim that what does not exist cannot be thought about has been read as a claim that every truthbearer must have a truthmaker, since otherwise the truthbearer is not ''about'' anything. A '''falsemaker''' for a [[proposition]] is that existent reality in virtue of which that proposition is false, assuming it is false.

==Overview==
In "Truth-Makers" (1984), Mulligan, Simons and Smith introduced the truth-maker idea as a contribution to the correspondence theory of truth. Logically atomic empirical sentences such as "John kissed Mary" have truthmakers, typically events or tropes corresponding to the main verbs of the sentences in question. Mulligan et al. explore extensions of this idea to sentences of other sorts, but they do not embrace any position of truthmaker maximalism, according to which every truthbearer has a truthmaker.

This maximalist position leads to philosophical difficulties, such as the question of what the truthmaker for an [[ethics|ethical]], [[modal logic|modal]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]] truthbearer could be. Of course someone who is deeply enough committed to truthmakers and who simultaneously doubts that a truthmaker could be found for a certain kind of truthbearer will simply deny that that truthbearer could be true. Those who find the Parmenidean insight sufficiently compelling often take it to be a particularly enlightening metaphysical pursuit to search for truthmakers of these kinds of propositions.

Another difficulty for the claim that every truthbearer has a truthmaker is with negations of [[existential proposition]]s (or, equivalently, [[universal proposition]]s). What ''entity'' makes it true that unicorns do not exist?  Proposals include the ''totality'' of all things, or some worldly state of affairs such as x1's not being a unicorn, x2's not being a unicorn, ..., and everything's being x1, or x2, or ... (the latter suggestion is due to Richard M. Gale).  

[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] has proposed a more moderate version of the truthmaker theory on which truthmakers are only required for positive propositions (e.g., there must be a truthmaker for the proposition that there are horses, but not for the equally true proposition that there are no unicorns). What makes a negative proposition ''p'' true is the ''lack'' of a [[falsemaker]] for it, i.e., the lack of a truthmaker for the negation of ''p''. Thus what makes it true that there are no unicorns is the lack of a truthmaker for the proposition that there ''are'' unicorns, i.e., the lack of unicorns. This may be what Protagoras was getting at when he said that to speak truly is to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not.

Truthmaker theorists differ as to what entities are the truthmakers of various truthbearers. Some say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting (assuming he is!) is ''Socrates' being seated'' (whatever exactly that might turn out to be on the correct ontology) and in general the truthmaker of the truthbearer expressed by a sentence ''s'' can be denoted by the [[participial nominalization]] of ''s''. Others will say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting is just ''Socrates'' himself. In any case, the truthmaker is supposed to be something ''concrete'', and on the first view is that whose existence is reported by the truthbearer and on the second view is that which the truthbearer is ''about''.

While the existence of truthmakers may seem an abstruse question, concrete instances are at the heart of a number of philosophical issues. Thus, J. L. Mackie has argued that the truthmakers of moral claims would be "queer entities", too strange to exist, and hence all moral claims are false. Alternatively, a [[Divine command theory|divine command]] [[metaethics|metaethicist]] may insist that the only possible candidate for a truthmaker of a moral claim is a command from a perfect God, and hence if moral claims are true and a truthmaker theory holds, then God exists. Thus the disagreement between various [[metaethics|metaethical]] schools is in part a disagreement over what kinds of truthmakers moral claims would have if these claims were true and over whether such truthmakers exist.

In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], '''ultrafinitism''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"&gt;International Workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity, ''Logic and Computational Complexity'', Springer, 1995, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict formalism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"&gt;St. Iwan (2000), "On the Untenability of Nelson's Predicativism", ''Erkenntnis'' '''53'''(1–2), pp. 147–154.&lt;/ref&gt; '''strict finitism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; '''actualism''',&lt;ref name="LCC"/&gt; '''predicativism''',&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with Russell's [[predicativism]].&lt;/ref&gt; and '''strong finitism''')&lt;ref name="Iwan"/&gt; is a form of [[finitism]]. There are various philosophies of mathematics that are called ultrafinitism. A major identifying property common among most of these philosophies is their objections to [[total function|totality]] of number theoretic functions like [[exponentiation]] over [[natural number]]s.

==Main ideas==
Like other [[finitism|finitists]], ultrafinitists deny the existence of the [[infinite set]] '''N''' of [[natural numbers]].

In addition, some ultrafinitists are concerned with acceptance of objects in mathematics that no one can construct in practice because of physical restrictions in constructing large finite mathematical objects.
Thus some ultrafinitists will deny or refrain from accepting the existence of large numbers, for example, the [[floor function|floor]] of the first [[Skewes's number]], which is a huge number defined using the [[exponential function]] as exp(exp(exp(79))), or
: &lt;math&gt; e^{e^{e^{79}}}. &lt;/math&gt;
The reason is that nobody has yet calculated what [[natural number]] is the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of this [[real number]], and it may not even be physically possible to do so. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; (in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]) would be considered only a formal expression which does not correspond to a natural number.  The brand of ultrafinitism concerned with physical realizability of mathematics is often called [[actualism]].

[[Edward Nelson]] criticized the classical conception of natural numbers because of the circularity of its definition. In classical mathematics the natural numbers are defined as 0 and numbers obtained by the iterative applications of the successor function to 0. But the concept of natural number is already assumed for the iteration. In other words, to obtain a number like &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; one needs to perform the successor function iteratively, in fact exactly &lt;math&gt;2\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 6&lt;/math&gt; times to 0.

Some versions of ultrafinitism are forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]], but most constructivists view the philosophy as unworkably extreme.  The logical foundation of ultrafinitism is unclear; in his comprehensive survey ''Constructivism in Mathematics'' (1988), the constructive logician [[A. S. Troelstra]] dismissed it by saying "no satisfactory development exists at present." This was not so much a philosophical objection as it was an admission that, in a rigorous work of [[mathematical logic]], there was simply nothing precise enough to include.

== People associated with ultrafinitism ==
Serious work on ultrafinitism has been led, since 1959, by [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], who in 1961 sketched a program for proving the consistency of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] in ultrafinite mathematics.  Other mathematicians who have worked in the topic include [[Doron Zeilberger]], [[Edward Nelson]], [[Rohit Jivanlal Parikh]], and [[Jean Paul Van Bendegem]]. The philosophy is also sometimes associated with the beliefs of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Robin Gandy]], [[Petr Vopenka]], and [[J. Hjelmslev]].

[[Shaughan Lavine]] has developed a form of set-theoretical ultra-finitism that is consistent with classical mathematics.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philosophy-mathematics/ |title=Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lavine has shown that the basic principles of arithmetic such as "there is no largest natural number" can be upheld, as Lavine allows for the inclusion of "indefinitely large" numbers.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

== Computational complexity theory based restrictions ==
Other considerations of the possibility of avoiding unwieldy large numbers can be based on [[computational complexity theory]], as in [[Andras Kornai]]'s work on explicit finitism (which does not deny the existence of large numbers)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713221118/http://kornai.com/Drafts/fathom_3.html "Relation to foundations"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Sazonov]]'s notion of [[feasible number]].

There has also been considerable formal development on versions of ultrafinitism that are based on complexity theory, like [[Samuel Buss]]'s [[Bounded Arithmetic]] theories, which capture mathematics associated with various complexity classes like [[P (complexity)|P]] and [[PSPACE]]. Buss's work can be considered the continuation of [[Edward Nelson]]'s work on [[predicative arithmetic]] as bounded arithmetic theories like S12 are interpretable in [[Raphael Robinson]]'s theory [[Robinson arithmetic|Q]] and therefore are predicative in [[Edward Nelson|Nelson]]'s sense.  The power of these theories for developing mathematics is studied in [[Bounded reverse mathematics]] as can be found in the works of [[Stephen A. Cook]] and [[Phuong The Nguyen]]. However these researches are not philosophies of mathematics but rather the study of restricted forms of reasoning similar to [[Reverse Mathematics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7694">{{About|the notion used in [[computer programming]] and [[type theory]]|types of measurement units|Units of measurement|other uses|Unit (disambiguation)}}

In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''unit type''' is a [[data type|type]] that allows only one value (and thus can hold no information).&lt;!-- see general reference at the end and WP:CITE --&gt; The carrier (underlying set) associated with a unit type can be any [[singleton set]]. There is an [[isomorphism]] between any two such sets, so it is customary to talk about ''the'' unit type and ignore the details of its value. One may also regard the unit type as the type of 0-[[tuple]]s, i.e. the [[product (category theory)|product]] of no types.

The unit type is the [[terminal object]] in the [[category theory|category]] of types and typed functions. It should not be confused with the ''zero'' or [[bottom type]], which allows ''no'' values and is the [[initial object]] in this category. Similarly, the [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] is the type with ''two'' values.

The unit type is implemented in most [[functional programming language]]s. The [[void type]] that is used in some imperative programming languages serves some of its functions, but because its carrier set is empty, it has some limitations (as detailed below).

==In programming languages==
Several computer [[programming language]]s provide a unit type to specify the result type of a [[function (computer science)|function]] with the sole purpose of causing a [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]], and the argument type of a function that does not require arguments. 
*In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is also &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation.  
*In [[ML programming language|ML]] descendants (including [[OCaml]], [[Standard ML]], and [[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]), the type is called &lt;code&gt;unit&lt;/code&gt; but the value is written as &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.  
*In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is written as &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;.
*In [[Common Lisp]] the type named &lt;tt&gt;NULL&lt;/tt&gt; is a unit type which has one value, namely the symbol &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt;.  This should not be confused with the &lt;tt&gt;NIL&lt;/tt&gt; ''type'', which is the [[bottom type]].
* In [[Python (programming language)|Python]], there is a type called &lt;code&gt;NoneType&lt;/code&gt; which allows the single value of &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.
* In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], the unit type is called &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; and its only value is also &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;, reflecting the 0-tuple interpretation.
* In [[Go_(programming_language)|Go]], the unit type is written &lt;code&gt;struct{}&lt;/code&gt; and its value is &lt;code&gt;struct{}{}&lt;/code&gt;.
* In [[PHP]], the unit type is called null, which only value is NULL itself.
* In [[Javascript]], both null and undefined are built-in unit types.
* in [[Kotlin_(programming_language)|Kotlin]], &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; is a singleton with only one value: the &lt;code&gt;Unit&lt;/code&gt; object.
* In [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; is the only instance of the &lt;code&gt;NilClass&lt;/code&gt; class.
* In [[C++]], the &lt;code&gt;std::monostate&lt;/code&gt; unit type was added in C++17.

=== Void type as unit type ===

In [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D_(programming_language)|D]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], &lt;code&gt;[[void return type|void]]&lt;/code&gt; is used to designate a function that does not return anything useful, or a function that accepts no arguments. The unit type in C is conceptually similar to an empty &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;, but a struct without members is not allowed in the C language specification. Instead, '&lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;' is used in a manner that simulates some, but not all, of the properties of the unit type, as detailed below. Like most imperative languages, C allows functions that do not return a value; these are specified as having the void return type. Such functions are called procedures in other imperative languages like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], where a syntactic distinction, instead of type-system distinction, is made between functions and procedures.

==== Difference in calling convention ====

The first notable difference between a true unit type and the void type is that the unit type may always be the type of the argument to a function, but the void type cannot be the type of an argument in C, despite the fact that it may appear as the sole argument in the list. This problem is best illustrated by the following program, which is a compile-time error in C:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
void f(void) {}
void g(void) {}

int main(void)
{
  f(g()); // compile-time error here
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This issue does not arise in most programming practice in C, because since the &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; type carries no information, it is useless to pass it anyway; but it may arise in [[generic programming]], such as C++ [[template (programming)|templates]], where &lt;code&gt;[[void return type|void]]&lt;/code&gt; must be treated differently from other types. In C++ however, empty classes are allowed, so it is possible to implement a real unit type; the above example becomes compilable as:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class unit_type {};
const unit_type the_unit;

unit_type f(unit_type) { return the_unit; }
unit_type g(unit_type) { return the_unit; }

int main()
{
  f(g(the_unit));
  return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

(For brevity, we're not worried in the above example whether &lt;code&gt;the_unit&lt;/code&gt; is really a [[singleton pattern|singleton]]; see [[singleton pattern]] for details on that issue.)

==== Difference in storage ====

The second notable difference is that the void type is special and can never be stored in a [[Record (computer science)|record type]], i.e. in a struct or a class in C/C++. In contrast, the unit type can be stored in records in functional programming languages, i.e. it can appear as the type of a field; the above implementation of the unit type in C++ can also be stored. While this may seem a useless feature, it does allow one for instance to elegantly implement a [[Set (computer science)|set]] as a [[Associative array|map]] to the unit type; in the absence of a unit type, one can still implement a set this way by storing some dummy value of another type for each key.

==== In Generics ====

In Java Generics, type parameters must be reference types. The wrapper type &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; is often used when a unit type parameter is needed. Although the &lt;code&gt;Void&lt;/code&gt; type can never have any instances, it does have one value, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; (like all other reference types), so it acts as a unit type. In practice, any other non-instantiable type, e.g. &lt;code&gt;Math&lt;/code&gt;, can also be used for this purpose, since they also have exactly one value, &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
public static Void f(Void x) { return null; }
public static Void g(Void x) { return null; }

public static void main(String[] args)
{
  f(g(null));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25400">The '''Working Group on Arbitrary Detention''' is a body of independent [[human rights]] experts that investigate cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. [[Arbitrary arrest and detention]] is the imprisonment or detainment of an individual, by a State, without respect for due process. These actions may be in violation of [[international human rights law]].

The Working Group was established by resolution in 1991 by the former [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|Commission on Human Rights]]. It is one of the thematic special procedures overseen by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and is therefore a subsidiary body of the UN.

==Mandate and composition==

The Working Group is mandated to receive and verify information from a variety of sources, in order to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily, or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.311]&lt;/ref&gt;  Article 9 states: ‘No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile’. In considering claims of arbitrary detention, the Working Group is not only guided by State national law, but other international legal instruments may also be relevant if accepted by the States concerned. For example, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 9(1) states; “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be Deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.”

The Working Group's role is to investigate individual cases of arbitrary detention, as well as situations where the conditions in a country prompt concern over widespread occurrences of arbitrary detention. It has an intentionally broad mandate, to allow flexibility, and allow anyone to seek its assistance. The Working Group may send urgent appeals to governments to ascertain the whereabouts and condition of those allegedly detained, issues opinions on the compliance with international law and may also conduct fact-finding visits to countries. The Working Group also issue deliberations on issues, to assist States in avoiding behaviour that may enable arbitrary detention. Ensuring a communicative dialogue with Governments and intergovernmental and [[non-governmental organisations]] allows the Working Group to achieve success. The Working Group must work in coordination with other Human Rights Council mechanisms and is mandated to carry out its task with discretion, objectivity and independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/WGADIndex.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group mandate reflects the Commission’s concerns regarding worldwide instances of detention without legal basis. The Commission on Human Rights entrusted the Working Group with the following mandate:

# To investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily in individual cases 
# To complete field missions in order to receive information from Government and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, and receive information from the individuals concerned, their families or their representatives; 
# To present annual reports to the Human Rights Council

The mandate lasts for a period of three years, and was most recently extended for a further three-year period by Human Rights Council resolution 33/30 of 30 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G16/228/05/PDF/G1622805.pdf?OpenElement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 33/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===

The Working Group is composed of five independent experts. They are appointed in equitable geographical distribution from the following regions: Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Other Countries, and South America and Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Three sessions are held per year, each lasting between five and eight days.

==Process==

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is tasked with acting on information of alleged cases of arbitrary detention. To fulfil this mandate, the Working Group may decide individual complaints of arbitrary detention, formulate deliberations to provide guidance on the interpretation of international standards related to detention circumstances and provide reports for the Human Rights Council. It may undertake country visits to achieve this.

The Working Group does not require the exhaustion of local remedies. However, its purpose is not to replace national courts.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This broadens its jurisdiction, as it allows the Group to bypass governments that may be stalling procedure.

Detention in itself does not necessarily violate human rights. Therefore, the Working Group must distinguish between lawful exercise of police power, and detention so lacking in lawful basis or otherwise unreasonable, that it must be considered arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual complaints and urgent appeals==

===Individual complaints===

The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is unique in that its mandate expressly provides for the consideration of individual complaints. Individuals anywhere in the world are therefore able to petition the Working Group for consideration. The Group acts on information submitted to it by individuals directly, their families, or through representatives of [[Non-governmental organisations]].

The Working Group then sends communications to the Governments concerned, to clarify or bring attention to the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The Government is invited to respond to the allegations within 60 days, with its view on the issue. The Working Group then sends the reply to the source of the allegations, requesting more information. This process allows the Group to remain neutral in the information-gathering process.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt;

The Working Group has identified detention or imprisonment as arbitrary if it falls into one of the following categories;
# Imposed without any legal basis
# Imposed because of the exercise of human rights 
# Imposed in violation of the principle of fair trial
# Prolonged administrative custody imposed on asylum seekers, immigrants or refugees
# Based on illegal discriminatory grounds

Examples of this can include continued detention after the completion of a sentence, denial of the exercise of fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, violations of the right to a fair trial, asylum and immigration claims, or detention based on ethnicity; religion; sexual orientation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.317]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving information under this adversary procedure, the Working Group then adopts one of the following approaches;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx], The UN.&lt;/ref&gt;

* If the individual concerned has been released, the Group may still decide to formulate an opinion on whether or not the deprivation of liberty was arbitrary
* The Group may find that the deprivation of liberty is not arbitrary, and will state an opinion as such
* The Group may seek further information from the individual or the Government
* If further information is unable to be sought, the Group may file the case subject to further confirmation
* The Group may decide that the arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been established, state an opinion to that effect, and make recommendations to the Government. These are then communicated to the Government. The opinion requests that the state takes the necessary steps to remedy the situation in order to bring it into conformity. The fulfilment of this request is often achieved by the release of the individual.

Upon evaluating contradicting evidence, such as between an individual claiming arbitrary deprivation of liberty and a government, the Working Group use a standard of 'convincing evidence', as opposed to evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The informal nature of the Working Group can strengthen the position of the individual represented, by easing the objective burden of proof on them.

===Urgent appeals===

If the Working Group receives information that raises concern about the immediate wellbeing of an individual, then it may, at its discretion, pursue an urgent action. The source must provide sufficiently reliable information that the continuation of deprivation poses significant threat to the psychological or physical wellbeing to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged situation may be time-sensitive in relation to loss of life or deportation. Rapid communication is sought with diplomats, such as the Foreign Minister (or equivalent). The Working Group request immediate action to ensure the detained person's right to life, as well as physical and mental integrity are respected.&lt;ref&gt;Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, Fact Sheet No. 26, The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, available at http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/FactSheet26en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This a purely humanitarian undertaking, and does not prejudice the Working Group's final opinion on whether the deprivation of liberty is indeed arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Complaints.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory procedures==

===Country visits===

In order to fulfil its mandate, the Working Group may conduct country visits. These provide an opportunity for the Group to understand the specific situation prevailing in countries. The Group undertake one to three country visits per year, upon invitation from the Government concerned.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in May 2017 the Working Group visited Argentina. In 2016 the Group visited the United States of America and Azerbaijan. The Group tend to visit between one and four countries per year.

On a country visit, members of the Working Group engage in a variety of tasks. These can include meeting with representatives of the executive, legislators, and other state officials. The Group also has the right to visit places of detention and have private discussions with detainees.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." They also enable the Working Group to evaluate internal legislation for its compatibility with international standards. Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Country visits enable the Working Group to gain a greater understanding of the social, political and historical environment in each country, enabling them to create context-appropriate recommendations.

===Deliberations===

More generally, the Working Group seeks to encourage broader international understanding of arbitrary detention, and promote universal standards.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through a more general advisory role, with the formulation of deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Weissbrodt and Brittany Mitchell. "The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Procedures and Summary of Jurisprudence." Human Rights Quarterly 38, no. 3 (2016): 655-705. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed September 4, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The Group formulates deliberations on general issues to assist States in safeguarding against the practice of arbitrary deprivation of liberty. For example, the Group have developed deliberations on issues relating to house arrest, psychiatric detention, deprivation of liberty subsequent to a conviction and resulting from the use of the internet, on rehabilitation through labour and situations regarding immigrants and asylum seekers. The Group have also provided legal analysis regarding the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] and clarified the definition of arbitrary deprivation of liberty under customary international law and the urgent appeals procedure.

===Annual reports===

The Working Group must submit Annual Reports to the Human Rights Council, summarising the previous year's activities. The report will express observations made while investigating cases and on field missions in differing countries. The report details the Working Group's reasoning behind legal insufficiencies, policies and judicial policies that are the cause of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and recommend best practice to safeguard against arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/Annual.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

The Group functions as a [[quasi-judicial body]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpil.de/files/pdf2/mpunyb_rudolf_4.pdf The Thematic Rapporteurs and Working Groups of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights p.315]&lt;/ref&gt; The Group has no direct enforcement power of its own. Instead, it relies on communication among states, policy-makers and advocates to encourage governments to implement its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its reliance on the cooperation of states, it can be argued that this weakens the authority of the Group.

The opinions of the Working Group however are legally binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights laws, such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. This is applicable to states that have ratified the Covenant.

The opinions of the Working Group are considered authoritative by some prominent international judicial institutions including the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17013&amp;LangID=E United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The features of the Working Group arguably play a role in its success, as it allows it to provide a politically viable alternative to treaty-based human rights enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; The flexible mandate enables it to avoid direct political confrontation with governments, ultimately achieving more politically acceptable and lasting solutions to individual cases of arbitrary detention.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; While the opinions of the Working Group are not binding on states, they can facilitate information sharing among non-governmental organisations and governments. This can in turn lead to an increase in government accountability.

A further criticism of the Group is that it has taken no steps toward creating a robust follow up procedure, to apply pressure on states arbitrarily detaining individuals. Establishing a systematic follow up procedure could ensure an even greater accountability on governments, acting as a name and shame process to pressure them into action. A follow up procedure may also be beneficial for providing feedback for future policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Genser, J. M.; Winterkorn-Meikle, M. K. (2008). The intersection of politics and international law: The united nations working group on arbitrary detention in theory and in practice. Columbia Human Rights Law Review 39(3), 687-756&lt;/ref&gt; It could also aid non-governmental organisations in petitioning governments with unresolved cases. Having a record of resolved cases could help the Group to keep track of the status of detainees and any correlation between the action of the Working Group. Information and statistics drawn from this can be publicised, and help to increase outreach.

==Development of Draft Principles==

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Council]] requested the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to develop draft basic principles. These were to provide guidelines on remedies and procedures for anyone deprived of his or her liberty by arrest or detention to bring proceedings before court, in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his or her detention and order his or her release if the detention is not lawful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The intention behind these were to assist states in fulfilling their obligation to avoid arbitrary deprivation of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/55f7d5844.pdf Report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention]&lt;/ref&gt; States, treaty bodies, human rights institutions and non-governmental organisations were invited to submit details on the treatment of the right to bring such proceedings before a court, in their respective legal frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Detention/Pages/DraftBasicPrinciples.aspx United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt; The text was adopted in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Detention/DraftBasicPrinciples/March2015/WGAD.CRP.1.2015.pdf United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable case==

===Julian Assange===
On 5 February 2016, the group released a report stating that Assange had been subject to [[arbitrary detention]] by the UK and Swedish Governments since 7 December 2010, including his time in prison in Britain and Sweden, on conditional bail, and in the Ecuadorian embassy. According to the report, Assange should be allowed to walk free and be given compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstpost.com/world/britain-sweden-should-accept-ruling-on-julian-assange-un-high-commissioner-for-human-rights-2618960.html "Britain, Sweden should accept ruling on Julian Assange: UN High Commissioner for Human Rights"]. ''Firstpost'' (India). 6 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=17012&amp;LangID=E The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention Deems the deprivation of liberty of Mr. Julian Assange as arbitrary]. The [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR). 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and Swedish governments rejected the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.skynews.com.au/news/top-stories/2016/02/05/assange-warrant-still-active--uk-police.html |work=Sky News Australia |title=UK, Sweden reject UN ruling on Assange |date=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, [[Philip Hammond]], said the claim was "ridiculous" and that the group was "made up of lay people", and called Assange a "[[fugitive from justice]]" who "can come out any time he chooses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecuador-sweden-assange-hammond-idUKKCN0VE120 Hammond calls U.N. Assange report 'ridiculous'], Reuters&lt;/ref&gt; UK and Swedish prosecutors called the group's claims irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/svenska-aklagarna-fn-gruppens-rapport-betydelselos "Svenska åklagarna: FN-gruppens rapport betydelselös"] ''[[svt.se]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/feb/05/philip-hammond-rejects-ridiculous-un-decision-julian-assange-video "Philip Hammond rejects 'ridiculous' UN decision on Julian Assange"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The UK said it would arrest Assange should he leave the Ecuadorian embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/reports-a-un-panel-votes-in-favor-of-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/2016/02/04/578e052e-cb2a-11e5-a7b2-5a2f824b02c9_story.html?tid=sm_tw |work=The Washington Post |title=Britain: WikiLeaks founder faces arrest regardless of U.N. panel ruling |date=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Ellis, executive director of the [[International Bar Association]], stated that the finding is "not binding on British law".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/04/what-happen-julian-assange-detention-ruling-officially-announced "Julian Assange Q&amp;A: what now for the WikiLeaks founder?"]. ''The Guardian'' (London). 5 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein]] has claimed that the finding is based on international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain, Sweden should accept Assange ruling: UN rights chief|url=http://www.newsjs.com/url.php?p=http://www.haveeru.com.mv/world/66368|access-date=13 February 2016|publisher=Haveeru.com|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13th February 2018, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, while considering whether the arrest warrant issued against Assange should be upheld, rejected the findings of the Working Group, stating in part that "The group appears to have based its conclusions on some misunderstandings of what occurred after Mr Assange’s arrest." Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) Emma Arbuthnot did not find that Mr Assange’s stay in the Embassy was "inappropriate, unjust, unpredictable, unreasonable, unnecessary or disproportionate." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43049474 "Julian Assange: Warrant for his arrest upheld by court"]. ''BBC'' 13 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/assange-ruling-2-feb2018.pdf "Ruling of the Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate)"].

Worldwide, there are between 180 and 220 million '''youth with disabilities'''. Eighty percent of disabled youth live in developing countries, and therefore have even less access to education, health care, jobs and general rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth with Disabilities|url=http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx|website=Youth Social Policy and Developmental Division|accessdate=December 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127013856/http://undesadspd.org/youth/resourcesandpublications/youthwithdisabilities.aspx |archive-date=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabilities include [[physical disabilities|physical]], [[mental disabilities]] or [[mental illness]].  Many youth live normal and stable lives, however those with disabilities may experience more obstacles than those without due to potential limitations, those created by physical limitations and social limitations. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Disability and education==
===Legal regulations in the United States===
Before the 1970s, there were no major [[federal law]]s that protected the [[civil rights|civil]] or [[constitutional right]]s of [[United States|Americans]] with disabilities. The [[civil rights movement]] started off the "[[disability rights movement]]", which focused on [[social services|social]] and therapeutic services for those with disabilities, and in 1975 the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was created. This law establishes the rights of children with disabilities to attend [[State school|public schools]], to receive services designed to meet their needs free of charge, and to receive instruction in regular education [[classroom]]s alongside non-disabled children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laudan |first1=Aron |last2=Loprest |first2=Pamela |title=Disability and the Education System|journal=The Future of Children |date=Spring 2012 |volume=22.1 |publisher=Princeton|location=United Kingdom |pmid=22550687 |pages=97–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IDEA also authorized [[federal grant]]s to [[U.S. state|states]] to cover some of the costs of special education services for youth aged three to twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Additions to the law focused on improving access to general education and [[curriculum]] (inclusion programs), developing appropriate assessments, implementing appropriate [[punishment|disciplinary]] procedures and alternative placements, and creating transition services for youth leaving the [[education system]]. This transition can be difficult for youth with a disability if it is too sudden- many of these youth struggle with the independence that [[graduation]] allows. In 2004, additions were made to promote better accountability for results, enhance parent involvement, encourage the use of proven practices and materials (increase research on current practices), and reduce administrative burdens for [[teacher]]s, states and local [[school district]]s. Before 1975, only one in five children with identified disabilities attended public school, and many states explicitly excluded children with certain types of disabilities from school; these included children who were [[blindness|blind]] or [[deafness|deaf]], and children labeled "[[Emotional and behavioral disorders|emotionally disturbed]]" or "[[mentally retarded]]".&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

===Current special education system===
The current special education system can offer many different supports and services including transportation, speech-language pathology and audiology services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, therapeutic recreation, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation, and mobility services, medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes, school health services, social work services in school, and parent counseling and training children.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; Each unique student and their unique symptoms of their disability is going to require different supports from another youth with a disability (even if it is the same disability). Within the classroom, there are many different ways that teachers and administration can adjust their work to meet the needs of the youth in their classroom with disabilities. Just a few of these adaptations are curriculum modification, small-group or individual instruction, and teachers who are especially skilled in motivating students, adapting instructional materials, teaching reading skills and language arts, and managing student behaviors.Specific accommodations might include tutors or aides, more time for students to take tests, alternative tests or assessments, modified grading standards, slower-paced instruction, shorter or different assignments, more frequent feedback, a reader or interpreter, a peer tutor, or special behavior management approaches and programs.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt;

==Challenges and hardships==

===Family effects===
{{Globalize|date=December 2014}}
Being a [[youth]] with a disability can create a financial burden on the individual, as well as to those who provide care and support. Their families also incur extra [[direct cost|direct]] and [[indirect cost]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. Families with disabled yout spend money on [[health care]], [[Therapy|therapeutic]], behavioral, or [[education]]al services; transportation; [[caregiver]]s; and other [[special needs]] services. Indirect costs include reductions in parents' ability to work because of additional time that is required to care for a child with a [[Mental disability (disambiguation)|disability]] combined with high costs or unavailability of adequate [[child care]]. This is a similar problem to one that many families face, but disabled youth may live at home longer require more attention.&lt;ref name=Stabile&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stabile|first1=Mark|title=The Economic Costs of Childhood Disability|pmid=22550686|volume=22|year=2012|pages=65–96|journal=Future Child|doi=10.1353/foc.2012.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These costs alone can decrease the financial stability of a family.  Having a child with disabilities increases the likelihood that the mother (or less often the father) will either curtail hours of work or stop working altogether.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;  One study showed that a decline in employment of 9% for mothers with a disabled child relative to all mothers, with a resultant estimate of approximately $3,150 in lost pay. In addition, mothers who continue to work are estimated to reduce time worked by around two hours a week, with a range of between half an hour and five hours a week.&lt;ref name=Stabile /&gt;

Families with more resources may be able to maintain financial stability, even with the financial strain of having a youth with a disability. These resources may provide treatment, [[affordable housing]], therapy, etc. for a youth with special needs. As a conclusion from the research listed above, these children are more likely to be able to function independently from their family, and live on their own at an earlier age, than those from families that may not be able to afford these extra resources.

===Poverty===
Eighty percent of people with disabilities live in resource-poor societies. They are often considered to be a burden, and carry a very negative [[social stigma]]. Many are unable to contribute to society, attend school, or find [[job|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manderson|first1=Lenore|title=Disability, Global Legislation and Human Rights|journal=The Politics of Health|date=June 2004|volume=47.2|pages=29–35|doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disabled youth in the justice system===
{{globalize|date=December 2014}}
In the justice system, youth are disproportionately male, poor and have significant learning or behavioral disabilities to the extent that they require services listed under the IDEA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=Mary|last2=Rutherford|first2=Robert|last3=Leone|first3=Peter|last4=Osher|first4=David|last5=Poirer|first5=Jeffery|title=Youth with Disabilities in Juvenile Corrections: A National Survey|journal=Exceptional Children|date=2005|volume=71|issue=3|pages=339–345|doi=10.1177/001440290507100308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 1345,000 youth incarcerated in the U.S system, and 30%-70% of these individuals are youth with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
[[Psychiatric disorder]]s occur more often among [[prisoner]]s than among those outside of [[prison]]. Such illnesses relate to at least some of the difficulties former inmates experience after they are released.&lt;ref name="Schnittker"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnittker |first1=Jason |last2=Massoglia|first2=Michael|last3=Uggen|first3=Christopher|title=Out and Down: Incarceration and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=Journal of Health and Social behavior|date=2012|volume=53.4 |url=http://users.soc.umn.edu/~uggen/Schnittker_Massoglia_Uggen_JHSB_12.pdf |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were diagnosed with a mental disability may have a harder time readjusting to life outside of [[incarceration|prison]] after being released; this often consists of [[recidivism|repetition of crime]], or difficulty maintaining independent stability financially or emotionally.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
