== History ==
AIMMS B.V. was founded in 1989 by noted mathematician Johannes Bisschop under the name of Paragon Decision Technology. His vision was to make optimization more approachable by building models rather than programming. In Bisschop’s view, modeling was able to build the bridge between the people who had problems and the people helping them solve those problems. 

'''AIMMS''' (an acronym for "'''Advanced Interactive Multidimensional Modeling System'''") began as a software system designed for modeling and solving large-scale optimization and scheduling-type problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  

AIMMS is considered to be one of the five most important algebraic modeling languages and the creator (Johannes J. Bisschop) has been awarded with [[INFORMS]] Impact Prize for his work in this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022091250/https://www.informs.org/Blogs/E-News-Blog/INFORMS-Impact-Prize |archive-date=2013-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, AIMMS was acquired by a small private equity firm who saw the potential value of mathematics to business. This led to the creation of a partnership program, further technical investment and the evolution of the platform. In 2011, the company launched AIMMS PRO, a way to deploy applications to end-users who don't have a technical background. This was quickly followed by the ability to publish and customize applications using a browser so that decision support applications are available on any device. These innovations led to rapid customer adoption and growth for the company. In 2017, AIMMS was recognized as a top B2B technology in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.g2crowd.com/blog/technology-research/b2b-netherlands-tech-2017/|title=The State of the Netherland's B2B Tech Scene in 2017|date=2017-12-14|work=G2 Crowd|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aimms.com/english/news-archive/aimms-named-one-fastest-companies-netherlands-second-consecutive-year/|title=AIMMS :: AIMMS named one of the fastest growing companies in the Netherlands for the second consecutive year|website=AIMMS|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIMMS SC Navigator Platform ==
In 2017, the product management team did a listening tour with supply chain executives. This, along with the growing interest in embedded advanced analytics for supply chain management, generated the initial idea for the AIMMS SC Navigator Platform and the democratization of supply chain analytics. SC Navigator consists of ready-made applications that are easily configurable to put supply chain analytics in the hands of supply chain professionals. 

AIMMS SC Navigator launched in October, 2017 with three initial cloud-based Apps: Supply Chain Network Design, Sales &amp; Operations Planning and Data Navigator. In 2018 two additional applications were rolled out - Center of Gravity and Product Lifecycle. Additional applications are rolling out every quarter.

==AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform==

The AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform consists of an [[algebraic modeling language]], an [[integrated development environment]] for both editing models and creating a [[graphical user interface]] around these models, and a graphical end-user environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aimms.com/aimms/download/manuals/aimms_user.pdf|title=AIMMS User's Guide|last=Roelofs|first=Marcel|publisher=lulu.com|year=2010|isbn=978-0-557-06360-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
AIMMS is linked to multiple [[solver]]s through the AIMMS Open Solver Interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.aimms.com/aimms/AimmsOSI/frames.html?frmname=topic&amp;frmfile=index.html|title=AIMMS Open Solver Interface API|author=Paragon Decision Technology|year=2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Supported solvers include [[CPLEX]], [[MOSEK]], [[FICO Xpress]], CBC, Conopt, [[MINOS (optimization software)|MINOS]], [[IPOPT]], [[SNOPT]], [[KNITRO]] and [http://www.ilog.com/products/cpoptimizer/ CP Optimizer].

AIMMS features a mixture of [[declarative programming|declarative]] and [[imperative programming|imperative]] programming styles. Formulation of optimization models takes place through declarative language elements such as sets and indices, as well as scalar and multidimensional parameters, variables and constraints, which are common to all [[algebraic modeling language]]s, and allow for a concise description of most problems in the domain of mathematical optimization. [[Units of measurement]] are natively supported in the language, and compile- and runtime unit analysis may be employed to detect modeling errors.

Procedures and [[control flow]] statements are available in AIMMS for 
* the exchange of data with external data sources such as [[spreadsheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[XML]] and text files
* data pre- and post-processing tasks around optimization models
* user interface event handling
* the construction of hybrid algorithms for problem types for which no direct efficient solvers are available. 
To support the re-use of common modeling components, AIMMS allows modelers to organize their model in user model [[library (computing)|libraries]].

AIMMS supports a wide range of mathematical optimization problem types:
* [[Linear programming]]
* [[Quadratic programming]]
* [[Nonlinear programming]]
* [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer programming]]
* Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
* [[Global optimization]]
* [[Complementarity theory|Complementarity problems]] (MPECs)
* [[Stochastic programming]]
* [[Robust optimization]]
* [[Constraint programming]]
[[Uncertainty]] can be taken into account in [[deterministic system|deterministic]] linear and mixed integer optimization models in AIMMS through the specification of additional attributes, such that [[stochastic programming|stochastic]] or [[robust optimization|robust]] optimization techniques can be applied alongside the existing deterministic solution techniques.

Custom hybrid and decomposition algorithms can be constructed using the GMP system library which makes available at the modeling level many of the basic building blocks used internally by the higher level solution methods present in AIMMS, matrix modification methods, as well as specialized steps for customizing solution algorithms for specific problem types.

Optimization solutions created with AIMMS can be used either as a standalone [[desktop application]] or can be embedded as a [[software component]] in other applications.

==Use in industry==

AIMMS Prescriptive Analytics Platform is used in a wide range of industries including retail, consumer products, healthcare, oil and chemicals, steel production and agribusiness.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''age of majority''' is the threshold of adulthood as recognized or declared in law. It is the moment when [[minor (law)|minor]]s cease to be considered such and assume legal control over their persons, actions, and decisions, thus terminating the control and legal responsibilities of their parents or guardian over them. Most countries set the age of majority at 18. The word ''majority'' here refers to having greater years and being of full age as opposed to ''minority'', the state of being a minor. The law in a given jurisdiction may not actually use the term "age of majority". The term typically refers to a collection of laws bestowing the status of adulthood. The age of majority does not necessarily correspond to the mental or [[Sexual maturity|physical maturity]] of an individual.

Age of majority should not be confused with the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], [[age of consent|age of sexual consent]], [[marriageable age]], [[school-leaving age]], [[drinking age]], [[driving age]], [[voting age]], [[smoking age]], [[gambling age]], etc., which each may be independent of and set at a different age from the age of majority.

Although a person may attain the age of majority in a particular jurisdiction, they may still be subject to age-based restrictions regarding matters such as the right to vote or stand for elective office, act as a judge, and many others.

==Explanation==
Age of majority can be confused with the similar concept of the '''age of [[license]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David R. Senn|author2=Richard A. Weems|title=Manual of Forensic Odontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-5133-3|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9u0MUnexdIC&amp;pg=PA212 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also pertains to the threshold of adulthood but in a much broader and more abstract way. As a legal term of art, "license" means "permission", and it can implicate a legally enforceable right or privilege. Thus, an age of license is an age at which one has legal permission from government to do something. The age of majority, on the other hand, is legal ''recognition'' that one has grown into an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornick|title=A Practical Guide to Family Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C|year=1995|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-314-04451-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YcZhqGMFht0C&amp;pg=PA229 229]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Age of majority pertains solely to the acquisition of the legal control over one's person, decisions and actions, and the correlative termination of the legal authority of the parents (or guardian(s), in lieu of parent(s)) over the child’s person and affairs generally.

Many ages of license are correlated to the age of majority, but they are nonetheless legally distinct concepts. One need not have attained the age of majority to have permission to exercise certain rights and responsibilities. Some ages of license are actually higher than the age of majority. For example, to purchase [[alcoholic beverages]], the age of license is 21 in all U.S. states. Another example is the voting age, which prior to the 1970s was 21 in the US, as was the age of majority in all or most states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Portals/0/documents/publications/Turn-18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic of Ireland the age of majority is 18, but one must be over 21 years of age to stand for election to the Houses of the [[Oireachtas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html|title=At what age can I?|publisher=Citizens Information Board (Bord um Fhaisnéis do Shaoránaigh / BFS)|accessdate=12 January 2011|location=Dublin| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101228220852/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/reference/checklists/checklist_at_what_age_can_i.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in Portugal the age of majority is 18, but one must be at least 25 years of age to run for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSTITUTION OF THE PORTUGUESE REPUBLIC |url=http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022091934/http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A child who is legally [[emancipation of minors|emancipated]] by a court of competent jurisdiction automatically attains to their maturity upon the signing of the court order. Only emancipation confers the status of maturity before a person has actually reached the age of majority.

In almost all places, minors who are married are automatically emancipated. Some places also do the same for minors who are in the armed forces or who have a certain degree or diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostoncoop.net/lcd/emancipation/emancipation_deliverable.pdf Statutory and Judicial Emancipation of Minors in the United States], 2001–2002 analysis by law students of [[Northeastern University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
{{Refimprove section||date= September 2009}}
In many countries minors can be [[Emancipation of minors|emancipated]]: depending on jurisdiction, this may happen through acts such as [[marriage]], attaining economic self-sufficiency, obtaining an educational [[academic degree|degree]] or [[diploma]], or participating in a form of [[military service]]. In the United States, all states have some form of emancipation of minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Emancipation of minors | publisher = Cornell | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/emancipation_of_minors}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious law==
Religions have their own rules as to the [[Coming of age|age of maturity]], when a child is regarded to be an adult, at least for ritual purposes:
*[[Islam]]: A person having reached the age of 15 or having entered puberty before that age is considered ''bulugh'' (adult).
*[[Judaism]]: 13 years of age for males ([[Bar Mitzvah]]) and 12 years of age for females ([[Bat Mitzvah]]). Such persons are considered adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The age requirement for Bar/Bat mitzvah | work = My Jewish Learning | url = http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-age-requirement-for-barbat-mitzvah/2/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Roman Catholic Church]]: 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Iuris Canonici'', Canon 97, §1, [http://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/latin/documents/cic_liberI_lt.html#TITULUS_VI] (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Always already''' is a philosophical term regarding the perception of phenomena by the mind of an observer. The features of a phenomenon that seem to precede any perception of it are said to be "always already" present.

==Development==
"Always already" literally translates the German phrase ''immer schon'' that appears prominently in several 20th century philosophical works, notably [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]''. The phrase is not specific to philosophy in German, but refers to an action or condition that has continued without any identifiable beginning. Heidegger used the phrase routinely to indicate that [[Dasein]], the human experience of existence, has no beginning apart from the world in which one exists, but is produced in it and by it.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Hubert L. and Mark A. Wrathal (2008) ''A Companion to Heidegger'', p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

On the strength of Heidegger's influence, French and later English philosophers adopted the literal translation of the phrase. In the Marxist tradition, [[Louis Althusser]] observed that "individuals are always-already subjects" within an ideological structure before they perceive themselves as such — indeed, even before birth.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis (1970) "[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1970/ideology.htm Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses]"&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 20th century the term spread into various areas of philosophical discourse that include [[literary theory]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]].

The '''Arched-hill symbol''' is a fairly current symbol on ancient [[Coinage of India]]. There some variations at to the number of the hills depicted, or the symbol surmounting the hill, such as a [[crescent]] or a star.

It is thought that the three-arched hill symbol was initiated during the [[Maurya Empire]] (3rd–2nd century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;"The crescented three- arched hill symbol, seems to have originally been adopted by Chandragupta Maurya." Malwa Through the Ages, from the Earliest Times to 1305 A.D, Kailash Chand Jain Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1972 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA145]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in coins from [[Taxila]] dated from 220 BCE, the three-arched symbol appears regularly, and from 185 BCE is regularly associated with the animal figures of the elephant and the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=150982 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[Nandipada]] is generally associated with the [[zebu]] bull.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=127009 CNG Coins]&lt;/ref&gt; On coins of the [[Shunga Empire|Shunga period]], the three-arched hill can appear among a multitude of other symbols, such as the [[Nandipada]], the tree-in-railing, the elephant, or the empty cross.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The symbol is generally considered a representation of a [[Buddhist]] [[Chaitya]] or a [[Mount Meru|Meru]].&lt;ref&gt;"symbols generally called as three- or six- or multiple-arched hill or chaitya" Tribal Coins of Ancient India - Devendra Handa - 2007 Page 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Let us examine the symbol of Hillocks. The three arched hill symbols called variously as Meru, Chaitya etc. with its several variations, for example with five arches," six arches, » three arches of which one is placed above the two..." Seminar Papers on the Local Coins of Northern India, Awadh K Narain - 1968, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been argued that it was the imperial symbol of the Mauryas.&lt;ref&gt;Coin Splendour: A Journey Into the Past, Prasanna Rao Bandela, Abhinav Publications, 2003, p.28 [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mUg2BBJr7kC&amp;pg=PA28]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol however, appears in many post-Mauryan contexts as seen with the coins of Taxila and the Shungas.

In [[psychology]], '''aversives''' are [[suffering|unpleasant]] [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] that induce changes in [[behavior]] through [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]]; by applying an aversive immediately following a behavior, the likelihood of the behavior occurring in the future is reduced. Aversives can vary from being slightly unpleasant or irritating (such as a disliked color) to physically damaging. It is not the level of unpleasantness, but rather the effectiveness the unpleasant event has on changing behavior that defines the aversive.

==Types of stimuli==
{{main|Classical conditioning}}
There are two types of aversive stimuli:

===Unconditioned===
Unconditioned aversive stimuli naturally result in pain or discomfort and are often associated with biologically harmful or damaging substances or events. Examples include extreme [[heat]] or [[cold]], [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] flavors, [[electric shock]]s, loud [[noise]]s and [[pain]]. Aversives can be applied naturally (such as touching a hot stove) or in a contrived manner (such as during [[torture]] or [[behavior modification]]).

===Conditioned===
A conditioned aversive stimulus is an initially [[neutral stimulus]] that becomes aversive after repeated pairing with an unconditioned aversive stimulus. This type of stimulus would include consequences such as verbal warnings, gestures or even the sight of an individual who is disliked.

==Use in applied behavior analysis (ABA)==
{{main|Operant conditioning|Ethical challenges to autism treatment}}
Aversives can be used as [[punishment (psychology)|punishment]] during [[applied behavior analysis]] to reduce unwanted behavior, such as [[self-injury]], that poses a risk of harm greater than that posed by application of the aversive. Aversive stimuli may also be used as [[Reinforcement#Types|negative reinforcement]] to increase the rate or probability of a behavior by its removal. The use of aversives was developed as a less restrictive alternative to practices prevalent in mental institutions at the time such as shock treatment, hydrotherapy, straitjacketing and frontal lobotomies. Early iterations of the [[Lovaas technique]] incorporated aversives during therapy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moser |first=Dan |title=Screams, Slaps &amp; Love: A surprising, shocking treatment helps far-gone mental cripples |year=1965 |journal=Life Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the use of aversives in ABA was not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones RS, McCaughey RE |title=Gentle teaching and applied behavior analysis: a critical review |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=853–67 |year=1992 |pmid=1478907 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1992.25-853 |pmc=1279769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the use of aversives has become less and less necessary as less and less restrictive alternative treatments have been developed.

The '''Behavior Analyst Certification Board''' (BACB) Guidelines for Responsible Conduct state that participation in an any behavior plan must be voluntary, by the client or their surrogate, and that clients or families have the right to terminate a particular intervention if they see fit, including aversive treatments.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The Behavior Analyst Certification Board issues credentials for behavior analysts nationwide, although state regulations vary as to whether or not a person can represent themselves as a "behavior analyst". The use of aversive treatment is something that practitioners of applied behavior analysis are supposed to take very seriously (see [[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]) due to the pain and risks involved and the controversy surrounding their use.

Several national and international disability rights groups have spoken against the use of aversive therapies, including [[TASH (organization)|TASH]] and [[Autism National Committee]] (known as [[Autism National Committee|AUTCOM]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3729">The '''Beau Geste hypothesis''' in animal behaviour is the [[hypothesis]] which tries to explain why some [[Bird|avian]] [[species]] have such elaborate [[Bird vocalization|song repertoires]], for the purpose of [[Territory (animal)|territorial defence]]. The hypothesis' name comes from the 1924 book ''[[Beau Geste]]'', and was first coined by [[John Krebs, Baron Krebs|John Krebs]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="krebs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=John R.|title=The significance of song repertoires: The Beau Geste hypothesis|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=May 1977|volume=25|pages=475–478|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(77)90022-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347277900227?via%3Dihub|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The Beau Geste hypothesis which was coined by Krebs in 1977 to explain why various avian species have such large song repertories.&lt;ref name="krebs" /&gt; The hypothesis discusses that avian species utilize such large song repertories for potentially a number of reasons such as for territorial defence and to test the competition within a new habitat.&lt;ref name="Searcy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Searcy|first1=W A|last2=Andersson|first2=M|title=Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Song|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=November 1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=507–533|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.17.110186.002451|jstor=2097007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the hypothesis comes from the book which was originally published in 1924 "Beau Geste".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wren, P.C (1924). ''Beau Geste''.&lt;/ref&gt; The book tells the story of three English brothers which all enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] and ended up in a desert battle against a [[Tuareg]] army. They were greatly outnumbered, and in order to create the illusion that they had more men then they actually had, they took whatever dead soldiers they could find and propped them up along the walls of the fortress.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Non-avian species ==
There has been mention of this hypothesis in places such as research into [[amphibian]] vocalizations in the ''[[Boophis madagascariensis]]'', an [[endemic]] species of [[tree frog]] found in [[Madagascar]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;1Narins 2lewis 3McClelland, 1P.M 2E.R 3B.E (March 2018). "Hyperextended call note repertoire of the endemic Madagascar tree frog Boophis madagascarensis". ''the zoological society of London''. '''250''': 283–298.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Beau Geste hypothesis is used to give one explanation of why the species has such a large vocal repertoire. There has been some support for the theory in that the frogs use a wide variety of songs to give the illusion to invading frogs that the territory they are trying to enter is already full of competing frogs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Beau Geste hypothesis has also been found to explain vocalizations within some [[cricket]] species such as the [[Ephippiger|bush cricket]], where males use a wide variety of songs to access the amount of competition which is in a given area.&lt;ref name="rebar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rebar|first1=Darren|last2=Barbosa|first2=Flavia|last3=Greenfield|first3=Michael D.|title=Acoustic experience influences male and female pre- and postcopulatory behaviors in a bushcricket|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2016|volume=27|issue=2|pages=434–443|doi=10.1093/beheco/arv171|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/2/434/2196514|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When males are present in an area with a large number of other males their vocal repertories are much smaller than when in an area with only a few males.&lt;ref name="rebar" /&gt;

'''Bell's theorem''' is a "[[no-go theorem]]" that draws an important distinction between [[quantum mechanics]] and the world as described by [[classical mechanics]], particularly concerning ''[[quantum entanglement]]'' where two or more particles in a ''[[quantum state]]'' continue to be mutually dependent, even at large physical separations. This theorem is named after [[John Stewart Bell]].

A series of experiments has verified the theorem and showed that quantum entanglement occurs over large distances. 
Quantum entanglement has profound implications for the outcomes of measurements of quantum systems; for example, in ''[[quantum computing]]''.

In its simplest form, Bell's theorem states:&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994 542"&gt;{{cite book | author = C.B. Parker | title = McGraw-Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics | edition = 2nd | page = 542 | year=  1994 | publisher = McGraw-Hill  | isbn = 978-0-07-051400-3 }}  Bell himself wrote: "If [a hidden variable theory] is local it will not agree with quantum mechanics, and if it agrees with quantum mechanics it will not be local.  This is what the theorem says."  John Bell, ''Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics'', Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|No physical theory of [[Local hidden variable theory|local hidden variables]] can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.}}

[[Cornell University|Cornell]] solid-state physicist [[David Mermin]] has described the appraisals of the importance of Bell's theorem in the physics community as ranging from "indifference" to "wild extravagance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=David Mermin| first=David| last=Mermin| title=Is the moon there when nobody looks?

Bell's theorem rules out [[local hidden variable]]s as a viable explanation of quantum mechanics (though it still leaves the door open for non-local hidden variables, such as [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]], etc). Bell concluded:

{{quotation|In a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements, without changing the statistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote. Moreover, the signal involved must propagate instantaneously, so that such a theory could not be [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]].&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt;}}

Bell summarized one of the least popular ways to address the theorem, [[superdeterminism]], in a 1985 BBC Radio interview:

{{quotation|There is a way to escape the inference of [[superluminal]] speeds and spooky action at a distance. But it involves absolute [[determinism]] in the universe, the complete absence of [[free will]]. Suppose the world is super-deterministic, with not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behavior, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined, including the 'decision' by the experimenter to carry out one set of measurements rather than another, the difficulty disappears. There is no need for a faster-than-light signal to tell particle ''A'' what measurement has been carried out on particle&amp;nbsp;''B'', because the universe, including particle&amp;nbsp;''A'', already 'knows' what that measurement, and its outcome, will be.&lt;ref&gt;The quotation is an adaptation from the edited transcript of the radio interview with John Bell of 1985.

== Historical background ==
In the early 1930s, the philosophical implications of the current interpretations of quantum theory troubled many prominent physicists of the day, including [[Albert Einstein]].  In a well-known 1935 paper, [[Boris Podolsky]] and co-authors Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] (collectively "EPR") sought to demonstrate by the [[EPR paradox]] that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of ''locality'' and ''realism'' (together called "local realism" or "[[local hidden variables]]", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: [[Principle of locality|locality]] meant no instantaneous [[quantum entanglement|("spooky") action at a distance]]; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably [[Bohr–Einstein debates|between Einstein and Niels Bohr]].

In his groundbreaking 1964 paper, "On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox",&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy  |author=JS Bell |chapter=Chapter 2:On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwAhAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8 |isbn=978-0521523387  |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Alain Aspect introduction to 1987 |pages=14–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; physicist [[John Stewart Bell]] presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.

In experimental tests following Bell's example, now using [[quantum entanglement]] of photons instead of electrons, [[John Clauser]] and [[Stuart Freedman]] (1972) and [[Alain Aspect]] ''et al''. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes]] for local realism.

In October 2015, Hensen and co-workers&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature15759 | volume=526 | issue=7575 | title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres | journal=Nature | pages=682–686|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 | pmid=26503041 | last1 = Hensen | first1 = B | last2 = Bernien | first2 = H | last3 = Dréau | first3 = AE | last4 = Reiserer | first4 = A | last5 = Kalb | first5 = N | last6 = Blok | first6 = MS | last7 = Ruitenberg | first7 = J | last8 = Vermeulen | first8 = RF | last9 = Schouten | first9 = RN | last10 = Abellán | first10 = C | last11 = Amaya | first11 = W | last12 = Pruneri | first12 = V | last13 = Mitchell | first13 = MW | last14 = Markham | first14 = M | last15 = Twitchen | first15 = DJ | last16 = Elkouss | first16 = D | last17 = Wehner | first17 = S | last18 = Taminiau | first18 = TH | last19 = Hanson | first19 = R| year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Free choice of detector orientations|freedom-of-choice]] (the last "could" lead to alternative [[Superdeterminism|superdeterministic]] theories).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url= http://www.nature.com/news/quantum-spookiness-passes-toughest-test-yet-1.18255 |author=Zeeya Merali |title=Quantum 'spookiness' passes toughest test yet |journal=Nature |volume= 525 |issue=7567 |pages=14–15 |date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2017-06-03|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18255 |pmid=26333448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as "not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.

== Overview ==
Bell's theorem states that any physical theory that incorporates [[Principle of locality#Local realism|local realism]] cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanical theory.  Because numerous experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory, and show differences between correlations that could not be explained by local hidden variables, the experimental results have been taken by many as refuting the concept of local realism as an explanation of the physical phenomena under test. For a hidden variable theory, if Bell's conditions are correct, the results that agree with quantum mechanical theory appear to indicate [[superluminal]] (faster-than-light) effects, in contradiction to the principle of locality.

These three key concepts – locality, realism, freedom&amp;nbsp;– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, the concept of ''realism'' is now somewhat different from what it was in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called ''[[counterfactual definiteness]]''; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. ''Locality'' is short for ''local relativistic causality''. (Currently accepted [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] ''are'' local in the terminology of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian formalism]] and [[Local quantum field theory|axiomatic approach]].) ''Freedom'' refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.

[[Image:Bell test for entangled qubits.svg|thumb|450px|right|Illustration of Bell test for spin-half particles such as electrons. A source produces a [[singlet state|singlet]] pair, one particle is sent to one location, and the other is sent to another location. A [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]] of the entangled property is performed at various angles at each location. The scheme for measurements on [[photons]] looks very similar: the quantum state is different but has very similar properties.]]

The theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[qubit]]s. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities. However, for the quantum correlations arising in the specific example considered, those constraints are not satisfied, hence the phenomenon being studied cannot be explained by a local hidden variables theory.

Following the argument in the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox]] paper (but using the example of spin, as in [[David Bohm]]'s version of the EPR argument&lt;ref name="Bell1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=John |year=1964 |title=On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox |url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/Bell_Compact.pdf |journal=[[Physics (American Physical Society journal)|Physics]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=195–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bohm|first=David|title=Quantum Theory|authorlink=David Bohm|publisher=Prentice−Hall|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Bell considered an experiment in which there are "a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the [[Singlet state|singlet spin state]] and moving freely in opposite directions."&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up&amp;nbsp;(+) or spin-down&amp;nbsp;(−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.

The probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.

Bell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The [[Quantum correlation|correlation]] of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of [[correlation]] in statistics. The quantum physicist's "correlation" is the statistician's "raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.

[[Pauli operator|Measuring the spin]] of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions—i.e., along the same axis but in opposite directions, the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as ''examples'' of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.

[[Image:Bell.svg|400px|thumb|The best possible local realist imitation (red) for the quantum correlation of two spins in the singlet state (blue), insisting on perfect anti-correlation at 0°, perfect correlation at 180°. Many other possibilities exist for the classical correlation subject to these side conditions, but all are characterized by sharp peaks (and valleys) at 0°, 180°, and 360°, and none has more extreme values (±0.5) at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°. These values are marked by stars in the graph, and are the values measured in a standard Bell-CHSH type experiment: QM allows {{nowrap|±1/{{sqrt|2}} {{=}} ±0.7071…}}, local realism predicts ±0.5 or less.]]

With the measurements oriented at intermediate angles between these basic cases, the existence of local hidden variables could agree with/would be consistent with a linear dependence of the [[quantum correlation|correlation]] in the angle but, according to Bell's inequality (see below), could not agree with the dependence predicted by quantum mechanical theory, namely, that the correlation is the negative [[cosine]] of the angle.  Experimental results match the curve predicted by quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="C.B. Parker 1994 542"/&gt;

Over the years, Bell's theorem has undergone a wide variety of experimental tests.  However, various [[Bell test loopholes|common deficiencies in the testing of the theorem]] have been identified, including the ''detection loophole''&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem Article on ''Bell's Theorem''] by Abner Shimony in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''communication loophole''.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; Over the years experiments have been gradually improved to better address these loopholes. In 2015, the first experiment to simultaneously address all of the loopholes was performed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

To date, Bell's theorem is generally regarded as supported by a substantial body of evidence and there are few supporters of local hidden variables, though the theorem is continually the subject of study, criticism, and refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Pearson Education|Pearson]]/[[Prentice Hall]] |pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Importance==
Bell's theorem, derived in his seminal 1964 paper titled ''On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox'',&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; has been called, on the assumption that the theory is correct, "the most profound in science".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stapp|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps of equal importance is Bell's deliberate effort to encourage and bring legitimacy to work on the completeness issues, which had fallen into disrepute.&lt;ref name="Bell 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=JS|title=On the impossible pilot wave|url=http://prac.us.edu.pl/~ztpce/QM/Bell_pilot_wave.pdf|journal=Foundations of Physics|year=1982|volume=12|issue=10|pages=989–99|doi=10.1007/bf01889272|bibcode = 1982FoPh...12..989B }} Reprinted in ''Speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics: collected papers on quantum philosophy''. CUP, 2004, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in his life, Bell expressed his hope that such work would "continue to inspire those who suspect that what is proved by the impossibility proofs is lack of imagination."&lt;ref name="Bell 1982"/&gt;

The title of Bell's seminal article refers to the 1935 paper by [[EPR paradox|Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777–780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E|url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/EPR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics.  In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) ''reality'' (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) ''locality'' (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.

In two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] than merely the [[EPR paradox|element of physical reality]] in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to [[stochastic]] theories&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.526|title=Experimental consequences of objective local theories|year=1974|last1=Clauser|first1=John F.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=10|issue=2|pages=526–535|bibcode=1974PhRvD..10..526C|url=http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225072037/http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well, and it was also realised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eberhard |first=P. H. |year=1977 |title=Bell's theorem without hidden variables |journal=[[Nuovo Cimento B]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=75–80 |doi= 10.1007/BF02726212 |url= http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/08/282/8282046.pdf|bibcode = 1977NCimB..38...75E |arxiv=quant-ph/0010047 |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6568 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the theorem is not so much about hidden variables, as about the outcomes of measurements that could have been taken instead of the one actually taken. Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of [[counterfactual definiteness]].

After the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical [[Observer (quantum physics)|observers]], now commonly referred to as [[Alice and Bob|''Alice'' and ''Bob'']], perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a ''[[spin singlet]] state''. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the ''x'' axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an ''element of physical reality'', or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.

In QM, predictions are formulated in terms of [[probability|probabilities]] — for example, the probability that an [[electron]] will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a ''definite'' position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a ''hidden variables theory'', might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.

==Local realism==
The concept of local realism is formalized to state, and prove, Bell's theorem and generalizations.  A common approach is the following:
# There is a [[probability space]] {{math|Λ}} and the observed outcomes by both Alice and Bob result by random sampling of the (unknown, "hidden") parameter {{math|''λ'' ∈ Λ}}.
# The values observed by Alice or Bob are functions of the local detector settings and the hidden parameter only. Thus, there are functions {{math|''A'',''B'' : ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × Λ → {-1, +1} }}, where a detector setting is modeled as a location on the unit sphere {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, such that
#*The value observed by Alice with detector setting {{mvar|a}} is {{math|''A''(''a'', ''λ'')}}
#*The value observed by Bob with detector setting {{mvar|b}} is {{math|''B''(''b'', ''λ'')}}

Perfect anti-correlation would require {{math|''B''(''c'', ''λ'') {{=}} −''A''(''c'', ''λ''), ''c'' ∈ ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Implicit in assumption 1) above, the hidden parameter space {{math|Λ}} has a [[probability measure]] {{mvar|μ}} and the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation]] of a random variable {{mvar|X}} on {{math|Λ}} with respect to {{mvar|μ}} is written

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(X) = \int_\Lambda X(\lambda) p(\lambda) d \lambda, &lt;/math&gt;

where for accessibility of notation we assume that the probability measure has a [[probability density]] {{mvar|p}} that therefore is nonnegative and integrates to {{math|1}}. The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.

== Bell inequalities ==
Bell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by
*:&lt;math&gt;C_e(a, b) = \frac{N_{++} + N_{--} - N_{+-} - N_{-+}}{N_{++} + N_{--} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}},&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;++&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the number of measurements yielding "spin up" in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}} measured by Alice (first subscript {{math|+}}) ''and'' "spin up" in the direction of {{math|'''b'''}} measured by Bob. The other occurrences of {{mvar|N}} are analogously defined.
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by quantum mechanics. This is given by the expression
*:&lt;math&gt;C_q(a, b) = \left\langle A \left|(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf b)^{(2)}(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf a)^{(1)}\right| A \right\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;
:where {{mvar|A}} is the antisymmetric spin wave function. This value is calculated to be
::&lt;math&gt;C_q(a, b) = -\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b.&lt;/math&gt;
*Let {{math|''C''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by any hidden variable theory. In the formalization of above, this is
*:&lt;math&gt;C_h(a, b) = E(A(\mathbf{a}, \lambda) B(\mathbf{b}, \lambda)) = \int_\Lambda A(\mathbf{a}, \lambda)B(\mathbf{b}, \lambda) p(\lambda) d\lambda.&lt;/math&gt;

The two-particle spin space is the [[tensor product]] of the two-dimensional spin Hilbert spaces of the individual particles. Each individual space is an [[Irreducible representation|irreducible representation space]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The product space decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations with definite total spins {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} of dimensions {{math|1}} and {{math|3}} respectively. Full details may be found in [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Clebsch—Gordan decomposition]]. The total spin zero subspace is spanned by the [[singlet state]] in the product space, a vector explicitly given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  |A\rangle =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\alpha^{(1)}\beta^{(2)} - \beta^{(1)}\alpha^{(2)}\right) =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(
    \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
  \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

with adjoint in this representation
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\otimes\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The way single particle operators act on the product space is exemplified below by the example at hand; one defines the tensor product of operators, where the factors are single particle operators, thus if {{math|Π, Ω}} are single particle operators,
:&lt;math&gt;(\Pi \otimes \Omega ) (|x\rangle \otimes |y\rangle) = \Pi|x\rangle \otimes \Omega|y\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^{(1)} (|x\rangle \otimes |y\rangle) \equiv \Pi|x\rangle \otimes \operatorname{Id}|y\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

etc., where the superscript in parentheses indicates on which Hilbert space in the tensor product space the action is intended and the action is defined by the right hand side. The singlet state has total spin {{math|0}} as may be verified by application of the operator of total spin {{math|'''J''' · '''J''' {{=}} ('''J'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⋅ ('''J'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''J'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} by a calculation similar to that presented below.

The expectation value of the operator
:&lt;math&gt;
  \left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b}\right)^{(2)}\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a}\right)^{(1)} =
  \left(\operatorname{Id} \otimes \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b}\right)\left(\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \operatorname{Id}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

in the singlet state can be calculated straightforwardly. One has, by definition of the [[Pauli matrices]],

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \operatorname{Id} = \begin{bmatrix} a_z &amp; a_x - ia_y \\ a_x + ia_y &amp; -a_z \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Upon left application of this on {{ket|''A''}} one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{a} \otimes \mathrm{Id} |A\rangle =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(
    \begin{bmatrix}a_z \\ a_x + ia_y\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}a_x - ia_y \\ -a_z\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}
  \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, application (to the left) of the operator corresponding to {{math|'''b'''}} on {{bra|''A''}} yields

:&lt;math&gt;
  \langle A|\operatorname{Id} \otimes \boldsymbol{\sigma} \cdot \mathbf{b} =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}b_x + ib_y &amp; -b_z\end{bmatrix} -
    \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix}b_z &amp; b_x - ib_y\end{bmatrix}
  \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

The inner products on the tensor product space is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \otimes y|u \otimes v\rangle = \langle x|u\rangle\langle y|v\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Given this, the expectation value reduces to
:&lt;math&gt;\langle A|(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf b)^{(2)}(\boldsymbol\sigma \cdot \mathbf a)^{(1)}|A\rangle = -\mathbf a \cdot \mathbf b.&lt;/math&gt;
----
{{Hidden end}}
With this notation, a concise summary of what follows can be made.
*Theoretically, there exists {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} such that
::&lt;math&gt;C_q \ne C_h,&lt;/math&gt;
:whatever are the particular characteristics of the hidden variable theory as long as it abides to the rules of local realism as defined above. That is to say, no local hidden variable theory can make the same predictions as quantum mechanics.
*Experimentally, instances of
::&lt;math&gt;C_e \ne C_h&lt;/math&gt;
:have been found (whatever the hidden variable theory), but 
::&lt;math&gt;C_e \ne C_q\quad \text{(not found)}&lt;/math&gt;
:has never been found. That is to say, predictions of quantum mechanics have never been falsified by experiment. These experiments include such that can rule out local hidden variable theories. But see below on possible loopholes.

=== Original Bell's inequality ===
The inequality that Bell derived can then be written as:&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_h(a, c) - C_h(b, a) - C_h(b, c) \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|c}} refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create ''perfect'' anti-correlation.

This simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips {{mvar|X, Y}}, and ''Z'', with the property that:
#''X'' and ''Y'' give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time
#''Y'' and ''Z'' also give the same outcome 99% of the time,

then ''X'' and ''Z'' must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Y'' (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between ''Y'' and ''Z'' (1/100) are together the ''maximum possible'' number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Z'' (a simple [[Fréchet inequalities|Boole–Fréchet inequality]]).

Imagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.

Start with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say ''f'', now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction ''f'' of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2''f''.

Compare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle {{mvar|θ}}, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately &lt;math&gt;f_1=\theta^2/4&lt;/math&gt; as explained by [[small-angle approximation]]. At two times this small angle, the chance of a mismatch is therefore about 4 times larger, since &lt;math&gt;f_2=(2\theta)^2/4=2^2 \theta^2/4 \approx 4f_1&lt;/math&gt;. But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.

This intuitive formulation is due to [[David Mermin]]. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.

===CHSH inequality===
{{Main article|CHSH inequality}}
Generalizing Bell's original inequality,&lt;ref name=Bell1964/&gt; [[John Clauser]], Michael Horne, [[Abner Shimony]] and R. A. Holt introduced the [[CHSH inequality]],&lt;ref name="Clauser 1969"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.23.880 |title=Proposed Experiment to Test Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1969 |last1=Clauser |first1=John |last2=Horne |first2=Michael |last3=Shimony |first3=Abner |last4=Holt |first4=Richard |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=23 |issue=15 |pages=880–884|bibcode = 1969PhRvL..23..880C}}&lt;/ref&gt; which puts classical limits on the set of four correlations in Alice and Bob's experiment, without any assumption of perfect correlations (or anti-correlations) at equal settings

:&lt;math&gt;(1) \quad C_h(a,b) + C_h(a,b') + C_h(a',b) - C_h(a',b') \leq 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Making the special choice &lt;math&gt;a'=b+\pi&lt;/math&gt;, denoting &lt;math&gt;b'=c&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming perfect anti-correlation at equal settings, perfect correlation at opposite settings, therefore &lt;math&gt;\rho(a,a+\pi)=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho(b,a+\pi)=-\rho(b,a)&lt;/math&gt;, the CHSH inequality reduces to the original Bell inequality. Nowadays, (1) is also often simply called "the Bell inequality", but sometimes more completely "the Bell-CHSH inequality".

==== Derivation ====
With abbreviated notation

:&lt;math&gt;A = A(a, \lambda), A' = A(a', \lambda), B = B(b, \lambda), B' = B(b', \lambda),&lt;/math&gt;

the CHSH inequality can be derived as follows. Each of the four quantities is {{math|±1}} and each depends on {{mvar|λ}}. It follows that for any {{math|''λ'' ∈ Λ}}, one of {{math|''B'' + ''B''&amp;prime;}} and {{math|''B'' − ''B''&amp;prime;}} is zero, and the other is {{math|±2}}. From this it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;AB + AB' + A'B - A'B'= A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right) \leq 2,&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  C_h(a, b) + C_h\left(a, b'\right) + C_h\left(a', b\right) - C_h\left(a', b'\right) 
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda ABp d\lambda + \int_\Lambda AB'p d\lambda + \int_\Lambda A'Bp d\lambda - \int_\Lambda A'B'p d\lambda \\
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda \left(AB + AB' + A'B - A'B'\right)p d\lambda \\
    &amp;= \int_\Lambda \left(A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right)\right) p d\lambda \leq 2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At the heart of this derivation is a simple algebraic inequality concerning four variables, {{math|''A'', ''A''&amp;prime;, ''B'', ''B''&amp;prime;}}, which take the values {{math|±1}} only:

:&lt;math&gt;AB + AB' + A'B - A'B' = A\left(B + B'\right) + A'\left(B - B'\right) \le 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The CHSH inequality is seen to depend only on the following three key features of a local hidden variables theory: (1) realism: alongside of the outcomes of actually performed measurements, the outcomes of potentially performed measurements also exist at the same time; (2) locality, the outcomes of measurements on Alice's particle don't depend on which measurement Bob chooses to perform on the other particle; (3) freedom: Alice and Bob can indeed choose freely which measurements to perform.

The ''realism'' assumption is actually somewhat idealistic, and Bell's theorem only proves non-locality with respect to variables that only ''exist'' for metaphysical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}. However, before the discovery of quantum mechanics, both realism and locality were completely uncontroversial features of physical theories.

==Bell inequalities are violated by quantum mechanical predictions==
The measurements performed by Alice and Bob are spin measurements on electrons. Alice can choose between two detector settings labeled ''a'' and ''a''′; these settings correspond to measurement of spin along the ''z'' or the ''x'' axis. Bob can choose between two detector settings labeled ''b'' and ''b''′; these correspond to measurement of spin along the ''z''′ or ''x''′ axis, where the {{math|''x''′ − ''z''′}} coordinate system is rotated 135° relative to the {{math|''x'' − ''z''}} coordinate system.  The spin observables are represented by the 2 × 2 self-adjoint matrices:

:&lt;math&gt; S_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp;  0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad S_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]] normalized so that the corresponding eigenvalues are {{math|±1}}. As is customary, we use the [[bra–ket notation]] to denote the eigenvectors of {{mvar|S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} by

:&lt;math&gt; \left|+x\right\rang, \quad \left|-x\right\rang. &lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be the spin singlet state for a pair of electrons discussed in the EPR paradox.  This is a specially constructed state described by the following vector in the tensor product

:&lt;math&gt;|\phi\rang = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \, \left|+x\right\rang \otimes \left|-x\right\rang -\left|-x\right\rang \otimes \left|+x\right\rang \, \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now let us apply the CHSH formalism to the measurements that can be performed by Alice and Bob.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A(a)  &amp;= S_z \otimes I\\
  A(a') &amp;= S_x \otimes I\\
  B(b)  &amp;= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ I \otimes (S_z + S_x)\\
  B(b') &amp;=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ I \otimes (S_z - S_x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The operators &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B(b'), B(b)&lt;/math&gt; correspond to Bob's spin measurements along ''x''′ and ''z''′. Note that the {{mvar|A}} operators commute with the {{mvar|B}} operators, so we can apply our calculation for the correlation. In this case, we can show that the CHSH inequality fails. In fact, a straightforward calculation shows that {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \left\langle A(a) B(b) \right\rangle = \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B(b) \right\rangle =
    \left\langle A\left(a'\right) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle &amp;=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
                \left\langle A(a) B\left(b'\right) \right\rangle &amp;= -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

Bell's Theorem: If the quantum mechanical formalism is correct, then the system consisting of a pair of entangled electrons cannot satisfy the principle of local realism.  Note that {{math|2{{sqrt|2}}}} is indeed the upper bound for quantum mechanics called [[Tsirelson's bound]]. The operators giving this maximal value are always [[isomorphic]] to the Pauli matrices.

Experimental tests can determine whether the Bell inequalities required by local realism hold up to the empirical evidence.

Actually, most experiments have been performed using polarization of photons rather than spin of electrons (or other spin-half particles). The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left (|V\rangle\otimes |V\rangle+|H\rangle\otimes|H\rangle \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).

When the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45° with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90° to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle {{mvar|θ}} to one another, the correlation is {{math|cos(2''θ'')}}. So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period {{mvar|π}} instead of {{math|2''π''}}.

Bell's inequalities are tested by "coincidence counts" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.

Bell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.

===Two classes of Bell inequalities===
The ''fair sampling'' problem was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser&lt;ref name="Clauser–Freedman"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938 |title=Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1972 |last1=Freedman |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Clauser |first2=John F. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=938–941|bibcode = 1972PhRvL..28..938F |url= http://dieumsnh.qfb.umich.mx/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Freedman.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; used ''fair sampling'' in the form of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH&lt;ref name="Clauser 1969"/&gt;) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"/&gt;  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,&lt;ref name="Garg &amp; Mermin, 1987"&gt;{{citation |author1=Anupam Garg |author2=N.D. Mermin |year=1987 |title=Detector inefficiencies in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment |journal=Phys. Rev. D |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=3831–5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.35.3831|bibcode = 1987PhRvD..35.3831G }}&lt;/ref&gt; but have very low dark rate and short dead and resolving times. This is now within reach.

===Practical challenges===
{{Main article|Loopholes in Bell test experiments}}

Because, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne&lt;ref name="Clauser–Horne"/&gt; recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the ''No Enhancement Hypothesis'' (NEH):

{{quote|A light signal, originating in an [[atomic cascade]] for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.}}

Given this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.

The experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,&lt;ref name="Clauser–Freedman"/&gt; who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.

While early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1-link=Margaret D. Reid |first1=M. D. |last1=Reid |first2=D. F. |last2=Walls |title= Violations of classical inequalities in quantum optics|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=34|issue=2 |pages=1260–1276|year=1986|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.34.1260|bibcode = 1986PhRvA..34.1260R }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving improved generation and detection properties. As a result, the most recent experiments with photons no longer suffer from the detection loophole (see [[Bell test experiments]]). This makes the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes have been surmounted, albeit presently only in separate experiments (Giustina et al. (2013), ''Bell violation using entangled photons without the fair-sampling assumption'', Nature 497, 227–230; B.G. Christensen et al. (2013), ''Detection-Loophole-Free Test of Quantum Nonlocality, and Applications'', arXiv:1306.5772).

== Metaphysical aspects ==
Most advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local [[hidden variable theory]], in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05677 |title=An experimental test of non-local realism |year=2007 |last1=Gröblacher |first1=Simon |last2=Paterek |first2=Tomasz |last3=Kaltenbaek |first3=Rainer |last4=Brukner |first4=Časlav |last5=Żukowski |first5=Marek |last6=Aspelmeyer |first6=Markus |last7=Zeilinger |first7=Anton |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7138 |pages=871–5 |pmid=17443179|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..871G | arxiv= 0704.2529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past [[light cone]]. This is the idea behind a [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|year=1986|last1=Cramer|first1=John|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume=58| issue=3| pages=647–687| bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has argued that the [[superdeterminism]] loophole cannot be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=0908.3408 |author1=Gerard 't Hooft |title=Entangled quantum states in a local deterministic theory |class=quant-ph |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0701097|author1=Gerard 't Hooft|title=The Free-Will Postulate in Quantum Mechanics |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible (but not universally accepted) solution is offered by the [[many-worlds interpretation|many worlds theory]] of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement does not lead to a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.

This point underlines the fact that the argument that realism is incompatible with quantum mechanics and locality depends on a particular formalization of the concept of realism. In its weakest form, the assumption underpinning that particular formalization is called [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This is the assumption that outcomes of measurements that are not performed are just as real as those of measurements that were performed.  Counterfactual definiteness is an uncontroversial property of all classical physical theories prior to quantum theory, due to their determinism. Many worlds interpretations are not only counterfactually indefinite, but are also factually indefinite. The results of all experiments, even ones that have been performed, are not uniquely determined.

If one chooses to reject counterfactual definiteness, reality has been made smaller, and there is no non-locality problem. On the other hand, one is thereby introducing irreducible or intrinsic randomness into our picture of the world: randomness that cannot be "explained" as merely the reflection of our ignorance of underlying, variable, physical quantities. Non-determinism becomes a fundamental property of nature.

Assuming counterfactual definiteness, reality has been enlarged, and there is a non-locality problem. On the other hand, in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, reality consists only of a deterministically evolving wave function and non-locality is a non-issue.

There have also been repeated claims that Bell's arguments are irrelevant because they depend on hidden assumptions that, in fact, are questionable.  For example, [[E. T. Jaynes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Clearing up Mysteries—The Original Goal |year=1989 |last1=Jaynes |first1=E. T. |journal=Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods |pages=1–27 | url=http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf |doi=10.1007/978-94-015-7860-8_1|isbn=978-90-481-4044-2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.46.1264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1989 that there are two hidden assumptions in Bell's theorem that could limit its generality. According to him:
# Bell interpreted conditional probability P(X|Y) as a causal inference, i.e. Y exerted a causal inference on X in reality.  However, P(X|Y) actually only means logical inference (induction).  Causes cannot travel faster than light or backward in time, but deduction can.
# Bell's inequality does not apply to some possible hidden variable theories. It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.

However, [[Richard D. Gill]] has argued that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis. Gill points out that in the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by [[Steve Gull]] presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Time, Finite Statistics, and Bell's Fifth Position |year=2003 |last1=Gill |first1=Richard D. |journal=Proc. Of "Foundations of Probability and Physics - 2", Ser. Math. Modelling in Phys., Engin., and Cogn. Sc. |volume=5/2002| pages=179–206 |arxiv= quant-ph/0301059|bibcode = 2003quant.ph..1059G }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would probably take us another 30 years to fully appreciate Gull's stunning result.

In 2006 a flurry of activity about implications for determinism arose with the paper: [[Free will theorem|''The Free Will Theorem'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Conway | first = John |author2=Simon Kochen | year = 2006 | title = The Free Will Theorem | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = 1441–1473 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9068-6 |arxiv = quant-ph/0604079 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36.1441C }}&lt;/ref&gt; which stated "the response of a spin 1 particle to a triple experiment is free—that is to say, is not a function of properties of that part of the universe that is earlier than this response with respect to any given inertial frame."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Conway, John H. |author2=Simon Kochen  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The strong free will theorem |journal= Notices of the AMS |volume=56 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=226–232 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200226p.pdf?q=will&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=k71jU8X7DoypyASw9YGoCA&amp;ved=0CCAQFjAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7L-k87yWE32ru0rDjkLOdg12LRQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem raised awareness of a tension between determinism fully governing an experiment (on the one hand) and Alice and Bob being free to choose any settings they like for their observations (on the other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cator, Eric |author2=Klaas Landsman  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Constraints on determinism: Bell versus Conway–Kochen |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=44 |issue=7 |year=2014 |pages=781–791 |doi=10.1007/s10701-014-9815-z|arxiv = 1402.1972 |bibcode = 2014FoPh...44..781C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Esfeld, Michael |title=Bell's Theorem and the Issue of Determinism and Indeterminism |journal= Foundations of Physics |year=2015 |pages= 471–482|arxiv = 1503.00660 | doi = 10.1007/s10701-015-9883-8 |volume=45|issue=5 |bibcode = 2015FoPh...45..471E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher David Hodgson supports this theorem as showing that determinism is ''unscientific'', and that quantum mechanics allows observers (at least in some instances) the freedom to make observations of their choosing, thereby leaving the door open for free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=David Hodgson |title=Rationality + Consciousness = Free Will |chapter=Chapter 7: Science and determinism |isbn=9780199845309 |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4SGsmowYARsC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Conway+and+Kochen+call+the+free+will+theorem%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UiMYVeTBII3woATFkoKAAQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Conway%20and%20Kochen%20call%20the%20free%20will%20theorem%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General remarks==
The violations of Bell's inequalities, due to quantum entanglement, provide near definitive demonstrations of something that was already strongly suspected: that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the classical picture of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roger |last=Penrose |title=The Road to Reality |edition= |page=583 |year=2007 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-77631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some earlier elements that had seemed incompatible with classical pictures included [[Complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] and [[wavefunction collapse]]. The Bell violations show that no resolution of such issues can avoid the ultimate strangeness of quantum behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Abers |title=Quantum Mechanics |edition= |pages=193–195 |year=2004 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=9780131461000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPR paper "pinpointed" the unusual properties of the ''entangled states'', e.g. the above-mentioned singlet state, which is the foundation for present-day applications of quantum physics, such as [[quantum cryptography]]; one application involves the measurement of quantum entanglement as a physical source of bits for [[Michael O. Rabin|Rabin's]] [[oblivious transfer]] protocol. This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the "entangledness" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any local theory.

What is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular physical theory. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.G.

{{Globalize/US|date=May 2013}}

'''Bicultural identity''' is the condition of being oneself regarding the combination of two cultures. The term can also be defined as [[biculturalism]], which is the presence of two different cultures in the same country or region. As a general term, culture involves the behaviors and belief characteristics of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. Within culture, we have cultural effects, which are the shared behaviors and customs we learn from the institutions around us. An example of a cultural effect would be how an individual’s personality is strongly influenced by the biological and social norms he is exposed to. Another cultural effect would be that in some societies it would be more [[acceptable]] to dress or act in a certain way.

In regards to bicultural identity, an individual may face conflict assimilating into both cultures or finding a balance between both. An individual may face challenges assimilating into the whole, collective culture. Similarly, an individual may face difficulty balancing their identity within themselves due to the influence of both of their cultures. Being an individual with identity plurality can be hard mentally and emotionally. The different levels of biculturalism can be defined though the way people are able to simultaneously manage their two selves. The more they alternate between them, the more cognitive complexity they face, since they avoid cultural duality and do not practice handling both cultures at the same time. It is through identity integration that they will be able to solve the problem and alleviate the tolls that come with identity plurality &lt;ref&gt;Kramer, T., Lau-Gesk, L., &amp; Chiu, C. (2009). The interactive effects of duality expertise and coping frames on responses to ambivalent messages. Journal of Consumer Psychology (Elsevier Science), 19(4), 661-672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzsimmons, S. R. (2013). Multicultural employees: a framework for understanding how they contribute to organizations. Academy of Management Review, 38(4), 525-549&lt;/ref&gt; Bicultural identity also may have positive effects on the individual, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire from belonging to more than one culture. Furthermore, with the growing number of racial minorities in American society, individuals that identify with more than one culture may have more linguistic ability.

== Biculturalism  and personality ==

Culture affects the personality of an individual because the individual may react in a way that is reflective of the knowledge one acquires from one or more culture(s). Problems may arise when ideals in one culture are not connected to another culture, which may cause generalizations about personality. Personality is shaped by both cultures and thus generalizations should not be made based on one single culture.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, H. (2012). Personality: Classic theories and modern research. Pearson Higher Education: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; One’s culture also influences one’s hormonal changes, one’s interaction with violence and one’s family values. For example, Hispanic American culture often requires older children to take care and/or help raise younger siblings, while mainstream American culture interprets parents as the sole caregivers. Another example of this difference would be religious preference and or practice. Cultures other than the American culture may often identify more with certain religions and are often more in tune with their religious beliefs.

== Measuring bicultural identity ==

=== Bicultural Identity Integration ===

One construct to measure bicultural identity is the Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) construct. It is a relatively new construct and was proposed in 2002 by Benet-Martínez, Leu, Lee &amp; Morris. The BII looks at how the bicultural individual perceives his bicultural identities and whether they are compatible or oppositional. It also seeks to identify the big five aspects of an individual’s personality, including aspects such as sociability, activity and emotionality.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, V., J.; Haritatos (2002). "Bicultural Identity Integration (BII): Components and psychosocial antecedents". Journal of Personality 73: 1015-1050.&lt;/ref&gt; The BII seeks to find whether an individual has a cultural distance or conflict within one’s cultures, which in turn helps indicate how biculturally competent we are.

Low BII bicultural individuals have difficulties in incorporating both cultures into a cohesive identity and tend to see both cultures as highly dissimilar. Bicultural individuals with high BII on the other hand, see their identities as complementary and themselves as part of a “third” culture, which integrates elements from both their cultures.
According to Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, individuals respond in a more stable fashion when their cultural contexts are understood. 
Researchers wanted to examine how these differences could relate to other factors and the results are insightful. BII is significantly associated with the psychological and social adjustments of the bicultural. Low BII bicultural individuals are found to have inferior bilingual proficiency, experience more anxiety, depression and are more neurotic and less open than bicultural individuals with high BII.
More importantly, low BII bicultural individuals are not chameleon-like. They resist the frame switching and are more likely to respond in ways inconsistent with the cultural cues. In other words, when low BII Chinese-Americans are presented with American cues, unlike high BII bicultural individuals, they would not behave like Americans but instead, more like a Chinese.
However, the identity struggle for bicultural individuals can be made less arduous. It is important to note that like other personality traits, BII is malleable to contextual factors. BII can be increased by asking bicultural individuals to recall positive cross-cultural exchanges or like in another study, make high-level construals. These findings can be useful in for example, helping immigrants to cope with their new environment.

== Bicultural identity and language ==

[[Language]] is an essential aspect of any culture. Individuals are able to maintain key aspects of their culture by maintaining their culture’s language. Language is important because it is an oral form of how people interact with other people within a society. Language reinforces the ties among the people who speak the same language, and thus encourages cultural bonding.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S.. "Two languages, two personalities? Examining language effects on personality in the bilingual context.". Unpublished doctoral dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by preserving the language within both of one’s cultures, one can maintain one’s integration within each culture. However, this can result in a difficulty in integrating one’s cultures if each has a distinct, different language as it can prevent outsiders from understanding that particular culture.

=== Cultural frame switching ===

The concept of cultural frame switching (CFS) or [[double consciousness]] made popular by [[W.E.B Du Bois]] addresses how an individual switches between cultural frames or systems in response to their environment. The presence of culture-specific peers can elicit culture-specific values.&lt;ref&gt;Benet-Martinez, V., J., F., M.; Leu, Lee, Morris (2002). "Negotiating biculturalism: Cultural frame switching in biculturals with oppositional versus compatible cultural identities". Journal of Cross-cultural Psychology 33: 492–516.&lt;/ref&gt; CFS can be used to describe the switching of different language use depending on the context. Thus, CFS can be connected to cultural accommodation, which is seen when bilinguals respond to situations with the language that applies best to the situation present. 
It is evident that language can have an effect on an individual’s thinking process; this is because the language itself primes the individual’s cultural values, attitudes and memory which in turn affects behavior. Thus, language has a powerful effect on the way in which an individual responds to change.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Cultural perspectives ==

=== African American culture ===

[[African American]] culture is also known as black culture in the [[United States]] and the identity of African American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African American people. It is rooted in [[Africa]], and is a blend of sub-Saharan African and Sahelean cultures. Due to aspects of African American culture that were accentuated by the slavery period, African American culture is dynamic. 
Within the African American culture, race or physical differences led to mass murder, and violence against racial groups. These occurrences may affect an individual’s perception of their African American culture. 
In America, Black and White differences are the most significant groupings largely because of American history. The US was founded on the principle of “all men are equal” and yet slavery existed. This is what resulted in the [[American Dilemma]]. Thus, due to historical reasons, and because they are often stereotyped, African Americans have difficulty assimilating with their culture and American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guan, M., F., E.; Lee, Cole (2012). "Complexity of culture: The role of identity and context in bicultural individuals' body ideals". Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology 18 (3): 247-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian American culture ===

Individuals having origins within the Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent are referred to as Asian under the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. [[Asian American]] complete 4.8% of the U.S. population alone. Asian Americans have had the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial demographic in the country and attain the highest median personal income overall, {{as of|2008|lc=y}}. Thus, Asian American Culture is often depicted as the most similar culture to American Culture.  
Asian Americans often communicate non-verbally and/or indirectly, and often are not as bold or upfront as other cultures in terms of their communication. The Asian American way of life is much more group-oriented or holistic and thus the way in which they interpret the world is systematically different from American Culture in terms of thought process and lifestyle. This may make it difficult for Asian Americans to assimilate easily into American culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Hispanic American culture ===

[[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have origins in the countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula consisting of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. Hispanic Americans are very racially diverse. Hispanics constitute 16.5% of the total United States population. 
Hispanic Americans often are very religiously oriented and focus on family values and the importance of intergenerational connections. This may cause difficulty in integration with American culture, as the Hispanic community often emphasizes the importance of helping one’s family and advancing as a family rather than simply individual success, which is more prominent within American Culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mok, A., M.; Morris (2012). "Bicultural self-defense in consumer contexts: Self-protection motives are the basis for contrast versus assimilation to cultural cues". Journal of Consumer Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hispanics may have difficulty associating with American Culture because of the language culture, as most Hispanics can speak Spanish. The ability to speak Spanish is valued greatly within Hispanic culture, as it is greatly used during social gatherings and amongst extended family. The Spanish language is a significant part of Hispanic culture, and because of the vast amount of racial differences within Hispanic Americans, the way in which Spanish is spoken within the different racial groups is often different. This makes it not only difficult to assimilate into American culture but to often assimilate with the different races in Hispanic America.

== Immigrant experience ==

[[Immigrants]] particularly find it difficult to assimilate both their cultural contexts. Immigrants need to reconcile both their current host cultures and their culture of origin, which is where they grew up. Immigrants culturally evolve through a process of adaptation and assimilation. Immigrants are usually influenced by more dominant values that they have learned in their native cultures. Immigrants encounter a major upheaval by moving far away from home and sometimes may never find themselves connected to either culture. Immigrants face many [[stress (psychological)|stresses]], which can raise their risk for [[substance abuse]] and other psychological stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Dong, Q., D., J.; Gundlach, Phillips (2006). "The impact of bicultural identity on immigrant socialization through television viewing in the United States". Journal of Intercultural Communication Studies 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Developing a bicultural identity is involves blending two cultures together and learning to be competent within their two cultures. Immigrants and children of these individuals may be more at risk for victimization, poverty, and the need for assistance from the government. Immigrant parents for example may struggle to find a balance in their new lives and may be so busy keeping up with the demands that may be less involved in the community and in turn less involved with their child’s education.

With immigrants, language barriers may also bring hardship in terms of communication with natives of their less dominant culture. Immigrants may not adapt fully because of the language barriers holding them back from even simple conversation. [[Acculturation]] is the process in which a bicultural individual or immigrant adopts the social norms of the mainstream society. The cultural gap between immigrant parents and their children may widen due to acculturation because younger generations find it easier to adapt to the new culture. Family relations may be strained due to this issue. Children of immigrant parents may enjoy more [[mainstream]] culture, but may also want to stick to their families’ roots in order to please their caregivers. Immigrants and bicultural families do have more positive roles as well. They have strong commitments to family and have a dream for a better life. This in turns gives families a sense of purpose and connection and makes the family unit stronger. Native customs such as holidays and religious affiliations may also support the family unit and promote unity all around.

== Integration ==

=== Social and workplace interactions ===

Individuals with bicultural identity face issues around stereotype threat. Others may be perceived negatively, or their judgments may in turn alter the way that one behaves in certain situations. For example, with standardized testing, African American students in low-income areas often do worse on a given test due to the expectations for them to do worse. Stereotype threat is so powerful that it may extend on to different areas of life, such as the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Mok, M., W.; Morris (2012). "Managing two cultural identities: The malleability of bicultural identity integration as a function of induced global or local processing". Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 38 (2): 233-246.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a multidimensional concept that may affect an individual on many levels. Stereotype threat makes it harder for individuals to integrate successfully with their peers if they feel judged or feel pressures to exceed in certain ways especially if their dual cultural roles may be in conflict with one another. Thiese scenarios are contingent on an individual's success with [[acculturation]] strategies.

A bicultural individual's integration into a workplace also depends on the cultural makeup of his or her team. A team can be categorized as culturally homogenous, culturally diverse, or possessing a cultural faultline.&lt;ref&gt;Dau, L.A. (2016). “Biculturalism, Team Performance, and Cultural-faultline Bridges,” Journal of International Management 22 (1): 48-62.&lt;/ref&gt; A bicultural is more likely to integrate with a team, possessing the skills to form a cultural attachment with homogenous or heterogenous teams by traversing cultural barriers.

=== Family dynamics and integration ===

Caregivers also face a dilemma with their children who have bicultural identities; they want to instill pride in their children, but also must prepare their children for prejudice without making them feel inferior to other cultural groups. For example, African-American parents must socialize their children in such a manner where they will be prepared to face discrimination in society, but they also must preserve their culture in such a way that makes them feel prideful. This dilemma that parents face makes it harder for individuals to feel comfortable within social groups and may minimize the different cultures that individuals surround themselves with.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, V., S., L., C., A., E.; Martinez, Wallace, Medrano, Robledo, Hernandez (2012). "The connections between Latino ethnic identity and adult experiences". Adult Education Quarterly 62 (1): 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals can develop a more multicultural outlook and feel confident being around many kinds of people, whereas others may have an issue with this and may stick to their own cultural group.

== Academics and attitudes towards education ==

Academics within individuals with bicultural identity may also be aversely affected in terms of stereotype threat. An individual may lose motivation in a scholastic setting due to the negative expectations placed on them. Attitudes may change within academics if a student feels as though he cannot do well due to societal constraints on his particular culture. Although this may discourage some, specific tests have been made in order to integrate culture within standardized testing.

A system created by Jane Mercer, assumes that test results cannot be distanced from the culture and it focuses on comparisons among people within particular culture groups rather than between culture groups. This system has been applied to intelligence and ability examinations in order to combat the concern of disadvantaged minorities doing poorly due to their incapacity to do as well as their counterparts.

'''Blood diamonds''' (also called '''conflict diamonds''', '''war diamonds''', '''hot diamonds''', or '''red diamonds''') is a term used for a [[diamond]] [[Diamond mining|mined]] in a war zone and sold to finance an [[insurgency]], an invading army's war efforts, or a [[warlord]]'s activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds [[Diamond mining|mined]] during the recent civil wars in [[Angola]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Guinea]], and [[Guinea Bissau]] have been given the label.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20121023004513/http://www.un.org/peace/africa/Diamond.html Conflict Diamonds].''

==History==

===Angola===
Reports estimated that as much as 20% of the total diamond production in the 1980s was being sold for illegal and unethical purposes and 19% was specifically ''conflict'' in nature.&lt;ref name=PACWEB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blooddiamond.pacweb.org/kimberlyprocess/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116014842/http://blooddiamond.pacweb.org/kimberlyprocess/ |archivedate=2007-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, the illegal diamond trade was estimated by the [[World Diamond Council]] to have been reduced to 4% of the world's diamond production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddiamondcouncil.com/estimate.shtml%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7c%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7cwork=worlddiamondcouncil.com%7ctitle=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM%7cwork=worlddiamondcouncil.com|title=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM|work=worlddiamondcouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211002030/http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/index.html |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Diamond Council]] reported that by 2004 this percentage had fallen to approximately 1% and up to today the World Diamond Council refers to this illegal trade to be virtually eliminated, meaning that more than 99% of diamonds being sold have a legal background. &lt;ref name=PACWEB/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venetiamajor.com.au/services/diamonds-gemstones/conflict-diamonds/|title=Conflict Diamonds|work=Venetia Major - Bespoke Jewellery|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410042847/http://www.venetiamajor.com.au/services/diamonds-gemstones/conflict-diamonds/|archivedate=2013-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the UN Resolution, UNITA was able to continue to sell or trade some diamonds in order to finance its war effort. The UN set out to find how this remaining illicit trade was being conducted and appointed Canadian ambassador [[Robert Fowler (diplomat)|Robert Fowler]] to investigate. In 2000, he produced the [[Fowler Report]], which named those countries, organizations and individuals involved in the trade.  The report is credited with establishing the link between diamonds and third world conflicts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4kNErbPSzUUC|title=Diamonds and Conflict: Problems and Solutions|author=Arthur V.

Still, after the report was published in 2013 smugglers from these African countries were selling blood diamonds through channels less sophisticated such as social media posts. And rhinestones from Angola, produced by UNITA were being traded to Cameroon to get them a Cameroonian certificate naturalization to then be sold as legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chutel |first1=Lynsey |title=Selling blood diamonds is as simple as a Facebook post and a WhatsApp message |url=https://qz.com/africa/1014548/blood-diamonds-from-central-african-republic-are-sold-over-facebook-and-whatsapp/ |website=Quartz Africa |publisher=Quartz Africa |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ivory Coast===
[[Ivory Coast]]  began to develop a fledgling diamond mining industry in the early 1990s. A [[Coup d'état|coup]] overthrew the government in 1999, starting a civil war. The country became a route for exporting diamonds from Liberia and war-torn Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213064137/http://www.diamondfacts.org/conflict/background.html |archivedate=2006-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=heartmatter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/heartmatter.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120121759/http://www.sierra-leone.org/heartmatter.html |archivedate=2007-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign investment began to withdraw from Ivory Coast. To curtail the illegal trade, the nation stopped all diamond mining and the [[UN Security Council]] banned all exports of diamonds from Ivory Coast in December 2005. This ban lasted about ten years but it was later lifted in April 2014 when members of the UN council voted to suspend the sanction. The Kimberley process officials also notified in November 2013 that Ivory Coast was right producing artisanal diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Land of Conflict: Ivory Coast Diamonds |url=https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry-history/land-conflict-ivory-coast-diamonds/ |website=Israeli Diamond Industry |publisher=The Israeli Diamond Industry |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt;

Despite UN sanctions the illicit diamond trade still exists in Ivory Coast. Rough diamonds are exported out of the country to neighboring states and international trading centers through the northern [[Forces Nouvelles de Côte d'Ivoire|Forces Nouvelles]] controlled section of the country, a group which is reported to be using these funds of chele to re-arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/861/en/campaigners_call_for_urgent_action_on_zimbabwe_blo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902191501/http://www.globalwitness.org/media_library_detail.php/861/en/campaigners_call_for_urgent_action_on_zimbabwe_blo |archivedate=2010-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/550/99/PDF/N0955099.pdf?OpenElement|title=ODS HOME PAGE|author=ODS Team|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (formerly [[Zaire]]) has suffered numerous looting wars in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miningafrica.net/mining-countries-africa/democratic-republic-of-congo/|title=Democratic Republic of Congo|work=Mining Africa|access-date=2017-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been a member of the Kimberley Process since 2003 and now exports about 8% of the world's diamonds.&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt;'However, even nowadays there is a warning concerning diamonds proceeding from this area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Enforcement |url=https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/enforcement |website=Kimberley Process |publisher=Kimberley Process |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there have been multiple cases of fake Kimberley certificates accompanying the gems. Once one of [[De Beers]]  most celebrated and priceless diamonds, the D-colour {{convert|777|carat|g}} [[Millennium Star]] was discovered in the DRC and sold to De Beers, in open competition with other diamond buyers, between 1991 and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacAskill|first1=Ewen|last2=McGreal|first2=Chris|last3=Vidal|first3=John|title=Blood, sweat and ice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/nov/09/features11.g2|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberia===
From 1989 to 2003, [[Liberia]] was engaged in [[Second Liberian Civil War|a civil war]]. In 2000, the UN accused Liberian president [[Charles G. Taylor]] of supporting the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) insurgency in neighboring [[Sierra Leone]] with weapons and training in exchange for diamonds.&lt;ref name="pssure"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[United Nations]] applied sanctions on the Liberian diamond trade. In August 2003, Taylor stepped down as president and, after being exiled to [[Nigeria]], faced trial in [[The Hague]]. On July 21, 2006, he pleaded not guilty to [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s,&lt;ref name=DFORGConflictbackground/&gt; of which he was found guilty in April 2012.  On May 30, 2012, he began a 50-year sentence in a high security prison in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news

Around the time of the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], [[al-Qaeda]] allegedly bought gems from Liberia as some of its other financial assets were frozen.&lt;ref name="BBCal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2775763.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Al-Qaeda 'traded blood diamonds'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having regained peace, Liberia is attempting to construct a legitimate diamond mining industry. The UN has lifted sanctions and Liberia is now a member of the [[Kimberley Process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Security Council votes to lift ban on Liberian diamond exports|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-security-council-votes-to-lift-ban-on-liberian-diamond-exports-1.689632|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 however, Liberian diamonds were reported to be partly produced using [[child labor]] according to the U.S. Department of Labor's ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.

=== Sierra Leone ===
The [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]] started in 1991 and continued until 2002, costing at least 50,000 lives and causing local people to suffer killings, mutilation, rape, torture and abduction, mainly due to the brutal warfare waged by rebel group, the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF). The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) claimed that they supported causes of justice and democracy in the beginning, but later on they started to control the villages and to prevent local people from voting for the new government by chopping off their limbs. Victims included children and infants. It created numerous examples of physical and psychological harm across Sierra Leone.&amp;nbsp;

Moreover, they also occupied the diamond mines in order to get access to funding and continued support of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smillie|first=I|date=2013|title=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|url=|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|volume=46(04)|pages=1004-1004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during that time, RUF was mining up to $125 million of diamonds yearly. Since diamonds are used as a funding source, they also created opportunities for tax evasion and financial support of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global Witness|first=|date=2006|title=The Truth About Diamonds : Conflict and Development.|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/import/the_truth_about_diamonds.pdf|journal=Global Witness|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[United Nations Security Council]] imposed diamond sanctions in 2000, which were then lifted in 2003. According to [[National Geographic News]], all of these civil wars and conflicts created by rebel groups resulted in over four million deaths in the African population and injuries to over two million civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/african-diamond-trade2.htm|title=How the African Diamond Trade Works|last=Hoyt|first=A|date=|website=Howstuffworks.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another latest conflict diamond statistic from Statistic Brain, revealed that Sierra Leone has been listed as second highest in the production of conflict diamonds, which is shown as 1% of the world's production, after Angola, which produced 2.1% in 2016. 15% of Sierra Leone's diamond production are conflict diamonds. It shows that the production of conflict diamonds still exists in Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/conflict-diamond-statistics/|title=Conflict Diamond statistics|last=Statistics Brain|first=|date=2016|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314173102/http://www.statisticbrain.com/conflict-diamond-statistics|archive-date=2012-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2005 [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Country Reports on Human Right Practices of Africa from the United States]], serious human rights issues still exist in Sierra Leone, even though the 11-year civil conflict had officially ended by 2002. Sierra Leone remains in an unstable political situation, although the country has elected a new government. The huge consequences of blood diamonds still remains a mainstream issue in Sierra Leone. One of the biggest issues is people still being abused by the security forces, including rape and the use of excessive force on detainees, including teenagers. Child abuse and child labor are other serious issues which took place in Sierra Leone after the civil conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2005/61591.htm|title=2005 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Africa : Sierra Leone|last=U.S. Department of State|first=|date=2006|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they need a huge number of workers, the security forces started kidnapping and forcing young adults to be their slaves; children were forced to join their army as soldiers, and women were raped. They even burned entire villages. Thousands of men, women, and children are used as slaves to collect diamonds, and they are forced to use their bare hands to dig in mud along river banks instead of digging with tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/26/world/africa/blood-diamonds/index.html|title=How diamonds fuel Africa’s conflicts|last=Paul|first=Armstrong|date=2012|website=CNN|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/89089538/Ethical-Issue-Analyis-Blood-Diamond-Analysis|title=Ethical Issue Analysis: Blood Diamond Analysis|last=Tammy|first=Hanna|date=2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the report, The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development from Global Witness, it mentioned that Sierra Leone is listed as second from the bottom of the [[United Nations Human Development Index|United Nation Human Development Index]].&amp;nbsp;It also shows that Sierra Leone still makes slow progress, in 2016, in such different aspects as, for example, education, health, and human rights, since 1990, which is also the year that conflicts took place in Sierra Leone. It shows that it is a huge consequence of blood diamonds that it brought into Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/SLE|title=Human Development Report - Sierra Leone|last=Human Development Report|first=|date=2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the war had ended in 2002 and the government tried to improve and adjust the cooperation of the diamond industry. Sierra Leone resulted in an increase of over US$140 million in 2005 and attempted a percentage return of export tax to diamond mining communities. However, it does not improve anything — the money is not reaching the public and it has not provided benefit to anyone in the communities. For instance, the Kono district in Sierra Leone has been mined for 70 years, but they still have no basic facilities, like electricity and repairing of roads. Houses are destroyed because of the civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global Witness|first=|date=2006|title=The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development|url=https://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/import/the_truth_about_diamonds.pdf|journal=The Truth About Diamonds: Conflict and Development|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also examines the unethical issues of how rebel groups treat those locals. They used brainwashing of inexperienced young children and forced them to be child soldiers as they lost their personal freedom and rights under command that included violence and intimidation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/89089538/Ethical-Issue-Analyis-Blood-Diamond-Analysis|title=Ethical Issue Analysis : Blood Diamond Analysis|last=Tammy|first=Hanna|date=2012|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of the Congo ===
The [[Republic of the Congo]] (Congo-Brazzaville) was expelled from the Kimberley Process in 2004&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; because, despite having no official diamond mining industry, the country was [[export]]ing large quantities of diamonds, the origin of which it could not detail. It was also accused of falsifying certificates of origin. The Republic of the Congo was readmitted in 2007.&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;{{cite news|publisher=IPS|accessdate=2010-08-11|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40296|title=Blood Diamonds No Longer Congo-Brazzaville’s Best Friend|date=30 Nov 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117091311/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40296|archivedate=2009-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
[[Zimbabwe]] Diamonds are not considered conflict diamonds by the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]].

In July 2010, the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme]] agreed that diamonds from the country's disputed [[Marange Diamond Fields]] could be sold on the international market,&lt;ref name=TheIndependent&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/zimbabwe-gets-goahead-to-sell-diamonds-again-2028699.html|title=Zimbabwe gets go-ahead to sell diamonds again|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a report from the Scheme's monitor a month earlier described diamonds mined from the fields as [[Conflict-free diamond|conflict-free]].&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703630304575270681883985308|title=Zimbabwe Nears Approval for Marange-Field Diamond Exports - WSJ|author1=Farai Mutsaka |author2=Peter Wonacott |author3=Sarah Childress |date=28 May 2010|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict diamond campaign==
[[Global Witness]] was one of the first organizations to pick up on the link between diamonds and conflicts in Africa in its 1998 report entitled "A Rough Trade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/A_Rough_Trade.pdf|title=A Rough Trade: The Role of Companies and Governments in the Angolan Conflict|author=Dan Brown|publisher=[[Global Witness]]|accessdate=2011-04-11|date=1998-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raO8jHBdDhYC|page=233|title=Glitter &amp; Greed: The Secret World of the Diamond Empire|author=Janine P. Roberts|publisher=The Disinformation Company|year=2003|isbn=0-9713942-9-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173]] in 1998, the United Nations too identified the conflict diamond issue as a funding for war.  The [[Fowler Report]] in 2000 detailed in depth how [[UNITA]] was financing its war activities, and in May 2000, led directly to the passing of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1295]] and the diamond producing countries of southern Africa meeting in [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]] to plan a method by which the trade in conflict diamonds could be halted, and buyers of diamonds could be assured that their diamonds have not contributed to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/202/41606.html|title=Final Report of the UN Panel of Experts ("The "Fowler Report")|publisher=Global Policy Forum|date=2000-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-20|author=Robert Fowler|authorlink=Robert Fowler (diplomat)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N00/396/56/PDF/N0039656.pdf |title=Resolution 1295 (2000) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this resolution the Security Council wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcomes the proposal that a meeting of experts be convened for the purpose of devising a system of controls to facilitate the implementation of the measures contained in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1173|Resolution 1173]] (1998), including arrangements that would allow for increased transparency and accountability in the control of diamonds from their point of origin to the bourses, emphasizes that it is important that, in devising such controls, every effort be made to avoid inflicting collateral damage on the legitimate diamond trade, and welcomes the intention of the Republic of South Africa to host a relevant conference this year''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/SC6988.doc.htm|title=RESOLUTIONS  AND  STATEMENTS OF  THE  SECURITY  COUNCIL 2000|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kimberley Process Certification Scheme===
{{Main|Kimberley Process Certification Scheme}}
On July 19, 2000, the [[World Diamond Congress]] at [[Antwerp]] adopted a resolution to strengthen the diamond industry's ability to block sales of conflict diamonds.&lt;ref name=wdcongress2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondfacts.org/facts/fact_06.html|title=Fact #6- The Facts - DiamondFacts.org|work=diamondfacts.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNJuly2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2000-07-19/world/africa.diamonds.01.reut_1_conflict-diamonds-diamond-industry-rough-diamonds?_s=PM:WORLD|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403165546/http://articles.cnn.com/2000-07-19/world/africa.diamonds.01.reut_1_conflict-diamonds-diamond-industry-rough-diamonds?_s=PM%3AWORLD|title=Diamond leaders in pact to ban 'conflict gems' funding African wars|archivedate=3 April 2012|work=CNN|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution called for an international certification system on the export and import of diamonds, legislation in all countries to accept only officially sealed packages of diamonds, for countries to impose criminal charges on anyone trafficking in conflict diamonds, and instituted a ban on any individual found trading in conflict diamonds from the diamond [[Exchange (organized market)|bourses]] of the [[World Federation of Diamond Bourses]].&lt;ref name=CNNJuly2000/&gt; The Kimberley Process was at the start led by South Africa and Canada as vice president and since then every year a new chair and vice chair country are elected to maintain the legitimacy of their practices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chair |url=https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/chair |website=Kimberley Process |publisher=Kimberley Process |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system tracks diamonds from the mine to the market and regulates the policing surrounding the export, manufacture and sale of the products. Also in tourist countries like Dubai and the United Kingdom. All the Kimberley members are not allowed to trade with non members.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} Before a gemstone is allowed through the airports to other countries, the Kimberley Certification must be presented by the gem's owner or obtained from a renowned attorney. The certificate should also be requested by the customer when the gems have reached a retail store to ensure its precedence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debeersgroup.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_841/cf_5/Diamonds-_development_and_democracy_April_2008.PDF |format=PDF |title=Diamonds, Development, and Democracy |first=Nicky |last=Oppenheimer |publisher=debeersgroup.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005102236/http://www.debeersgroup.com/ImageVaultFiles/id_841/cf_5/Diamonds-_development_and_democracy_April_2008.PDF |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17–18 of 2001, diamond industry figures convened and formed the new organization, the [[World Diamond Council]]. This new body set out to draft a new process, whereby all diamond rough could be certified as coming from a non-conflict source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worlddiamondcouncil.com/chairmansreportforlondon.shtml%257|title=WORLDDIAMONDCOUNCIL.COM|website=www.worlddiamondcouncil.com|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KPCS was given approval by the UN on March 13, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N01/497/66/PDF/N0149766.pdf |title=UN Resolution 56/263 - The role of diamonds in fueling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts }} UN 96th plenary meeting, 13 March 2002, accessed online November 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and in November, after two years of negotiation between governments, diamond producers, and Non-Government organizations, the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme was created.

The Kimberley Process attempted to curtail the flow of conflict diamonds, help stabilize fragile countries and support their development. As the Kimberley Process has made life harder for criminals, it has brought large volumes of diamonds onto the legal market that would not otherwise have made it there. This has increased the revenues of poor governments, and helped them to address their countries’ development challenges. For instance, around $125 million worth of diamonds were legally exported from Sierra Leone in 2006, compared to almost none at the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref name="kimberly"&gt;{{cite news

===Shortcomings and criticism===

The Kimberley Process has ultimately failed to stem the flow of blood diamonds, leading key proponents such as Global Witness to abandon the scheme.&lt;ref name="Failed"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16027011|title=NGO Global Witness leaves diamond vetting scheme|date=5 December 2011|accessdate=5 December 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is no guarantee that diamonds with a Kimberley Process Certification are in fact conflict-free.  This is due to the nature of the corrupt government officials in the leading diamond producing countries.  It is common for these officials to be bribed with $50 to $100 a day in exchange for paperwork declaring that blood diamonds are Kimberley Process Certified.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, E. Kieron|title=Blood Diamond Farce|date=11 August 2010|accessdate=12 December 2011|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig11/ryan-k1.1.1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transparency===
The Kimberley system attempted to increase governments' [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] by forcing them to keep records of the diamonds they are exporting and importing and how much they are worth. In theory, this would show governments their finances so that they can be held accountable for how much they are spending for the benefit of the country's population.  However non-compliance by countries such as Venezuela has led to the failure of accountability.&lt;ref name="Failed"/&gt;

The company [[Materialytics]] claims that it can trace the origin of virtually any diamond using [[Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://materialytics.com/gsa2015determinationofdiamondprovenance/|title=Diamonds: GSA 2015: Determination of Diamond Provenance|work=materialytics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no way to know whether a diamond purchased online is blood free or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thediamondringreview.com/2017/10/the-real-story-history-of-conflict_14.html|title=The Real Story &amp; History of Conflict Blood Diamonds|website=www.thediamondringreview.com|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of this legislation was key to the success of the KPCS, as the United States is the largest consumer of diamonds. The CDTA states: 'As the consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.&lt;ref name=CDTA/&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] also maintains an office for a Special Adviser for Conflict Diamonds.  As of October 14, 2015, the position is held by [[Ashley Orbach]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/e/eb/diamonds/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian policy ===
During the 1990s diamond-rich areas were discovered in Northern Canada. [[Canada]] is one of the key players in the diamond industry. [[Partnership Africa Canada]] was created in 1986 to help with the crisis in Africa. This organization is also part of the Diamond Development Initiative. The Diamond Development Initiative helps improve and regulate the legal diamond industry.

The [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberley Process]] was initiated in May 2000 by [[South Africa]] with Canada a major supporter of instituting the scheme. Canada has now passed several laws that help stop the trade of conflict diamonds. The laws deal with the export and import of rough diamonds, and also how they are transferred. In December 2002 the [[Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act]] was passed by the Canadian government. This law acts as a system that helps control the importing, exporting and transporting of rough diamonds through Canada. The Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act also states that the Kimberley Process is the minimum requirement of certifying rough diamonds and a certificate is also required for all shipments of diamonds. This certificate is called the [[Canadian Certificate]], it gives permission for an officer to seize any shipment of diamonds that does not meet the requirements of the Export and Import of Rough Diamonds Act.&lt;ref name="stop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/Canadian-Policy-Laws.asp|title=Stop Blood Diamonds - Creating a Conflict Free Diamond World|work=stopblooddiamonds.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510200002/http://www.stopblooddiamonds.org/Canadian-Policy-Laws.asp|archivedate=2007-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government of the Northwest Territories of Canada (GNWT) also has a unique certification program. They offer a Government certificate on all diamonds that are mined, cut, and polished in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Canadian diamonds are tracked from the mine, through the refining process, to the retail jeweler with a unique diamond identification number (DIN) laser inscribed on the diamond's girdle. To obtain this certificate one must cut and polish the diamond in the NWT.

== Technology response ==
Technical services have emerged that may act as a solution for tracking diamond movement across borders. A service was launched in July 2016 that allows managers to build systems using a [[blockchain (database)|blockchain database]] for tracking high-value or highly regulated items through a [[supply chain]].  [[Everledger]] is one using such a system to "record the movement of diamonds from mines to jewelry stores" and is one of the inaugural clients of a new [[blockchain]]-based tracking service from [[IBM]].&lt;ref name=wsj20160714&gt;

==In popular culture==

*Conflict diamonds are a central plot point throughout the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002).
*The origins of the [[Kimberley Process Certification Scheme|Kimberley Process]] were dramatized in [[Ed Zwick]]'s motion picture ''[[Blood Diamond]]'' (2006), starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Djimon Hounsou]]. The film helped to publicize the controversy surrounding conflict diamonds and led to worldwide awareness of the Western African involvement in the diamond trade.
*The ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' episode "Man Down" (2007) involves the trafficking of African blood diamonds.
*''[[CSI: NY]]'' episode "Not What It Looks Like" (2006) involves when a group of robbers stole blood diamonds and the men who brought them into the country wanted them back.
*Law &amp; Order episode "Soldier of Fortune" (2001) involves the murder of a diamond broker who has knowledge of a blood diamond connection between Sierra Leone and a Swiss diamond company.
*Danish filmmaker [[Mads Brügger]]'s documentary ''[[The Ambassador (2011 film)|Ambassadøren]]'' (2011, in English: "The Ambassador") addresses the trade in [[diplomatic passport]]s in order to make money with blood diamonds.
*Players compete in ''[[Diamond Trust of London]]'' to extract diamonds out of Angola before the implementation of the Kimberley Process.
*The remix version of [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning song ''[[Diamonds from Sierra Leone]]'' performed by American artist [[Kanye West]], has verses that detail the blood diamond trade in Sierra Leone, and comments about the Western public unawareness of the origins of the diamonds linked to the conflict.
*Blood diamonds play a part in ''[[Far Cry 2]]'', serving as the player's currency, acquired by missions from the two warlord factions or from guarded briefcases. One of the endings also involves delivering a case of stolen diamonds to a border guard as a bribe.
*Blood Diamonds is a thriller fiction book title by Jon Land, copyright 2002; {{ISBN|0-765-30226-8}}
*The 2013 game ''[[Splinter Cell: Blacklist]]'' features an optional mission: Infiltrating and shutting down a blood diamond mine in Equatorial Guinea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">The term '''Caledonian Antisyzygy''' refers to the "idea of dueling polarities within one entity",&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Maureen M. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HZYPW17S34C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gnwUTK7pGdKbOIaxoK4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false Maureen M. ''The Mighty Scot'', p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt; thought of as typical for the Scottish psyche and literature. It was first coined by [[George Gregory Smith|G. Gregory Smith]] in his 1919 book ''Scottish Literature: Character and Influence''&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Gerard. (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHUQTMtwRFkC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22caledonian+antisyzygy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BnYUTK2JHp-UOMSuyLMM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22caledonian%20antisyzygy&amp;f=false ''Scottish Literature'', p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt; in which he wrote:

&lt;!--Quote needs to be either paraphrased or summarised.--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the literature [of Scotland] is the literature of a small country... it runs a shorter course than others... in this shortness and cohesion the most favourable conditions seem to be offered for a making of a general estimate. But on the other hand, we find at closer scanning that the cohesion at least in formal expression and in choice of material is only apparent, that the literature is remarkably varied, and that it becomes, under the stress of foreign influence, almost a zigzag of contradictions. The antithesis need not, however, disconcert us. Perhaps in the very combination of opposites—what either of the two Thomases, [[Thomas Browne|of Norwich]] and [[Thomas Urquhart|Cromarty]], might have been willing to call "'''the Caledonian antisyzygy'''"—we have a reflection of the contrasts which the Scot shows at every turn, in his political and ecclesiastical history, in his polemical restlessness, in his adaptability, which is another way of saying that he has made allowance for new conditions, in his practical judgement, which is the admission that two sides of the matter have been considered. If therefore, Scottish history and life are, as an old northern writer said of something else, 'varied with a clean contrair spirit', we need not be surprised to find that in his literature the Scot presents two aspects which appear contradictory. Oxymoron was ever the bravest figure, and we must not forget that disorderly order is order after all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] elaborated on the concept in his essay, ''The Caledonian Antisyzygy and the Gaelic Idea'', published in two parts in ''The Modern Scot'' 1931–1932. The notion is most frequently cited in reference to the seemingly morally contradictory quality of the works of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (''Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde'') and [[James Hogg]] (''The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner''), but is also applied to contrasts between the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], Protestantism and Catholicism, Britishness and Scottishness, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Dobson and [[Glenn Hook|Glenn D. Hook]]. (1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">The '''categorical test''' is a legal standard for determining whether there has been adequate provocation to reduce a [[murder]] charge to [[voluntary manslaughter]]. Traditionally, the [[mens rea]] for murder was [[malice aforethought]]. While murder and voluntary manslaughter are both [[intention (criminal law)|intentional]] [[homicide]]s, adequate [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] mitigates a defendant's culpability. Adequate provocation is a legal requirement for a murder charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. The test for adequate provocation varies across jurisdictions and has changed over time. The categorical approach is based on [[common law]] principles, but most courts today apply less restrictive tests, such as the extreme emotional disturbance test in [[Model Penal Code]] jurisdictions.

==Historical background==
The formal distinction between manslaughter and murder begins to emerge in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Taylor |first=Laurie J. |title=Provoked Reason in Men and Women: Heat-of-Passion Manslaughter and Imperfect Self-Defense|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/PL?key=CQCZv|year=1986| volume=33|journal=UCLA L. Rev.|page=1679}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 1550s, cases appear in [[Law report|law reports]] that begin to develop the [[jurisprudence]] of manslaughter. Provocation began to replace the earlier "hotbloodedness" when a landmark case from 1600 established that insults and rude gestures were not sufficient provocation to reduce a murder charge to manslaughter. After this case, judges began developed four common law "categories" of provocation:&lt;ref&gt;Kesselring, K.(2016-05-12). ‘Murder’s Crimson Badge’: Homicide in the Age of Shakespeare. In The Oxford Handbook of the Age of Shakespeare. : Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#seeing a friend or family member attacked (1612)
#insulting physical attacks like boxing the ears (early 17th century)
#seeing an English person unlawfully deprived of liberty (1666)
#seeing another man committing adultery with one's wife

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">A '''Clearing murder''' was a revenge killing of a known and popular [[Denmark|Dane]] in the last part of the German [[occupation of Denmark]] during World War II. When a [[Nazi Germany|German]] or Danish soldier or [[informant]] was killed by the [[Danish resistance movement]], the [[Peter group]] performed one or more clearing murder.

[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], at some time in the latter half of 1944,  ordered that 10 civilians be killed each time a German soldier was killed by civilians. In Denmark, this was modified so that only one civilian was shot for one German soldier.

The first clearing murder was of famous author and priest [[Kaj Munk]] January 4, 1944. Subsequently, several doctors were murdered, including a senior consultant in [[Vejle]] and four doctors in [[Odense]]. In all, it is estimated that around one hundred people were killed in clearing murders.

Usually the clearing murders were done as street shooting in order to increase the [[terrorism|terror]] impact of [[fear]] and uncertainty in the general population. The aim was to turn the population against the Danish resistance movement. Doctors were especially vulnerable to clearing murders since they were out to look after the sick at any time of day.

The Germans demanded the Danish newspapers to print articles linking resistance killings and clearing murders next to each other on the same page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4181">The '''cumulative accuracy profile (CAP)''' is used in data science to visualize the discriminative power of a model. The CAP of a model represents the cumulative number of positive outcomes along the ''y''-axis versus the corresponding cumulative number of a classifying parameter along the ''x''-axis. The CAP is distinct from the [[receiver operating characteristic]] (ROC), which plots the [[true-positive rate]] against the [[false-positive rate]].

==Example==

An example is a model that predicts whether a product is bought ('''positive outcome''') by each individual from a group of people ('''classifying parameter''') based on factors such as their gender, age, income etc. If group members would be contacted at random, the cumulative number of products sold would rise linearly toward a maximum value corresponding to the total number of buyers within the group. This distribution is called the '''"random" CAP'''. A perfect prediction, on the other hand, determines exactly which group members will buy the product, such that the maximum number of products sold will be reached with a minimum number of calls. This produces a steep line on the CAP curve that stays flat once the maximum is reached (contacting all other group members will not lead to more products sold), which is the '''"perfect" CAP'''.

[[File:CAP profiles.jpg|thumb|The CAP profiles for the perfect, good and random model predicting the buying customers from a pool of 100 individuals.]]

A successful model predicts the likelihood of individuals purchasing the product and ranks these probabilities to produce a list of potential customers to be contacted first. The resulting cumulative number of sold products will increase rapidly and eventually flatten out to the given maximum as more group members are contacted. This results in a distribution that lies between the random and the perfect CAP curves.

==Analyzing a CAP==

The CAP can be used to evaluate a model by comparing the curve to the '''perfect CAP''' in which the maximum number of positive outcomes is achieved directly and to the '''random CAP''' in which the positive outcomes are distributed equally. A good model will have a CAP between the perfect CAP and the random CAP with a better model tending to the perfect CAP.

The '''accuracy ratio (AR)''' is defined as the ratio of the area between the model CAP and the random CAP and the area between the perfect CAP and the random CAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another indication of the model strength is given by the cumulative number of positive outcomes at 50% of the classifying parameter. For a successful model this value should lie between 50% and 100% of the maximum, with a higher percentage for stronger models.

==Applications==

The CAP and the ROC are both commonly used by banks and regulators to analyze the discriminatory ability of rating systems that evaluate the credit risks &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3266">In the theory of [[differential form]]s, a '''differential ideal''' ''I'' is an ''algebraic ideal'' in the ring of smooth differential forms on a [[smooth manifold]], in other words a [[graded algebra|graded ideal]] in the sense of [[ring theory]], that is further closed under [[exterior differentiation]] ''d''. In other words, for any form α in ''I'', the exterior derivative ''d''α is also in ''I''.

In the theory of [[differential algebra]], a '''differential ideal''' ''I'' in a differential ring ''R'' is an ideal which is mapped to itself by each differential operator.

== Exterior differential systems and partial differential equations ==
An '''exterior differential system''' consists of a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and a differential ideal

:&lt;math&gt; I\subset \Omega^*(M) &lt;/math&gt;.

An '''integral manifold''' of an exterior differential system &lt;math&gt;(M,I)&lt;/math&gt; consists of a [[submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;N\subset M&lt;/math&gt; having the property that the pullback to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of all differential forms contained in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically.

One can express any [[partial differential equation]] system as an exterior differential system with independence condition. Say that we have ''k''th order partial differential equation systems for maps &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, given by

:&lt;math&gt; F^r(x, u, \frac{\partial^{|I|}u }{\partial x^I})=0, \quad 1\le |I|\le k &lt;/math&gt;.

The solution of this partial differential equation system is the submanifold &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; of the [[jet (mathematics)|jet space]] consisting of integral manifolds of the pullback of the [[jet bundle|contact system]] to &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;.

This idea allows one to analyze the properties of partial differential equations with methods of differential geometry. For instance, we can apply [[Cartan's method]] on partial differential equation systems by writing down the exterior differential system associated with it.

== Perfect differential ideals ==
A differential ideal &lt;math&gt;I \, &lt;/math&gt; is perfect if it has the property that if it contains an element &lt;math&gt; a \in I &lt;/math&gt; they contain any element &lt;math&gt; b \in I &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b^n = a &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging''' ('''DWI''' or '''DW-MRI''') is the use of specific [[MRI sequence]]s as well as software that generates images from the resulting data, that uses the diffusion of water molecules to generate [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in MR images.&lt;ref name=LeBihan1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Bihan|first=D |author2=E.

Molecular diffusion in tissues is not free, but reflects interactions with many obstacles, such as [[macromolecule]]s, fibers, and [[Biological membrane|membrane]]s. Water molecule diffusion patterns can therefore reveal microscopic details about tissue architecture, either normal or in a diseased state. A special kind of DWI, '''diffusion tensor imaging''' ('''DTI'''), has been used extensively to map [[white matter]] [[tractography]] in the brain.

== Introduction ==
In '''diffusion weighted imaging''' (DWI), the intensity of each image element ([[voxel]]) reflects the best estimate of the rate of water diffusion at that location. Because the mobility of water is driven by thermal agitation and highly dependent on its cellular environment, the hypothesis behind DWI is that findings may indicate (early) pathologic change. For instance, DWI is more sensitive to early changes after a stroke than more traditional MRI measurements such as [[T1 relaxation|T1]] or [[T2 relaxation]] rates. A variant of diffusion weighted imaging, '''diffusion spectrum imaging''' (DSI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedeen |first1=Van J. |last2=Hagmann |first2=Patric |last3=Tseng |first3=Wen-Yih Isaac |last4=Reese |first4=Timothy G. |last5=Weisskoff |first5=Robert M. |title=Mapping complex tissue architecture with diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1377–86 |year=2005 |pmid=16247738 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20642}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used in deriving the Connectome data sets; DSI is a variant of diffusion-weighted imaging that is sensitive to intra-voxel heterogeneities in diffusion directions caused by crossing fiber tracts and thus allows more accurate mapping of [[axon]]al trajectories than other diffusion imaging approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedeen |first1=V.J. |last2=Wang |first2=R.P. |last3=Schmahmann |first3=J.D. |last4=Benner |first4=T. |last5=Tseng |first5=W.Y.I. |last6=Dai |first6=G. |last7=Pandya |first7=D.N. |last8=Hagmann |first8=P. |last9=D'arceuil |first9=H.  |title=Diffusion spectrum magnetic resonance imaging (DSI) tractography of crossing fibers |journal=NeuroImage |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1267–77 |year=2008 |pmid=18495497 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion-weighted images are very useful to diagnose vascular strokes in the brain. It is also used more and more in the staging of [[Non-small cell lung cancer|non-small-cell lung cancer]], where it is a serious candidate to replace [[positron emission tomography]] as the 'gold standard' for this type of disease. Diffusion tensor imaging is being developed for studying the diseases of the [[white matter]] of the brain as well as for studies of other body tissues (see below). DWI is most applicable when the tissue of interest is dominated by isotropic water movement e.g. [[grey matter]] in the [[cerebral cortex]] and major brain nuclei, or in the body&amp;mdash;where the diffusion rate appears to be the same when measured along any axis. However, DWI also remains sensitive to T1 and T2 relaxation. To entangle diffusion and relaxation effects on image contrast, one may obtain quantitative images of the diffusion coefficient, or more exactly the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The ADC concept was introduced to take into account the fact that the diffusion process is complex in biological tissues and reflects several different mechanisms.&lt;ref name=LeBihan1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Le Bihan|first=D|author2=Breton, E|author3=Lallemand, D|author4=Grenier, P|author5=Cabanis, E|author6=Laval-Jeantet, M|title=MR imaging of intravoxel incoherent motions: application to diffusion and perfusion in neurologic disorders|journal=Radiology|year=1986|volume=161|issue=2|pages=401–7|pmid=3763909|doi=10.1148/radiology.161.2.3763909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diffusion tensor imaging''' (DTI) is important when a tissue&amp;mdash;such as the neural [[axons]] of [[white matter]] in the brain or muscle fibers in the heart&amp;mdash;has an internal fibrous structure analogous to the [[anisotropy]] of some crystals. Water will then diffuse more rapidly in the direction aligned with the internal structure, and more slowly as it moves perpendicular to the preferred direction. This also means that the measured rate of diffusion will differ depending on the direction from which an observer is looking.

Traditionally, in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), three gradient-directions are applied, sufficient to estimate the trace of the diffusion tensor or 'average diffusivity', a putative measure of [[edema]]. Clinically, trace-weighted images have proven to be very useful to diagnose vascular [[stroke]]s in the brain, by early detection (within a couple of minutes) of the hypoxic edema.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Yudong|last2=Wang|first2=Shuihua|last3=Wu|first3=Lenan|last4=Huo|first4=Yuankai|title=Multi-channel diffusion tensor image registration via adaptive chaotic PSO|journal=Journal of Computers|date=Jan 2011|volume=6|issue=4|pages=825–829|doi=10.4304/jcp.6.4.825-829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More extended DTI scans derive neural tract directional information from the data using 3D or multidimensional vector algorithms based on six or more gradient directions, sufficient to compute the diffusion [[tensor]]. The diffusion model is a rather simple model of the diffusion process, assuming homogeneity and linearity of the diffusion within each image voxel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; From the diffusion tensor, diffusion anisotropy measures such as the [[fractional anisotropy]] (FA), can be computed. Moreover, the principal direction of the diffusion tensor can be used to infer the white-matter connectivity of the brain (i.e. [[tractography]]; trying to see which part of the brain is connected to which other part).

Recently, more advanced models of the diffusion process have been proposed that aim to overcome the weaknesses of the diffusion tensor model. Amongst others, these include q-space imaging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Mechanism==
Diffusion imaging is an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] method that produces in vivo magnetic resonance images of biological tissues sensitized with the local characteristics of molecular diffusion, generally water (but other [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] can also be investigated using MR spectroscopic approaches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posse|first=S |author2=Cuenod, CA |author3=Le Bihan, D|title=Human brain: proton diffusion MR spectroscopy.|journal=Radiology|year=1993|volume=188|issue=3|pages=719–25|pmid=8351339|doi=10.1148/radiology.188.3.8351339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MRI can be made sensitive to the motion of molecules. Regular MRI acquisition utilizes the behaviour of protons in water to generate contrast between clinically relevant features of a particular subject. The versatile nature of MRI is due to this capability of producing contrast related to the structure of tissues at microscopic level. In a typical &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;-weighted image, water molecules in a sample are excited with the imposition of a strong magnetic field. This causes many of the protons in water molecules to precess simultaneously, producing signals in MRI. In &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt;-weighted images, contrast is produced by measuring the loss of coherence or synchrony between the water protons. When water is in an environment where it can freely tumble, relaxation tends to take longer. In certain clinical situations, this can generate contrast between an area of pathology and the surrounding healthy tissue.

To sensitize MRI images to diffusion, instead of a homogeneous magnetic field, the homogeneity is varied linearly by a pulsed field gradient. Since precession is proportional to the magnet strength, the protons begin to precess at different rates, resulting in dispersion of the phase and signal loss. Another gradient pulse is applied in the same magnitude but with opposite direction to refocus or rephase the spins. The refocusing will not be perfect for protons that have moved during the time interval between the pulses, and the signal measured by the MRI machine is reduced. This "field gradient pulse" method was initially devised for NMR by Stejskal and Tanner  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stejskal|first=E. O.|author2=Tanner, J. E.|title=Spin Diffusion Measurements: Spin Echoes in the Presence of a Time-Dependent Field Gradient|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=1 January 1965|volume=42|issue=1|pages=288|doi=10.1063/1.1695690|bibcode = 1965JChPh..42..288S }}&lt;/ref&gt; who derived the reduction in signal due to the application of the pulse gradient related to the amount of diffusion that is occurring through the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S(TE)}{S_0} =  \exp \left[ -\gamma^2 G^2\delta^2 \left( \Delta-\frac{\delta}{3}\right)D \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; S_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the signal intensity without the diffusion weighting, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the signal with the gradient, &lt;math&gt; \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]], &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the strength of the gradient pulse, &lt;math&gt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; is the duration of the pulse, &lt;math&gt; \Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the time between the two pulses, and finally, &lt;math&gt; D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion-coefficient.

In order to localize this signal attenuation to get images of diffusion one has to combine the pulsed magnetic field gradient pulses used for MRI (aimed at localization of the signal, but those gradient pulses are too weak to produce a diffusion related attenuation) with additional "motion-probing" gradient pulses, according to the Stejskal and Tanner method. This combination is not trivial, as cross-terms arise between all gradient pulses. The equation set by Stejskal and Tanner then becomes inaccurate and the signal attenuation must be calculated, either analytically or numerically, integrating all gradient pulses present in the MRI sequence and their interactions. The result quickly becomes very complex given the many pulses present in the MRI sequence and, as a simplication, Le Bihan suggested to gather all the gradient terms in a "b factor" (which depends only on the acquisition parameters), so that the signal attenuation simply becomes:&lt;ref name=LeBihan1985 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{S(TE)}{S_0} =  \exp (-b\cdot ADC)&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the diffusion coefficient, &lt;math&gt; D&lt;/math&gt;, is replaced by an apparent diffusion coefficient, &lt;math&gt; ADC&lt;/math&gt;, to indicate that the diffusion process is not free in tissues, but hindered and modulated by many mechanisms (restriction in closed spaces, tortuosity around obstacles, etc.) and that other sources of IntraVoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) such as blood flow in small vessels or cerebrospinal fluid in ventricles also contribute to the signal attenuation.
At the end, images are "weighted" by the diffusion process:  In those diffusion-weighted images (DWI) the signal is more attenuated the faster the diffusion and the larger the b factor is. However, those diffusion-weighted images are still also sensitive to T1 and T2 relaxivity contrast, which can sometimes be confusing. It is possible to calculate "pure" diffusion maps (or more exactly ADC maps where the ADC is the sole source of contrast) by collecting images with at least 2 different values, &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt;, of the b factor according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ADC}(x,y,z)= \ln [S_2(x,y,z)/S_1(x,y,z)]/(b_1-b_2)&lt;/math&gt;

Although this ADC concept has been extremely successful, especially for clinical applications, it has been challenged recently, as new, more comprehensive models of diffusion in biological tissues have been introduced. Those models have been made necessary, as diffusion in tissues is not free. In this condition, the ADC seems to depend on the choice of b values (the ADC seems to decrease when using larger b values), as the plot of ln(S/So) is not linear with the b factor, as expected from the above equations. This deviation from a free diffusion behavior is what makes diffusion MRI so successful, as the ADC is very sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure. On the other hand, modeling diffusion in tissues is becoming very complex. Among most popular models are the biexponential model, which assumes the presence of 2 water pools in slow or intermediate exchange &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Niendorf T, Dijkhuizen RM, Norris DG, van Lookeren Campagne M, Nicolay K|title= Biexponential Diffusion Attenuation in Various States of Brain Tissue : Implications for Diffusion-Weighted Imaging |journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|year=1996|volume=36|pages=847–857|doi=10.1002/mrm.1910360607|pmid=8946350|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karger|first=J|author2=Pfeifer, H|author3=Heink, W|title= Principles and application of self-diffusion measurements by nuclear magnetic resonance |journal= Advances in Magnetic Resonance |year=1988|volume=12|pages=1–89|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-025512-2.50004-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the cumulant-expansion (also called Kurtosis) model &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=C|author2=Bammer, R|author3=Moseley, ME|title=Generalized Diffusion Tensor Imaging (GDTI): A Method for Characterizing and Imaging Diffusion Anisotropy Caused by Non-Gaussian Diffusion|journal=Israel Journal of Chemistry|year=2003|volume=43|issue=1–2|pages=145–54|doi=10.1560/HB5H-6XBR-1AW1-LNX9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chabert2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chabert|first=S |author2=Mecca, CC |author3=Le Bihan D|title= Relevance of the information about the diffusion distribution in invo given by kurtosis in q-space imaging |journal= Proceedings, 12th ISMRM annual meeting, (Kyoto)|year=2004|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=JH |author2=Helpern, JA |author3=Ramani, A |author4=Lu, H |author5=Kaczynski, K|title=Diffusional kurtosis imaging: the quantification of non-gaussian water diffusion by means of magnetic resonance imaging|journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|year=2005|volume=53|issue=6|pages=1432–40|pmid=15906300|doi=10.1002/mrm.20508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which does not necessarily require the presence of 2 pools.

=== Diffusion model ===

Given the concentration &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; and flux &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt;, [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's first law]] gives a relationship between the flux and the concentration [[gradient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; J(x,t)=-D\nabla\rho(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

where D is the [[diffusion coefficient]]. Then, given conservation of mass, the [[continuity equation]] relates the time derivative of the concentration with the [[divergence]] of the flux:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\rho(x,t)}{\partial t}=-\nabla\cdot J(x,t) &lt;/math&gt;

Putting the two together, we get the [[diffusion equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial\rho(x,t)}{\partial t}=D\nabla^2\rho(x,t). &lt;/math&gt;

=== Magnetization dynamics ===

With no diffusion present, the change in nuclear [[magnetization]] over time is given by the classical [[Bloch equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d{M}}{dt}=\gamma{M}\times{B}-\frac{M_x\vec{i}+M_y\vec{j}}{T_2}-\frac{(M_z-M_0)\vec{k}}{T_1} &lt;/math&gt;

which has terms for precession, T2 relaxation, and T1 relaxation.

In 1956, [[H.C. Torrey]] mathematically showed how the [[Bloch equations]] for magnetization would change with the addition of diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.104.563 |bibcode=1956PhRv..104..563T |title=Bloch Equations with Diffusion Terms |year=1956 |last1=Torrey |first1=H. C. |journal=Physical Review |volume=104 |pages=563–565 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Torrey modified Bloch's original description of transverse magnetization to include diffusion terms and the application of a spatially varying gradient.  Since the magnetization &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; is a vector, there are 3 diffusion equations, one for each dimension.  The '''Bloch&amp;ndash;Torrey equation''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d{M}}{dt}=\gamma{M}\times{B}-\frac{M_x\vec{i}+M_y\vec{j}}{T_2}-\frac{(M_z-M_0)\vec{k}}{T_1}+\nabla\cdot D\nabla{M} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is now the diffusion tensor.

For the simplest case where the diffusion is isotropic the diffusion tensor is a multiple of the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;{D} = D \cdot \vec {I} = D \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

then the Bloch&amp;ndash;Torrey equation will have the solution

:&lt;math&gt;  {M}={M}_{\text{bloch}}e^{-\frac13\gamma^2G^2t^3D}\sim e^{-bD_0} &lt;/math&gt;

The exponential term will be referred to as the ''attenuation'' &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;. Anisotropic diffusion will have a similar solution for the diffusion tensor, except that what will be measured is the ''apparent diffusion coefficient'' (ADC). In general, the attenuation is:

:&lt;math&gt;  A=e^{ -\sum_{i,j}b_{ij}D_{ij} } &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt; b_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; terms incorporate the gradient fields &lt;math&gt; G_x, &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; G_y &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; G_z &lt;/math&gt;.

==ADC image==
[[File:Cerebral infarction after 4 hours on ADC MRI.jpg|thumb|150px|ADC image of the same case of cerebral infarction as seen on DWI in section above.]]
An ''apparent diffusion coefficient'' (ADC) image or an ''ADC map'' is an MRI image that more specifically shows diffusion than conventional DWI, by eliminating the [[T2-weighted imaging|T2 weighing]] that is otherwise inherent in conventional DWI.&lt;ref name=hammer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://xrayphysics.com/dwi.html#adc |title= MRI Physics: Diffusion-Weighted Imaging |author= Mark Hammer |website= XRayPhysics |accessdate= 2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADC imaging does so by acquiring multiple conventional DWI images with different amounts of DWI weighing, and the change in signal is proportional to the rate of diffusion. Contrary to DWI images, the standard grayscale of ADC images is to represent a smaller magnitude of diffusion as darker.&lt;ref name=mriquestions/&gt;

[[Cerebral infarction]] leads to diffusion restriction, and the difference between images with various DWI weighing will therefore be minor, leading to an ADC image with low signal in the infarcted area.&lt;ref name=hammer/&gt; A decreased ADC may be detected minutes after a cerebral infarction.&lt;ref name="AnFord2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=An|first1=H.|last2=Ford|first2=A.

==Diffusion tensor imaging==
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables the measurement of the restricted diffusion of water in tissue in order to produce neural tract images instead of using this data solely for the purpose of assigning contrast or colors to pixels in a cross sectional image. It also provides useful structural information about muscle—including heart muscle—as well as other tissues such as the prostate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=17507813 |year=2007 |author1=Manenti |first2=M |first3=S |first4=V |first5=M |first6=E |first7=G |title=Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=412–9 |doi=10.1097/01.rli.0000264059.46444.bf |journal=Investigative radiology |last2=Carlani |last3=Mancino |last4=Colangelo |last5=Di Roma |last6=Squillaci |last7=Simonetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In DTI, each voxel has one or more pairs of parameters: a rate of diffusion and a preferred direction of diffusion&amp;mdash;described in terms of three-dimensional space&amp;mdash;for which that parameter is valid. The properties of each voxel of a single DTI image is usually calculated by vector or tensor math from six or more different diffusion weighted acquisitions, each obtained with a different orientation of the diffusion sensitizing gradients. In some methods, hundreds of measurements&amp;mdash;each making up a complete image&amp;mdash;are made to generate a single resulting calculated image data set. The higher information content of a DTI voxel makes it extremely sensitive to subtle pathology in the brain. In addition the directional information can be exploited at a higher level of structure to select and follow neural tracts through the brain&amp;mdash;a process called [[tractography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basser|first=P. J.|last2=Pajevic|first2=S.|last3=Pierpaoli|first3=C.|last4=Duda|first4=J.|last5=Aldroubi|first5=A.|date=2000-10-01|title=In vivo fiber tractography using DT-MRI data|journal=Magnetic Resonance in Medicine|volume=44|issue=4|pages=625–632|issn=0740-3194|pmid=11025519|doi=10.1002/1522-2594(200010)44:4&lt;625::AID-MRM17&gt;3.0.CO;2-O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more precise statement of the image acquisition process is that the image-intensities at each position are attenuated, depending on the strength (''b''-value) and direction of the so-called magnetic diffusion gradient, as well as on the local microstructure in which the water molecules diffuse. The more attenuated the image is at a given position, the greater diffusion there is in the direction of the diffusion gradient. In order to measure the tissue's complete diffusion profile, one needs to repeat the MR scans, applying different directions (and possibly strengths) of the diffusion gradient for each scan.

=== Measures of anisotropy and diffusivity ===
[[File:DTI-axial-ellipsoids.jpg|thumb|Visualization of DTI data with ellipsoids.]]
In present-day clinical neurology, various brain pathologies may be best detected by looking at particular measures of anisotropy and diffusivity. The underlying physical process of [[diffusion]] causes a group of water molecules to move out from a central point, and gradually reach the surface of an [[ellipsoid]] if the medium is anisotropic (it would be the surface of a sphere for an isotropic medium). The ellipsoid formalism functions also as a mathematical method of organizing tensor data. Measurement of an ellipsoid tensor further permits a retrospective analysis, to gather information about the process of diffusion in each voxel of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Le Bihan|first=D|author2=Mangin JF |author3=Poupon C |author4=Clark CA |author5=Pappata S |author6=Molko N |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Concepts and Applications|journal=JMRI|volume=66 |issue=13 |pages=534–546 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an isotropic medium such as [[cerebro-spinal fluid]], water molecules are moving due to diffusion and they move at equal rates in all directions. By knowing the detailed effects of diffusion gradients we can generate a formula that allows us to convert the signal [[attenuation]] of an MRI voxel into a numerical measure of diffusion&amp;mdash;the [[diffusion coefficient]] ''D''. When various barriers and restricting factors such as [[cell membrane]]s and [[microtubule]]s interfere with the free diffusion, we are measuring an "apparent diffusion coefficient" or '''ADC''' because the measurement misses all the local effects and treats it as if all the movement rates were solely due to Brownian motion. The ADC in anisotropic tissue varies depending on the direction in which it is measured. Diffusion is fast along the length of (parallel to) an [[axon]], and slower perpendicularly across it.

Once we have measured the voxel from six or more directions and corrected for attenuations due to T2 and T1 effects, we can use information from our calculated ellipsoid tensor to describe what is happening in the voxel.  If you consider an ellipsoid sitting at an angle in a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] grid then you can consider the projection of that ellipse onto the three axes. The three projections can give you the ADC along each of the three axes ADC&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ADC&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ADC&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt;. This leads to the idea of describing the average diffusivity in the voxel which will simply be

:&lt;math&gt;
(ADC_x + ADC_y + ADC_z)/3 = ADC_i
&lt;/math&gt;

We use the ''i'' subscript to signify that this is what the isotropic diffusion coefficient would be with the effects of anisotropy averaged out.

The ellipsoid itself has a principal long axis and then two more small axes that describe its width and depth. All three of these are perpendicular to each other and cross at the center point of the ellipsoid. We call the axes in this setting '''[[eigenvectors]]''' and the measures of their lengths '''[[eigenvalues]]'''. The lengths are symbolized by the Greek letter ''[[lambda|λ]]''. The long one pointing along the axon direction will be ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the two small axes will have lengths ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In the setting of the DTI tensor ellipsoid, we can consider each of these as a measure of the diffusivity along each of the three primary axes of the ellipsoid. This is a little different from the ADC since that was a projection on the axis, while ''λ'' is an actual measurement of the ellipsoid we have calculated.

The diffusivity along the principal axis, ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is also called the longitudinal diffusivity or the '''axial diffusivity''' or even the parallel diffusivity ''λ''&lt;sub&gt;∥&lt;/sub&gt;. Historically, this is closest to what Richards originally measured with the vector length in 1991.&lt;ref name="Richards1992"&gt;Richards TL, Heide AC, Tsuruda JS, Alvord EC: Vector analysis of diffusion images in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Presented at Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, Berlin, SMRM Proceedings 11:412, 1992 (abstr).&lt;/ref&gt; The diffusivities in the two minor axes are often averaged to produce a measure of '''radial diffusivity'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_{\perp} = (\lambda_2 + \lambda_3)/2 .
&lt;/math&gt;

This quantity is an assessment of the degree of restriction due to membranes and other effects and proves to be a sensitive measure of degenerative pathology in some neurological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vaillancourt DE, Spraker MB, Prodoehl J |display-authors=etal |title=High-resolution diffusion tensor imaging in the substantia nigra of de novo Parkinson disease |journal=Neurology |volume=72  |pages=1378&amp;ndash;1384 |year=2009 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000340982.01727.6e |pmid=19129507 |issue=16 |pmc=2677508}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be called the perpendicular diffusivity (&lt;math&gt;
\lambda_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;).

Another commonly used measure that summarizes the total diffusivity is the '''Trace'''&amp;mdash;which is the sum of the three eigenvalues,

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{tr}(\Lambda) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_3&lt;/math&gt; on its diagonal.

If we divide this sum by three we have the '''mean diffusivity''',

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{MD} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3) /3
&lt;/math&gt;

which equals ''ADC&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' since
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{tr}(\Lambda)/3 &amp;= \mathrm{tr}(V V^{-1} \Lambda)/3 \\
&amp;= \mathrm{tr}(V \Lambda V^{-1})/3 \\ 
&amp;= \mathrm{tr}(D)/3 \\
&amp;= ADC_i
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of eigenvectors and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion tensor.
Aside from describing the amount of diffusion, it is often important to describe the relative degree of anisotropy in a voxel. At one extreme would be the sphere of isotropic diffusion and at the other extreme would be a cigar or pencil shaped very thin [[prolate spheroid]]. The simplest measure is obtained by dividing the longest axis of the ellipsoid by the shortest =&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, this proves to be very susceptible to measurement noise, so increasingly complex measures were developed to capture the measure while minimizing the noise.  An important element of these calculations is the sum of squares of the diffusivity differences =&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''λ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. We use the square root of the sum of squares to obtain a sort of weighted average—dominated by the largest component. One objective is to keep the number near 0 if the voxel is spherical but near 1 if it is elongate. This leads to the '''[[fractional anisotropy]]''' or '''FA''' which is the square root of the sum of squares (SRSS) of the diffusivity differences, divided by the SRSS of the diffusivities. When the second and third axes are small relative to the principal axis, the number in the numerator is almost equal the number in the denominator. We also multiply by &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; so that FA has a maximum value of 1. The whole formula for '''FA''' looks like this:

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{FA}=\frac{\sqrt{3( (\lambda_1-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_2-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_3-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2 )}}{\sqrt{2( \lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2 )}} &lt;/math&gt;

The fractional anisotropy can also be separated into linear, planar, and spherical measures depending on the "shape" of the diffusion ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;Westin CF, Peled S, Gudbjartsson H, Kikinis R, Jolesz FA. Geometrical diffusion measures for MRI from tensor basis analysis. In ISMRM '97. Vancouver Canada, 1997;1742.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Westin CF, Maier SE, Mamata H, Nabavi A, Jolesz FA, Kikinis R. Processing and visualization of diffusion tensor MRI. Medical Image Analysis 2002;6(2):93-108.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a "cigar" shaped prolate ellipsoid indicates a strongly linear anisotropy, a "flying saucer" or [[oblate spheroid]] represents diffusion in a plane, and a sphere is indicative of isotropic diffusion, equal in all directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrew L. Alexander |title=Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Brain |year=2008 |pmc=2041910 |pmid=17599699 |doi=10.1016/j.nurt.2007.05.011 |volume=4 |journal=Neurotherapeutics |pages=316–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the eigenvalues of the diffusion vector are sorted such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \lambda_3 \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the measures can be calculated as follows:

For the '''linear case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \gg \lambda_2 \simeq \lambda_3 &lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
C_l=\frac{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
&lt;/math&gt;

For the '''planar case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2 \gg \lambda_3 
&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_p=\frac{2(\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

For the '''spherical case''', where &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 \simeq \lambda_2 \simeq \lambda_3 &lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_s=\frac{3\lambda_3}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

Each measure lies between 0 and 1 and they sum to unity. An additional '''anisotropy measure''' can used to describe the deviation from the spherical case:

: &lt;math&gt;
     C_a=C_l+C_p=1-C_s=\frac{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 - 2\lambda_3}{\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3}
   &lt;/math&gt;

There are other metrics of anisotropy used, including the ''relative anisotropy'' (RA):

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{RA}=\frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_2-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2+(\lambda_3-\operatorname E[\lambda])^2}}{\sqrt{3}\operatorname E[\lambda]} &lt;/math&gt;

and the ''volume ratio'' (VR):

:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{VR}=\frac{\lambda_1\lambda_2\lambda_3}{\operatorname E[\lambda]^3} &lt;/math&gt;

===Applications===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
The principal application is in the imaging of [[white matter]] where the location, orientation, and [[anisotropy]] of the tracts can be measured. The architecture of the [[axon]]s in parallel bundles, and their [[myelin]] sheaths, facilitate the [[diffusion]] of the water molecules preferentially along their main direction. Such preferentially oriented diffusion is called '''anisotropic diffusion'''.

[[Image:DTI-sagittal-fibers.jpg|thumb|240px|Tractographic reconstruction of neural connections via DTI]]
The imaging of this property is an extension of diffusion MRI. If a series of diffusion gradients (i.e. [[magnetic field]] variations in the MRI magnet) are applied that can determine at least 3 directional vectors (use of 6 different gradients is the minimum and additional gradients improve the accuracy for "off-diagonal" information), it is possible to calculate, for each [[voxel]], a [[tensor]] (i.e. a symmetric positive definite 3&amp;times;3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]) that describes the 3-dimensional shape of diffusion.  The fiber direction is indicated by the tensor's main [[eigenvector]]. This vector can be color-coded, yielding a cartography of the tracts' position and direction (red for left-right, blue for superior-inferior, and green for anterior-posterior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makris|first=N.|last2=Worth|first2=A.

Mean diffusivity (MD) or trace is a scalar measure of the total diffusion within a voxel. These measures are commonly used clinically to localize white matter lesions that do not show up on other forms of clinical MRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Edward Soll |url=http://www.doctorsimaging.com/services-in-metairie-new-orleans-louisiana/dti-mtbi-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussions-scan/ |title=DTI (Quantitative), a new and advanced MRI procedure for evaluation of Concussions |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffusion tensor imaging data can be used to perform [[tractography]] within white matter. Fiber tracking algorithms can be used to track a fiber along its whole length (e.g. the [[corticospinal tract]], through which the motor information transit from the [[motor cortex]] to the [[spinal cord]] and the peripheral [[nerve]]s).  Tractography is a useful tool for measuring deficits in white matter, such as in aging.  Its estimation of fiber orientation and strength is increasingly accurate, and it has widespread potential implications in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and neurobiology.

Some clinical applications of DTI are in the tract-specific localization of white matter [[lesion]]s such as trauma and in defining the severity of [[Traumatic brain injury#Focal vs. diffused|diffuse traumatic brain injury]].   The localization of [[tumor]]s in relation to the white matter tracts (infiltration, deflection), has been one of the most important initial applications. In surgical planning for some types of [[brain tumors]], surgery is aided by knowing the proximity and relative position of the [[corticospinal tract]] and a tumor.

The use of DTI for the assessment of white matter in development, pathology and degeneration has been the focus of over 2,500 research publications since 2005. It promises to be very helpful in distinguishing [[Alzheimer's disease]] from other types of [[dementia]]. Applications in brain research cover e.g. connectionistic investigation of [[neural network]]s [[in vivo]].

DTI also has applications in the characterization of [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]].  The sensitivity to fiber orientation also appears to be helpful in the area of [[sports medicine]] where it greatly aids imaging of structure and injury in [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s.

==Mathematical foundation&amp;mdash;tensors==
{{see also|Principal axis theorem}}
Diffusion MRI relies on the mathematics and physical interpretations of the geometric quantities known as [[tensor]]s. Only a special case of the general mathematical notion is relevant to imaging, which is based on the concept of a [[symmetric matrix]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;Several full mathematical treatments of general tensors exist, e.g. [[classical treatment of tensors|classical]], [[Component-free treatment of tensors|component free]], and so on, but the generality, which covers arrays of all sizes, may obscure rather than help.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diffusion itself is tensorial, but in many cases the objective is not really about trying to study brain diffusion per se, but rather just trying to take advantage of diffusion anisotropy in white matter for the purpose of finding the orientation of the axons and the magnitude or degree of anisotropy. Tensors have a real, physical existence in a material or tissue so that they don't move when the coordinate system used to describe them is rotated.  There are numerous different possible representations of a tensor (of rank 2), but among these, this discussion focuses on the ellipsoid because of its physical relevance to diffusion and because of its historical significance in the development of diffusion anisotropy imaging in MRI.

The following matrix displays the components of the diffusion tensor:

:&lt;math&gt; \bar{D} = \begin{vmatrix}
D_{\color{red}xx} &amp; D_{xy} &amp; D_{xz} \\
D_{xy} &amp; D_{\color{red}yy} &amp; D_{yz} \\
D_{xz} &amp; D_{yz} &amp; D_{\color{red}zz}
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The same matrix of numbers can have a simultaneous second use to describe the shape and orientation of an ellipse and the same matrix of numbers can be used simultaneously in a third way for matrix mathematics to sort out eigenvectors and eigenvalues as explained below.

===Physical tensors===
The idea of a tensor in physical science evolved from attempts to describe the quantity of physical properties. The first properties they were applied to were those that can be described by a single number, such as temperature. Properties that can be described this way are called [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]; these can be considered tensors of rank 0, or 0th-order tensors. Tensors can also be used to describe quantities that have directionality, such as mechanical force. These quantities require specification of both magnitude and direction, and are often represented with a [[Euclidean vector|vector]]. A three-dimensional vector can be described with three components: its projection on the ''x,'' ''y'', and ''z'' axes. Vectors of this sort can be considered tensors of rank 1, or 1st-order tensors.

A tensor is often a physical or biophysical property that determines the relationship between two vectors. When a force is applied to an object, movement can result. If the movement is in a single direction, the transformation can be described using a vector—a tensor of rank 1. However, in a tissue, diffusion leads to movement of water molecules along trajectories that proceed along multiple directions over time, leading to a complex projection onto the Cartesian axes. This pattern is reproducible if the same conditions and forces are applied to the same tissue in the same way. If there is an internal anisotropic organization of the tissue that constrains diffusion, then this fact will be reflected in the pattern of diffusion. The relationship between the properties of driving force that generate diffusion of the water molecules and the resulting pattern of their movement in the tissue can be described by a tensor. The collection of molecular displacements of this physical property can be described with nine components—each one associated with a pair of axes ''xx'', ''yy'', ''zz'', ''xy'', ''yx'', ''xz'', ''zx'', ''yz'', ''zy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nye JF |title=Physical Properties of Crystals: Their Representations by Tensors and Matrices |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be written as a matrix similar to the one at the start of this section.

Diffusion from a point source in the anisotropic medium of white matter behaves in a similar fashion. The first pulse of the Stejskal Tanner diffusion gradient effectively labels some water molecules and the second pulse effectively shows their displacement due to diffusion. Each gradient direction applied measures the movement along the direction of that gradient. Six or more gradients are summed to get all the measurements needed to fill in the matrix, assuming it is symmetric above and below the diagonal (red subscripts).

In 1848, [[Henri Hureau de Sénarmont]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Sénarmont HH: |title=Mémoire sur la conductibilité des substances cristalisées pour la chaleur |journal=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l'Académie des Sciences|volume=25 |pages=459–461 |year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied a heated point to a polished crystal surface that had been coated with wax. In some materials that had "isotropic" structure, a ring of melt would spread across the surface in a circle. In anisotropic crystals the spread took the form of an ellipse. In three dimensions this spread is an ellipsoid. As [[Adolf Eugen Fick|Adolf Fick]] showed in the 1850s, diffusion exhibits many of the same patterns as those seen in the transfer of heat.

===Mathematics of ellipsoids===
At this point, it is helpful to consider the mathematics of ellipsoids. An ellipsoid can be described by the formula: ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. This equation describes a [[quadric]] surface. The relative values of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' determine if the quadric describes an [[ellipsoid]] or a [[hyperboloid]].

As it turns out, three more components can be added as follows: ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ ''dyz''&amp;nbsp;+ ''ezx''&amp;nbsp;+ ''fxy''&amp;nbsp;= 1. Many combinations of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'',  and ''f''  still describe ellipsoids, but the additional components (''d'', ''e'', ''f'') describe the rotation of the ellipsoid relative to the orthogonal axes of the Cartesian coordinate system. These six variables can be represented by a matrix similar to the tensor matrix defined at the start of this section (since diffusion is symmetric, then we only need six instead of nine components—the components below the diagonal elements of the matrix are the same as the components above the diagonal). This is what is meant when it is stated that the components of a matrix of a second order tensor can be represented by an ellipsoid—if the diffusion values of the six terms of the quadric ellipsoid are placed into the matrix, this generates an ellipsoid angled off the orthogonal grid. Its shape will be more elongated if the relative anisotropy is high.

When the ellipsoid/tensor is represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], we can apply a useful technique from standard matrix mathematics and linear algebra—that is to "[[Diagonalizable matrix#How to diagonalize a matrix|diagonalize]]" the matrix. This has two important meanings in imaging. The idea is that there are two equivalent ellipsoids—of identical shape but with different size and orientation. The first one is the measured diffusion ellipsoid sitting at an angle determined by the axons, and the second one is perfectly aligned with the three [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] axes. The term "diagonalize" refers to the three components of the matrix along a diagonal from upper left to lower right (the components with red subscripts in the matrix at the start of this section). The variables ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''cz''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are along the diagonal (red subscripts), but the variables ''d'', ''e'' and ''f'' are "off diagonal". It then becomes possible to do a vector processing step in which we rewrite our matrix and replace it with a new matrix multiplied by three different vectors of unit length (length=1.0). The matrix is diagonalized because the off-diagonal components are all now zero. The rotation angles required to get to this equivalent position now appear in the three vectors and can be read out as the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' components of each of them. Those three vectors are called "[[eigenvectors]]" or characteristic vectors. They contain the orientation information of the original ellipsoid. The three axes of the ellipsoid are now directly along the main orthogonal axes of the coordinate system so we can easily infer their lengths. These lengths are the eigenvalues or characteristic values.

[[Diagonalizable matrix|Diagonalization]] of a matrix is done by finding a second matrix that it can be multiplied with followed by multiplication by the inverse of the second matrix—wherein the result is a new matrix in which three diagonal (''xx'', ''yy'', ''zz'') components have numbers in them but the off-diagonal components (''xy'', ''yz'', ''zx'') are 0. The second matrix provides [[eigenvector]] information.

==Beyond DTI==
Early in the development of DTI based tractography, a number of researchers pointed out a flaw in the diffusion tensor model. The tensor analysis assumes that there is a single ellipsoid in each imaging voxel&amp;mdash; as if all of the axons traveling through a voxel traveled in exactly the same direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuch DS |title=Q-Ball Imaging |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=52 |pages=1358&amp;ndash;1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20279 |pmid=15562495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often true, but it can be estimated that in more than 30% of the voxels in a standard resolution brain image, there are at least two different neural tracts traveling in different directions that pass through each other. In the classic diffusion ellipsoid tensor model, the information from the crossing tract just appears as noise or unexplained decreased anisotropy in a given voxel. David Tuch was among the first to describe a solution to this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuch DS, Weisskoff RM, Belliveau JW, Wedeen VJ |title=High angular resolution diffusion imaging of the human brain |journal=Proceedings of the 7th Annual Meeting of the ISMRM, Philadelphia |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuch DS, Reese TG, Wiegell MR |display-authors=etal |title=High angular resolution diffusion imaging reveals intravoxel white matter fiber heterogeneity |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=48 |pages=577&amp;ndash;582 |year=2002 |doi=10.1002/mrm.10268 |pmid=12353272 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is best understood by conceptually placing a kind of geodesic dome around each image voxel. This [[icosahedron]] provides a mathematical basis for passing a large number of evenly spaced gradient trajectories through the voxel&amp;mdash;each coinciding with one of the apices of the icosahedron. Basically, we are now going to look into the voxel from a large number of different directions (typically 40 or more). We use "''n''-tuple" [[tessellations]] to add more evenly spaced apices to the original icosahedron (20 faces)&amp;mdash;an idea that also had its precedents in paleomagnetism research several decades earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hext GR |title=The estimation of second-order tensors with related tests and designs |journal=Biometrika |volume=50 |pages=353&amp;ndash;373 |year=1963 |doi=10.1093/biomet/50.3-4.353}}&lt;/ref&gt; We just want to know which direction lines turn up the maximum anisotropic diffusion measures. If there is a single tract, there will be just two maxima pointing in opposite directions. If two tracts cross in the voxel, there will be two pairs of maxima, and so on. We can still use tensor math to use the maxima to select groups of gradients to package into several different tensor ellipsoids in the same voxel, or use more complex higher rank tensors analyses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Basser PJ, Pajevic S |title=Spectral decomposition of a 4th-order covariance tensor: applications to diffusion tensor MRI |journal=Signal Processing |volume=87 |pages=220&amp;ndash;236 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.02.050 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or we can do a true "model free" analysis that just picks the maxima and goes on about doing the tractography.

The Q-Ball method of tractography is an implementation in which David Tuch provides a mathematical alternative to the tensor model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuch DS |title=Q-Ball imaging |journal=Magn. Res. Med. |volume=52 |pages=1358&amp;ndash;1372 |year=2004 |doi=10.1002/mrm.20279 |pmid=15562495 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of forcing the diffusion anisotropy data into a group of tensors, the mathematics used deploys both  probability distributions and a classic bit of geometric [[tomography]] and vector math developed nearly 100 years ago&amp;mdash;the [[Funk Radon Transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Funk P |title=Uber eine geometrische Anwendung der Abelschen Integralgleichnung |journal=Math. Ann. |volume=77 |pages=129&amp;ndash;135 |year=1919 |doi=10.1007/BF01456824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary===
For DTI, it is generally possible to use [[linear algebra]], matrix mathematics and vector mathematics to process the analysis of the tensor data.

In some cases,  the full set of tensor properties is of interest, but for [[tractography]] it is usually necessary to know only the magnitude and orientation of the primary axis or vector. This primary axis—the one with the greatest length—is the largest eigenvalue and its orientation is encoded in its matched eigenvector. Only one axis is needed because the interest is in the vectorial property of axon direction to accomplish tractography.

'''Disability etiquette''' is a set of guidelines dealing specifically with how to approach a person with a disability.

There is no consensus on when this phrase first came into use, although it most likely grew out of the [[Disability rights movement|Disability Rights Movement]] that began in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The concept may have started as a cynical play on existing rule sheets, written for audiences without a disability, that were seen as patronizing by civil rights activists.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Guidelines==
Most disability [[etiquette]] guidelines seem to be predicated on a simple dictate: "Do not assume&amp;nbsp;..." They are written to address real and perceived shortcomings in how society as a whole treats disabled people.

These guidelines can be broken down into the several broad categories.

"'''Do not assume ...'''":
* "... a person with a disability either wants or requires assistance."
* "... rejection of aid is meant as a personal affront."
* "... upon acceptance of your help, that you know, without being told, what service to perform."
* "... a person who appears to have one kind of disability also has others."
* "... a disabled person is dissatisfied with his/her quality of life, and is thus seeking pity."
* "... a person with a disability is easily offended."
* "... that a person who does not appear disabled, or who uses assistive devices intermittently instead of all of the time, is faking or imagining their disability." (''see [[invisible disability]]'')
* "... companions accompanying a person with a disability are there strictly to render service."
* "... a person with a disability will be receptive to personal questions, particularly in a public setting."
* "... that when a person with a disability is in a public place, that they are being escorted by a caretaker, instead of traveling alone."

Each category encompasses specific "rules." For example, the last two of these would include guidelines such as:
* "Ask questions of the person with a disability, and not of his/her companions."
* "Hand grocery or other receipts to the individual who is paying the bill."
* "Only ask questions about the person's disability if you know that person."

People writing on specific disabilities have given rise to their own unique guidelines. Wheelchair users may, for example, include the rule, "do not grab the push handles of a person's wheelchair without permission." Visually impaired people often list a request to, "identify yourself when you enter a room."

==Language==
Like many other minority groups, disabled people do not always agree on what constitutes [[politically correct]] language. However, see the [[List of disability-related terms with negative connotations]] and [[people-first language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">In [[engineering]], '''double-subscript notation''' is notation used to indicate some variable ''between'' two points (each point being represented by one of the subscripts). In [[electronics]], the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage, while in [[mechanical engineering]] it is sometimes used to describe the [[force]] or [[Stress (physics)|stress]] between two points, and sometimes even a component that spans between two points (like a beam on a bridge or [[truss]]). Note that, although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used, they are not necessarily called ''double subscript notation'' specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Circuit Analysis for Power Engineering Handbook |author=Moses E. Zarudi, Shenkman, Arieh L. Shenkman|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-412-83180-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electronic usage ==
IEEE standard 255-1963, "Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices", defined eleven original quantity symbols expressed as abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = 255-1963 - IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Semiconductor Devices|last =|first =|publisher = IEEE|year = 1963|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a [[Convention (norm)|convention]] to standardize the directions of double-subscript labels. The following uses [[transistors]] as an example, but shows how the direction is read generally. The convention works like this:

&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{CB} \ &lt;/math&gt; represents the [[voltage]] from C to B. In this case, C would denote the collector end of a transistor, and B would denote the base end of the same transistor. This is the same as saying "the voltage drop from C to B". Though this applies the standard definitions of the letters C and B,&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics|last=Graf|first=Rudolf F.|publisher=Howard W. Sams &amp; Co., Inc.|year=1973|isbn=|edition=4th|location=|pages=683-684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{CE} \ &lt;/math&gt; would in turn represent the current from C to E. In this case, C would again denote the collector end of a transistor, and E would denote the emitter end of the transistor. This is the same as saying "the current in the direction going from C to E".&lt;ref name="graf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IC power supply pin|Power supply pins on integrated circuits]] utilize the same letters for denoting what kind of voltage the pin would receive. For example, a power input labeled V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; would be a positive input that would presumably connect to the collector pin of a BJT transistor in the circuit, and likewise respectively with other subscripted letters. The format used is the same as for notations described above, though without the connotation of V&lt;sub&gt;CC&lt;/sub&gt; meaning the voltage from a collector pin to collector pin; the repetition avoids confusion as such an expression would not exist.

The table above shows only the originally denoted letters; others have found their way into use over time, such as S and D for the Source and Drain of a [[Field-effect transistor|FET]], respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4818">[[Image: Omega_av.jpg|thumb|A [[automobile|car]] is a durable good. The [[gasoline]] that powers it is a non-durable good, or consumable good]]

In [[economics]], a '''durable good''' or a '''hard good''' is a [[Good (economics)|good]] that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields [[utility]] over time rather than being completely [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] in one use. Items like [[brick]]s could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out. Highly durable goods such as [[refrigerator]]s or [[car]]s usually continue to be useful for three or more years of use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Examples of consumer durable goods include [[automobiles]], [[books]], [[household goods]] ([[home appliance]]s, [[consumer electronics]], [[furniture]], [[tools]], etc.), [[sports equipment]], [[jewelry]], [[medical equipment]], [[firearms]], and [[toy]]s.

'''Nondurable goods''' or '''soft goods''' ([[consumables]]) are the opposite of durable goods. They may be defined either as goods that are immediately consumed in one use or ones that have a lifespan of less than three years.

Examples of nondurable goods include [[fast-moving consumer goods]] such as [[cosmetics]] and cleaning products, food, condiments, fuel, beer, cigarettes and tobacco, medication, office supplies, packaging and containers, paper and paper products, personal products, rubber, plastics, textiles, clothing, and footwear.

While durable goods can usually be rented as well as bought, nondurable goods generally are not rented. While buying durable goods comes under the category of investment demand of goods, buying non-durables comes under the category of consumption demand of goods.

== Durability ==
According to Cooper (1994, p5)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|last=Cooper|first=Tim|publisher=The New Economics Foundation|year=1994|oclc=48830517|location=Whitechapel Road, London|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''[[durability]] is the ability of a product to perform its required function over a lengthy period under normal conditions of use without excessive expenditure on maintenance or repair''". Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application such as years of existence, hours of use and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ===
The life span of household goods is significant for [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume= 3| issue = 1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer product life spans could contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus, slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume= 9| issue = 1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods, that can be demanded by consumers, was not clear until an amendment of the law relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994[[Durability#cite note-5|[5]]].

The environmentally friendly trends are marketed with a different color association, using the color blue for clean air and clean water, as opposed to green in western cultures.

* At the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates and votes for a candidate from the state, or less often from the state's region, who is not a viable candidate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24338">'''Fibred categories''' (or '''fibered categories''') are abstract entities in [[mathematics]] used to provide a general framework for [[descent theory]]. They formalise the various situations in [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] in which ''inverse images'' (or ''pull-backs'') of objects such as [[vector bundle]]s can be defined. As an example, for each topological space there is the category of vector bundles on the space, and for every [[continuous map]] from a topological space ''X'' to another topological space ''Y'' is associated the [[pullback bundle|pullback]] [[functor]] taking bundles on ''Y'' to bundles on ''X''. Fibred categories formalise the system consisting of these categories and inverse image functors. Similar setups appear in various guises in mathematics, in particular in [[algebraic geometry]], which is the context in which fibred categories originally appeared. Fibered categories are used to define [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, which are fibered categories (over a site) with "descent". Fibrations also play an important role in categorical semantics of [[type theory]], and in particular that of [[dependent type]] theories.

Fibred categories were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|first=Alexander|last= Grothendieck|year=1959|year2=1971}}, and developed in more detail by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Jean Giraud (mathematician)|first=Jean |last=Giraud |year1=1964|year2=1971}}.

==Background and motivations==
There are many examples in [[topology]] and [[geometry]] where some types of objects are considered to exist ''on'' or ''above'' or ''over'' some underlying ''base space''. The classical examples include vector bundles, [[principal bundle]]s and [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] over topological spaces. Another example is given by "families" of [[algebraic varieties]] parametrised by another variety. Typical to these situations is that to a suitable type of a [[map (mathematics)|map]] ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' between base spaces, there is a corresponding ''inverse image'' (also called ''pull-back'') operation ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' taking the considered objects defined on ''Y'' to the same type of objects on ''X''. This is indeed the case in the examples above: for example, the inverse image of a vector bundle ''E'' on ''Y'' is a vector bundle ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''E'') on ''X''.

Moreover, it is often the case that the considered "objects on a base space" form a category, or in other words have maps ([[morphisms]]) between them. In such cases the inverse image operation is often compatible with composition of these maps between objects, or in more technical terms is a [[functor]]. Again, this is the case in examples listed above.

However, it is often the case that if ''g'': ''Y'' → ''Z'' is another map, the inverse image functors are not ''strictly'' compatible with composed maps: if ''z'' is an object ''over'' ''Z'' (a vector bundle, say), it may well be that

: &lt;math&gt; f^*(g^*(z))\neq (g\circ f)^*(z).&lt;/math&gt;

Instead, these inverse images are only [[natural transformation|naturally]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. This introduction of some "slack" in the system of inverse images causes some delicate issues to appear, and it is this set-up that fibred categories formalise.

The main application of fibred categories is in [[descent theory]], concerned with a vast generalisation of "glueing" techniques used in topology. In order to support descent theory of sufficient generality to be applied in non-trivial situations in algebraic geometry the definition of fibred categories is quite general and abstract. However, the underlying intuition is quite straightforward when keeping in mind the basic examples discussed above.

==Formal definitions==
There are two essentially equivalent technical definitions of fibred categories, both of which will be described below. All discussion in this section ignores the [[set theory|set-theoretical]] issues related to "large" categories. The discussion can be made completely rigorous by, for example, restricting attention to small categories or by using [[Grothendieck universe|universe]]s.

===Cartesian morphisms and functors===
If φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is a [[functor]] between two [[category (mathematics)|categories]] and ''S'' is an object of ''E'', then the [[subcategory]] of ''F'' consisting of those objects ''x'' for which φ(''x'')=''S'' and those morphisms ''m'' satisfying φ(''m'')=id&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the ''fibre category'' (or ''fibre'') ''over S'', and is denoted ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. The morphisms of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' are called ''S-morphisms'', and for ''x'',''y'' objects of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', the set of ''S''-morphisms is denoted by Hom&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''). The image by φ of an object or a morphism in ''F'' is called its ''projection'' (by φ). If f is a morphism of ''E'', then those morphisms of ''F'' that project to ''f'' are called ''f-morphisms'', and the set of ''f''-morphisms between objects ''x'' and ''y'' in ''F'' is denoted by Hom&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y''). A functor φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is also called an ''E-category'', or said to make ''F'' into an ''E''-category or a category ''over'' ''E''. An ''E''-functor from an ''E''-category φ: ''F'' → ''E'' to an ''E''-category ψ: ''G'' → ''E'' is a functor α: ''F'' → ''G'' such that ψ ∘ α = φ. ''E''-categories form in a natural manner a [[2-category]], with 1-morphisms being ''E''-functors, and 2-morphisms being natural transformations between ''E''-functors whose components lie in some fibre.

A morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' in ''F'' is called ''φ-cartesian'' (or simply ''cartesian'') if it satisfies the following condition:
: if ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' is the projection of ''m'', and if n: ''z'' → ''y'' is an ''f''-morphism, then there is ''precisely one'' ''T''-morphism ''a'': ''z'' → ''x'' such that ''n'' = ''m ∘ a''.
A cartesian morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' is called an ''inverse image'' of its projection ''f'' = φ(''m''); the object ''x'' is called an ''inverse image'' of ''y'' ''by f''.

The cartesian morphisms of a fibre category ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' are precisely the isomorphisms of ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. There can in general be more than one cartesian morphism projecting to a given morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'', possibly having different sources; thus there can be more than one inverse image of a given object ''y'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' by ''f''.  However, it is a direct consequence of the definition that two such inverse images are isomorphic in ''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''.

An ''E''-functor between two ''E''-categories is called a ''cartesian functor'' if it takes cartesian morphisms to cartesian morphisms. Cartesian functors between two ''E''-categories ''F'',''G'' form a category Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G''), with [[natural transformations]] as morphisms. A special case is provided by considering ''E'' as an ''E''-category via the identity functor: then a cartesian functor from ''E'' to an ''E''-category ''F'' is called a ''cartesian section''. Thus a cartesian section consists of a choice of one object ''x&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each object ''S'' in ''E'', and for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' a choice of an inverse image ''m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''x&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''x&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''. A cartesian section is thus a (strictly) compatible system of inverse images over objects of ''E''. The category of cartesian sections of ''F'' is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;\underset{\longleftarrow}{\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) = \mathrm{Cart}_E(E,F).&lt;/math&gt;

In the important case where ''E'' has a [[Initial object|terminal object]] ''e'' (thus in particular when ''E'' is a [[topos]] or the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;/S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of [[slice category|arrows]] with target ''S'' in ''E'') the functor

: &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\colon\underset{\longleftarrow}{\mathrm{Lim}} (F/E) \to F_e,\qquad s\mapsto s(e)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[full and faithful functors|fully faithful]] (Lemma 5.7 of Giraud (1964)).

===Fibred categories and cleaved categories===
The technically most flexible and economical definition of fibred categories is based on the concept of cartesian morphisms. It is equivalent to a definition in terms of ''[[cleavage (mathematics)|cleavages]]'', the latter definition being actually the original one presented in Grothendieck (1959); the definition in terms of cartesian morphisms was introduced in Grothendieck (1971) in 1960–1961.

An ''E'' category φ: ''F'' → ''E'' is a ''fibred category'' (or a ''fibred E-category'', or a ''category fibred over E'') if each morphism ''f'' of ''E'' whose codomain is in the range of projection has at least one inverse image, and moreover the composition ''m ∘ n'' of any two cartesian morphisms ''m'',''n'' in ''F'' is always cartesian. In other words, an ''E''-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are in the range of projection) and are ''transitive''.

If ''E'' has a terminal object ''e'' and if ''F'' is fibred over ''E'', then the functor ε from cartesian sections to ''F&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined at the end of the previous section is an [[equivalence of categories]] and moreover [[surjection|surjective]] on objects.

If ''F'' is a fibred ''E''-category, it is always possible, for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' in ''E'' and each object ''y'' in ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'', to choose (by using the [[axiom of choice]]) precisely one inverse image ''m'': ''x'' → ''y''. The class of morphisms thus selected is called a ''cleavage'' and the selected morphisms are called the ''transport morphisms'' (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a ''cleaved category''. A cleavage is called ''normalised'' if the transport morphisms include all identities in ''F''; this means that the inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised cleavages below.

The choice of a (normalised) cleavage for a fibred ''E''-category ''F'' specifies, for each morphism ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' in ''E'', a ''functor'' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'': on objects ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is simply the inverse image by the corresponding transport morphism, and on morphisms it is defined in a natural manner by the defining universal property of cartesian morphisms. The operation which associates to an object ''S'' of ''E'' the fibre category ''F&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and to a morphism ''f'' the ''inverse image functor'' ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is ''almost'' a contravariant functor from ''E'' to the category of categories. However, in general it fails to commute strictly with composition of morphisms. Instead, if ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' and ''g'': ''U'' → ''T'' are morphisms in ''E'', then there is an isomorphism of functors
:&lt;math&gt; c_{f,g}\colon  \quad g^*f^* \to (f \circ g)^*.&lt;/math&gt;
These isomorphisms satisfy the following two compatibilities:
# &lt;math&gt;c_{f,\mathrm{id}_T} = c_{\mathrm{id}_S,f} = \mathrm{id}_{f^*}&lt;/math&gt;
# for three consecutive morphisms &lt;math&gt;h,g,f\colon\quad V \to U \to T \to S&lt;/math&gt; and object &lt;math&gt;x\in F_S&lt;/math&gt; the following holds: &lt;math&gt;c_{f,g\circ h} \cdot c_{g,h}(f^*(x)) = c_{f\circ g, h}(x)\cdot h^*(c_{f,g}(x)).&lt;/math&gt;
It can be shown (see Grothendieck (1971) section 8) that, inversely, any collection of functors ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; together with isomorphisms ''c''&lt;sub&gt;f,g&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying the compatibilities above, defines a cleaved category. These collections of inverse image functors provide a more intuitive view on fibred categories; and indeed, it was in terms of such compatible inverse image functors that fibred categories were introduced in Grothendieck (1959).

The paper by Gray referred to below makes analogies between these ideas and the notion of  [[fibration]] of spaces.

These ideas simplify in the case of [[groupoids]], as shown in the paper of Brown referred to below, which obtains a useful family of exact sequences from a fibration of groupoids.

===Splittings and split fibred categories===
A (normalised) cleavage such that the composition of two transport morphisms is always a transport morphism is called a ''splitting'', and a fibred category with a splitting is called a ''split'' (fibred) ''category''. In terms of inverse image functors the condition of being a splitting means that the composition of inverse image functors corresponding to composable morphisms ''f,g'' in ''E'' ''equals'' the inverse image functor corresponding to ''f ∘ g''. In other words, the compatibility isomorphisms ''c&lt;sub&gt;f,g&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the previous section are all identities for a split category. Thus split ''E''-categories correspond exactly to true functors from ''E'' to the category of categories.

Unlike cleavages, not all fibred categories admit splittings. For an example, see [[#Examples|below]].

===Co-cartesian morphisms and co-fibred categories===
One can invert the direction of arrows in the definitions above to arrive at corresponding concepts of co-cartesian morphisms, co-fibred categories and split co-fibred categories (or co-split categories). More precisely, if φ: ''F'' →''E'' is a functor, then a morphism ''m'': ''x'' → ''y'' in ''F'' is called ''co-cartesian'' if it is cartesian for the [[opposite functor]] φ&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;: ''F''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → ''E''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''m'' is also called a ''direct image'' and ''y'' a direct image of ''x'' for ''f'' = φ(''m''). A ''co-fibred'' ''E''-category is an''E''-category such that direct image exists for each morphism in ''E'' and that the composition of direct images is a direct image. A ''co-cleavage'' and a ''co-splitting'' are defined similarly, corresponding to ''direct image functors'' instead of inverse image functors.

==Properties==

===The 2-categories of fibred categories and split categories===
The categories fibred over a fixed category ''E'' form a 2-category '''Fib'''(''E''), where the ''category'' of morphisms between two fibred categories ''F'' and ''G'' is defined to be the category Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') of cartesian functors from ''F'' to ''G''.

Similarly the split categories over ''E'' form a 2-category '''Scin'''(''E'') (from French ''catégorie scindée''), where the category of morphisms between two split categories ''F'' and ''G'' is the full sub-category Scin&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') of ''E''-functors from ''F'' to ''G'' consisting of those functors that transform each transport morphism of ''F'' into a transport morphism of ''G''. Each such ''morphism of split E-categories'' is also a morphism of ''E''-fibred categories, i.e., Scin&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'') ⊂ Cart&lt;sub&gt;''E''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'',''G'').

There is a natural forgetful 2-functor ''i'': '''Scin'''(''E'') → '''Fib'''(''E'') that simply forgets the splitting.

===Existence of equivalent split categories===
While not all fibred categories admit a splitting, each fibred category is in fact ''equivalent'' to a split category. Indeed, there are two canonical ways to construct an equivalent split category for a given fibred category ''F'' over ''E''. More precisely, the forgetful 2-functor ''i'': '''Scin'''(''E'') → '''Fib'''(''E'') admits a right 2-adjoint ''S'' and a left 2-adjoint ''L'' (Theorems 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 of Giraud 1971), and ''S''(''F'') and ''L''(''F'') are the two associated split categories. The adjunction functors ''S''(''F'') →  ''F'' and  ''F'' → ''L''(''F'') are both cartesian and equivalences (''ibid''.). However, while their composition ''S''(''F'') → ''L''(''F'') is an equivalence (of categories, and indeed of fibred categories), it is ''not'' in general a morphism of split categories. Thus the two constructions differ in general. The two preceding constructions of split categories are used in a critical way in the construction of the [[stack (mathematics)|stack]] associated to a fibred category (and in particular stack associated to a [[pre-stack]]).

==Examples==
# The functor ''Ob '': '''Cat'''→'''Set''', sending a category to its set of objects, is a fibration. For a set ''S'', the fiber consists of categories ''C'' with ''Ob(C)=S''. The cartesian arrows are the fully faithful functors.
# '''Categories of arrows''': For any category ''E'' the ''category of arrows'' A(''E'') in ''E'' has as objects the morphisms in ''E'', and as morphisms the commutative squares in ''E'' (more precisely, a morphism from (''f'': ''X'' → ''T'') to (''g'': ''Y'' → ''S'') consists of morphisms (''a'': ''X'' → ''Y'') and (''b'': ''T'' → ''S'') such that ''bf = ga''). The functor which takes an arrow to its target makes A(''E'') into an ''E''-category; for an object ''S'' of ''E'' the fibre ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;/S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''S''-objects in ''E'', i.e., arrows in ''E'' with target ''S''. Cartesian morphisms in A(''E'') are precisely the [[Cartesian square (category theory)|cartesian square]]s in ''E'', and thus A(''E'') is fibred over ''E'' precisely when  [[fibre product]]s exist in ''E''.
# '''Fibre bundles''': Fibre products exist in the category ''Top'' of [[topological space]]s and thus by the previous example A(''Top'') is fibred over ''Top''. If ''Fib'' is the full subcategory of A(''Top'') consisting of arrows that are projection maps of [[fibre bundle]]s, then ''Fib&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the category of fibre bundles on ''S'' and ''Fib'' is fibred over ''Top''. A choice of a cleavage amounts to a choice of ordinary inverse image (or ''pull-back'') functors for fibre bundles.
# '''Vector bundles''': In a manner similar to the previous examples the projections (''p'': ''V'' → ''S'') of real (complex)  [[vector bundles]] to their base spaces form a category ''Vect''&lt;sub&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sub&gt; (''Vect''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;) over ''Top'' (morphisms of vector bundles respecting the [[vector space]] structure of the fibres). This ''Top''-category is also fibred, and the inverse image functors are the ordinary ''pull-back'' functors for vector bundles. These fibred categories are (non-full) subcategories of ''Fib''.
# '''Sheaves on topological spaces''': The inverse image functors of [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] make the categories Sh(''S'') of sheaves on topological spaces ''S'' into a (cleaved) fibred category ''Sh'' over ''Top''. This fibred category can be described as the full sub-category of A(''Top'') consisting of [[etale space]]s of sheaves. As with vector bundles, the sheaves of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] also form fibred categories of ''Top''.
# '''Sheaves on topoi''': If ''E'' is a [[topos]] and ''S'' is an object in ''E'', the category ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''S''-objects is also a topos, interpreted as the category of sheaves on ''S''. If ''f'': ''T'' → ''S'' is a morphism in ''E'', the inverse image functor ''f''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; can be described as follows: for a sheaf ''F'' on ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' and an object ''p'': ''U'' → ''T''  in ''E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' one has ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;F''(''U'') = Hom&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'', ''f&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;F'') equals Hom&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f ∘ p'', ''F'') = ''F''(''U''). These inverse image make the categories ''E&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;'' into a ''split'' fibred category on ''E''. This can be applied in particular to the "large" topos ''TOP'' of topological spaces.
# '''Quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes''': [[Quasi-coherent sheaf|Quasi-coherent sheaves]] form a fibred category over the category of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. This is one of the motivating examples for the definition of fibred categories.
# '''Fibred category admitting no splitting''': A group ''G'' can be considered as a category with one object and the elements of ''G'' as the morphisms, composition of morphisms being given by the group law. A group [[homomorphism]] ''f'': ''G'' → ''H'' can then be considered as a functor, which makes ''G'' into a ''H''-category. It can be checked that in this set-up all morphisms in ''G'' are cartesian; hence ''G'' is fibred over ''H'' precisely when ''f'' is surjective. A splitting in this setup is a (set-theoretic) [[section (category theory)|section]] of ''f'' which commutes strictly with composition, or in other words a section of ''f'' which is also a homomorphism. But as is well known in [[group theory]], this is not always possible (one can take the projection in a non-split [[group extension]]).
# '''Co-fibred category of sheaves''': The [[direct image]] functor of sheaves makes the categories of sheaves on topological spaces into a co-fibred category. The transitivity of the direct image shows that this is even naturally co-split.

{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=all}}

'''Freedom of religion''' is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or community, in public or private, to manifest religion or [[belief]] in teaching, practice, [[worship]], and observance. It also includes the freedom to change one's religion or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml |title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion is considered by many people and most of the nations to be a [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] [[human right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right|accessdate=5 December 2006|last=Davis|first=Derek H.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201105738/http://usinfo.state.gov/dd/eng_democracy_dialogues/religion/religion_essay.html|archivedate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ANDmIIpAmwC&amp;pg=PA29734|title=Congressional Record #29734 – 19 November 2003|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a country with a [[state religion]], freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not [[religious persecution|persecute]] believers in other faiths.
Freedom of belief is different. It allows the right to believe what a person, group or religion wishes, but it does not necessarily allow the right to practice the religion or belief openly and outwardly in a public manner.

==History==
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Minerva]] as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]
Historically, ''freedom of religion'' has been used to refer to the tolerance of different theological systems of belief, while ''freedom of worship'' has been defined as freedom of individual action. Nevertheless, freedom ''from'' religion is a far more pressing moralistic, legal, and peaceful solution.  Each of these have existed to varying degrees. While many countries have accepted some form of religious freedom, this has also often been limited in practice through punitive taxation, repressive social legislation, and political disenfranchisement. Compare examples of individual freedom in Italy or the Muslim tradition of [[dhimmi]]s, literally "protected individuals" professing an officially tolerated non-Muslim religion.

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789) guarantees freedom of religion, as long as religious activities do not infringe on public order in ways detrimental to society.]]
In [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] point of view often allowed communities of traders to operate under their own customs. When street mobs of separate quarters clashed in a [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, the issue was generally perceived to be an infringement of community rights.

[[Cyrus the Great]] established the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ca. 550 BC, and initiated a general policy of permitting religious freedom throughout the empire, documenting this on the [[Cyrus Cylinder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html Cyrus Cylinder], [http://www.livius.org/ livius.org].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard A. Taylor|author2=E. Ray Clendenen|title=Haggai, Malachi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC|date=15 October 2004|publisher=B&amp;H Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8054-0121-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hII6mqKrH9kC&amp;pg=PA31 31–32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the historical exceptions have been in regions where one of the revealed religions has been in a position of power: Judaism, [[Zoroastrianism]], Christianity and Islam. Others have been where the established order has felt threatened, as shown in the [[trial of Socrates]] in 399 BC or where the ruler has been deified, as in Rome, and refusal to offer token [[sacrifice]] was similar to refusing to take an [[oath of allegiance]]. This was the core for resentment and the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christian communities]].

Freedom of religious worship was established in the Buddhist [[Maurya Empire]] of [[History of India|ancient India]] by [[Ashoka the Great]] in the 3rd century BC, which was encapsulated in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]].

Greek-Jewish clashes at [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] in 73 AD and 117 AD and in [[Alexandria]] in 115 AD provide examples of cosmopolitan cities as scenes of tumult.

The Romans tolerated most religions, including [[Judaism]] and encouraged local subjects to continue worshipping their own gods. They did not however, tolerate [[Christianity]] until it was legalised by the Roman emperor [[Galerius]] in 311. The [[Edict of Milan]] guaranteed freedom of religion in the Roman Empire until the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380, which outlawed all religions except Christianity.

===Muslim world===
Following a period of fighting lasting around a hundred years before 620 AD which mainly involved Arab and Jewish inhabitants of [[Medina]] (then known as ''Yathrib''), religious freedom for Muslims, Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] was declared by [[Muhammad]] in the [[Constitution of Medina]]. The Islamic [[Caliphate]] later guaranteed religious freedom under the conditions that non-Muslim communities accept ''[[dhimmi]]'' status and their adult males pay the punitive ''[[jizya]]'' tax instead of the ''[[zakat]]'' paid by Muslim citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Njeuma|first=Martin Z.|title=Fulani Hegemony in Yola (Old Adamawa) 1809-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfQA4Q6fX7EC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;ots=8pyCFSKL0V&amp;dq=Fulani%20Hegemony%20in%20Yola%20(Old%20Adamawa)%201809-1902&amp;hl=fi&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-726-95-0|page=82|quote=Of all the various forms of taxation known to Islamic communities, it seems only two{{snd}} the zakat and the jixya were of importance in Adamawa.

The only privilege that was reserved for the Muslims was the seat of the caliphate, and this, because of certain religious functions attached to it, which could not naturally be discharged by a non-Muslim."

[[Religious pluralism]] existed in classical [[Islamic ethics]] and [[Sharia]], as the [[religious law]]s and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and [[Hinduism]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early [[Caliphate]], [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry-138&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeramantry|first=C.

According to the famous Islamic legal scholar [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Islam and the Blackamerican: looking toward the third resurrection|author=Sherman A.

===India===
{{Main article|Freedom of religion in India}}
Ancient Jews fleeing from persecution in their homeland 2,500 years ago settled in India and never faced [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Who are the Jews of India? – The S. Mark Taper Foundation imprint in Jewish studies. University of California Press. 2000. p. 26. {{ISBN|978-0-520-21323-4}}. https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWX6pF2PTJwC&amp;pg=PA26.; "When the Portuguese arrived in 1498, they brought a spirit of intolerance utterly alien to India. They soon established an Office of Inquisition at Goa, and at their hands Indian Jews experienced the only instance of anti-Semitism ever to occur in Indian soil."&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of religion [[edicts]] have been found written during [[Ashoka the Great]]'s reign in the 3rd century BC. Freedom to practise, preach and propagate any religion is a constitutional right in Modern India. Most major religious festivals of the main communities are included in the list of national holidays.

Although India is an 80% [[Hindu]] country, India is a secular state without any [[state religion]]s.

Many scholars and intellectuals believe that India's predominant religion, [[Hinduism]], has long been a most tolerant religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David E. Ludden|title=Contesting the Nation: Religion, Community, and the Politics of Democracy in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC|year=1996|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1585-0|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jEUdPqYQjhoC&amp;pg=257 257–58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, "[India] is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally non-religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non–religious%22 134]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]], the Tibetan leader in exile, said that religious tolerance of 'Aryabhoomi,' a reference to India found in the [[Mahabharata]], has been in existence in this country from thousands of years. "Not only Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism which are the native religions but also Christianity and Islam have flourished here. Religious tolerance is inherent in Indian tradition," the Dalai Lama said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/42229/indias-religious-tolerance-lauded.html|title=India's religious tolerance lauded|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in the [[Indian subcontinent]] is exemplified by the reign of King Piyadasi (304–232 BC) ([[Ashoka]]). One of King Ashoka's main concerns was to reform governmental institutes and exercise moral principles in his attempt to create a [[Edicts of Ashoka|just and humane society]]. Later he promoted the principles of [[Buddhism]], and the creation of a just, understanding and fair society was held as an important principle for many ancient rulers of this time in the East.

The importance of freedom of worship in India was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:
{{Quote|King Piyadasi (Ashok) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, one must not exalt one's creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.}} 

On the main Asian continent, the Mongols were tolerant of religions. People could worship as they wished freely and openly.

After the arrival of Europeans, Christians in their zeal to convert local as per belief in conversion as service of God, have also been seen to fall into frivolous methods since their arrival, though by and large there are hardly any reports of law and order disturbance from mobs with Christian beliefs, except perhaps in the north eastern region of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-knapp.com/christian_persecution_in_india.htm|title=Christian Persecution in India: The Real Story|publisher=Stephen-knapp.com|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom of religion in contemporary India is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 of the nation's constitution. Accordingly, every citizen of India has a right to profess, practice and propagate their religions peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=The Constitution of India |format=PDF |accessdate=3 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]] counters this argument by saying that [[evangelical]] Christians are forcefully (or through money) converting rural, illiterate populations and they are only trying to stop this.

In September 2010, the Indian state of [[Kerala]]'s State Election Commissioner announced that "Religious heads cannot issue calls to vote for members of a particular community or to defeat the nonbelievers".&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orthodoxherald.com/2010/09/18/%E2%80%98using-places-of-worship-for-campaigning-in-kerala-civic-polls-is-violation-of-poll-code%E2%80%99/|title='Using places of worship for campaigning in Kerala civic polls is violation of poll code'|newspaper=Indian Orthodox Herald|date=18 September 2010|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church comprising Latin, Syro-Malabar and Syro-Malankara rites used to give clear directions to the faithful on exercising their franchise during elections through pastoral letters issued by bishops or council of bishops. The pastoral letter issued by Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) on the eve of the poll urged the faithful to shun atheists.&lt;ref name="orthodoxherald.com"/&gt;

Even today, most Indians celebrate all religious festivals with equal enthusiasm and respect. [[Hindu]] festivals like [[Deepavali]] and [[Holi]], Muslim festivals like [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid-Ul-Adha]], [[Muharram]], Christian festivals like Christmas and other festivals like [[Buddha Purnima]], [[Mahavir Jayanti]], Gur Purab etc. are celebrated and enjoyed by all [[Indian people|Indians]].

===Europe===

====Religious intolerance====
[[File:CONGRESS COLUMN-BRUSSELS-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (13).jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century allegorical statue on the [[Congress Column]] in Belgium depicting religious freedom]]
Most Roman Catholic kingdoms kept a tight rein on religious expression throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. Jews were alternately tolerated and persecuted, the most notable examples of the latter being the expulsion of all [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jews]] from Spain in 1492. Some of those who remained and converted were tried as heretics in the [[Inquisition]] for allegedly practicing Judaism in secret. Despite the persecution of Jews, they were the most tolerated non-Catholic faith in Europe.

However, the latter was in part a reaction to the growing movement that became the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. As early as 1380, [[John Wycliffe]] in England denied [[transubstantiation]] and began his translation of the Bible into English. He was condemned in a [[Papal Bull]] in 1410, and all his books were burned.

In 1414, [[Jan Hus]], a [[Bohemia]]n preacher of reformation, was given a safe conduct by the Holy Roman Emperor to attend the [[Council of Constance]]. Not entirely trusting in his safety, he made his will before he left. His forebodings proved accurate, and he was burned at the stake on 6 July 1415. The Council also decreed that Wycliffe's remains be disinterred and cast out. This decree was not carried out until 1429.

After the fall of the city of [[Granada]], Spain, in 1492, the Muslim population was promised religious freedom by the [[Treaty of Granada]], but that promise was short-lived. In 1501, Granada's Muslims were given an ultimatum to either convert to Christianity or to emigrate. The majority converted, but only superficially, continuing to dress and speak as they had before and to secretly practice Islam. The [[Morisco]]s (converts to Christianity) were ultimately expelled from Spain between 1609 (Castile) and 1614 (rest of Spain), by [[Philip III of Spain#Expulsion of the Moors (1609–1610)|Philip III]].

[[Martin Luther]] published his famous 95 Theses in [[Wittenberg]] on 31 October 1517. His major aim was theological, summed up in the three basic dogmas of Protestantism:

* The Bible only is infallible.
* Every Christian can interpret it.
* Human sins are so wrongful that no deed or merit, only God's grace, can lead to salvation.

In consequence, Luther hoped to stop the sale of [[indulgence]]s and to reform the Church from within. In 1521, he was given the chance to recant at the [[Diet of Worms]] before [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. After he refused to recant, he was declared heretic. Partly for his own protection, he was sequestered on the [[Wartburg]] in the possessions of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], where he translated the [[New Testament]] into German. He was excommunicated by Papal Bull in 1521.

However, the movement continued to gain ground in his absence and spread to Switzerland. [[Huldrych Zwingli]] preached reform in [[Zürich]] from 1520 to 1523. He opposed the sale of indulgences, celibacy, pilgrimages, pictures, statues, relics, altars, and organs. This culminated in outright war between the Swiss [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] that accepted Protestantism and the Catholics. The Catholics were victorious, and Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531. The Catholic cantons were magnanimous in victory.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The defiance of Papal authority proved contagious, and in 1533, when [[Henry VIII of England]] was excommunicated for his divorce and remarriage to Anne Boleyn, he promptly established a state church with bishops appointed by the crown. This was not without internal opposition, and [[Thomas More]], who had been his Lord Chancellor, was executed in 1535 for opposition to Henry.

In 1535, the Swiss canton of Geneva became Protestant. In 1536, the [[Bern]]ese imposed the reformation on the canton of [[Vaud]] by conquest. They sacked the cathedral in [[Lausanne]] and destroyed all its art and statuary. [[John Calvin]], who had been active in Geneva was expelled in 1538 in a power struggle, but he was invited back in 1540.

[[File:ReligiousFreedomStamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|A U.S. postage stamp commemorating religious freedom and the [[Flushing Remonstrance]] ]]
The same kind of seesaw back and forth between Protestantism and Catholicism was evident in England when [[Mary I of England]] returned that country briefly to the Catholic fold in 1553 and persecuted Protestants. However, her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England]] was to restore the [[Church of England]] in 1558, this time permanently, and began to persecute Catholics again. The [[King James Bible]] commissioned by King [[James I of England]] and published in 1611 proved a landmark for Protestant worship, with official Catholic forms of worship being banned.

In France, although peace was made between Protestants and Catholics at the [[Treaty of Saint Germain]] in 1570, persecution continued, most notably in the [[Massacre of Saint Bartholomew's Day]] on 24 August 1572, in which thousands of Protestants throughout France were killed. A few years before, at the "Michelade" of Nîmes in 1567, Protestants had massacred the local Catholic clergy.

====Early steps and attempts in the way of tolerance====

Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic) enjoyed religious freedom between 1436 and 1520, and became one of the most liberal countries of the Christian world during that period of time. The so-called Basel Compacts of 1436 declared the freedom of religion and peace between Catholics and [[Utraquism|Utraquists]]. In 1609 Emperor Rudolf II granted Bohemia greater religious liberty with his Letter of Majesty. The privileged position of the Catholic Church in the Czech kingdom was firmly established after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620. Gradually freedom of religion in Bohemian lands came to an end and Protestants fled or were expelled from the country. A devout Catholic, Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] forcibly converted Austrian and Bohemian Protestants.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the meantime, in Germany [[Philip Melanchthon]] drafted the [[Augsburg Confession]] as a common confession for the Lutherans and the free territories. It was presented to Charles V in 1530.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Charles V agreed to tolerate Lutheranism in 1555 at the [[Peace of Augsburg]]. Each state was to take the religion of its prince, but within those states, there was not necessarily religious tolerance. Citizens of other faiths could relocate to a more hospitable environment.

In France, from the 1550s, many attempts to reconcile Catholics and Protestants and to establish tolerance failed because the State was too weak to enforce them. It took the victory of prince Henry IV of France, who had converted into Protestantism, and his accession to the throne, to impose religious tolerance formalized in the [[Edict of Nantes]] in 1598. It would remain in force for over 80 years until its revocation in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France]]. Intolerance remained the norm until Louis XVI, who signed the Edict of Versailles (1787), then the constitutional text of 24 December 1789, granting civilian rights to Protestants. The [[French Revolution]] then abolished state religion and confiscated all Church property, turning intolerance against Catholics.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Early laws and legal guarantees for religious freedom===

====Principality of Transylvania====
In 1558, the Transylvanian Diet's [[Edict of Torda]] declared free practice of both Catholicism and Lutheranism. Calvinism, however, was prohibited. Calvinism was included among the accepted religions in 1564. Ten years after the first law, in 1568, the same Diet, under the chairmanship of [[List of Hungarian monarchs|King of Hungary]], and [[List of Princes of Transylvania|Prince of Transylvania]] [[John Sigismund Zápolya]] (John II.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mek.oszk.hu/03400/03407/html/103.html|title=History of Transylvania.

However, it was more than a religious tolerance; it declared the equality of the religions, prohibiting all kinds of acts from authorities or from simple people, which could harm other groups or people because of their religious beliefs. The emergence in social hierarchy wasn't dependent on the religion of the person thus Transylvania had also Catholic and Protestant monarchs, who all respected the Edict of Torda. The lack of state religion was unique for centuries in Europe. Therefore, the Edict of Torda is considered as the first legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lightbringers.net/content/story-francis-david-and-king-john-sigismund-establishment-transylvanian-unitarian-church|title=The Story of Francis David and King John Sigismund: The Establishment of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church|work=Lightbringers|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four religions ([[Catholicism]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarianism]]) were named as accepted religions (religo recepta), having their representatives in the Transylvanian Diet, while the other religions, like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxs]], [[Sabbatarians]] and [[Anabaptists]] were tolerated churches (religio tolerata), which meant that they had no power in the law making and no veto rights in the Diet, but they were not persecuted in any way. Thanks to the Edict of Torda, from the last decades of the 16th Century Transylvania was the only place in Europe, where so many religions could live together in harmony and without persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mult-kor.hu/20051125_erdely_es_a_habsburg_vallaspolitika_a_17_szazad_utolso_evtizedeiben "Kovács Kálmán: Erdély és a Habsburg valláspolitika a 17. század utolsó évtizedeiben"] ''Mult-Kor'' (25 November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the [[Union of Utrecht]] (20 January 1579), personal freedom of religion was declared in the struggle between the Northern Netherlands and Spain. The Union of Utrecht was an important step in the establishment of the Dutch Republic (from 1581 to 1795). Under Calvinist leadership, the Netherlands became the most tolerant country in Europe. It granted asylum to persecuted religious minorities, such as the Huguenots, the Dissenters, and the Jews who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi, ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', 11. Auflage (1956), Tübingen (Germany), pp. 396–97&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of a Jewish community in the Netherlands and New Amsterdam (present-day New York) during the Dutch Republic is an example of religious freedom. When New Amsterdam surrendered to the English in 1664, freedom of religion was guaranteed in the Articles of Capitulation. It benefitted also the Jews who had landed on Manhattan Island in 1654, fleeing Portuguese persecution in Brazil. During the 18th century, other Jewish communities were established at Newport, Rhode Island, Philadelphia, Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Ciffs, N.J., p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Intolerance of dissident forms of Protestantism also continued, as evidenced by the exodus of the Pilgrims, who sought refuge, first in the Netherlands, and ultimately in America, founding [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. [[William Penn]], the founder of Philadelphia, was involved in a case which had a profound effect upon future American laws and those of England. In a classic case of jury nullification, the jury refused to convict William Penn of preaching a Quaker sermon, which was illegal. Even though the jury was imprisoned for their acquittal, they stood by their decision and helped establish the freedom of religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Poland====
[[File:Konfederacja Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573. The beginning of religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The General Charter of Jewish Liberties known as the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued by the Duke of [[Greater Poland]] [[Bolesław the Pious|Boleslaus the Pious]] on 8 September 1264 in [[Kalisz]]. The statute served as the basis for the legal position of Jews in Poland and led to the creation of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking autonomous Jewish nation until 1795. The statute granted exclusive jurisdiction of Jewish courts over Jewish matters and established a separate tribunal for matters involving Christians and Jews. Additionally, it guaranteed personal liberties and safety for Jews including freedom of religion, travel, and trade. The statute was ratified by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir III of Poland]] in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453 and [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]] in 1539. Poland freed Jews from direct royal authority, opening up enormous administrative and economic opportunities to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinkoff|first=Nancy|title=Out of the Shtetl: Making Jews Modern in the Polish Borderlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-KmeZgY2hIC|year=2003|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|isbn=978-1-930675-16-2|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f–KmeZgY2hIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=1539 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
{{Main article|Warsaw Confederation}}
The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the future [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] throughout the 15th and early 16th century, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth kept religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Zamoyski, Adam. ''The Polish Way''.

===United States===
{{See also|Freedom of religion in the United States}}
Most of the early colonies were generally not tolerant of dissident forms of worship, with Maryland being one of the exceptions. For example, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] found it necessary to found a new colony in [[Rhode Island]] to escape persecution in the theocratically dominated colony of Massachusetts. The [[Puritans]] of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were the most active of the New England persecutors of [[Quakers]], and the persecuting spirit was shared by [[Plymouth Colony]] and the colonies along the [[Connecticut river]].&lt;ref name=PER/&gt; In 1660, one of the most notable victims of the religious intolerance was English Quaker [[Mary Dyer]], who was hanged in Boston, Massachusetts for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.&lt;ref name=PER&gt;Rogers, Horatio, 2009.

Freedom of religion was first applied as a principle of government in the founding of the colony of Maryland, founded by the Catholic [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.&lt;ref name="Symbol of Enduring Freedom"&gt;Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen years later (1649), the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: "No person or persons...shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof." The Act allowed freedom of worship for all [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christians in Maryland, but [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] anyone who denied the divinity of [[Jesus]]. The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed during the Cromwellian Era with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J.

Williams gave the most profound argument: As faith is the free work of the [[Holy Spirit]], it cannot be forced on a person. Therefore, strict [[separation of church and state]] has to be kept.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte der Christenheit'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States in 1776. It was the inseparable connection between democracy, religious freedom, and the other forms of freedom which became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded the disestablishment of state churches{{snd}} [[Anglican]] and [[Congregationalist]]{{snd}} and the protection of religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiterating Maryland's and the other colonies' earlier colonial legislation, the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], written in 1779 by [[Thomas Jefferson]], proclaimed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Those sentiments also found expression in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the national constitution, part of the United States' [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."

The United States formally considers religious freedom in its foreign relations. The [[International Religious Freedom Act of 1998]] established the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] which investigates the records of over 200 other nations with respect to religious freedom, and makes recommendations to submit nations with egregious records to ongoing scrutiny and possible economic sanctions. Many human rights organizations have urged the United States to be still more vigorous in imposing sanctions on countries that do not permit or tolerate religious freedom.

===Canada===
{{Further information|Freedom of religion in Canada}}
Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. Canadian law goes further, requiring that private citizens and companies provide [[reasonable accommodation]] to those, for example, with strong religious beliefs. The [[Canadian Human Rights Act]] allows an exception to reasonable accommodation with respect to religious dress, such as a [[Sikh]] [[turban]], when there is a ''[[bona fide]]'' occupational requirement, such as a workplace requiring a [[hard hat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2011-60-e.htm#a6 Freedom of Religion and Religious Symbols in the Public Sphere. 2.2.2 Headcoverings].

===International===
On 25 November 1981, the United Nations General Assembly passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]]. This declaration recognizes freedom of religion as a fundamental human right in accordance with several other instruments of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/36/a36r055.htm|title=A/RES/36/55.

However, the most substantial binding legal instruments that guarantee the right to freedom of religion that was passed by the international community is the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which states in its Article 14: ''"States Parties shall respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.{{snd}} States Parties shall respect the rights and duties of the parents and, when applicable, legal guardians, to provide direction to the child in the exercise of his or her right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child.{{snd}} Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr2int.htm Religious Rights – International Legal Instruments]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs===
In 1993, the UN's human rights committee declared that article 18 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] "protects theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/453883fb22.html|title=CCPR General Comment 22: 30/07/93 on ICCPR Article 18|work=Minorityrights.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee further stated that "the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another or to adopt atheistic views." Signatories to the convention are barred from "the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers" to recant their beliefs or convert. Despite this, minority religions still are persecuted in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=1 August 2003|title=Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran|author=International Federation for Human Rights|publisher=fdih.org|accessdate=3 March 2009|url=http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |title=The Evolution of Religious Liberty as a Universal Human Right |accessdate=3 March 2009 |last=Davis |first=Derek H. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723210828/http://www.law2.byu.edu/lawreview/archives/2002/2/dav2.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal secular===
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued in favour of freedom of religion.|alt=A man posing for a print]]
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] noted in his book on English society, ''[[Letters on the English]]'', that freedom of religion in a diverse society was deeply important to maintaining peace in that country.  That it was also important in understanding why England at that time was more prosperous in comparison to the country's less religiously tolerant European neighbours. &lt;blockquote&gt;If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there are such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/2/6.html|title=Letter VI – On the Presbyterians.

So long as there are enough different religions and/or religious sects operating freely in a society then they are all compelled to moderate their more controversial and violent teachings, so as to be more appealing to more people and so have an easier time attracting new converts. It is this [[free competition]] amongst religious sects for converts that ensures stability and tranquillity in the long run.

Smith also points out that laws that prevent religious freedom and seek to preserve the power and belief in a particular religion will, in the long run, only serve to weaken and corrupt that religion, as its leaders and preachers become complacent, disconnected and unpractised in their ability to seek and win over new converts:&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 643–49&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The interested and active zeal of religious teachers can be dangerous and troublesome only where there is either but one sect tolerated in the society, or where the whole of a large society is divided into two or three great sects; the teachers of each acting by concert, and under a regular discipline and subordination. But that zeal must be altogether innocent, where the society is divided into two or three hundred, or, perhaps, into as many thousand small sects, of which no one could be considerable enough to disturb the public tranquillity. The teachers of each sect, seeing themselves surrounded on all sides with more adversaries than friends, would be obliged to learn that candour and moderation which are so seldom to be found among the teachers of those great sects.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hinduism===
Hinduism is one of the more broad-minded religions when it comes to religious freedom.&lt;ref name=Religionfacts.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/hinduism/beliefs.htm|title=Hindu Beliefs|publisher=religionfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It respects the right of everyone to reach God in their own way. [[Hindus]] believe in different ways to preach attainment of God and religion as a philosophy and hence respect all religions as equal.

===Judaism===
[[File:Lesley and Rachel Detained.jpg|thumb|Women detained at Western Wall for wearing prayer shawls; photo from Women of the Wall]]
[[Judaism]] includes multiple streams, such as Orthodox, [[Reform Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], [[Jewish Renewal]] and [[Humanistic Judaism]]. However, Judaism also exists in many forms as a civilization, possessing characteristics known as  peoplehood, rather than strictly as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Erica|last2=Galperin|first2=Misha|title=The Case for Jewish Peoplehood: Can We be One?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC|year=2009|publisher=Jewish Lights Publishing|isbn=978-1-58023-401-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QBQxCts6_CYC&amp;pg=PA71 71]|quote=The 'hood' is not only a geographic reference; it is a shared identity that may be characterized by joint assumptions, body language, certain expressions, and a host of familial-like behaviors that unite an otherwise dispirate groupe of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Torah, Jews are forbidden to practice idolatry and are commanded to root out pagan and idolatrous practices within their midst, including killing idolaters who sacrifice children to their gods, or engage in immoral activities. However, these laws are not adhered to anymore as Jews have usually lived among a multi-religious community.

After the conquest of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judea by the Roman Empire, a Jewish state did not exist until 1948 with the establishment of the State of Israel. For over 1500 years Jewish people lived under pagan, Christian, Muslim, etc. rule. As such Jewish people in some of these states faced persecution. From the pogroms in Europe during the Middle Ages to the establishment of segregated Jewish ghettos during World War II. In the Middle East, Jews were categorised as dhimmi, non- Muslims permitted to live within a Muslim state. Even though given rights within a Muslim state, a dhimmi is still not equal to a Muslim within Muslim society, the same way non-Jewish Israeli citizens are not [[ Israeli apartheid| equal ]] with Jewish citizens in modern-day Israel.

Possibly because of this history of long term persecution, Jews in modernity have been among the most active proponents of religious freedom in the US and abroad and have founded and supported anti-hate institutions, including the Anti-Defamation League, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union. Jews are very active in supporting Muslim and other religious groups in the US against discrimination and hate crimes and most Jewish congregations throughout the US and many individual Jews participate in interfaith community projects and programs.

The State of Israel was established for the Jewish diaspora after World War II. While the Israel Declaration of Independence stresses religious freedom as a fundamental principle, in practice the current{{clarify timeframe|date=January 2017}} government, dominated by the ultra-Orthodox segment of the population has instituted legal barriers for those who do not practice Orthodox Judaism as Jews. However, as a nation state, Israel is very open towards other religions and religious practices, including public Muslim call to prayer chants and Christian prayer bells ringing in Jerusalem.  Israel has been evaluated in research by the Pew organization as having "high" government restrictions on religion. The government recognizes only Orthodox Judaism in certain matters of personal status, and marriages can only be performed by religious authorities. The government provides the greatest funding to Orthodox Judaism, even though adherents represent a minority of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;"Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Global restrictions on Religion (2009" http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish women, including [[Anat Hoffman]], have been arrested at the [[Western Wall]] for praying and singing while wearing religious garments the Orthodox feel should be reserved for men. [[Women of the Wall]] have organized to promote religious freedom at the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Police-arrest-5-women-at-Western-Wall-for-wearing-tallitot-309436 "Police arrest 5 women at Western Wall for wearing tallitot"] ''Jerusalem Post'' (11 April 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, a group of 60 non-Orthodox rabbinical students were told they would not be allowed to pray in the [[Knesset]] synagogue because it is reserved for Orthodox. Rabbi Joel Levy, director of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, said that he had submitted the request on behalf of the students and saw their shock when the request was denied. He noted: "paradoxically, this decision served as an appropriate end to our conversation about religion and state in Israel."

Prior to this, [[Pope Pius IX]] had written a document called the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]. ''The Syllabus was made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, and presented as a list of "condemned propositions". It does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but it cites earlier documents to which the reader can refer for the Pope's reasons for saying each proposition is false. Among the statements included in the Syllabus are: "[It is an error to say that] Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true" (15); "[It is an error to say that] In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship"; "[It is an error to say that] Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P9SYLL.HTM|title=The Syllabus|author=[[Pope Pius IX]]|publisher=[[EWTN]]}}, [http://www.ewtn.com/ Global Catholic Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Orthodox Christians, especially those living in democratic countries, support religious freedom for all, as evidenced by the position of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. Many Protestant Christian churches, including some [[Baptists]], [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Churches of Christ]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and [[Mainline (Protestant)|main line]] churches have a commitment to religious freedoms. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] also affirms religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;''"We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may"'', [http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng the eleventh Article of Faith].&lt;/ref&gt;

However others, such as African scholar [[Makau Mutua]], have argued that Christian insistence on the propagation of their faith to native cultures as an element of religious freedom has resulted in a corresponding denial of religious freedom to native traditions and led to their destruction. As he states in the book produced by the Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief, "Imperial religions have necessarily violated individual conscience and the communal expressions of Africans and their communities by subverting African religions."&lt;ref&gt;Mutua, Makau. 2004.

In their book ''[[Breaking India]]'', [[Rajiv Malhotra]] and [[Aravindan Neelakandan]] discussed the "US Church" funding activities in India, such as the popularly advertised campaigns to "save" poor children by feeding, clothing, and educating them, with the book arguing that the funds collected were being used not so much for the purposes indicated to sponsors, but for indoctrination and conversion activities. They suggest that India is the prime target of a huge enterprise{{snd}} a "network" of organizations, individuals, and churches{{snd}} that, they argue, seem intensely devoted to the task of creating a separatist identity, history, and even religion for the vulnerable sections of India.

[[Joel Spring]] has written about the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Christianity added new impetus to the expansion of empire. Increasing the arrogance of the imperial project, Christians insisted that the Gospels and the Church were the only valid sources of religious beliefs. Imperialists could claim that they were both civilizing the world and spreading the true religion. By the 5th century, Christianity was thought of as co-extensive with the ''Imperium romanum''. This meant that to be human, as opposed to being a natural slave, was to be "civilized" and Christian. Historian Anthony Pagden argues, "just as the ''civitas''; had now become coterminous with Christianity, so to be human{{snd}} to be, that is, one who was 'civil', and who was able to interpret correctly the law of nature{{snd}} one had now also to be Christian." After the fifteenth century, most Western colonialists rationalized the spread of empire with the belief that they were saving a barbaric and pagan world by spreading Christian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Globalization and educational rights: an intercivilizational analysis|author=Joel H.

[[Conversion to Islam]] is simple, but Muslims are forbidden to convert  from Islam to another religion. Certain [[Muslim-majority countries]] are known for their restrictions on religious freedom, highly favoring Muslim citizens over non-Muslim citizens. Other countries{{who|date=February 2012}} having the same restrictive laws tend to be more liberal when imposing them. Even other Muslim-majority countries are secular and thus do not regulate religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=United States |first=Department of State|title=2010 International Religious Freedom Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/index.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012|reason=this may be supportable, but I don't see clear support in the source cited}} 

Islamic theologians{{Who|date=October 2009}} quote the [[Qur'an]] ({{Cite quran|2|256|expand=no|q=There is no compulsion in religion}} and {{Cite quran|109|1|end=6|expand=no|q=Say: O you who reject faith, I do not worship what you worship, nor do you worship what I worship...To you be your religion, and to me be mine}}, i.e., Sura [[Al-Kafirun]]) to show scriptural support for religious freedom.

{{Cite quran|2|190|end=194|style=nosup}}, referring to the war against Pagans during the [[Battle of Badr]] in [[Medina]], indicates that Muslims are only allowed to fight against those who intend to harm them ([[right of self-defense]]) and that if their enemies surrender, they must also stop because God does not like those who transgress limits.

In Bukhari:V9 N316, Jabir ibn 'Abdullah narrated that a Bedouin accepted Islam and then when he got a fever he demanded that [[Muhammad]] to cancel his pledge (allow him to renounce Islam). Muhammad refused to do so. The Bedouin man repeated his demand once, but Muhammad once again refused. Then, he (the Bedouin) left Medina. Muhammad said, "Madinah is like a pair of bellows (furnace): it expels its impurities and brightens and clear its good." In this narration, there was no evidence demonstrating that Muhammad ordered the execution of the Bedouin for wanting to renounce Islam.

In addition, {{Cite quran|5|3|style=nosup}}, which is believed to be God's final revelation to Muhammad, states that Muslims are to fear God and not those who reject Islam, and {{Cite quran|53|38|end=39|style=nosup}} states that one is accountable only for one's own actions. Therefore, it postulates that in Islam, in the matters of practising a religion, it does not relate to a worldly punishment, but rather these actions are accountable to God in the [[afterlife]]. Thus, this supports the argument against the execution of apostates in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wix.com/ugd/789970_3b7987b974024c298f48d68986fe0c80.pdf Islam and Belief: At Home with Religious Freedom], Abdullah Saeed (2014): 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the other hand, some Muslims support the practice of executing apostates who leave Islam, as in Bukhari:V4 B52 N260; "The Prophet said, 'If a Muslim discards his religion and separates from the main body of Muslims, kill him.{{cn span|However, many Muslims believe that this hadith was written in the context of war and therefore Prophet Muhammad stipulated that whichever Muslim rejects his religion, leaves from the main body of Muslims and betrays the Muslims in war should be executed as a punishment for his treachery towards the community of Muslims.

===Changing religion===
{{Main article|Religious conversion}}
Among the most contentious areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change or abandon his or her own religion ([[apostasy]]), and the right to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.

Other debates have centered around restricting certain kinds of missionary activity by religions. Many Islamic states, and others such as China, severely restrict missionary activities of other religions. Greece, among European countries, has generally looked unfavorably on missionary activities of denominations others than the majority church and proselytizing is constitutionally prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51555.htm|title=US State Department report on Greece|publisher=State.gov|date=8 November 2005|accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different kind of critique of the freedom to propagate religion has come from non-Abrahamic traditions such as the African and Indian. African scholar [[Makau Mutua]] criticizes religious evangelism on the ground of cultural annihilation by what he calls "proselytizing universalist faiths" (Chapter 28: Proselytism and Cultural Integrity, p.&amp;nbsp;652):

{{Quote|...the (human) rights regime incorrectly assumes a level playing field by requiring that African religions compete in the marketplace of ideas. The rights corpus not only forcibly imposes on African religions the obligation to compete{{snd}} a task for which as nonproselytizing, noncompetitive creeds they are not historically fashioned{{snd}} but also protects the evangelizing religions in their march towards universalization ... it seems inconceivable that the human rights regime would have intended to protect the right of certain religions to destroy others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mutua  |first=Makau |title=Facilitating Freedom of Religion or Belief, A Deskbook |year=2004 |publisher= Oslo Coalition on Freedom of Religion or Belief|isbn=978-90-04-13783-7|page=652}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- direct quote should have page number.

Some Indian scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20150/Sankrant%20Sanu.%204-12.pdf|format=PDF|title=Re-examining Religious Freedom|first=Sankrant|last=Sanu|publisher=Manushi|year=2006|accessdate=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have similarly argued that the right to propagate religion is not culturally or religiously neutral.

In Sri Lanka, there have been debates regarding a bill on religious freedom that seeks to protect indigenous religious traditions from certain kinds of missionary activities. Debates have also occurred in various states of India regarding similar laws, particularly those that restrict conversions using force, fraud or allurement.

In 2008, [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide]], a Christian human rights non-governmental organisation which specializes in religious freedom, launched an in-depth report on the human rights abuses faced by individuals who leave Islam for another religion. The report is the product of a year long research project in six different countries. It calls on Muslim nations, the international community, the UN and the international media to resolutely address the serious violations of human rights suffered by apostates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.online2.church123.com/attach.asp?clientURN=christiansolidarityworldwide2&amp;attachFileName=09ae125dba76986113441ef1463aca8e.attach&amp;attachOriginalFileName=CSW_Briefing_Apostasy_April_2008.pdf|title=No place to call home|date=29 April 2008|publisher=Christian Solidarity Worldwide|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Apostasy in Islam====
{{Main article|Apostasy in Islam|Takfir|Mutaween}}
[[File:Rechtsgutachten betr Apostasie im Islam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Legal opinion on apostasy by the [[Fatwa]] committee at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], the highest Islamic institution in the world, concerning the case of a man who converted to Christianity: "Since he left Islam, he will be invited to express his regret. If he does not regret, he will be killed pertaining to rights and obligations of the Islamic law."]]
In Islam, apostasy is called "''ridda''" ("turning back") and is considered to be a profound insult to God. A person born of Muslim parents that rejects Islam is called a "''murtad fitri''" (natural apostate), and a person that converted to Islam and later rejects the religion is called a "''murtad milli''" (apostate from the community).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118171026/http://www.peacefaq.com/apostacy.html |archivedate=18 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }} from "Leaving Islam: Apostates speak out" by Ibn Warraq&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), the consensus view is that a male apostate must be [[Apostasy in Islam#Execution|put to death]] unless he suffers from a mental disorder or converted under duress, for example, due to an imminent danger of being killed. A female apostate must be either executed, according to [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]], and [[Hanbali]] schools of [[Sunni Islam]]ic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]), or imprisoned until she reverts to Islam as advocated by the Sunni [[Hanafi]] school and by [[Shi'a]] scholars.&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Heffening, W.|article=Murtadd| encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' Online Edition|editor1=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=C.E. Bosworth |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|issn=1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the one performing the execution of an apostate must be an [[imam]].&lt;ref name="EI Murtadd" /&gt; At the same time, all schools of [[Islamic jurisprudence]] agree that any Muslim can kill an apostate without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adbul Qadir Oudah|title=Kitab Bhavan|year=1999|isbn=81-7151-273-9|publisher=Kitab Bhavan|location=New Delhi}}, Volume II. pp. 258–62; Volume IV. pp. 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while almost all scholars agree about the punishment, many disagree on the allowable time to retract the apostasy. Many scholars push this as far as allowing the apostate till he/she dies. Thus, practically making the death penalty just a theoretical statement/exercise.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} S. A. Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Pakistan, argues that there is no indication of the death penalty for apostasy in the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. A. Rahman|authorlink=S. A. Rahman|title=Punishment of Apostasy in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC|year=2007|publisher=The Other Press|isbn=978-983-9541-49-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=PA132 132–42]|chapter=Summary and Conclusions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4fsYtFf5AoC&amp;pg=Pa132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular law===
Religious practice may also conflict with secular law, creating debates on religious freedom. For instance, even though [[polygamy]] is permitted in Islam, it is prohibited in secular law in many countries. This raises the question of whether prohibiting the practice infringes on the beliefs of certain Muslims. The US and India, both constitutionally secular nations, have taken two different views of this. In India, polygamy is permitted, but only for Muslims, under Muslim Personal Law. In the US, polygamy is prohibited for all. This was a major source of conflict between the early [[LDS Church]] and the United States until the Church amended its position on practicing polygamy.

Similar issues have also arisen in the context of the religious use of [[psychedelic substance]]s by Native American tribes in the United States as well as other Native practices.

In 1955, Chief Justice of California [[Roger J. Traynor]] neatly summarized the American position on how freedom of religion cannot imply freedom from law: "Although freedom of conscience and the freedom to believe are absolute, the freedom to act is not."&lt;ref&gt;''Pencovic v. Pencovic'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/45C2d97.htm 45 Cal. 2d 67] (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; But with respect to the religious use of animals within secular law and those acts, the [[US Supreme Court]] decision in the case of the ''[[Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]'' in 1993 upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision: "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Burger in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'' {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Law and Procedure'', Daniel E. Hall. Cengage Learning, July 2008. p. 266.

In 2015, [[Kim Davis]], a Kentucky county clerk, refused to abide by the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' legalizing [[Same-sex marriage in the United States]]. When she refused to issue marriage licenses, she became embroiled in the ''[[Miller v. Davis]]'' lawsuit. Her actions caused attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] to state that "Kim Davis is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=15 October 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=16 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the case of Engele v. Vitale went to court over the violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment resulting from a mandatory nondenominational prayer in New York public schools. The Supreme Court ruled in opposition to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/facts-and-case-summary-engel-v-vitale|title=Facts and Case Summary - Engel v.

In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Abington School District v. Schempp. Edward Schempp sued the school district in Abington over the Pennsylvania law which required students to hear and sometimes read portions of the bible for their daily education.

In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Epperson v. Arkansas. Susan Epperson, a high school teacher in Arkansas sued over a violation of religious freedom. The state had a law banning the teaching of evolution and the school Epperson worked for had provided curriculum which contained evolutionary theory. Epperson had to choose between violating the law or losing her job. The Supreme Court ruled to overturn the Arkansas law because it was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cases.laws.com/epperson-v-arkansas|title=Epperson V Arkansas - Cases {{!}} Laws.com|website=cases.laws.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

27 October is International Religious Freedom Day, in commemoration of the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]], a group of [[Quakers]] executed by the [[Puritans]] on [[Boston Common]] for their religious beliefs under the legislature of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] between 1659–1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margery Post Abbott|title=Historical Dictionary of the Friends (Quakers)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7088-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlTnzA6kHYwC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US proclaimed 16 January Religious Freedom Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/01/20060113-9.html Religious Freedom Day, 2006 – A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America], [http://clinton5.nara.gov/library/hot_releases/January_16_2001_6.html Religious Freedom Day, 2001 – Proclamation by the President of the United States of America 15 January 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern concerns==
In its 2011 annual report, the ''[[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]]'' designated fourteen nations as "countries of particular concern". The commission chairman commented that these are nations whose conduct marks them as the world's worst religious freedom violators and human rights abusers. The fourteen nations designated were [[Rohingya people|Burma]], China, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Other nations on the commission's watchlist include Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Laos, Russia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=10154|title=US commission names 14 worst violators of religious freedom|accessdate=11 July 2011|publisher=Christianity Today|date=29 April 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;^ {{Cite press release|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3595|title=USCIRF Identifies World's Worst Religious Freedom Violators: Egypt Cited for First Time|publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;

===Social hostilities and government restrictions===
[[File:Religiousfreedom.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Freedom of religion by country (Pew Research Center study, 2009). Light yellow: low restriction; red: very high restriction on freedom of religion.]]
The [[Pew Research Center]] has performed studies on international religious freedom between 2009 and 2015, compiling global data from 16 governmental and non-governmental organizations–including the United Nations, the [[United States State Department]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]–and representing over 99.5 percent of the world's population.&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, nearly 70 percent of the world's population lived in countries classified as having heavy restrictions on freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="prc-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2" /&gt; This concerns restrictions on religion originating from government prohibitions on [[free speech]] and religious expression as well as social hostilities undertaken by private individuals, organisations and social groups. Social hostilities were classified by the level of [[communal violence]] and [[Religious terrorism|religion-related terrorism]].

While most countries provided for the protection of religious freedom in their constitutions or laws, only a quarter of those countries were found to fully respect these legal rights in practice. In 75 countries governments limit the efforts of religious groups to proselytise and in 178 countries religious groups must register with the government. In 2013, Pew classified 30% of countries as having restrictions that tend to target religious minorities, and 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt;

The countries in North and South America reportedly had some of the lowest levels of ''government'' and ''social'' restrictions on religion, while The Middle East and North Africa were the regions with the highest. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran were the countries that top the list of countries with the ''overall'' highest levels of restriction on religion. Topping the Pew government restrictions index were Saudi Arabia, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Egypt, Burma, Maldives, Eritrea, Malaysia and Brunei.

Of the world's 25 most populous countries, Iran, Egypt, Indonesia and Pakistan had the most restrictions, while Brazil, Japan, Italy, South Africa, the UK, and the US had some of the lowest levels, as measured by Pew.

Vietnam and China were classified as having high ''government'' restrictions on religion but were in the moderate or low range when it came to ''social'' hostilities. Nigeria, Bangladesh and India were high in ''social'' hostilities but moderate in terms of ''government'' actions.

Restrictions on religion across the world increased between mid-2009 and mid-2010, according to a 2012 study by the [[Pew Research Center]]. Restrictions in each of the five major regions of the world increased—including in the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, the two regions where overall restrictions previously had been declining. In 2010, Egypt, Nigeria, the Palestinian territories, Russia, and Yemen were added to the "very high" category of social hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Government/Rising-Tide-of-Restrictions-on-Religion-findings.aspx|title=Rising Tide of Restrictions on Religion|date=20 September 2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Iraq, and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-05 |title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country |year=2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but the harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9776">In [[astronomy]], '''Galactocentrism''' is the theory that the [[Milky Way Galaxy]], home of [[Earth]]{{'}}s [[Solar System]], is at or near the center of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Merriam"&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of galactocentric |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/galactocentric |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of galactocentric in English: |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/galactocentric |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Observations by [[William Herschel]] in 1785 suggested that the [[Milky Way]] was a disk-shaped galaxy with the sun in a central position. Although [[heliocentric]], Herschel's observations were the first attempt at an [[observational cosmology]].&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt; 

Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]'s work on [[globular cluster]]s in 1918. Shapley's research marked the transition from heliocentrism to galactocentrism, placing the [[Galactic Center]] of the Milky Way Galaxy far away from the sun, towards [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]. [[Heber Doust Curtis]] and [[Edwin Hubble]] further refuted the heliocentric view of the universe by showing that spirals are themselves far-flung galactic systems.  By 1925, the galactocentric model was established.&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

The theory of Galactocentrism was an important step in the development of [[cosmological]] models as speculation on the existence of other galaxies, comparable in size and structure to our own, placed the earth in its proper perspective with respect to the rest of the [[universe]]. Shifts from heliocentrism to galactocentrism and later acentrism have been compared in significance to the [[Copernican Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

==William Herschel's Heliocentrism==
Work by [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] indicated that fuzzy patches of light called [[nebula]]e were actually distant "island universes" consisting of many [[star system|stellar systems]].&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{Citation |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=67–71 |isbn=0-521-66148-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=galactocentric+theory |title=Cosmology: The Science of the Universe |first=Edward Robert |last= Harrison }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of our own galaxy was expected to resemble that of the nebulae. 

[[File:Herschel-galaxy.jpg|thumb | right| William Herschel's model of the Milky Way, 1785]]
In 1783, amateur [[astronomer]] [[William Herschel]] attempted to determine the shape of the galaxy by examining stars through his handmade [[telescopes]]. Herschel was the first to propose a model of the galaxy based on observation and measurement. He concluded that it was in the shape of a [[spiral galaxy|disk]], but incorrectly assumed that the sun was in the center of the disk.&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berendzen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berendzen |first1=Richard |title=Geocentric to heliocentric to galactocentric to acentric: the continuing assault to the egocentric |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |date=1975 |volume=17 |pages=65–83 |doi=10.1016/0083-6656(75)90049-5 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0083665675900495 |accessdate=6 June 2018|bibcode=1975VA.....17...65B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Shape of the Milky Way from Starcounts |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l8_p3.html |website=Astro 801 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Meet the Stargazers |url=https://www.pbs.org/seeinginthedark/meet-the-stargazers/in-history.html |website=WHYY |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing that the stars belonging to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy appeared to encircle the Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the galaxy. However, there were two flaws in Herschel's [[methodology]]: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.&lt;ref name="Ferris"&gt;{{Citation |title=Coming of Age in the Milky Way |pages=150–159

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] introduced motion, [[density]], and [[luminosity]] to Herschel's star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun.&lt;ref name="Kamp"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Galactocentric Revolution, A Reminiscent Narrative |date=October 1965 |last=van de Kamp |first=Peter |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=77 |pages=324–328 |issue=458 |bibcode=1965PASP...77..325V |doi = 10.1086/128228 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1965PASP...77..325V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harlow Shapley and Galactocentrism==
In 1918, as Kapteyn was refining his model, Herschel's heliocentric theory was overthrown by astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]]'s work on [[globular cluster]]s. 
Shapley's [[observational cosmology]] marked a transition from [[Heliocentrism]] to Galactocentrism.&lt;ref name="Bergh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bergh |first1=Sidney van den |title=Hubble and Shapley—Two Early Giants of Observational Cosmology |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada |date=2011 |volume=105 |issue=6 |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1110/1110.2445.pdf |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berendzen"/&gt;

Shapley had been studying the [[Asymmetry|asymmetrical]] distribution of globular clusters, estimating the distance and location of individual objects by using [[variable stars]] as [[standard candle]]s. Globular clusters contain many [[cepheid variable]] stars, whose precise relationship between luminosity and variability period was established by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt|Henrietta Leavitt]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="Kamp"/&gt; Using cepheid and [[RR Lyrae variable]]s to systematically chart the distribution of globular clusters, Shapley discovered that the stars in the Milky Way orbited a common center thousands of light years away from the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Nasa"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/shapley_obit.html |title= `Great Debate:' Obituary of Harlow Shapley |publisher=NASA |journal=Nature |date=1972 |last=Kopal |first=Z. |pages=429–430 |volume=240 |doi=10.1038/240429a0 |issue=5381|bibcode = 1972Natur.240..429. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The galactic center was determined to be in the direction of the [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius constellation]], approximately 50,000 [[light-year]]s from us.&lt;ref name="Nasa" /&gt;

[[File:Local.group.arp.600pix.jpg|thumb | right | [[Sextans A]], a member of the local group of galaxies, which includes the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda]] and Milky Way spirals, [[Lowell Observatory]], 2013 ]]
In 1920 [[Heber Doust Curtis]] and Harlow Shapley participated in the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on the nature of nebulae and [[galaxy|galaxies]], and the size of the universe.

In [[philosophy]], '''genealogy''' is a [[history|historical]] technique in which one questions the commonly understood emergence of various philosophical and social beliefs by attempting to account for the scope, breadth or totality of [[discourse]], thus extending the possibility of analysis, as opposed to the [[Marxist]] use of the term [[ideology]] to explain the totality of historical discourse within the time period in question by focusing on a singular or dominant discourse (ideology). Moreover, a genealogy often attempts to look beyond the discourse in question toward the conditions of their possibility (particularly in Foucault's genealogies). It has been developed as continuation of the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. For example, tracking the lineages of a concept such as 'globalization' can be called a 'genealogy' to the extent that the concept is located in its changing constitutive setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 424}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This entails not just documenting its changing meaning (etymology) but the social basis of its changing meaning.

==Nietzsche==
Nietzsche criticized "the genealogists" in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' and proposed the use of a historic philosophy to critique modern [[morality]] by supposing that it developed into its current form through [[power relations]]. But scholars note that he emphasizes that, rather than being purely necessary developments of power relations, these developments are to be exposed as at least partially contingent, the upshot being that the present conception of morality could always have been constituted otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=di Georgio|first1=Paul|title=Contingency and Necessity in the Genealogy of Morality|journal=TELOS|date=2013|volume=2013|issue=162|pages=97–111|doi=10.3817/0313162097|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/2013/162/97.extract|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the philosophy of Nietzsche has been characterized as genealogy, he only uses the term in ''On the Genealogy of Morals.'' The later philosophy that has been influenced by Nietzsche, and which is commonly described as genealogy, shares several fundamental aspects of Nietzschean philosophical insight. Nietzschean historic philosophy has been described as "a consideration of oppositional tactics" that embraces, as opposed to forecloses, the conflict between philosophical and historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foucault's Discipline |last=Ransom |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham |isbn=0-8223-1878-4 |pages=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foucault==
In the late twentieth century, [[Michel Foucault]] expanded the concept of genealogy into a counter-history of the position of the subject which traces the development of people and societies through history.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Lectures At The College de France Society Must Be Defended'' 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  His genealogy of the subject accounts "for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of objects, and so on, without having to make reference to a subject which is either [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] in relation to the field of events or runs in its empty sameness throughout the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Foucault: Selections from Essential works of Foucault, 1954-1984 |last=Foucault |first=Michel |year=2003 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-56584-801-2 |page=306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Foucault discussed in his essay "Nietzsche, Genealogy, History", Foucault's ideas of genealogy were greatly influenced by the work that Nietzsche had done on the development of morals through power. Foucault also describes genealogy as a particular investigation into those elements which "we tend to feel [are] without history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language, Counter-Memory, Practice: Selected Essays and Interviews |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1980 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=0-8014-9204-1 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would include things such as sexuality, and other elements of everyday life.  Genealogy is not the search for origins, and is not the construction of a [[linear]] development.  Instead it seeks to show the plural and sometimes contradictory past that reveals traces of the influence that power has had on truth.

As one of the important theories of Michel Foucault,  genealogy deconstructs truth, arguing that truth is, more often than not, discovered by chance, backed up by the operation of [[Power/knowledge]] or the consideration of interest. Furthermore, all truths are questionable. Pointing out the unreliability of truth, which is often accused as "having tendency of relativity and nihilism",{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} the theory flatly refuses the uniformity and regularity of history, emphasizing the irregularity and inconstancy of truth and toppling the notion that history progresses in a linear order.

The practice of genealogy is also closely linked to what Foucault called the "archeological method:"

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, it seems that from the empirical observability for us of an ensemble to its historical acceptability, to the very period of time in which it is actually observable, the analysis goes by way of the knowledge-power nexus, supporting it, recouping it at the point where it is accepted, moving toward what makes it acceptable, of course, not in general, but only where it is accepted. This is what can be characterized as recouping it in its positivity. Here, then, is a type of procedure, which, unconcerned with legitimizing and consequently excluding the fundamental point of view of the law, runs through the cycle of positivity by proceeding from the fact of acceptance to the system of acceptability analyzed through the knowledge-power interplay. Let us say that this is, approximately, the archaeological level [of analysis].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "What is Critique?" in ''The Politics of Truth'', Ed. Sylvère Lotringer. New York: Semiotext(e), 2007, pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t2.png|thumb|right|150px|Grid cells derive their name from the fact that connecting the centers of their firing fields gives a triangular grid.]]

Grid cells were discovered in 2005 by [[Edvard Moser]], [[May-Britt Moser]] and their students Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn and Sturla Molden at the [[Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for the Biology of Memory|Centre for the Biology of Memory]] (CBM) in Norway. They were awarded the 2014 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain. The arrangement of spatial firing fields all at equal distances from their neighbors led to a hypothesis that these cells encode a cognitive representation of [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref name=Hafting2005&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = T.

In a typical experimental study, an [[single unit recording|electrode]] capable of recording the activity of an individual [[neuron]] is implanted in the [[cerebral cortex]] of a rat, in a section called the dorsomedial [[entorhinal cortex]], and recordings are made as the rat moves around freely in an open arena. For a grid cell, if a dot is placed at the location of the rat's head every time the neuron emits an [[action potential]], then as illustrated in the adjoining figure, these dots build up over time to form a set of small clusters, and the clusters form the vertices of a grid of equilateral triangles. This regular triangle-pattern is what distinguishes grid cells from other types of cells that show spatial firing. By contrast, if a [[place cell]] from the rat hippocampus is examined in the same way (i.e., by placing a dot at the location of the rat's head whenever the cell emits an action potential), then the dots build up to form small clusters, but frequently there is only one cluster (one "place field") in a given environment, and even when multiple clusters are seen, there is no perceptible regularity in their arrangement.

==Background==
In 1971, [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and Jonathon Dostrovsky reported the discovery of [[place cell]]s in the rat [[hippocampus]]—cells that fire action potentials when an animal passes through a specific small region of space, which is called the ''place field'' of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| issue = 1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This discovery, although controversial at first, led to a series of investigations that culminated in the 1978 publication of a book by O'Keefe and his colleague [[Lynn Nadel]] called ''The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'' (a phrase that also appeared in the title of the 1971 paper)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map |authors=O'Keefe J, Nadel L |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1978 |url=http://www.cognitivemap.net/HCMpdf/HCMChapters.html |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the book argued that the hippocampal neural network instantiates [[cognitive map]]s as hypothesized by the psychologist [[Edward C. Tolman]].  This theory aroused a great deal of interest, and motivated hundreds of experimental studies aimed at clarifying the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory and spatial navigation.

Because the entorhinal cortex provides by far the largest input to the hippocampus, it was clearly important to understand the spatial firing properties of entorhinal neurons.  The earliest studies, such as Quirk ''et al.'' (1992), described neurons in the entorhinal cortex as having relatively large and fuzzy place fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mosers, however, thought it was possible that a different result would be obtained if recordings were made from a different part of the entorhinal cortex.  The entorhinal cortex is a strip of tissue running along the back edge of the rat brain from the ventral to the dorsal sides.  Anatomical studies had shown that different sectors of the entorhinal cortex project to different levels of the hippocampus:  the dorsal end of the EC projects to the dorsal hippocampus, the ventral end to the ventral hippocampus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every study of entorhinal spatial activity prior to 2004, however, had made use of electrodes implanted near the ventral end of the EC.  Accordingly, together with Marianne Fyhn, Sturla Molden and Menno Witter, the Mosers set out to examine spatial firing from the different dorsal-to-ventral levels of the entorhinal cortex. They found that in the dorsal part of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), cells had sharply defined place fields like in the hippocampus but the cells fired at multiple locations.&lt;ref name=Fyhn2004&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = M.

The next set of experiments, reported in 2005, made use of a larger environment, which led to the recognition that the cells were actually firing in a hexagonal grid pattern.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt; The study showed that cells at similar dorsal-to-ventral MEC levels had similar grid spacing and grid orientation but the phase of the grid (the offset of the grid vertices relative to the x and y axes) appeared to be randomly distributed between cells. The periodic firing pattern was expressed independently of the configuration of landmarks, in darkness as well as in the presence of visible landmarks and independently of changes in the animal’s speed and direction, leading the authors to suggest that grid cells expressed a path-integration dependent dynamic computation of the animal’s location.

For their discovery of grid cells, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2014 alongside John O'Keefe.

[[File:Autocorrelation image.jpg|thumb|Spatial autocorrelogram of the neuronal activity of the grid cell from the first figure.]]

Grid cells are neurons that fire when a freely moving animal traverses a set of small regions (firing fields) which are roughly equal in size and arranged in a periodic triangular array that covers the entire available environment.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Cells with this firing pattern have been found in all layers of the dorsocaudal medial [[entorhinal cortex]] (dMEC), but cells in different layers tend to differ in other respects.  Layer II contains the largest density of pure grid cells, in the sense that they fire equally regardless of the direction in which an animal traverses a grid location.  Grid cells from deeper layers are intermingled with conjunctive cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sargolini|first=F.|title=Conjunctive Representation of Position, Direction, and Velocity in Entorhinal Cortex|journal=Science|date=5 May 2006|volume=312|issue=5774|pages=758–762|doi=10.1126/science.1125572|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..758S|pmid=16675704}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[head direction cells]] (i.e. in layers III, V and VI there are cells with a grid-like pattern that fire only when the animal is facing a particular direction).&lt;ref name=Sargolini2006&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = F.

Grid cells that lie next to one another (i.e., cells recorded from the same electrode) usually show the same grid spacing and orientation, but their grid vertices are displaced from one another by apparently random offsets.  Cells recorded from separate electrodes at a distance from one another, however, frequently show different grid spacings.  Cells that are located more ventrally (that is, farther from the dorsal border of the MEC) generally have larger firing fields at each grid vertex, and correspondingly greater spacing between the grid vertices.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  The total range of grid spacings is not well established:  the initial report described a roughly twofold range of grid spacings (from 39&amp;nbsp;cm to 73&amp;nbsp;cm) across the dorsalmost part (upper 25%) of the MEC,&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt; but there are indications of considerably larger grid scales in more ventral zones.  Brun ''et al.'' (2008) recorded grid cells from multiple levels in rats running along an 18-meter track, and found that the grid spacing expanded from about 25&amp;nbsp;cm in their dorsalmost sites to about 3 m at the ventralmost sites.&lt;ref name=Brun2008&gt;{{Cite journal

Grid cell activity does not require visual input, since grid patterns remain unchanged when all the lights in an environment are turned off.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  When visual cues are present, however, they exert strong control over the alignment of the grids: Rotating a cue card on the wall of a cylinder causes grid patterns to rotate by the same amount.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Grid patterns appear on the first entrance of an animal into a novel environment, and usually remain stable thereafter.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  When an animal is moved into a completely different environment, grid cells maintain their grid spacing, and the grids of neighboring cells maintain their relative offsets.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;

==Interactions with hippocampal place cells==

When a rat is moved to a different environment, the spatial activity patterns of hippocampal place cells usually show ''"complete remapping"''—that is, the pattern of place fields reorganizes in a way that bears no detectable resemblance to the pattern in the original environment (Muller and Kubie, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = RU | last2 = Kubie | first2 = JL | year = 1987 | title = The effects of changes in the environment on the spatial firing of hippocampal complex-spike cells | url = | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1951–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the features of an environment are altered less radically, however, the place field pattern may show a lesser degree of change, referred to as ''"rate remapping"'', in which many cells alter their firing rates but the majority of cells retain place fields in the same locations as before.  Fyhn ''et al.'' (2007) examined this phenomenon using simultaneous recordings of hippocampal and entorhinal cells, and found that in situations where the hippocampus shows rate remapping, grid cells show unaltered firing patterns, whereas when the hippocampus shows complete remapping, grid cell firing patterns show unpredictable shifts and rotations.&lt;ref name=Fyhn2007&gt;{{Cite journal

==Theta rhythmicity==

Neural activity in nearly every part of the hippocampal system is modulated by the limbic [[theta rhythm]], which has a frequency range of about 6–9&amp;nbsp;Hz in rats. The entorhinal cortex is no exception:  like the hippocampus, it receives [[acetylcholine|cholinergic]] and [[GABA]]ergic input from the [[medial septum|medial septal area]], the central controller of theta.  Grid cells, like hippocampal place cells, show strong theta modulation.&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;  Grid cells from layer II of the MEC also resemble hippocampal place cells in that they show [[Place cell#Phase precession|phase precession]]—that is, their spike activity advances from late to early phases of the theta cycle as an animal passes through a grid vertex.  Most grid cells from layer III do not precess, but their spike activity is largely confined to half of the theta cycle.  The grid cell phase precession is not derived from the hippocampus, because it continues to appear in animals whose hippocampus has been inactivated by an agonist of GABA.&lt;ref name=Hafting2008&gt;{{Cite journal

==Possible functions==

Many species of mammals can keep track of spatial location even in the absence of visual, auditory, olfactory, or tactile cues, by integrating their movements—the ability to do this is referred to in the literature as [[path integration]]. A number of theoretical models have explored mechanisms by which path integration could be performed by neural networks. In most models, such as those of Samsonovich and McNaughton (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Because cells in the MEC encode information about position (grid cells&lt;ref name=Hafting2005/&gt;) and movement (head direction cells and conjunctive position-by-direction cells&lt;ref name=Sargolini2006/&gt;), this area is currently viewed as the most promising candidate for the place in the brain where path integration occurs. However, the question remains unresolved, as in humans the entorhinal cortex does not appear to be required for path integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Hafting et al. (2005) suggested that a place code is computed in the entorhinal cortex and fed into the [[hippocampus]], which may make the associations between place and events that are needed for the formation of memories.

In contrast to a hippocampal [[place cell]], a grid cell has multiple firing fields, with regular spacing, which tessellate the environment in a hexagonal pattern. The unique properties of grid cells are as follows:

[[File:Equilateral Triangle Lattice.svg|thumb|right|250px|A hexagonal lattice.]]
# Grid cells have firing fields dispersed over the entire environment (in contrast to place fields which are restricted to certain specific regions of the environment)
# The firing fields are organized into a [[hexagonal lattice]]
# Firing fields are generally equally spaced apart, such that the distance from one firing field to all six adjacent firing fields is approximately the same (though when an environment is resized, the field spacing may shrink or expand differently in different directions; Barry et al. 2007)
# Firing fields are equally positioned, such that the six neighboring fields are located at approximately 60 degree increments

The grid cells are anchored to external landmarks, but persist in darkness, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a self-motion based map of the spatial environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6845">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''heap''' (sometimes also called a '''groud'''&lt;ref&gt;Schein (1979) pp.101–102: footnote (o)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a mathematical generalization of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Informally speaking, a heap is obtained from a group by "forgetting" which element is the unit, in the same way that an [[affine space]] can be viewed as a [[vector space]] in which the 0 element has been "forgotten".  A heap is essentially the same thing as a [[torsor]], and the category of heaps is equivalent to the category of torsors, with morphisms given by transport of structure under group homomorphisms, but the theory of heaps emphasizes the intrinsic composition law, rather than global structures such as the geometry of bundles.

Formally, a heap is an [[structure (mathematical logic)|algebraic structure]] consisting of a non-empty [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''H'' with a [[ternary operation]] denoted &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z]\in H&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

* the '''para-associative''' law

::&lt;math&gt;\forall \ a,b,c,d,e \in H \ \ \ \ [[a,b,c],d,e] = [a,[d,c,b],e] = [a,b,[c,d,e]],&lt;/math&gt;

* the '''identity''' law

::&lt;math&gt;\forall \ x,a \in H\ \ \ \  [x,a,a] = [a,a,x] = x.&lt;/math&gt;

A group can be regarded as a heap under the operation &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = xy^{-1}z &lt;/math&gt;.  Conversely, let ''H'' be a heap, and choose an element {{nowrap|''e'' ∈ ''H''}}.  The [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;x*y = [x,e,y]&lt;/math&gt; makes ''H'' into a group  with [[identity element|identity]] ''e'' and inverse &lt;math&gt; x^{-1} = [e,x,e] &lt;/math&gt;. A heap can thus be regarded as a group in which the identity has yet to be decided.

Whereas the [[automorphism]]s of a single object form a group, the set of [[isomorphism]]s between two isomorphic objects naturally forms a heap, with the operation &lt;math&gt;[f,g,h]=fg^{-1}h&lt;/math&gt; (here juxtaposition denotes [[composition of functions]]). This heap becomes a group once a particular isomorphism by which the two objects are to be identified is chosen.

==Examples==

===Heap of a group===
As noted above, any group becomes a heap under the operation
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = x y^{-1} z . &lt;/math&gt;

====Two element heap====
Turn &lt;math&gt;H=\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt; into the [[cyclic group]] &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;, by defining &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the identity element, and &lt;math&gt;bb = a&lt;/math&gt;. Then it produces the following heap:

:&lt;math&gt;[a,a,a]=a,\, [a,a,b]=b,\, [b,a,a]=b,\, [b,a,b]=a,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[a,b,a]=b,\, [a,b,b]=a,\, [b,b,a]=a,\, [b,b,b]=b.&lt;/math&gt;

Defining &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as the identity element and &lt;math&gt;aa=b&lt;/math&gt; would have given the same heap.

====Heap of integers====
If &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are integers, we can set &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z]=x-y+z&lt;/math&gt; to produce a heap. We can then choose any integer &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be the identity of a new group on the set of integers, with the operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x*y = x+y-k&lt;/math&gt;
and inverse
:&lt;math&gt;x^{-1} = 2k-x&lt;/math&gt;.

===Heap of a groupoid with two objects===
One may generalize the notion of the heap of a group to the case of a [[groupoid]] which has two objects A and B when viewed as a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. The elements of the heap may be identified with the morphisms from A to B, such that three morphisms x, y, z define a heap operation according to: 
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = x y^{-1} z . &lt;/math&gt;
This reduces to the heap of a group if a particular morphism between the two objects is chosen as the identity. This intuitively relates the description of isomorphisms between two objects as a heap and the description of isomorphisms between multiple objects as a groupoid.

== Generalizations and related concepts ==

* A '''pseudoheap''' or '''pseudogroud''' satisfies the partial para-associative condition&lt;ref name=vagner1968&gt;Vagner (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[[a,b,c],d,e] = [a,b,[c,d,e]] .&lt;/math&gt;
* A [[Malcev operation]] satisfies the identity law but not necessarily the para-associative law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borceux|first1=Francis|last2=Bourn|first2=Dominique|title=Mal'cev, Protomodular, Homological and Semi-Abelian Categories|date=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Mal_cev_Protomodular_Homological_and_Sem.html?id=olmeksCI22cC|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1961-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, a [[ternary operation]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the identity &lt;math&gt;f(x, x, y) = f(y, x, x) = y&lt;/math&gt;.
* A '''semiheap''' or '''semigroud''' is required to satisfy only the para-associative law but need not obey the identity law.&lt;ref name=moldavska/&gt;
::An example of a semigroud that is not in general a groud is given by ''M'' a ring of matrices of fixed size with
:::&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = x \cdot y^\mathrm{T} \cdot z&lt;/math&gt;
::where • denotes [[matrix multiplication]] and T denotes [[matrix transpose]].&lt;ref name=moldavska&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Moldavs'ka | first=Z. Ja. | title=Linear semiheaps | journal= Dopovidi Ahad. Nauk Ukrain. | series=RSR Ser. A | volume=1971 | pages=888–890, 957 |mr=297918}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An '''idempotent semiheap''' is a semiheap where &lt;math&gt; [a,a,a] = a &lt;/math&gt; for all ''a''.
* A '''generalised heap''' or '''generalised groud''' is an idempotent semiheap where

::&lt;math&gt; [a,a,[b,b,x]] = [b,b,[a,a,x]] &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; [[x,a,a],b,b] = [[x,b,b],a,a] &lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' and ''b''.

A semigroud is a generalised groud if the relation → defined by

:&lt;math&gt;a \rightarrow b \Leftrightarrow [a,b,a] = a &lt;/math&gt;

is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (idempotence) and [[anti-symmetric relation|anti-symmetric]].  In a generalised groud, → is an [[order relation]].&lt;ref&gt;Schein (1979) p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

* A [[torsor]] is an equivalent notion to a heap that places more emphasis on the associated group.  Any &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-torsor &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a heap under the operation &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z]=(x/y)\cdot z&lt;/math&gt;.  Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a heap, any &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; define a [[permutation]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{x,y}(z)=[x,y,z]&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  If we let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all such permutations &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{x,y}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-torsor under the natural action.

In English law, offenders who commit burglary while carrying a weapon can be convicted of the offence of [[Burglary_in_English_law#Aggravated_burglary|aggravated burglary]] even if the weapon is not actually brandished or used.

Home invasion differs from [[burglary]] in that its perpetrators have a violent intent apart from the unlawful entry itself, specific or general, much the same way as aggravated robbery—personally taking from someone by force—is differentiated from mere [[larceny]] (theft alone).

==Incidence==
Few statistics are available on the crime of home invasion as such, because it is not defined as a crime in its own right in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald; William Molidor; Andrew Cantu (2018). "US Newspapers' Portrayals of Home Invasion Crime". The Howard Journal of Crime and Justice. 57(2): 250-277.  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hojo.12257 &lt;/ref&gt; Statistics about home invasion found on the Internet are often false or  misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinvasionnews.com/?p=797 |title=If You See These Home Invasion Statistics, Don’t Look. |publisher=Home Invasion News |date=June 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persons arrested for what the police or media may refer to as "home invasion" are actually charged with crimes such as robbery, [[kidnapping]], [[homicide]], rape, or assault.

==Terminology and home invasion as a crime==
The first published use of the term "home invasion" recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is an article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on 1 February 1912,&lt;ref&gt;OED, 4th ed 2004: 1912 Washington Post 1 Feb. 4/3 (heading) Child Bureau wins. Senate passes bill after prohibiting home invasion.&lt;/ref&gt; with an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 18 March 1925 clearly indicating the modern meaning.&lt;ref&gt;OED, 4th ed 2004: 1925 Los Angeles Times 18 Mar.  ii. 11/1 (heading) Trio hunted in home invasion. Woman reports attack on twin daughters.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Home-invasion robberies" were highlighted in June 1995, when the term appeared in the cover story of ''The [[FBI]] Law Enforcement Bulletin'' in an article written by Police Chief James T. Hurley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbfl.us/index.aspx?NID=153 |title=Fernandina Beach, FL – Official Website – Home Invasion |publisher=Fbfl.us |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, area, later republished on bNet, the online blog posted by Harvard Business School. Hurley posited that, at the time, the crime could be considered an alternative to bank or convenience store robberies, which were becoming more difficult to carry out due to technological advances in security. In the same article Hurley recommended educating the public about home invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2194/is_n6_v64/ai_17312586/?tag=mantle_skin;content |title=Violent crime hits home: home invasion robbery &amp;#124; FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin,The &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=November 20, 2011 |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the term "home invasion" came in use, the term "hot burglary" was often used in the literature. Early references also use "burglary of occupied homes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence, Jr. |last=Southwick |title=Guns and Justifiable Homicide: Deterrence and Defense |volume=18 |journal=St. Louis U Pub Law Rev |pages=217 [p. 227] |year=1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "burglar striking an occupied residence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Wright |first2=Peter |last2=Rossi |first3=Kathleen |last3=Daly |title=Under the Gun |location=New York |publisher=Aldine |year=1983 |page=15 |isbn=0-202-30305-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Connecticut]] Congressman [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] proposed in 2008 making home invasion a [[federal crime]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chris Murphy |url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/chris-murphy--CT-S |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326104354/http://www.chrismurphy.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=44&amp;Itemid=55 |archivedate=March 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
The ''[[Chauffeurs de la Drome]]'' (The Heaters of Drôme) were a gang of four men who carried out a series of attacks on remote dwellings in the [[Drôme|Department of  Drôme]] in south-west France between 1905 and 1908. They became notorious for roasting the feet of householders against the fireplace, to torture them into revealing the hiding places of valuables.&lt;ref name="romanshistorique"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.romanshistorique.fr/romans-sur-isere-la-maison-des-chauffeurs-de-la-drome-rue-pecherie | title=La maison des Chauffeurs de la Drôme, rue Pêcherie | publisher=Romans Historique | language=French | date=26 May 2010 | accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson2011" /&gt; Responsible for as many as 18 murders,&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of the gang were guillotined on September 22, 1909. The fourth died on the penal colony at [[Devil's Island]].&lt;ref name="Histoires de bourreaux"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://histoiresdebourreaux.blogspot.co.uk/2009/09/22-septembre-1909-lexecution-des.html | title=Histoires de bourreaux | language=French | date=22 September 2009 | accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One well-known home invasion is the November 15, 1959, quadruple murder of the Clutter family by [[Richard Hickock|Richard "Dick" Hickock]] and [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Edward Smith]] during a home-invasion robbery in rural [[Holcomb, Kansas|Holcomb]], Kansas. The murders were detailed in [[Truman Capote]]'s "nonfiction novel" ''[[In Cold Blood]]''. However, the perpetrators were convicted of murder, not home invasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/clutter/4.html Crime library article on Clutter family murders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403063659/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/family/clutter/4.html |date=April 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, two paroled criminals were each charged with three counts of capital murder during a [[Cheshire, Connecticut, home invasion murders|home invasion into the Petit family home]] in [[Cheshire, Connecticut]], on July 23, 2007. During the invasion, the mother died of asphyxiation due to strangulation and the two daughters died of smoke inhalation after the suspects set the house on fire. The men were charged with first-degree sexual assault, murder of a kidnapped person, and murder of two or more people at the same time. The state attorney sought the death penalty against the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfsb.com/cheshirecase/13762474/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808182554/http://www.wfsb.com/cheshirecase/13762474/detail.html |archivedate=August 8, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first defendant, Steven Hayes, was found guilty of 16 of 17 counts including capital murder on October 5, 2010, and on November 8, 2010, was sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Joshua Komisarjevsky, was convicted of all 17 counts against him in October 2011, and was also sentenced to death. Both men later had their sentences commuted to life without parole when Connecticut abolished the death penalty in 2015.

Another home invasion occurred on November 26, 2007, when [[Washington Redskins]] star [[Sean Taylor]] was murdered during an overnight home invasion of his suburban [[Miami]] home. Four defendants were charged with this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SEAN TAYLOR MURDER: Men arrested held without bond |url=http://www.winknews.com/news/local/11995026.html |publisher=WINK News |date=December 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 4, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201190807/http://www.winknews.com/news/local/11995026.html |archivedate=February 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. states (particularly those that endorse the [[Castle Doctrine]]) include defending oneself against forcible entry of one's home as part of their definition of justifiable [[homicide]] without any [[Duty to retreat|obligation to retreat]].&lt;ref&gt;K.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

The '''id, ego, and super-ego''' are three distinct, yet interacting agents in the [[psychic apparatus]] defined in [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] [[Ego psychology|structural model]] of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

The three parts are the theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction our [[mental life]] is described. According to this Freudian model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.'' Vol. XIX. Translated from the German under the General Editorship of [[James Strachey]]. In collaboration with [[Anna Freud]]. Assisted by [[Alix Strachey]] and [[Alan Tyson]], Vintage, 1999. [Reprint.] {{ISBN|0-09-929622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus in its relation to the id it is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide it where it wants to go; so in the same way the ego is in the habit of transforming the id's will into action as if it were its own. (p. 19).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965512|title=The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud. Volume XIX (1923-26) The Ego and the Id and Other Works|last=Freud, Sigmund|first=|date=|publisher=Hogarth Press|others=Strachey, James., Freud, Anna, 1895-1982,, Rothgeb, Carrie Lee, 1925-, Richards, Angela., Scientific Literature Corporation.|year=1978|isbn=0701200677|location=London,|pages=|oclc=965512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although the model is structural and makes reference to an apparatus, the id, ego and super-ego are purely [[psychological]] concepts and do not correspond to ([[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]) structures of the [[brain]] such as the kind dealt with by [[neuroscience]]. The super-ego is observable in how someone can view themselves as guilty, [[Evil|bad]], [[shameful]], weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. Freud in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' discusses "the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal – its dictatorial 'Thou shalt.{{'"}}

Freud (1933) hypothesizes different levels of ego ideal or superego development with increasingly greater ideals:
{{quote|...nor must it be forgotten that a child has a different estimate of [their] parents at different periods of [their] life. At the time at which the [[Oedipus complex]] gives place to the super-ego they are something quite magnificent; but later they lose much of this. Identifications then come about with these later parents as well, and indeed they regularly make important contributions to the formation of character; but in that case they only affect the ego, they no longer influence the super-ego, which has been determined by the earliest parental images.|''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'', p. 64}}

The earlier in development, the greater the estimate of parental power. When one defuses into rivalry with the parental imago, then one feels the 'dictatorial thou shalt' to manifest the power the imago represents. Four general levels are found in Freud's work: the auto-erotic, the narcissistic, the anal, and the phallic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different levels of development and the relations to parental imagos correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection. For example, aggressive desires to decapitate, to dismember, to cannibalize, to swallow whole, to suck dry, to make disappear, to blow away, etc. animate myths, are enjoyed in fantasy and horror movies, and are observable in the fantasies and repressions of patients across cultures.  
      
The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud's thought as the "structural model" (which succeeded his "economic model" and "topographical model") and was first discussed in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his ''The Ego and the Id''. Freud's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]" and its many conflicting uses.

Psychology: the science of behavior (Canandian ed., p. 453).

{{quote|It is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality, what little we know of it we have learned from our study of the [[dreamwork]] and of course the construction of neurotic symptoms, and most of that is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego. We approach the id with analogies: we call it a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations. ...It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933), ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''. pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the id:

{{quote|...contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other out. ...There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation...nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Developmentally, the id precedes the ego; i.e., the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While "id" is in search of pleasure, "ego" emphasizes the principle of reality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Lapsley |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Paul C.  |first2=Stey |title=Id, Ego, and Superego |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www3.nd.edu/~dlapsle1/Lab/Articles_%26_Chapters_files/Entry%2520for%2520Encyclopedia%2520of%2520Human%2520BehaviorFInal%2520Submitted%2520Formatted4.pdf |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375000-6.00199-3}} Chapter of {{cite book |editor-last=Ramachandran |editor-first=Vilayanur S. |editor-link=V.

The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The "id" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The id "knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual [[cathexis|cathexes]] seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as "the great reservoir of [[libido]]",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; the instinctive drive to create—the life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts—the [[death drive]] which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world and other organisms"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; through aggression. Freud considered that "the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Eros (concept)|eros]] or the life instincts.

=== Ego ===
The ego (Latin for "I",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Ich}})&lt;ref name="Ich"&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988). "[https://books.google.com/?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=130&amp;dq=%22Ego+%3D+D.\+Ich%22 Ego (pp. 130-43)"].&lt;/ref&gt; acts according to the [[reality principle]]; i.e., it seeks to please the id's drive in realistic ways that will benefit in the long term rather than bring grief.&lt;ref name="Child Development"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noam|first1=Gil G|last2=Hauser|first2=Stuart T.|last3=Santostefano|first3=Sebastiano|last4=Garrison|first4=William|last5=Jacobson|first5=Alan M.|last6=Powers|first6=Sally I.|last7=Mead|first7=Merrill|title=Ego Development and Psychopathology: A Study of Hospitalized Adolescents|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=1|pages=189–194|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00283.x|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] on behalf of the [[Society for Research in Child Development]]|date=February 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Freud concedes that as the ego "attempts to mediate between id and reality, it is often obliged to cloak the [unconscious] commands of the id with its own  [[preconscious]] [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizations]], to conceal the id's conflicts with reality, to profess...to be taking notice of reality even when the id has remained rigid and unyielding."&lt;ref name="Freud, p. 110"&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The reality principle that operates the ego is a regulating mechanism that enables the individual to delay gratifying immediate needs and function effectively in the real world. An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner, Daniel (2011). ''Psychology'' (1. publ., 3. print. ed.). Cambridge: WorthPublishers. {{ISBN|978-1-429-24107-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory.&lt;ref name="Snowden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt; "The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a person on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with their own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces."&lt;ref&gt;Freud,''The Ego and the Id'', ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 363–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Still worse, "it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id."&lt;ref name="Freud, p. 110"/&gt; Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. "Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it," and readily "breaks out in anxiety—realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and inferiority.

To overcome this the ego employs [[defense mechanism]]s. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=David G. |authorlink=David Myers (academic) |title=Psychology Eighth Edition in Modules |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |chapter=Module 44 The Psychoanalytic Perspective |isbn=978-0-7167-7927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos.

[[Denial]], [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]], [[intellectualisation]], [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]], [[Psychological projection|projection]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[reaction formation]], [[Regression (psychology)|regression]], [[Psychological repression|repression]], and [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] were the defense mechanisms Freud identified. However, his daughter [[Anna Freud]] clarified and identified the concepts of [[Undoing (psychology)|undoing]], [[Thought suppression|suppression]], [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[Idealization and devaluation|idealization]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], [[introjection]], inversion, [[somatisation]], [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], and substitution.

[[File:Structural-Model1.png|thumb|right|200px|"The ego is not sharply separated from the id; its lower portion merges into it.... But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it. The repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression; it can communicate with the ego through the id." ([[Sigmund Freud]], 1923)]]In a diagram of the [[Defense mechanism#Structural model: The id, ego, and superego|Structural and Topographical Models of Mind]], the ego is depicted to be half in the consciousness, while a quarter is in the [[preconscious]] and the other quarter lies in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].

In modern English, ego has many meanings. It could mean one’s [[self-esteem]]; an inflated sense of self-worth; the conscious-thinking self;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldtransformation.com/ego/ "Ego". In ''The Book of Real Answers to Everything!'', [[Jeremy Griffith|Griffith J.]]. 2011. {{ISBN|9781741290073}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in philosophical terms, one’s self. Ego development is known as the development of multiple processes, cognitive function, defenses, and interpersonal skills or to early adolescence when ego processes are emerged.&lt;ref name="Child Development"/&gt;

=== Super-ego ===
{{Redirect|Superego|the podcast|Superego (podcast)}}
The super-ego&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Superego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/superego |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-de|Über-Ich}})&lt;ref name="Über-Ich"&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988). "[https://books.google.com/?id=PsvZpv0ZRw0C&amp;pg=435&amp;dq=%22Super-Ego+%3D+D.:+Ober-Ich%22 Super-Ego (pp. 435–8)"].&lt;/ref&gt; reflects the internalization of cultural rules, mainly taught by parents applying their guidance and influence.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; Freud developed his concept of the super-ego from an earlier combination of the ego ideal and the "special psychical agency which performs the task of seeing that narcissistic satisfaction from the ego ideal is ensured...what we call our 'conscience'."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; For him "the installation of the super-ego can be described as a successful instance of identification with the parental agency," while as development proceeds "the super-ego also takes on the influence of those who have stepped into the place of parents&amp;nbsp;— educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models".
{{quote|Thus a child's super-ego is in fact constructed on the model not of its parents but of its parents' super-ego; the contents which fill it are the same and it becomes the vehicle of tradition and of all the time-resisting judgments of value which have propagated themselves in this manner from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The super-ego aims for perfection.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt; It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's [[ego ideals]], spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called "conscience") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. "The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Reber, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the [[inner critic]] as it appears in contemporary therapies such as [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Richard|title=Internal Family Systems Therapy|date=1997|publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt. It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt;

The super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt;

Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the [[father figure]] and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the [[conscience]], maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the [[Oedipus complex]].&lt;ref name="Sédat"&gt;{{cite journal

Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:
{{quote|The super-ego retains the character of the father, while the more powerful the Oedipus complex was and the more rapidly it succumbed to repression (under the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading), the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on—in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, "their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect "that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of the structural model ==

[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]

Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, [[preconscious]], and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology, the science of behaviour: The psychodynamic approach|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its heart was "the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. x&lt;/ref&gt; With what Freud called the "disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud took the step in the structural model to "no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense," and to rename "the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of "conscious vs. unconscious".

"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards "Editor's Introduction" Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 344–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously:

{{quote|[[Transference neurosis|Transference neuroses]] correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; [[narcissistic neurosis|narcissistic neuroses]], to a conflict between the ego and the superego; and [[psychosis|psychoses]], to one between the ego and the external world.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[Neurosis and Psychosis]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is important to realise however, that "the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)"&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Introduction" in ''On Metapsychology'' p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;—the id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully "the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

== Translation ==

The terms "id", "ego", and "super-ego" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator [[James Strachey]]. Freud himself wrote of "''[[wikt:das#German|das]] [[wikt:Es#German|Es]]''",&lt;ref name="Es"/&gt; "''das [[wikt:Ich|Ich]]''",&lt;ref name="Ich"/&gt; and "''das [[wikt:über-|Über-]]Ich''"&lt;ref name="Über-Ich"/&gt;—respectively, "the It", "the I", and "the Over-I" (or "I above"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term "''das Es''" from [[Georg Groddeck]], a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as "the It").&lt;ref name="Groddeck"&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Groddeck |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Groddeck |title=Das Buch vom Es. Psychoanalytische Briefe an eine Freundin |trans-title=[https://archive.org/details/b29815101 The Book of the It] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lpYXAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag |location=[[Vienna]] |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:ego|ego]]'' is taken directly from [[Latin]], where it is the [[nominative]] of the first person singular [[personal pronoun]] and is translated as "I myself" to express emphasis.
Figures like [[Bruno Bettelheim]] have criticized the way "the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1996) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; by substituting the formalised language of the [[Basil Bernstein|elaborated code]] for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.

'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

'''Internet universality''' is the concept that "the Internet is much more than infrastructure and applications, it is a network of economic and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable [[human rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the Internet should be Human rights-based, Open, Accessible, and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the Internet in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], rights and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about|title=Internet Universality|date=10 July 2017|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the concept internet universality UNESCO highlights four separate but interdependent fields of Internet policy and practice that are considered a "key" to assess a better Internet environment; access to information and knowledge, [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[privacy]], and [[Ethics|ethical norms]] and behavior online.

A framework named ROAM was developed by UNESCO in order to investigate and evaluate the universality of Internet in different countries. The framework is based on four normative principles agreed by [[UNESCO]] [[Member states of UNESCO|Member States]]; human rights, openness, accessibility and multistakeholder participation, summarised in the acronym R-O-A-M.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principles represent a solid ground for UNESCO in order to create a tool to comprehend Internet governance: the Internet Universality indicators.

== History ==
The term was agreed on by UNESCO’s General Conference in 2015 as a means to integrate UNESCO’s work, in the framework of the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS). It is part of UNESCO's project to fulfill the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. During the 37th session of the [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]], UNESCO Member States affirmed the principle of applicability of human rights in [[cyberspace]]. The concept of Internet Universality was then built upon the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference outcome document on 3–4 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/outcome_document.pdf|title=Connecting the Dots: Options for Future Action|date=5 March 2015|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO’s Deputy Director General, Mr. Getachew Engida, in closing the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference, stated: "''The Internet and all new information and communication must be at the heart of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda - as a transformational force and a foundation for building the knowledge societies we need''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ROAM Principles.png|thumb|The principles of Internet Universality]]

== Wider context ==
The social, civic and economic potential of a [[Transnationalism|global Internet]] — one that bridges the world — is widely recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001920/192096e.pdf|title=Reflections and Analysis by UNESCO on the Internet|date=18 April 2011|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|access-date=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecting an individual, locality, nation or continent to the wealth of information, expertise and communities distributed across the globe is among the greatest promises of the Internet; for example, educational materials can now readily be put in the hands of students worldwide. However, the Internet can also empower users to create, disseminate, and consume [[information]] and knowledge resources. This potential for using the Internet to reconfigure access to information and knowledge, and also reshape freedom of expression, privacy, and ethical norms and behavior, has been a theme in academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Society on the Line|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconceptualizing Development in the Global Information Age|editor-last=Castells|editor-first=M.|editor-last2=Himanen|editor-first2=P.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rise of the Network Society|last=Castells|first=M.|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=2000|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Include the interconnected [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]], such as the Web, [[social media]], developing [[Mobile Web|mobile Internet]], and the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT), including such developments as [[cloud computing]], [[big data]], and [[robotics]], for example, that are increasingly central to networked technologies. [[Biometrics]] and other technologies central to developing network [[Application software|applications]], such as for personal identification and security, are also incorporated in this definition.

By 2014, over three billion people had gained access to the Internet from around the world.{{efn|Internet World Stats estimates that there were 3,035,749,340 Internet users by 30 June 2014, constituting 42.3% of the global population of 7.2B people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Internet User Statistics and 2014 World Population Stats|date=30 June 2014|website=www.internetworldstats.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217215945/https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|archive-date=17 December 2014|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This is a major advance in worldwide access to information and knowledge, but translates to only 42 per cent of the world, leaving most of the world without access. Even those with access are often constrained by technical barriers, [[language barrier]]s, skills deficits and many other social and policy factors, from accessing information and knowledge in essential ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Working-Class Network Society: Communication Technology and the Information Have-Less in Urban China.|last=Qui|first=J.L.|publisher=Cambridge, MA: MIT Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The global diffusion of the Internet is progressing, but at the same time what we know as the Internet is continually changing. Innovation continues apace in many areas, from mobile applications and payment systems to social media and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The Internet has reached more people in more powerful ways than ever thought possible. It has also become a major resource for [[economic development]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Internet Universality Principles: R-O-A-M ==
The R-O-A-M principles are a [[Theory|theoretical]] framework for assessing the state of play of each key fields of Internet policy. The framework underscores a set of principles that, when applied to the Internet, aim to achieve an open, [[Global Internet usage|global]] and [[Internet security|secure]] [[Internet]], by highlighting the relevance of human rights as a whole, as well as openness, [[Internet access|accessibility]] and multistakeholder participation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rights-based ===
The Internet is becoming so significant in everyday life, work and identity in much of the world, that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish human rights on and off the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO and the [[United Nations]] more broadly have affirmed the principle of human rights should apply to all aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/general-conference-37th/|title=General Conference 37th {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would include, for example, freedom of expression, and privacy. UNESCO considers that as these two rights should also apply to the Internet, so should other rights, such as [[cultural diversity]], [[gender equality]], and [[education]]. As human rights are indivisible, for UNESCO all these rights mentioned above also need to be balanced with rights that apply to both [[Virtual life|digital]] and [[Life|extra-digital life]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Openness ===
This general principle, applied to the Internet, encompasses open [[Globalization|global]] standards, [[interoperability]], [[Interface (computing)|open application interfaces]], and open science, documents, text, data, and [[Flow network|flows]]. Social and political support for open systems, not only technical [[expertise]], is part of this principle. Transparency is part of openness, as well as a dimension of the rights to seek and receive information. Making rights and openness are [[Interdependence|interdependent]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Accessibility ===
There is special relevance to the Internet of the broader principle of social inclusion. This puts forward the role of accessibility in overcoming [[digital divide]]s, digital inequalities, and [[Social exclusion|exclusions]] based on skills, [[literacy]], language, [[gender]] or disability. It also points to the need for [[Sustainability|sustainable]] [[business model]]s for Internet activity, and to trust in the preservation, quality, integrity, security, and authenticity of information and knowledge. Accessibility is interlinked to rights and openness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Multistakeholders participation ===
{{Main|Multi-stakeholder governance}}

The general principle of participation in [[decision-making]] that impacts on the lives of individuals has been part of the Internet from its outset, accounting for much of its success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What if we all governed the Internet? Advancing multistakeholder participation in Internet governance|last=van der Spuy|first=Anri|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2017|isbn=|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002598/259867e.pdf|access-date=10 November 2017|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognizes the value of multistakeholder participation, incorporating [[user (computing)|user]]s and a user-centric perspective as well as all other actors critical to developing, using and [[Governance|governing]] the Internet across a range of levels. The other principles are enriched by the multistakeholder participation principle, because it states that everyone should have a stake in the future of the Internet.

It is possible to define a number of broad categories of stakeholders in the Internet, with subgroups as well: State, businesses and industries, [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental actors]], [[civil society]], [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]], research actors, individuals, and others. Each of these categories has more or less unique stakes in the future of the Internet, but there are also areas of great overlap and interdependence. For instance, some NGOs, are likely to prioritize the promotion of human rights; meanwhile parliaments are primary actors in defining laws to protect these rights. Still other stakeholders are key to shaping [[Human rights and encryption|rights online]], such as [[Search engine|search engine providers]], and [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries|last=MacKinnon|first=R.|last2=Hickok|first2=E.|last3=Bar|first3=A.|last4=Lim|first4=Hae-in|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|access-date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals also have particular roles to play in respecting, promoting and protecting rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cross-cutting factors ===
Aside from the four main factors (R-O-A-M), UNESCO has also identified five different cross-cutting factors that will suit all of the R-O-A-M factors, and should be taken into consideration. Of the five, two of them are concerned with gender and age equality, one is concerned with sustainable development (i.e. what part does the internet play in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals developed by the UN), the fourth is concerned with internet trust and security, and the last is concerned with legal and ethical properties of the internet.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== Internet Universality Indicators ==
UNESCO is now developing Internet Universality indicators - based on the ROAM principles - to help governments and other stakeholders to assess their own national Internet environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet|title=Freedom of Expression on the Internet|date=25 October 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research process was envisioned to include [[wikt:consultation|consultation]]s at a range of global forums and a written [[questionnaire]] sent to key actors, but also a series of [[publication]]s on important [[Internet censorship|Internet Freedom]] related issues as encryption, [[Online hate speech|hate speech online]], privacy,  [[Internet safety|digital safety]] and [[Journalism and freedom|journalism]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/unesco-series-on-internet-freedom|title=UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom|date=1 November 2017|website=[[UNESCO]]|language=en|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this multidimensional research will be publicized in June 2018. The final indicators will be submitted to the UNESCO Member States in the International Program for Development of Communication (IPDC) for endorsement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The indicators are divided into three different groups: quantitative indicators, qualitative indicators and institutional indicators (which concerns constitutional and legal arrangements). This has raised questions about the credibility of the indicators, as well as the difficulty of actually carrying out the research. Due to differences in data availability, it could be difficult to give a fair assessment to all indicators for all countries involved. However, in their draft UNESCO believes that the range and diversity of indicators included in the framework should enable the indicators to provide sufficient evidence of the Internet environment as a whole. Other challenges that it faces include different definitions of terms like 'broadband', as well as the fact that most of the data is held by private companies and is not publicly available as a result.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

== The Four Major Fields of Focus ==

=== Access to Information and Knowledge ===
[[Access to information]] and knowledge encompasses the vision of universal access, not only to the Internet, but also to the ability to seek and receive open scientific, indigenous, and traditional knowledge [[Online and offline|online]], and also produce content in all forms. This requires initiatives for [[freedom of information]] and the building of [[Open access|open]] and preserved knowledge resources, as well as a respect for cultural and linguistic diversity that fosters local content in multiple languages, quality educational opportunities for all, including [[Media literacy|new media literacy]] and skills, and social inclusion online, including addressing inequalities based on income, skills, education, gender, age, race, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], or accessibility by those with [[Disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frontiers in New Media Research|editor-last=Lee|editor-first=F.

=== Freedom of Expression ===
{{Main|Freedom of speech}}

Freedom of expression entails the ability to safely express one’s views over the Internet, ranging from the rights of Internet users to freedom of expression online, through to press freedom and the safety of journalists, [[blog]]gers and human rights advocates, along with [[Policy|policies]] that enhance an open exchange of views and a respect for the rights of free online expression. Privacy refers broadly to Internet practices and policies that respect the rights of individuals to have a reasonable expectation of having a personal space, and to control access to their personal information. Privacy, therefore, allows individuals to freely express their ideas without fear of reprisals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Privacy ===
{{Main|Privacy}}

Privacy protection is however a tricky concept that goes together with the promotion of openness and transparency and a recognition that privacy and its protection underpins freedom of expression and trust in the Internet, and therefore its greater use for social and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Ethics}}

Ethics considers whether the norms, rules and procedures that govern online behavior and the design of the Internet and related [[digital media]] are based on ethical principles anchored in human rights based principles and geared to protecting the dignity and safety of individuals in cyberspace and advance accessibility, openness, and inclusiveness on the Internet. For example, Internet use should be sensitive to ethical considerations, such as non-discrimination on the basis of gender, age or disabilities; and shaped by ethics rather than used to retrospectively justify practices and policies, placing a focus on the intentionality of actions, as well as on the outcomes of Internet policies and practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges to Internet Universality ==

As the [[World Wide Web]] and related digital media have evolved, they have come to serve many diverse purposes for many different actors, e.g. household entertainment, [[Surveillance|government surveillance]]. Technical innovations are altering traditional business models, such as in the provision of news, and the structure of organizations, where traditional hierarchical reporting relationships have been challenged by many-to-one and many-to-many networks of communication that span organizational boundaries.

=== Policy ===
{{See also|Human rights and encryption}}

As digital media have been a force behind the convergence of formerly more distinct technologies of the post, telephone, and [[mass media]], so policy and regulation have often failed to keep up, as we can see with the lack of a clear and unified regulation policy used by social media. This has left potentially inappropriate regulations in place and failed to integrate new solutions such as Media and information literacy. A worldwide ecology of policies and regulations is shaping the interrelated local and global outcomes of the Internet on access to information and knowledge, freedom of expression, privacy and ethics.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001915/191594e.pdf|title=Freedom of Connection, Freedom of Expression: The Changing Legal and Regulatory Ecology Shaping the Internet|last=Dutton|first=W.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002311/231162e.pdf|title=Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries|last=MacKinnon|first=R.|last2=Hickok|first2=E.|last3=Bar|first3=A.|last4=Lim|first4=Hae-in|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|location=Paris|access-date=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
And such policy choices are being considered by a multiplicity of actors at all levels for all are concerned that the policies and practices governing the Internet could undermine principles and purposes they view as fundamental, whether those values are centered on freedom of expression, the privacy of personal information, or ethical conduct, and whether the implications are perceived to be immediate or long term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Blocking, Filtering and Content Regulation ===
[[Block (Internet)|Blocking]] and [[Internet Filtering|filtering]] of content regulation are common areas of concern for NGO's and International Organizations, such as UNESCO. These measures restrict in a direct way citizens’ rights to impart information and opinion, as well as impacting adversely on their rights to access online content. In many cases, users might not realize that content has been filtered or blocked. There was some recognition that alongside [[censorship]] as a violation of free expression, there is also legitimate reason in some contexts to block certain content, such as material that incites [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]. This raises the question of how to draw the line in specific cases about what to block, for how long, in what proportion, and with what transparency and redress mechanism.{{efn|This common example originated in 1919 with US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.’s opinion in the United States Supreme Court case Schenck v. United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Schenck v. United States|vol=249|reporter=U.S.|opinion=47|court=U.S.|date=3 March 1919|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/249/47.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another issue is the danger of holding intermediaries liable as if they were publishers — for example, making social media [[Computing platform|platform]]s responsible for an alleged case of hate speech. International standards of [[International human rights law|human rights law]] mean that removal, blockage or [[Filtering software|filtering]] of Internet content should be the exception to the norm of free flow of information, and that such actions fulfill the conditions of due purpose, necessity, proportionality, and transparency, and are authorized under relevant law and policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, multiple actors, including individual users can identify instances of censorship and expose these cases to the court of [[public opinion]]. In such ways, the Internet has the potential for enabling individual Internet users to hold institutions and other users more accountable for their actions online, creating what has been called a ‘[[Fifth Estate]]’, analogous to the [[Fourth Estate]] of the press, but potentially even more powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dutton|first=W. H.|date=2009|title=The Fifth Estate Emerging through the Network of Networks|journal=Prometheus|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fifth Estate does require a relatively free and open Internet to be sustainable and influential.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== User Targeting and Profiling ===
[[Government]]s or commercial enterprises have the ability to target individual users, putting their privacy in danger, given that they will know much about their interests through their search or other online activities. Individual users of social media platforms can advertise to others who are interested in particular topics. This can appear more as a violation of privacy then the exercise of free speech. A related issue is the ‘[[filter bubble]]’:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web is Changing What We Read and How We Think|last=Pariser|first=E.|publisher=Penguin Press|year=2011|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that different Internet users will see different versions of the Internet, based on how algorithms use their previous search or social media preferences. User [[wikt:targeting|targeting]] can happen at the level of the government, [[private companies]], or even at the [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Expression and Identification ===
The dependence of freedom of expression on related issues of privacy, anonymity, and encryption that face an apparent resistance to change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Anonymity ===
Anonymity can be a cornerstone of privacy; it is considered as a prerequisite for the expression of [[Popularity|unpopular]] or critical speech. A[[anonymity|nonymity]] is sometimes viewed as contributing to harmful speech, such as hate speech, which goes beyond international standards of human rights law for protected speech. Despite this perception, academic research has not established that removing anonymity and requiring the identification of speakers would be a cure to insensitive or hurtful remarks. These incivilities are often fostered by a larger set of circumstances, such as a failure of users sitting at a computer to fully realize that they are communicating with a real person. Anonymity may also impact on [[public debate]] online. In some countries, participants would refrain from participating (for instance on the issue of gay rights or domestic abuse) for fear of identification and [[persecution]]. Anonymity in [[Cyberattack|cyber-attacks]], including fake [[Domain (Internet)|domain]] attacks impersonating civil society, is a serious violation of free expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Data protection and surveillance ===
[[Information privacy|Data protection]] can be critical to free expression. Increasing government surveillance of citizens, including through the collection and analysis of ‘big data’, is leading to an erosion of the citizens' rights to privacy and freedom of expression. A report of the former UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression states that, bulk access to all [[Data transmission|digital communications]] traffic eradicates the possibility of individualized proportionality analysis, because it pre-empts prior authorization based on specific targeted suspicion.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Terrorism/Pages/SRTerrorismIndex.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Special Rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights|at=paras. 12, 13, 14|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[mass surveillance]] potentials and the use of big data analytics could change the balance between the state and individuals. [[Whistleblower]], such as [[Edward Snowden]], helped identifying the mass surveillance of [[Metadata|communications metadata]], as a disproportionate response in relation to the security problem. Concern were also expressed during the ‘CONNECTing the dots’ conference about [[surveillance tools]], originally built to address severe crimes, being used to collect personal information about dissidents, or sometimes from all citizens. Further concerns were over weak transparency on how data is collected or used for security investigations. Manipulation of security practices such as the introduction of [[Software cracking|‘back doors]]’ into [[software]], to allow legitimate government access can leave Internet users vulnerable to other, illegitimate threats. Attackers can potentially get in through the same back doors, rendering systems less secure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jurisdictional Issues ===
There are a certain number of obstacles in maintaining and promoting the rights to freedom of expression via regulation and regulatory frameworks. Due to its globalized and borderless nature, the Internet can be seen as inherently unregulated. There is, for example, a difficulty in establishing effective state-based regulation in a world where content can be hosted and accessed from entirely different countries, leading to regulation becoming obsolete. Striking the correct regulatory balance is difficult, as over- or inappropriate regulation can have negative consequences not only for freedom of expression but for the value of the Internet in general. UNESCO considers that governments role is not to restrict [[Political freedom|freedoms]], but rather to ensure that fundamental human rights — including communication-related rights — are protected. Paradoxically, a lack of regulation could be a detriment to the [[public interest]]. Internet-specific laws to protect freedom of expression could then be justified, since the Internet is so very different from any of the traditional media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Jealousy''' generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, concern, and envy over relative lack of possessions, status or something of great personal value, particularly in reference to a comparator, a rival, or a competitor. 

Jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as [[anger]], [[resentment]], inadequacy{{how|date=October 2018}}, helplessness or [[disgust]]. In its original meaning, ''jealousy'' is distinct from [[envy]], though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the [[English language]], with ''jealousy'' now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone.

Jealousy is a typical experience in [[Interpersonal relationship|human relationships]], and it has been observed in infants as young as five months.&lt;ref name="Draghi-Lorenz,2000"&gt;Draghi-Lorenz, R. (2000). Five-month-old infants can be jealous: Against cognitivist [[solipsism]].

Jealousy can either be '''suspicious''' or '''reactive''',&lt;ref&gt;Rydell RJ, Bringle RG Differentiating reactive and suspicious jealousy ''Social Behavior and Personality An International Journal'' 35(8):1099-1114 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. [[Psychologist]]s have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. [[Sociologist]]s have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. [[Biologist]]s have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy.

Throughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and [[theologian]]s have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.

== Sexual jealousy ==
{{main|Sexual jealousy}}

Sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person's significant other displays sexual interest in another person.&lt;ref name="BuunkHupka"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = Bram | last2 = Hupka | first2 = Ralph B | year = 1987 | title = Cross-Cultural Differences in the Elicitation of Sexual Jealousy | url = | journal = The Journal of Sexual Research | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 12–22 | doi=10.1080/00224498709551338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of jealousy  may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of [[infidelity]]. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners.

It seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner's phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.robertburriss.com/pdfs/burriss_06_ehb.pdf|title = Effects of partner conception risk phase of male perception of dominance in faces|last = Burriss, R., &amp; Little, A.|first = |date = 2006|journal = Evolution and Human Behavior|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1690982/pdf/12028782.pdf|pmc = 1690982|title = Changes in women’s sexual interest and their partner's mate retention tactics across the menstrual cycle: evidence for shifting conflicts of interest|last = Gangestad, S.

== Romantic jealousy ==
Romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest. It is defined as “''a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Gregory L.|date=1 December 1981|title=A model of romantic jealousy|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992549|journal=Motivation and Emotion|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=295–310|doi=10.1007/BF00992549|issn=0146-7239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively related to relationship jealousy in both genders.

=== Communicative responses ===
As romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jorgensen|first3=Peter F.|last4=Spitzberg|first4=Brian H.|last5=Eloy|first5=Sylvie V.|date=1 December 1995|title=Coping with the green‐eyed monster: Conceptualizing and measuring communicative responses to romantic jealousy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570319509374523|journal=Western Journal of Communication|volume=59|issue=4|pages=270–304|doi=10.1080/10570319509374523|issn=1057-0314}}&lt;/ref&gt; If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salovey|first=Peter|last2=Rodin|first2=Judith|date=1 March 1988|title=Coping with Envy and Jealousy|url=http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=15–33|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.1.15|issn=0736-7236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bringle|first=Robert G|last2=Renner|first2=Patricia|last3=Terry|first3=Roger L|last4=Davis|first4=Susan|date=1 September 1983|title=An analysis of situation and person components of jealousy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0092656683900260|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=17|issue=3|pages=354–368|doi=10.1016/0092-6566(83)90026-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness:
* Avoidance/Denial (low threat and low directness). ''Example: becoming silent; pretending nothing is wrong.''
* Integrative Communication (low threat and high directness). ''Example: explaining feelings; calmly questioning partner.''
* Active Distancing (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: decreasing affection.''
* Negative Affect Expression (medium threat and medium directness). ''Example: venting frustration; crying or sulking.''
* Distributive Communication (high threat and high directness). ''Example: acting rude; making hurtful or abrasive comments.''
* Violent Communication/Threats (high threat and high directness). ''Example: using physical force.'' 
Guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced:
* Surveillance/ Restriction (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: observing rival; trying to restrict contact with partner.''
* Rival Contacts (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented/repair-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). ''Example: confronting rival.''
* Manipulation Attempts (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, negatively valenced). ''Example: tricking partner to test loyalty; trying to make partner feel guilty.''
* Compensatory Restoration (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, commonly positively valenced). ''Example: sending flowers to partner.''
* Violent Behavior (-, -, negatively valenced). ''Example: slamming doors.''
While some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Trost|first2=Melanie R.|last3=Yoshimura|first3=Stephen M.|date=1 June 2005|title=Romantic jealousy: Emotions and communicative responses|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x/abstract|journal=Personal Relationships|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=233–252|doi=10.1111/j.1350-4126.2005.00113.x|issn=1475-6811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bevan|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Lannutti|first2=Pamela J.|date=1 June 2002|title=The experience and expression of romantic jealousy in same‐sex and opposite‐sex romantic relationships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090209384854|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=19|issue=3|pages=258–268|doi=10.1080/08824090209384854|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors.

== Gender-based differences ==

According to the Parental Investment Model based on [[parental investment]] theory, more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one’s level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected (Levy, Blatt, Schachner.) The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants' attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. (Levy, Blatt &amp; Shaner, 1998). Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships (Schachner &amp; shaer, 2004). As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that  audit attachment styles strongly  conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Rydell, McConnell, Bringle 2004, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy.

There are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships (Buss, Green &amp; Saboni 2004). For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in  males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more  women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity.  A large amount of data{{which|date=April 2013}} supports this notion. However, one must consider  for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve  the reproductive role.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces   when both parties involved is responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. (Sabbini and Silver, Averill 1995). Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages in on. One study discovered serious relationships are reserved for older adults rather than undergraduates.  For example, Buss ''et al.'' (1992) predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases.

A second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is from one culture (Desieno ''et al.'', 2002) Kitayana (2004) have highlighted differences in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional (Sabini &amp; Green 2004). Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals' life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as well (Richardson and Guyer, 1998). Research on self-esteem and attachment theory  suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship (Steinberg, Davila, &amp; Fincham, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Green, Sabini 2006, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== In animals ==

A study by researches at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines.  They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that  a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to nonsocial objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Jealousy in Dogs|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 23 July 2014|pmc = 4108309|pmid = 25054800|pages = e94597|volume = 9|issue = 7|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0094597|first = Christine R.|last = Harris|first2 = Caroline|last2 = Prouvost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The word stems from the French ''jalousie'', formed from ''jaloux'' (jealous), and further from  [[Vulgar Latin|Low Latin]] ''zelosus'' (full of zeal), in turn from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ζήλος}} (''zēlos''), sometimes "jealousy", but more often in a positive sense "emulation, ardour, zeal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=jealousy&amp;searchmode=none Jealous], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2346217 Zelos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus
&lt;/ref&gt;
(with a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] connoting "to [[boil]], [[Fermentation (food)|ferment]]"; or "yeast"). The "biblical language" zeal would be known as "tolerating no unfaithfulness" while in middle English zealous is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jealous|title=jealous {{!}} Origin and meaning of jealous by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One origin word ''gelus'' meant "Possessive and suspicious" the word then turned into ''jelus.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/jealous|title=jealous {{!}} Origin and meaning of jealous by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of terms like "green-eyed monster",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Othello]]'', Act III, Scene 3, 170&lt;/ref&gt; the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expressions "green with envy", are derived.

== Theories ==

=== Scientific definitions ===

People do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.&lt;ref name="Darwin,1872"&gt;Darwin, C. (1872). The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clanton, Smith"&gt;Clanton, G. &amp; Smith, L. (1977) Jealousy. New Jersey: Prentice- Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk,1984"&gt;Bram Buunk, B. (1984). Jealousy as related to attributions for the partner's behavior. [[Social psychology|Social Psychology]] Quarterly, 47, 107–112.&lt;/ref&gt;
They instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions which follow threats to [[self-esteem]] and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the perception of potential attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival." (White, 1981, p. 24)&lt;ref name="White,1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = G.L. | year = 1981 | title = Jealousy and partner's perceived motives for attraction to a rival | url = | journal = Social Psychology Quarterly | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 24–30 | doi=10.2307/3033859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a partner's extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to occur." (Bringle &amp; Buunk, 1991, page 135)&lt;ref name="Bringle, Buunk"&gt;Bringle, R.G. &amp; Buunk, B.P. (1991). Extradyadic relationships and [[sexual jealousy]].  In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 135-153) Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is conceptualized as a cognitive, emotional, and behavioral response to a relationship threat. In the case of sexual jealousy, this threat emanates from knowing or suspecting that one's partner has had (or desires to have) [[Human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] with a third party. In the case of emotional jealousy, an individual feels threatened by her or his partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for a third party." (Guerrero, Spitzberg, &amp; Yoshimura, 2004, page 311)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Spitzberg, Yoshimura,2004"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., Spitzberg, B.H., &amp; Yoshimura, S.M. (2004).  Sexual and Emotional Jealousy.  In J.H. Harvey, S. Sprecher, and A. Wenzel (Eds.), The Handbook of Sexuality in Close Relationships (pp. 311-345). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is defined as a defensive reaction to a perceived threat to a valued relationship, arising from a situation in which the partner's involvement with an activity and/or another person is contrary to the jealous person's definition of their relationship." (Bevan, 2004, page 195)&lt;ref name="Bevan,2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bevan | first1 = J.L. | year = 2004 | title = General partner and relational uncertainty as consequences of another person's jealousy expression | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 195–218 | doi=10.1080/10570310409374796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

* "Jealousy is triggered by the threat of separation from, or loss of, a romantic partner, when that threat is attributed to the possibility of the partner's romantic interest in another person." (Sharpteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 628)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen, Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These definitions of jealousy share two basic themes. First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.

==== Comparison with envy ====

Popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for [[envy]]. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as Nancy Friday's ''Jealousy'', where the expression 'jealousy' applies to a broad range of passions, from envy to lust and greed. While this kind of usage blurs the boundaries between categories that are intellectually valuable and psychologically justifiable, such confusion is understandable in that historical explorations of the term indicate that these boundaries have long posed problems. Margot Grzywacz's fascinating etymological survey of the word in Romance and [[Germanic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Margot Grzywacz, "Eifersucht" in den romanischen Sprachen (Bochum-Langendreer, Germany: H. Pöppinghaus, 1937), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; asserts, indeed, that the concept was one of those that proved to be the most difficult to express in language and was therefore among the last to find an unambiguous term. [[Classical Latin]] used ''invidia'', without strictly differentiating between envy and jealousy. It was not until the postclassical era that Latin borrowed the late and poetic Greek word ''zelotypia'' and the associated adjective ''zelosus''. It is from this adjective that are derived French ''jaloux'', Provençal ''gelos'', Italian ''geloso'', and Spanish ''celoso''. (Lloyd, 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=71snX5ZkX10C&amp;pg=PA4 page 4])&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;Lloyd, R. (1995). Closer &amp; Closer Apart: Jealousy in Literature. Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University|Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival.&lt;ref name="Parrot, Smith"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parrot | first1 = W.G. | last2 = Smith | first2 = R.H. | year = 1993 | title = Distinguishing the experiences of envy and jealousy | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 906–920 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.906}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy.&lt;ref name="Kristjansson,2002"&gt;Kristjansson, K. (2002). Justifying Emotions: Pride and Jealousy.&lt;/ref&gt; A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival — affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy.&lt;ref name="Smith, Kim, Parrott"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = R.H. | last2 = Kim | first2 = S.H. | last3 = Parrott | first3 = W.G. | year = 1988 | title = Envy and jealousy: Semantic problems and experiential distinctions | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 401–409 | doi=10.1177/0146167288142017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher [[John Rawls]]&lt;ref name="Rawls"&gt;Rawls, J. (1971). [[A Theory of Justice]]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[Harvard University Press|Belknap Press]] of Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents' attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend's new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen"&gt;Guerrero, L.K., &amp; Andersen, P.A. (1998). The dark side of jealousy and envy: desire, delusion, desperation, and destructive communication. In W.R. Cupach and B.H. Spitzberg (Eds.), The Dark Side of Close Relationships, (pp. ). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They claim the jealous person "perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner," whereas the envious person "does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it." Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.&lt;ref name="Parrot 92"&gt;Parrott, W.G. (1992). The emotional experiences of envy and jealousy. In [[Peter Salovey|P. Salovey]] (Ed.), The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy (pp. 3–29). New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{Citation|last=Staff |first=P.T. |title=A devastating difference |journal=Psychology Today |date=Jan–Feb 1994 |id=Document ID 1544 |accessdate=2006-07-08 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427112226/http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-19940101-000017.html |archivedate=27 April 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of '''jealousy''' for many people may involve:

:* Fear of loss
:* Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal
:* Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss
:* Uncertainty and loneliness
:* Fear of losing an important person to another
:* Distrust

The experience of '''envy''' involves:

:* Feelings of inferiority
:* Longing
:* Resentment of circumstances
:* Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings
:* Motivation to improve
:* Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities
:* Disapproval of feelings

Parrot acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy.&lt;ref name="Pines, Aronson,1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pines | first1 = A. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = E. | year = 1983 | title = Antecedents, correlates, and consequences of sexual jealousy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 108–136 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1983.tb00857.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science.

=== In psychology ===

Jealousy involves an entire "emotional episode," including a complex "narrative": the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at [[Self control|self regulation]], subsequent actions and events and the resolution of the episode (Parrott, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;306). The narrative can originate from experienced facts,  thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guess and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, Goldie (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;228) shows how jealousy can be a "cognitively impenetrable state", where education and rational belief matter very little.

One possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion (Prinz after Buss and Larsen, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;120) selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one’s own offspring. A jealous behavior, in men, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else’s offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person's cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one's needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship.

While mainstream psychology considers [[sexual arousal]] through jealousy a [[paraphilia]], some authors on sexuality (Serge Kreutz, ''Instrumental Jealousy'') have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on [[sexual function]] and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.&lt;ref&gt;Emotions and sexuality. In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), ''Sexuality, in close relationships'' (pp. 49–70). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pines"&gt;Pines, A. (1992). ''Romantic jealousy: Understanding and conquering the shadow of love''. New York: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb05/jealousy.html |title=Study links jealousy with aggression, low self-esteem |publisher=Apa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Sybil Hart, Ph.D., at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in six-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | last2 = Carrington | first2 = H. | last3 = Tronick | first3 = E. Z. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In sociology ===
{{Main|Social aspects of jealousy}}

Anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. [[Cultural learning]] can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy.

[[Jealousy in art|Artistic depictions of jealousy]] occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession.

=== In religion ===
{{Main|Jealousy in religion}}

Jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy.

The Christian [[New Testament]] records that the Jewish [[Kohen|chief priests]] and elders had handed [[Jesus]] over to [[Pontius Pilate]] to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] because they were jealous of his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:18|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|15:10|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four cultures were Ireland, Thailand, India and the United States.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The overall findings discovered that in male dominate cultures are more likely to express and reveal jealousy than other cultures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This was proven when the survey found that Thais are less likely to express jealousy then the other three cultures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is because the men in these cultures are rewarded in a way for showing jealousy due to the fact that some women interpret it as love.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can also be seen when watching romantic comedies when males show they are jealous of a rival or emotionally jealous women perceive it as men caring more.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Between 1643 and 1689 he served as chief [[cryptographer]] for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and, later, the royal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David Eugene|authorlink=David Eugene Smith|title=John Wallis As a Cryptographer|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|year=1917|volume=24|issue=2|pages=82–96|mr=1560009|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1917-03015-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with introducing the [[symbol]] ∞ to represent the concept of [[infinity]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; He similarly used [[1/∞]] for an [[infinitesimal]].

== Life ==
John Wallis was born in [[Ashford, Kent]], the third of five children of Reverend John Wallis and Joanna Chapman. He was initially educated at a school in Ashford but moved to James Movat's school in [[Tenterden]] in 1625 following an outbreak of [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. Wallis was first exposed to mathematics in 1631, at Martin Holbeach's [[Felsted School|school in Felsted]]; he enjoyed maths, but his study was erratic, since "mathematics, at that time with us, were scarce looked on as academical studies, but rather mechanical" ([[#References|Scriba 1970]]).

As it was intended he should be a doctor, he was sent in 1632 to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WLS632J|name=Wallys, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he kept an ''act'' on the doctrine of the [[circulation of the blood]]; that was said to have been the first occasion in Europe on which this theory was publicly maintained in a disputation. His interests, however, centred on mathematics. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1637 and a Master's in 1640, afterwards entering the priesthood. From 1643 to 1649, he served as a nonvoting scribe at the [[Westminster Assembly]]. He was elected to a fellowship at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] in 1644, from which he had to resign following his marriage.

Throughout this time, Wallis had been close to the Parliamentarian party, perhaps as a result of his exposure to Holbeach at Felsted School. He rendered them great practical assistance in deciphering Royalist dispatches. The quality of cryptography at that time was mixed; despite the individual successes of mathematicians such as [[François Viète]], the principles underlying cipher design and analysis were very poorly understood. Most ciphers were ad hoc methods relying on a secret [[algorithm]], as opposed to systems based on a variable [[key (cryptography)|key]]. Wallis realised that the latter were far more secure – even describing them as "unbreakable", though he was not confident enough in this assertion to encourage revealing cryptographic algorithms. He was also concerned about the use of ciphers by foreign powers, refusing, for example, [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s request of 1697 to teach [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanoverian]] students about cryptography.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David|last=Kahn|title=The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing|year=1967|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|lccn=63016109|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to London – he had been made chaplain at [[St Gabriel Fenchurch]] in 1643 – Wallis joined the group of scientists that was later to evolve into the [[Royal Society]]. He was finally able to indulge his mathematical interests, mastering [[William Oughtred]]'s ''Clavis Mathematicae'' in a few weeks in 1647. He soon began to write his own treatises, dealing with a wide range of topics, which he continued for the rest of his life.

Wallis joined the moderate Presbyterians in signing the remonstrance against the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by which he incurred the lasting hostility of the Independents. In spite of their opposition he was appointed in 1649 to the [[Savilian Professor of Geometry|Savilian Chair of Geometry]] at Oxford University, where he lived until his death on 28 October 1703 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]). In 1661, he was one of twelve [[Presbyterian]] representatives at the [[Savoy Conference]].

Besides his mathematical works he wrote on [[theology]], [[logic]], [[English grammar]] and philosophy, and he was involved in devising a system for teaching a deaf boy to speak at [[Littlecote House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Find could end 350-year science dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7511446.stm|accessdate=5 May 2018|publisher=BBC|date=26 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Holder]] had earlier taught a deaf man, Alexander Popham, to speak "plainly and distinctly, and with a good and graceful tone".&lt;ref&gt;W. Holder, W. (1668). "Of an Experiment, Concerning Deafness". ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' 3, pp. 665–668.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallis later claimed credit for this, leading Holder to accuse Wallis of "rifling his Neighbours, and adorning himself with their spoyls".&lt;ref&gt;Holder, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', supplement, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions to mathematics ==
[[File:Wallis - Opera mathematica, 1699 - 4760514 980122 3 00541.tif|thumb|''Opera mathematica'', 1699]]

Wallis made significant contributions to [[trigonometry]], [[calculus]], [[geometry]], and the analysis of [[infinite series]]. In his ''Opera Mathematica'' I (1695) he introduced the term "[[continued fraction]]".

Wallis rejected as absurd the now usual idea of a negative number as being less than nothing, but accepted the view that it is something greater than infinity. (The argument that negative numbers are greater than infinity involves the quotient &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; and considering what happens as ''x'' approaches and then crosses the point ''x'' = 0 from the positive side.) Despite this he is generally credited as the originator of the idea of the [[number line]], in which numbers are represented geometrically in a line with the negative numbers represented by lengths opposite in direction to lengths of positive numbers.&lt;ref name="Martínez2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martínez, Alberto A.|title=Negative Math: How Mathematical Rules Can Be Positively Bent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HSodlYby9MC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=9 June 2013|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12309-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical geometry===
In 1655, Wallis published a treatise on [[conic sections]] in which they were defined analytically. This was the earliest book in which these curves are considered and defined as curves of the second degree. It helped to remove some of the perceived difficulty and obscurity of [[René Descartes]]' work on [[analytic geometry]].
In the ''Treatise on the Conic Sections'' Wallis popularised the symbol ∞ for infinity. He wrote, “I suppose any plane (following the ''Geometry of Indivisibles'' of Cavalieri) to be made up of an infinite number of parallel lines, or as I would prefer, of an infinite number of parallelograms of the same altitude; (let the altitude of each one of these be an infinitely small part [[1/∞]] of the whole altitude, and let the symbol ∞ denote Infinity) and the altitude of all to make up the altitude of the figure.”&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J.F. 1981. ‘’The Mathematical Work of John Wallis, D.D., F.R.S. (1616–1703)’’. Chelsea Publishing Co. New York, NY. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integral calculus===

''Arithmetica Infinitorum'', the most important of Wallis's works, was published in 1656. In this treatise the methods of analysis of Descartes and [[Bonaventura Cavalieri|Cavalieri]] were systematised and extended, but some ideas were open to criticism. He began, after a short tract on conic sections, by developing the standard notation for powers, extending them from [[positive integers]] to [[rational numbers]]:

:&lt;math&gt; x^0 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{-1} = \frac 1 x &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{-n} = \frac {1} {x^n} \text{ etc.} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{1/2} = \sqrt{x} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{x^2} \text{ etc.} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{x} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^{p/q} = \sqrt[q]{x^p} &lt;/math&gt;

Leaving the numerous algebraic applications of this discovery, he next proceeded to find, by [[Integral|integration]], the area enclosed between the curve ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, the axis of ''x'', and any ordinate ''x'' = ''h'', and he proved that the ratio of this area to that of the parallelogram on the same base and of the same height is 1/(''m'' + 1), extending [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. He apparently assumed that the same result would be true also for the curve ''y'' = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' is any constant, and ''m'' any number positive or negative, but he discussed only the case of the parabola in which ''m'' = 2 and the hyperbola in which ''m'' = −1. In the latter case, his interpretation of the result is incorrect. He then showed that similar results may be written down for any curve of the form

: &lt;math&gt; y = \sum_{m}^{} ax^{m} &lt;/math&gt;

and hence that, if the ordinate ''y'' of a curve can be expanded in powers of ''x'', its area can be determined: thus he says that if the equation of the curve is ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ..., its area would be ''x'' + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3 + ... He then applied this to the [[Numerical integration|quadrature]] of the curves ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''y'' = (''x'' − ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc., taken between the limits ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 1. He shows that the areas are, respectively, 1, 1/6, 1/30, 1/140, etc. He next considered curves of the form ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1/m&lt;/sup&gt; and established the theorem that the area bounded by this curve and the lines ''x'' = 0 and ''x'' = 1 is equal to the area of the rectangle on the same base and of the same altitude as ''m'' : ''m'' + 1. This is equivalent to computing

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1x^{1/m}\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

He illustrated this by the parabola, in which case ''m'' = 2. He stated, but did not prove, the corresponding result for a curve of the form ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;p/q&lt;/sup&gt;.

Wallis showed considerable ingenuity in reducing the equations of curves to the forms given above, but, as he was unacquainted with the [[binomial theorem]], he could not effect the [[quadrature of the circle]], whose equation is &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, since he was unable to expand this in powers of ''x''. He laid down, however, the principle of [[interpolation]]. Thus, as the ordinate of the circle &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Geometric mean|geometrical mean]] of the ordinates of the curves &lt;math&gt;y = (1 - x^2)^0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = (1 - x^2)^1&lt;/math&gt;, it might be supposed that, as an approximation, the area of the semicircle &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1 - x^2}\, dx&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{4} \end{matrix} \pi&lt;/math&gt; might be taken as the geometrical mean of the values of

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2)^0 \, dx\text{ and }\int_{0}^{1} (1 - x^2)^1 \, dx&lt;/math&gt;

that is, 1 and &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{2}{3} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;; this is equivalent to taking &lt;math&gt;4 \sqrt{\begin{matrix} \frac{2}{3} \end{matrix}}&lt;/math&gt; or 3.26... as the value of π. But, Wallis argued, we have in fact a series &lt;math&gt;1, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{6} \end{matrix}, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{30} \end{matrix}, \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{140} \end{matrix},&lt;/math&gt;... and therefore the term interpolated between 1 and &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} \frac{1}{6} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; ought to be chosen so as to obey the law of this series{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}. This, by an elaborate method that is not described here in detail, leads to a value for the interpolated term which is equivalent to taking
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac21\cdot\frac23\cdot\frac43\cdot\frac45\cdot\frac65\cdot\frac67\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
(which is now known as the [[Wallis product]]).

In this work also the formation and properties of [[continued fraction]]s are discussed, the subject having been brought into prominence by [[William Brouncker, 2nd Viscount Brouncker|Brouncker]]'s use of these fractions.

A few years later, in 1659, Wallis published a tract containing the solution of the problems on the [[cycloid]] which had been proposed by [[Blaise Pascal]]. In this he incidentally explained how the principles laid down in his ''Arithmetica Infinitorum'' could be used for the rectification of algebraic curves and gave a solution of the problem to rectify (i.e., find the length of) the semicubical parabola ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ay''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which had been discovered in 1657 by his pupil [[William Neile]]. Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The [[logarithmic spiral]] had been rectified by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel. The cycloid was the next curve rectified; this was done by [[Christopher Wren]] in 1658.

Early in 1658 a similar discovery, independent of that of Neile, was made by [[van Heuraët]], and this was published by [[van Schooten]] in his edition of Descartes's ''Geometria'' in 1659. Van Heuraët's method is as follows. He supposes the curve to be referred to rectangular axes; if this be so, and if (''x'', ''y'') be the coordinates of any point on it, and ''n'' be the length of the normal{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}, and if another point whose coordinates are (''x'', η) be taken such that  η : ''h'' = ''n'' : ''y'', where ''h'' is a constant; then, if ''ds'' be the element of the length of the required curve, we have by similar triangles ''ds'' : ''dx'' = ''n'' : ''y''. Therefore, ''h ds'' = η ''dx''. Hence, if the area of the locus of the point (''x'', η) can be found, the first curve can be rectified. In this way van Heuraët effected the rectification of the curve ''y''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; but added that the rectification of the parabola ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''ax'' is impossible. since it requires the quadrature of the hyperbola. The solutions given by Neile and Wallis are somewhat similar to that given by van Heuraët, though no general rule is enunciated, and the analysis is clumsy. A third method was suggested by [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] in 1660, but it is inelegant and laborious.

===Collision of bodies===

The theory of the [[collision of bodies]] was propounded by the [[Royal Society]] in 1668 for the consideration of mathematicians. Wallis, [[Christopher Wren]], and [[Christian Huygens]] sent correct and similar solutions, all depending on what is now called the [[conservation of momentum]]; but, while Wren and Huygens confined their theory to perfectly elastic bodies ([[elastic collision]]), Wallis considered also imperfectly elastic bodies ([[inelastic collision]]). This was followed in 1669 by a work on [[statics]] (centres of gravity), and in 1670 by one on [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]]: these provide a convenient synopsis of what was then known on the subject.

===Algebra===

In 1685 Wallis published ''Algebra'', preceded by a historical account of the development of the subject, which contains a great deal of valuable information. The second edition, issued in 1693 and forming the second volume of his ''Opera'', was considerably enlarged. This algebra is noteworthy as containing the first systematic use of formulae. A given magnitude is here represented by the numerical ratio which it bears to the unit of the same kind of magnitude: thus, when Wallis wants to compare two lengths he regards each as containing so many units of length. This perhaps will be made clearer by noting that the relation between the space described in any time by a particle moving with a uniform velocity is denoted by Wallis by the formula

:''s'' = ''vt'',

where ''s'' is the number representing the ratio of the space described to the unit of length; while the previous writers would have denoted the same relation by stating what is equivalent to the proposition

:''s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''.

===Geometry===
He is usually credited with the proof of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] using [[similar triangles]]. However, [[Thabit Ibn Qurra]] (AD 901), an Arab mathematician, had produced a generalisation of the Pythagorean theorem applicable to all triangles six centuries earlier. It is a reasonable conjecture that Wallis was aware of Thabit's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.G.|last=Joseph|title=The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics|edition=2|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=0-14-027778-1|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallis was also inspired by the works of Islamic mathematician Sadr al-Tusi, the son of [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], particularly by al-Tusi's book written in AD 1298 on the [[parallel postulate]]. The book was based on his father's thoughts which presented one of the earliest arguments for a non-Euclidean hypothesis equivalent to the parallel postulate. After reading this, Wallis then wrote about his ideas as he developed his own thoughts about the postulate, trying to prove it also with similar triangles.&lt;ref&gt;The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam:A Sourcebook [http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8583.html Victor J. Katz Princeton University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

He found that [[Parallel postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate]] is equivalent to the one currently named  "Wallis postulate" after him. This postulate states that "On a given finite straight line it is always possible to construct a triangle similar to a given triangle". This result was encompassed in a trend trying to deduce Euclid's fifth from the other four postulates which today is known to be impossible. Unlike other authors, he realised that the unbounded growth of a triangle was not guaranteed by the four first postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculator===

Another aspect of Wallis's mathematical skills was his ability to do mental calculations. He slept badly and often did mental calculations as he lay awake in his bed. One night he calculated in his head the square root of a number with 53 digits. In the morning he dictated the 27-digit square root of the number, still entirely from memory. It was a feat that was considered remarkable, and [[Henry Oldenburg]], the Secretary of the Royal Society, sent a colleague to investigate how Wallis did it. It was considered important enough to merit discussion in the ''Philosophical Transactions'' of the Royal Society of 1685.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wallis (1685) "Two extracts of the Journal of the Phil. Soc. of Oxford; one containing a paper, communicated March 31, 1685, by the Reverend Dr. Wallis, president of that society, concerning the strength of memory when applied with due attention; … ", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''15''' :  1269-1271.

===Controversy with Hobbes===
{{details|Hobbes–Wallis controversy}}

A long-running debate between Wallis and [[Thomas Hobbes]] arose in the mid-1650s, when mathematicians criticised errors in the work ''[[De corpore]]'' by Hobbes. It continued into the 1670s, having gathered in the later claims of Hobbes on [[squaring the circle]], and the wider beliefs on both sides.

== Musical theory ==
Wallis translated into Latin works of [[Ptolemy]], Bryennius, and Porphyrius's commentary on Ptolemy.  He also published three letters to [[Henry Oldenburg]] concerning tuning. He approved of [[equal temperament]] that was being used in England's organs.&lt;ref&gt;David Damschoder and David Russell Williams, ''Music Theory from Zarlino to Schenker: A Bibliography and Guide'' (Stytvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1990), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
[[File:Wallis - Opera mathematica, 1657 - 4611280.tif|thumb|''Opera mathematica'', 1657]]His ''Institutio logicae'', published in 1687, was very popular.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wallis, John |volume=28 |page=284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Grammatica linguae Anglicanae'' was a work on [[English grammar]], that remained in print well into the eighteenth century. He also published on theology.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[File:Hydrogen fine structure.svg|thumb|[[Fine structure]] of energy levels in hydrogen – relativistic corrections to the [[Bohr model]]]]

In [[physics]], the '''Lamb shift''', named after [[Willis Lamb]], is a difference in [[energy]] between two [[energy levels]] 2''S''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and 2''P''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (in [[term symbol]] notation) of the [[hydrogen atom]] which was not predicted by the [[Dirac equation]], according to which these states should have the same energy.

Interaction between vacuum energy fluctuations and the hydrogen electron in these different orbitals is the cause of the Lamb shift, as was shown subsequent to its discovery. The Lamb shift has since played a significant role through vacuum energy fluctuations in theoretical prediction of [[Hawking radiation]] from [[black hole]]s.

This effect was first measured in 1947 in the '''Lamb–Retherford experiment'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; on the hydrogen microwave spectrum&lt;ref name=Aruldhas&gt;
{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics |chapter=§15.15 Lamb Shift |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HLB6884s9IC&amp;pg=PA404 |page=404 |edition= 2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Pvt. Ltd. |author=G Aruldhas |year=2009 |isbn=81-203-3635-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and this measurement provided the stimulus for [[renormalization]] theory to handle the divergences. It was the harbinger of modern [[quantum electrodynamics]] developed by [[Julian Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman]],  [[Ernst Stueckelberg]], [[Sin'ichirō Tomonaga|Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Freeman Dyson]]. Lamb won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1955 for his discoveries related to the Lamb shift.

== Importance ==
On Lamb's 65th birthday, [[Freeman Dyson]] addressed him as follows: "Those years, when the Lamb shift was the central theme of physics, were golden years for all the physicists of my generation. You were the first to see that this tiny shift, so elusive and hard to measure, would clarify our thinking about particles and fields."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Willis E. Lamb, Jr. 1913—2008|journal=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2009|pages= 6|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/lamb-jr-willis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivation ==
This heuristic derivation of the electrodynamic level shift following Welton is from ''Quantum Optics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marlan Orvil Scully |author2=Muhammad Suhail Zubairy |title=Quantum Optics|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge UK|isbn=0-521-43595-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ISsQCKKmQC&amp;pg=PA430|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fluctuation in the electric and magnetic fields associated with the [[QED vacuum]] perturbs the [[electric potential]] due to the [[atomic nucleus]]. This [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]] causes a fluctuation in the position of the [[electron]], which explains the energy shift. The difference of [[potential energy]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = V(\vec{r}+\delta \vec{r})-V(\vec{r})=\delta \vec{r} \cdot \nabla V (\vec{r}) + \frac{1}{2} (\delta \vec{r} \cdot \nabla)^2V(\vec{r})+\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Since the fluctuations are [[isotropic]],

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \delta \vec{r} \rangle _{vac} =0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\langle (\delta \vec{r} \cdot \nabla )^2 \rangle _{vac} = \frac{1}{3} \langle (\delta \vec{r})^2\rangle _{vac} \nabla ^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So one can obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\langle \Delta V\rangle =\frac{1}{6} \langle (\delta \vec{r})^2\rangle _{vac}\left\langle \nabla ^2\left(\frac{-e^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0r}\right)\right\rangle _{at}.&lt;/math&gt;

The classical [[equation of motion]] for the electron displacement (''δr'')&lt;sub&gt;{{vec|''k''}}&lt;/sub&gt; induced by a single mode of the field of [[wave vector]] {{vec|''k''}} and [[frequency]] ''ν'' is

:&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d^2}{dt^2} (\delta r)_{\vec{k}}=-eE_{\vec{k}},&lt;/math&gt;

and this is valid only when the [[frequency]] ''ν'' is greater than ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the Bohr orbit, &lt;math&gt;\nu &gt; \pi c/a_0&lt;/math&gt;. The electron is unable to respond to the fluctuating field if the fluctuations are smaller than the natural orbital frequency in the atom.

For the field oscillating at ''ν'',

:&lt;math&gt;\delta r(t)\cong \delta r(0)e^{-i\nu t}+c.c.,&lt;/math&gt;

therefore

:&lt;math&gt;(\delta r)_{\vec{k}} \cong \frac{e}{mc^2k^2} E_{\vec{k}}=\frac{e}{mc^2k^2} \mathcal{E} _{\vec{k}} \left (a_{\vec{k}}e^{-i\nu t+i\vec{k}\cdot \vec{r}}+h.c. \right) \qquad \text{with} \qquad  \mathcal{E} _{\vec{k}}=\left(\frac{\hbar ck/2}{\epsilon _0 \Omega}\right)^{1/2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is some large normalization volume (the volume of the hypothetical "box" containing the hydrogen atom). By the summation over all &lt;math&gt;\vec{k},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\langle (\delta \vec{r} )^2\rangle _{vac} &amp;=\sum_{\vec{k}} \left(\frac{e}{mc^2k^2} \right)^2 \left\langle 0\left |(E_{\vec{k}})^2 \right |0 \right \rangle \\
&amp;=\sum_{\vec{k}} \left(\frac{e}{mc^2k^2} \right)^2\left(\frac{\hbar ck}{2\epsilon _0 \Omega} \right) \\
&amp;=2\frac{\Omega}{(2\pi )^3}4\pi \int dkk^2\left(\frac{e}{mc^2k^2} \right)^2\left(\frac{\hbar ck}{2\epsilon_0 \Omega}\right) &amp;&amp; \text{since continuity of } \vec{k} \text{ implies } \sum_{\vec{k}} \to 2 \frac{\Omega}{(2\pi)^3} \int d^3 k \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0\pi^2}\left(\frac{e^2}{\hbar c}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{mc}\right)^2\int \frac{dk}{k}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result diverges when no limits about the integral (at both large and small frequencies). As mentioned above, this method is expected to be valid only when &lt;math&gt;\nu &gt; \pi c/a_0&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;k &gt; \pi/a_0&lt;/math&gt;. It is also valid only for wavelengths longer than the [[Compton wavelength]], or equivalently &lt;math&gt;k &lt; mc/\hbar&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, one can choose the upper and lower limit of the integral and these limits make the result converge.

:&lt;math&gt;\langle(\delta\vec{r})^2\rangle_{vac}\cong\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0\pi^2}\left(\frac{e^2}{\hbar c}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{mc}\right)^2\ln\frac{4\epsilon_0\hbar c}{e^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the [[atomic orbital]] and the [[Coulomb potential]],

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\nabla^2\left(\frac{-e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}\right)\right\rangle_{at}=\frac{-e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int d\vec{r}\psi^*(\vec{r})\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\psi(\vec{r})=\frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0}|\psi(0)|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

since it is known that

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla^2\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)=-4\pi\delta(\vec{r}).&lt;/math&gt;

For ''p'' orbitals, the nonrelativistic [[wave function]] vanishes at the origin, so there is no energy shift. But for ''s'' orbitals there is some finite value at the origin,

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_{2S}(0)=\frac{1}{(8\pi a_0^3)^{1/2}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Bohr radius]] is

:&lt;math&gt;a_0=\frac{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2}{me^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle\nabla^2\left(\frac{-e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0r}\right)\right\rangle_{at}=\frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0}|\psi_{2S}(0)|^2=\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon_0a_0^3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, the difference of the potential energy becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\Delta V\rangle=\frac{4}{3}\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar c}\left(\frac{\hbar}{mc}\right)^2\frac{1}{8\pi a_0^3}\ln\frac{4\epsilon_0\hbar c}{e^2} = \alpha^5 mc^2 \frac{1}{6\pi} \ln\frac{1}{\pi\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine-structure constant]]. This shift is about 1&amp;nbsp;GHz, very similar with the observed energy shift.

== Experimental work ==
In 1947 Willis Lamb and [[Robert Retherford]] carried out an experiment using [[microwave]] techniques to stimulate radio-frequency transitions between
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method|first=Willis E.|last=Lamb|author2=Retherford, Robert C. |authorlink=Willis Lamb|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=72|issue=3|pages=241–243|year=1947|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.72.241|bibcode = 1947PhRv...72..241L }}&lt;/ref&gt; By using lower frequencies than for optical transitions the [[Doppler broadening]] could be neglected (Doppler broadening is proportional to the frequency). The energy difference Lamb and Retherford found was a rise of about 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz of the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''S''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; level above the &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''P''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; level.

This particular difference is a [[one-loop effect]] of [[quantum electrodynamics]], and can be interpreted as the influence of virtual [[photon]]s that have been emitted and re-absorbed by the atom. In quantum electrodynamics the electromagnetic field is quantized and, like the [[harmonic oscillator]] in [[quantum mechanics]], its lowest state is not zero. Thus, there exist small [[zero-point energy|zero-point]] oscillations that cause the [[electron]] to execute rapid oscillatory motions. The electron is "smeared out" and each radius value is changed from ''r'' to ''r'' + ''δr'' (a small but finite perturbation).

The Coulomb potential is therefore perturbed by a small amount and the degeneracy of the two energy levels is removed. The new potential can be approximated (using [[atomic units]]) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle E_\mathrm{pot} \rangle=-\frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left\langle\frac{1}{r+\delta r}\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lamb shift itself is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_\mathrm{Lamb}=\alpha^5 m_e c^2 \frac{k(n,0)}{4n^3}\ \mathrm{for}\ \ell=0\, &lt;/math&gt;

with ''k''(''n'', 0) around 13 varying slightly with ''n'', and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E_\mathrm{Lamb}=\alpha^5 m_e c^2 \frac{1}{4n^3}\left[k(n,\ell)\pm \frac{1}{\pi(j+\frac{1}{2})(\ell+\frac{1}{2})}\right]\ \mathrm{for}\ \ell\ne 0\ \mathrm{and}\ j=\ell\pm\frac{1}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

with ''k''(''n'',{{ell}}) a small number (&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.05).

For a derivation of Δ''E''&lt;sub&gt;Lamb&lt;/sub&gt; see for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bethe, H.A. |author2=Salpeter, E.E.| title=Quantum Mechanics of One- and Two-Electron Atoms| publisher=Springer |year=1957 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the hydrogen spectrum==
In 1947, [[Hans Bethe]] was the first to explain the Lamb shift in the [[hydrogen spectrum]], and he thus laid the foundation for the modern development of [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Bethe was able to derive the Lamb shift by implementing the idea of mass renormalization, which allowed him to calculate the observed energy shift as the difference between the shift of a bound electron and the shift of a free electron.
&lt;ref name=BetheEmagShift&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Bethe|first=H. A.|last2= |first2= |date=1947|title=The Electromagnetic Shift of Energy Levels|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.72.339|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=72|issue=4|pages=339–341|bibcode=1947PhRv...72..339B|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.72.339}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The Lamb shift currently provides a measurement of the [[fine-structure constant]] α to better than one part in a million, allowing a [[Precision tests of QED|precision test of quantum electrodynamics]].

A different perspective relates [[Zitterbewegung]] to the Lamb shift.&lt;ref name=Genz&gt;

'''Lean Government''' refers to the application of [[lean production]] (also known as "Lean") principles and methods to both identify and then implement the most efficient, [[value added]] way to provide government services. Government agencies have found that when Lean is implemented, they see an improved understanding of how their own processes work, that it facilitates the quick identification and implementation of improvements and that it builds a culture of [[continuous improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (March 2008) and Graham Richard (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean for government focuses on governing and serving citizens with respect and continuously improving service delivery by cutting out "waste" and "inefficiency" in processes; this in turn will result in better services overall, engaged civil servants as well as more [[Value (economics)|value]] for tax-supported programs and services. Generally, proponents also see that a Lean government is a means to expand the capacity of government to provide more services per [[Unit of account|unit]] of [[investment]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Miller, [http://www.governing.com/column/promise-going-lean &amp;ldquo; The Promise of Going Lean&amp;rdquo;], ''Governing,'' May 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common methods and approaches==
Many Lean manufacturing methods have been successfully adapted to identify non-value added activities (waste) in administrative, transactional, and office processes that are common in government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Carlos | last = Venegas | title = Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements  | publisher= Productivity Press  | year =2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common Lean methods include:

* [[Value Stream Mapping]] (VSM) – Value stream mapping refers to the development of a high‐level visual representation of a process flow that is involved in delivering a product or service (called a “value stream”) to customers. VSM events, which are typically 3–4 days, focus on identifying the sources of non‐value added activity and prioritizing possible improvement activities.
* [[Kaizen]] – Kaizen means to change for the good of all and is based on the philosophy of improvement, without regard to its size, type or duration. Kaizen activity is often focused on rapid process improvement events (called kaizen events) that bring together a cross‐functional team for 3‐5 days to study a specific process followed by implementing process changes.
* [[5S (methodology)|5S]] – 5S is the name of a workplace organizational method that uses a list of five Japanese words which, when translated into English, start with the letter S—Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.

As more and more government services are delivered electronically, Lean government initiatives are commonly applications of [[Lean IT]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Maria. [https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS119892+06-Mar-2009+PRN20090306 &amp;ldquo;The City of Cape Coral Enables Leaner Government with AMX and JD Edwards&amp;rdquo;] ''Reuters''. March 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lean government approaches typically have the following characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/primer/resources/LeanGovtPrimer.pdf | title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Environmental Council of States, Working Smart for Environmental Protection: Improving State Agency Processes with Lean and Six Sigma | publisher= U.S. EPA | work = Publication #EPA-100-R-08-007 | date = March 2008 | pages =3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Take a [[customer service]] perspective that seeks to optimize value delivered to the public, the regulated community, and/or other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s;
*Involve employees and external stakeholders in continual improvements and [[problem-solving]] activities;
*Deploy a rapid [[continuous improvement]] framework that emphasizes implementation over prolonged planning;
*Seek to reduce the complexity of processes and the variation in process outputs;
*Use [[performance metrics]] and visual controls to provide rapid feedback to improve real-time [[decision-making]] and problem-solving; and
*Approach improvement activities using [[systems thinking]].

Lean government does not necessarily promote low [[taxes]], only efficient use of those taxes levied. Tax policy is discerned by the [[legislative]] and executive branches of government with oversight of the [[judicial branch]] of government.  Lean government is implemented by the administrative function of government through executive order, legislative mandate, or departmental administrative decisions.  Lean government can be applied in legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government.

==Types of waste==
Several types of non-value added activity, or waste ([[Muda (Japanese term)|muda]] in Japanese), are common in government administrative and service processes.  Lean methods focus on identifying and eliminating these wastes.  The list below identifies common administrative process wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/lean/government/starterkit/index.htm|title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lean in Government Starter Kit: How to Implement Successful Lean Initiatives at Environmental Agencies, Version 2.0|publisher=U.S. EPA Publication # EPA-100-K-09-007, May 2009, p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative process wastes with examples===

* Inventory = Backlog of Work, Excess Materials or Information
* Defects = Data Errors, Missing Info
* Overproduction = Unneeded Reports, Doing Work Not Requested
* Complexity = Unnecessary Process Steps
* Waiting = Unnecessary Approval Cycles
* Excess Motion = Trips to Remote Printer or Files
* Moving Items = Report Routing, File Storage

Wastes in administrative and service processes can relate to:
# collection, use, and management of information
# design and implementation of work processes
# the efficiency and effectiveness with which individuals work.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Venegas, Flow in the Office: Implementing and Sustaining Lean Improvements, Productivity Press, 2007, pp. 10-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lean government activity==
Numerous government agencies, such as the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the States of [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]] [[Washington (state)|and Washington]], are using Lean to improve the quality, [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and speed of government processes. As in the manufacturing and service sectors, some government agencies are implementing Lean methods in conjunction with [[Six Sigma]] process improvement approaches.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Michael L. George, Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed &amp; Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions, The McGraw-Hill Companies, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mad Pride''' is a mass movement of the users of [[mental health]] services, former users, and the aligned, and that individuals with mental illness should be proud of their 'mad' identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://themighty.com/2017/03/healing-voices-mad-pride/|title=The Power of 'Healing Voices'|publisher=The Mighty|first=Oryx|last=Cohen|date=9 March 2017|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 1993 in response to local community prejudices towards people with a psychiatric history living in boarding homes in the Parkdale area of [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, and an event has been held every year since then in the city except for 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csinfo.ca/bulletin.html  |first=Geoffrey |last=Reaume |title=A History of Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day during the 1990s |publisher=The Consumer/Survivor Information Resource Centre Bulletin, No. 374 |date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar movement began around the same time in the United Kingdom. By the late 1990s similar events were being organized under the Mad Pride name around the globe, including Australia, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, Madagascar, South Africa and the United States. Events draw thousands of participants, according to [[MindFreedom International]], a United States mental health advocacy organization that promotes and tracks events spawned by the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html?partner=rssnyt 'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride activists seek to reclaim terms such as "[[Insanity|mad]]", "[[nutter (disambiguation)|nutter]]", and "[[psychosis|psycho]]" from misuse, such as in [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers and in order to switch it from a negative view into a positive view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html|title=Mad Pride’ Fights a Stigma|publisher=New York Times|first=Gabriell|last=Glaser|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=19 September 2018|deadurl= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a series of [[mass media]] campaigns, Mad Pride activists seek to re-educate the general public on such subjects as the causes of [[mental disorder|mental disabilities]], the experiences of those using the mental health system, and the global [[suicide]] pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  One of Mad Pride's founding activists in the UK was [[Pete Shaughnessy]], who later died by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentalmagazine.co.uk/pete_shaughnessy.htm#petemain Pete Shaughnessy r.i.p.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Roberts, [[Robert Dellar]] (who died in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.disabilitynewsservice.com/activists-mourn-robert-dellar-co-founder-of-mad-pride-and-a-tenacious-force-for-good/|title=Activists mourn Robert Dellar, co-founder of Mad Pride and a ‘tenacious force for good’|date=2016-12-22|work=Disability News Service|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Simon Barnet were among the other founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mad-pride-remembering-the-uks-mental-health-pride-movement&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'' records the early Mad Pride movement.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride"&gt;{{cite book |author=Theodore R Curtis |year=1996 |title=Mad Pride |publisher=Spare Change Books |location=Hackney, London |isbn=0-95257-445-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''On Our Own: Patient-Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System'', published in 1978 by [[Judi Chamberlin]], is a foundational text in the Mad Pride movement, although it was published before the movement was launched.&lt;ref name="TBG"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=J.M.|title=Judi Chamberlin, writings took on mental health care|url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/arlington/articles/2010/01/20/judi_chamberlin_writings_took_on_mental_health_care/?page=full|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known event, specifically organized as a Pride event by people who identified as [[Psychiatric survivors movement|survivors, consumers or ex-patients of psychiatric practices]], was held on 18 September 1993, when it was called "Psychiatric Survivor Pride Day".

==[[Mad Studies]]==
[[Mad Studies]] grew out of Mad Pride and survivor thinking, and focuses on developing scholarly thinking around "mental health" by academics who self-identify as mad. As noted in ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'' (LeFrançois, Menzies and Reaume, 2013),&lt;ref name="brenda"&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) ''Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies'', Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mad Studies can be defined in general terms as a project of inquiry, knowledge production, and political action devoted to the critique and transcendence of psy-centred ways of thinking, behaving, relating, and being".&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;{{rp|13}}  As a book, {{"'}}Mad Matters' offers a critical discussion of mental health and madness in ways that demonstrate the struggles, oppression, resistance, agency and perspectives of Mad people to challenge dominant understandings of ‘mental illness’".&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;Mark Anthony Castrodale (2014) "Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies", ''Scandinavian Journal of Disability Research'', {{doi|10.1080/15017419.2014.895415}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  "''Mad Studies'' is a growing, evolving, multi-voiced and interdisciplinary field of activism, theory, praxis and scholarship."&lt;ref name="cas" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

== History ==
Mad Pride was launched alongside a book of the same name, ''Mad Pride:  A celebration of mad culture'', published in 2000.&lt;ref name="Mad Pride" /&gt;  On May 11, 2008, Gabrielle Glaser documented Mad Pride in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="'Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gabrielle Glaser |title='Mad Pride' Fights a Stigma |work= The New York Times |date= May 11, 2008 | publisher= The New York Times Company |access-date= May 11, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/11/fashion/11madpride.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glaser stated, "Just as gay-rights activists reclaimed the word [[queer]] as a [[gay pride|badge of honor]] rather than a slur, these advocates proudly call themselves mad; they say their conditions do not preclude them from productive lives."

=== Early origins ===
[[Elizabeth Packard]] (1816-1897) was deemed insane by her husband as she did not agree with his conservative political views. In Illinois at the time, involuntary admission to an asylum did not require a public hearing so long as it was a husband admitting his wife.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt; Due to this, Packard was institutionalized though she saw herself to be sane. In Packard’s lifetime to be labeled as ‘mad’ was a form of social disapproval. However, she felt solidarity among Mad people due to her experience in the institution. Though she did not personally identify as Mad and had to identify as ‘sane’ in order to be an activist, it is here that we see early forms of organizing from ex-patients.&lt;ref name="brenda" /&gt;

==Mad culture and events==
[[File:2016-05-16-Mad Pride Köln 2016-4988.jpg|thumb|Bed Push at Mad Pride parade in Cologne, Germany, in 2016]]
The Mad Pride movement has spawned recurring cultural events in [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and other cities around the world.  These events often include music, poetry readings, film screenings, and [[street theatre]], such as "bed push" protests, which aim to raise awareness about the poor levels of choice of treatments and the widespread [[Involuntary treatment|use of force]] in [[psychiatric hospital]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedpush.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=2 The Great Escape Bed Push]&lt;/ref&gt; Past events have included British journalist [[Jonathan Freedland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |title=Glad to be 'mad'? |work=The Guardian |first=Jo |last=Brand |date=2007-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104141912/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/may/08/health.healthandwellbeing |archivedate=November 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and popular novelist Clare Allan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Misplaced pride |work=Guardian Unlimited |first=Clare |last=Allan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1881476,00.html |date=2006-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109101343/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/story/0%2C%2C1881476%2C00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mad Pride cultural events take a variety of forms, such as the South London collective Creative Routes, the Chipmunka Publishing enterprise, and the many works of Dolly Sen.&lt;ref&gt;Dolly Sen (October 2002) ''World Is Full of Laughter:  1 Million People Commit Suicide Every Year'', Chipmunka Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-95422-181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bed push===
[[File:peteshaughnessy.jpg|thumb|A flyer for a 2003 Mad Pride event.]]
A Bed Push is a method of activism employed by multiple mental health agencies and advocates as a method of raising awareness about psychiatric care. Activists wheel a gurney through public spaces to provoke discussion about mental health care. [[Mind Freedom]] has a recipe for a successful Bed Push on their website, urging participants to remain peaceful but also be seen by blowing horns, slightly disrupting traffic and playing music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/madpride/other-info/how-to/bed-push-tips&lt;/ref&gt; Often patients in psychiatric care feel silenced and powerless, showing resilience in the face of that and securing visibility is a method of regaining dignity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mindfreedom.org/campaign/media/mf-journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Mad Pride Week in Toronto is proclaimed as such by the city itself.&lt;ref name="blogto.com"&gt;http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/07/mad_pride_breaks_the_stigma_of_mental_illness/&lt;/ref&gt; The festivities surrounding this week are highlighted by the Mad Pride Bed Push, typically on the 14th of July. The event takes place Toronto’s Queen Street West “to raise public awareness about the use of force and lack of choice for people ensnared in the Ontario mental health system” &lt;ref&gt;Brenda LeFrançois, Robert Menzies and Geoffrey Reaume, editors (2013) Mad matters: a critical reader in Canadian mad studies, Toronto, Canadian Scholars’ Press Inc. {{ISBN|978-1-55130-534-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This week is officially run by Toronto Mad Pride which partners a number of mental health agencies in the city. In recent years, some advocates have pushed for [[Parkdale, Toronto]] to be renamed MAD! Village, to reclaim pride in its surrounding communities' long history of struggle with mental health and addictions &lt;ref name="blogto.com"/&gt;

A series of bed push events take place around London each year.

=== Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours ===
The Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours take place in Toronto, ON at the CAMH facility on Queen St West. The tours show the patient built walls from the 19th century that are located at present day CAMH. The purpose of the tours is to give a history on the lives of the patients who built the walls, and bring attention to the harsh realities of psychiatry.

Geoffrey Reaume and Heinz Klein first came up with the idea of walking tours as part of a Mad Pride event in 2000. The first wall tour occurred on what is now known as Mad Pride Day, on July 14, 2000, with an attendance of about fifty people. Reaume solely leads the tours, and they have grown from annual events for Mad Pride, to occurring several times throughout the year in all non-winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-10/|title=Psychiatric Patient Built Wall Tours at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto, 2000 – 2010|date=2011-04-19|work=ActiveHistory.ca|access-date=2017-03-13|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As predicted by the theorem, the maximum of the modulus cannot be inside of the disk (so the highest value on the red surface is somewhere along its edge).]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''maximum modulus principle''' in [[complex analysis]] states that if ''f'' is a [[holomorphic function]], then the [[absolute value|modulus]] |''f'' | cannot exhibit a true [[local maximum]] that is properly within the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of ''f''. 

In other words, either ''f'' is a [[constant function]], or, for any point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; inside the domain of ''f'' there exist other points arbitrarily close to ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at which |''f'' | takes larger values.

==Formal statement==
Let ''f'' be a function holomorphic on some [[connected set|connected]] [[open set|open]] [[subset]] ''D'' of the [[complex plane]] ℂ and taking complex values. If ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a point in ''D'' such that 
:&lt;math&gt;|f(z_0)|\ge |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; 
for all ''z'' in a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then the function ''f'' is constant on ''D''.

By switching to the [[Multiplicative_inverse|reciprocal]], we can get the '''minimum modulus principle'''. It states that if  ''f'' is holomorphic within a bounded domain ''D'', continuous up to the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''D'', and non-zero at all points, then |''f''(z)| takes its minimum value on the boundary of ''D''.

Alternatively, the maximum modulus principle can be viewed as a special case of the [[open mapping theorem (complex analysis)|open mapping theorem]], which states that a nonconstant holomorphic function maps open sets to open sets. If |''f''| attains a local maximum at ''z'', then the image of a sufficiently small open neighborhood of ''z'' cannot be open. Therefore, ''f'' is constant.

==Sketches of proofs==

===Using the maximum principle for harmonic functions===
One can use the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\log f(z) = \ln |f(z)| + i\arg f(z)&lt;/math&gt;

for complex [[natural logarithm]]s to deduce that ln |''f''(''z'')| is a [[harmonic function]]. Since ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a local maximum for this function also, it follows from the [[maximum principle]] that |''f''(''z'')| is constant. Then, using the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] we show that ''{{prime|f}}''(''z'') = 0, and thus that ''f''(''z'') is constant as well. Similar reasoning shows that |''f''| can only have a local minimum (which necessarily has value 0) at an isolated zero of ''f(z)''.

===Using Gauss's mean value theorem===
Another proof works by using Gauss's mean value theorem to "force" all points within overlapping open disks to assume the same value. The disks are laid such that their centers form a polygonal path from the value where ''f''(''z'') is maximized to any other point in the domain, while being totally contained within the domain. Thus the existence of a maximum value implies that all the values in the domain are the same, thus ''f''(''z'') is constant.

==Physical interpretation==

A physical interpretation of this principle comes from the [[heat equation]]. That is, since log |''f''(''z'')| is harmonic, it is thus the steady state of a heat flow on the region ''D''. Suppose a strict maximum was attained on the interior of ''D'', the heat at this maximum would be dispersing to the points around it, which would contradict the assumption that this represents the steady state of a system.

== Applications ==
The maximum modulus principle has many uses in complex analysis, and may be used to prove the following:
* The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].
* [[Schwarz's lemma]], a result which in turn has many generalisations and applications in complex analysis.
* The [[Phragmén–Lindelöf principle]], an extension to unbounded domains.
* The [[Borel–Carathéodory theorem]], which bounds an analytic function in terms of its real part.
* The [[Hadamard three-lines theorem]], a result about the behaviour of bounded holomorphic functions on a line between two other parallel lines in the complex plane.

The '''National Woman's Party''' ('''NWP''') is an American women's political organization formed in 1916 to fight for [[women's suffrage]]. After achieving this goal with the 1920 adoption of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the NWP advocated for other issues including the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], which is still seeking ratification today. The most prominent leader of the '''National Woman's Party''' was [[Alice Paul]].

==Overview==
The '''National Woman's Party''' was an outgrowth of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]], which had been formed in 1913 by [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] to fight for [[women's suffrage]]. The National Woman's Party broke from the much larger [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], which was focused on attempting to gain women's suffrage at the state level. The NWP prioritized the passage of a [[constitutional amendment]] ensuring women's suffrage throughout the United States.

==Early history==
Alice Paul was closely linked to England’s Women's Suffrage Political Union (WSPU), organized by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. While a college student in England, Paul became involved with the Pankhursts and their English suffrage campaign. During this time Alice Paul met Lucy Burns, who would go on and be a co-founder of the NWP. Although Paul was closely tied to the militant suffrage campaign in England, when she left to pursue suffrage in the United States, instead Paul pioneered civil disobedience in the United States. For example, members of the WSPU heckled members of parliament, spit on police officers, and committed arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lance, Keith|date=June 1979|title=Strategy Choices of the British Women's Social and Political Union, 1903-18|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/42860512?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=60|pages=51–53|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul continued her struggle for women's equality and organized picketing of a wartime time president to maintain attention to the lack of enfranchisement for women.  Members of the NWP argued it was hypocritical for the United States to fight a war for democracy in Europe while denying its benefits to half of the US population. Similar arguments were being made in Europe, where most of the allied nations of Europe had enfranchised some women or soon would.

After their experience with militant suffrage work in Great Britain, [[Alice Paul]] and [[Lucy Burns]] reunited in the United States in 1910. The two women originally were appointed to the Congressional Committee of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). In March 1913, the two women organized the first national suffrage[[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|parade]] of 5,000–8,000 women (by differing estimates)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/original-womens-march-washington-and-suffragists-who-paved-way-180961869/|title=The Original Women’s March on Washington and the Suffragists Who Paved the Way|author=Boissoneault, Lorraine|date=January 2017|website=Smithsonian|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Washington, D.C. on the day before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration. This was designed as a political tactic to show the strength of women and to show that they would pursue their goals under Wilson’s administration. Leading the parade was Inez Milholland who wore all white and rode on a white horse, which later served as a symbol for the suffrage movement. This placement of Millholland at the start of the parade was strategic because of Mulholland's beauty, Paul knew she would attract media attention and followers. One of the criticisms of this first national suffrage parade was the barrier of colored women from participating side by side with white women. Even though Paul never opposed black women getting the right to vote, she barred them from marching with the white women and forced them to be in the back of the parade with the men to appease southern women. The parade quickly devolved into chaos due to violent reactions from the crowd and a lack of support by the local police. The D.C. police did little to help the suffragists; but the women were assisted by the Massachusetts National Guard, the Pennsylvania National Guard, and boys from the Maryland Agricultural College, who created a human barrier protecting the women from the angry crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Baltimore Sun, March 4, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

After this incident, which Paul effectively used to rally public opinion to the suffrage cause, Paul and Burns founded the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in April 1913, which split off from NAWSA later that year. There were many reasons for the split, but primarily Paul and Burns were frustrated with the National's slower approach of focusing on individual state referendums and wanted to pursue a congressional amendment. Alice Paul had also chafed under the leadership of [[Carrie Chapman Catt]], as she had very different ideas of how to go about suffrage work, and a different attitude towards militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States|author=Flexner, Eleanor|year=1959|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-674-10654-7|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catt disapproved of the radical strategies, inspired by the British "Suffragettes", Paul and Burns were trying to implement into the American Suffrage Movement.

The split was confirmed by a major difference of opinion on the Shafroth-Palmer Amendment. This amendment was spearheaded by Alice Paul's replacement as chair of the National's Congressional Committee, and was a compromise of sorts meant to appease racist sentiment in the [[Southern United States|South]]. Shafroth–Palmer was to be a constitutional amendment that would require any state with more than 8 percent signing an initiative petition to hold a state referendum on suffrage. This would have kept the law-making out of federal hands, a proposition more attractive to the South.  Southern states feared a congressional women's suffrage amendment as a possible federal encroachment into their restrictive system of voting laws, meant to disenfranchise the black voter.

Paul and Burns felt that this amendment was a lethal distraction from the true and ultimately necessary goal of an all-encompassing federal amendment protecting the rights of all women—especially as the bruising rounds of state referendums were perceived at the time as almost damaging the cause. In Paul's words: "It is a little difficult to treat with seriousness an equivocating, evasive, childish substitute for the simple and dignified suffrage amendment now before Congress."{{sfnp|Adams|Keene|2008|p=103}}

==Opposition to Wilson==
[[File:Woman's Journal of March 8, 1913.jpg|thumb|right|220px|March 8, 1913 front page of ''[[Woman's Journal]]'']]

Women associated with the party staged a very innovative [[Woman Suffrage Parade of 1913|suffrage parade on March 3, 1913]], the day before Wilson's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;Flexner, Eleanor, ''Century of Struggle'', enlarged edition (1959; Harvard University Press, 1996), pp. 255–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the group's first meeting, Paul clarified that the party would not be a traditional political party and therefore would not endorse a candidate for president during elections. While non-partisan, the NWP directed most of its attention to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] and the Democrats, criticizing them as responsible for the failure to pass a constitutional amendment. As a result, in 1918, Paul ran a campaign that boycotted Democrats because of their refusal to support women's suffrage. They decided to boycott the entire party, including pro-suffrage Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alice Paul and the American Suffrage Campaign|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the boycott of Democrats spearheaded by the NWP lead to a Republican majority in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/images/tactics.pdf|title=TACTICS AND TECHNIQUES OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN’S PARTY SUFFRAGE CAMPAIGN|last=|first=|date=|website=American Memory|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Woman's Party continued to focus on suffrage as their main cause. It refused to either support or attack American involvement in the World War, while the rival NAWSA, under [[Carrie Chapman Catt]] gave full support to the war effort. As a result, a diverse group of activists such as pacifists and Socialists were attracted to the NWP due to its opposition to an anti-suffrage president.{{sfnp|Cott|1987|pp=59–61}}

==Picketing the White House==
[[Image:National Women's Party picketing the White House.jpg|left|thumb|300px|NWP members picket the [[White House]] during the [[Silent Sentinels]] protests in 1917; the banner reads, "[[Woodrow Wilson|Mr. President]], How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty."]]
The escalating conflict in Europe didn’t stop Alice Paul and the NWP from protesting Wilson’s hypocritical stance on the war. Wilson promoted the idea of maintaining democracy abroad, even though the United States still denied half of its citizens the right to vote. The NWP pickets were seen as controversial because they continued during war time and other suffrage groups like NAWSA chose to support the war effort. Known as "[[Silent Sentinels]]", their action lasted from January 10, 1917 until June 1919. The picketers were tolerated at first, but when they continued to picket after the United States declared war in 1917, they were arrested by police for obstructing traffic. Regardless of the weather, the women stood outside of the White House holding banners, constantly reminding Wilson of his hypocrisy. When they were first arrested, Lucy Burns claimed that they were political prisoners but were treated as regular prisoners.  As a tribute to their commitment to suffrage, they refused to pay the fines  and accepted prison time. The first night that the Silent Sentinels spent in jail was known as the [[Night of Terror (event)|Night of Terror]]: the prisoners were beaten until a few of them were unconscious, starved, and Burns had her hands chained above her head. Due to this unlawful detention, many of the NWP's members went on [[hunger strike]]s; some, including Lucy Burns and Paul, were force-fed by jail personnel as a consequence.Hunger strikes left the women weak and in terrible conditions, but they persisted. After a while, the guards were told to force-feed the women. They had long narrow tubes shoved down their throats, which caused many injuries that failed to heal. The suffragists were also forced to provide labor in the workhouses and were often beaten and abused. Taking advantage of the mistreatment and physical abuse, some of the suffragists shared their stories to the press and to ''The Suffragist'', their suffrage newspaper. Doris Stevens, a notable member of the NWP, wrote about their horrible experiences in the Occoquan Workhouse in her memoir ''Jailed for Freedom''. The resulting publicity was at a time when Wilson was trying to build a reputation for himself and the nation as an international leader in [[human right]]s. Many of banners featured quotes from Wilson about preserving democracy abroad, which called attention to Wilson's hypocrisy and his lack of support for a national suffrage amendment.

There are many different theories about why Wilson changed his stance of suffrage. Wilson favored  woman suffrage at the state level, but held off support for a nationwide constitutional amendment because his party was sharply divided, with the South opposing an amendment on the grounds of state's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/jamie-stiehm/2013/12/10/woodrow-wilson-versus-the-suffrage-movement|title=Woodrow Wilson Versus the Suffragettes|last=Steihm|first=Jamie|date=December 10, 2013|website=US NEWS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Southern state to grant women the vote was Arkansas. The NWP in 1917–1919 repeatedly targeted Wilson and his party for not enacting an amendment. Wilson, however, kept in close touch with more moderate suffragists of the NAWSA. Wilson continued to hold off until he was sure the Democratic Party in the North was in support; the 1917 referendum in New York State in favor of suffrage proved decisive for him. In January 1918, Wilson went in person to the House and made a strong and widely published appeal to the House to pass the bill. The NWP had many innovative non-violent tactics including; staging sit-ins, organizing deputations of high class and working-class women, boycotting the Democrats in midterm elections, using the voting power of women in the west, appealing to Wilson everyday through picketing, and calling out Wilson for supporting world democracy but not supporting it at home, of the NWP were a contributing factor in getting Wilson to change his position on the suffrage bill. It passed but the Senate stalled until 1919 then finally sent the amendment to the states for ratification.[[National Woman's Party#cite%20note-13|&lt;sup&gt;[13]&lt;/sup&gt;]] Scholar Belinda A. Stillion Southard has written that "...the campaign of the NWP was crucial toward securing the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment."[[National Woman's Party#cite%20note-14|&lt;sup&gt;[14]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Fighting for equal rights==
The NWP played a critical role in the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] in 1920, which granted U.S. women the right to vote. Alice Paul then turned her attention to securing the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) which she felt was vital for women to secure gender equality. The NWP regrouped in1923 and published the magazine ''Equal Rights''. The publication was directed towards women but also intended to educate men about the benefits of women's suffrage, women's rights and other issues concerning American women.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="Alice Paul Inst"&gt;{{cite web|author=Carol, Rebecca|author2=Myers, Kristina|author3=Lindman, Janet|title=The Equal Rights Amendment|url=http://www.alicepaul.org/who-was-alice-paul/|work=Alice Paul: Feminist, Suffragist and Political Strategist|publisher=Alice Paul Institute|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The NWP did not support protective legislation and argued that these laws would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society. But, the NWP did support working women and their support was vital throughout their campaign for the national Amendment. Alice Paul organized many working class deputations and even sent over 400 blue collar workers to meet with Wilson. Although seen as highly controversial due to the status difference, this move showed Paul's support for all types of women, not just those of prestigious class.

After 1920, the National Woman's Party authored over 600 pieces of legislation fighting for women's equality; over 300 were passed. In addition, the NWP continued to lobby for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;ref&gt;Leila J. Rupp and Verta Taylor, ''Survival in the Doldrums'' (Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 24–44.&lt;/ref&gt; and under president [[Sarah Tarleton Colvin]], who served in 1933, pressed for equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|title=Mrs. A.

Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by [[Phyllis Schlafly]] and never passed.  However, in 1964 the NWP did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have "sex" added to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP.

==Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964==
In 1963 Congress passed the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], which prohibited wage differentials based on sex.

The prohibition on sex discrimination was added by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginian Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee. He was a conservative who strongly opposed civil rights laws for blacks, but he supported such laws for white women.    
Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. 
[[Image:CivilRightsAct1964-HouseRollCall-Sex-Amendment.jpg|thumb|[[House Rules Committee]] clerk's record of [[markup (legislation)|markup session]] adding "sex" to bill.]] 
Historians debate Smith's motivation—was it a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, or did he support women's rights and was attempting to improve the bill by broadening it to include women?&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/lawandpolicy/titlevii.htm|author=Freeman, Jo|title=How 'Sex' Got into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy|journal=Law and Inequality|volume=9|issue=2|date=March 1991|pages=163–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Rosenberg, ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'' (2008) p. 187–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'70s 245"&gt;{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|author=Frum, David|authorlink=David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, NY|isbn=0-465-04195-7|pages=245–246, 249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=cbpubs|title=A Tale of Two Amendments: The Reasons Congress Added Sex to Title VII and Their Implication for the Issue of Comparable Worth|author=Gold, Michael Evan|year=1981|work=Faculty Publications – Collective Bargaining, Labor Law, and Labor History|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith asserted that he sincerely supported the amendment and, indeed, along with Rep. [[Martha Griffiths]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynne Olson|Olson, Lynne]] (2001). ''Freedom's daughters: the unsung heroines of the civil rights movement'', p.&amp;nbsp;360.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.&lt;ref name="Gold"/&gt; For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment—with no linkage to racial issues—in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and especially Paul. She and other activists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosalind Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Rosalind]] (2008). ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'', p.&amp;nbsp;187 notes that Smith had been working for years with two Virginia feminists on the issue.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws "protecting" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Cynthia (1989). ''On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945–1968'', p.&amp;nbsp;179&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats.  However, in 1964 the NWP and Pauli Murray did succeed, with the support of conservatives and over the opposition of liberals, blacks and labor unions, to have "sex" added to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], thus achieving some of the goals sought by the NWP. [[Pauli Murray]] was also instrumental in the inclusion of sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII]] of the Civil Rights Act prohibits the discrimination based on sex, which has been attributed to the betterment of women as a group.

''[[The Suffragist]]'' newspaper was founded by the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage in 1913. It was referred to as "the only women's political newspaper in the United States" and was published to promote women's suffrage activities.{{r|Suffragist}} The Suffragist would follow weekly events and promote different views held by the leaders of the NWP.

==Legacy==
The Nineteenth amendment, which prohibits the denial of the right to vote on the basis of sex, became the law of the land when it was ratified by a sufficient number of states in 1920. Many African American women and men in the Jim Crow South, however, remained disenfranchised after the ratification of this amendment until the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Today, the National Woman's Party exists as a 501c3 educational organization. Its task is now the maintenance and interpretation of the collection and archives of the historic National Woman's Party. The NWP operates out of the Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument in Washington, DC, where objects from the collection are exhibited. The legacy that this group left behind is mixed. On one hand Alice Paul and the NWP were one of the reasons that the Nineteenth Amendment was passed, but on the other hand the party was flawed for their lack of inclusion of black women and their refusal to help black women gain the right to vote. To keep the support of southern members of the NWP, Paul refused to bring up the issue of race in the south. Her single-minded focus on the ERA caused her to refuse to fight the Jim Crow Laws barring black women the right to vote. Historian Nancy Cott has noted that as the party moved into the 1920s it remained ideologically consistent in the pursuit of a solitary goal for women and that:
it remained an autocratically run, single-minded and single-issue pressure group, still reliant on getting into the newspapers as a means of publicizing its cause, very insistent on the method of "getting in touch with the key men."...NWP lobbyists went straight to legislators, governors, and presidents, not to their constituents.

In 1972 Congress passed the ERA Amendment and many states ratified it, but at the last minute in 1982 it was stopped by a coalition of conservatives led by Phyllis Schlafly and never passed. Even though the expiration date has passed for this Amendment, recently a few states have ratified it symbolically. Although Alice Paul didn’t live to see her hard work pay off, her legacy lives on in the continued struggle to ratify the ERA.

[[File:Pitchcap.jpg|thumb|right|"''Captain Swayne pitchcapping the people of Prosperous''"]]
'''Pitchcapping''' was a form of [[torture]] used by the British military against suspected Irish rebels during the period of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 rebellion]], most famously on [[Anthony Perry]], one of the leaders of the Wexford Rebels.

== Process ==
The process involved pouring hot [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], or [[tar]] (mainly used at the time for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head, allowed to cool, then rapidly removed, taking with it a portion of the suspect's skin and tissue. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or piece of paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim such as described by [[Myles Byrne]]* [https://archive.org/stream/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala/memoirsofmilesby01byrniala_djvu.txt] in his memoirs.

"''Flogging, half hanging, picketing, were mild tortures in comparison of the pitch caps that were applied to the heads of those who happened to wear their hair short, called croppies; the head being completely singed, a cap made of strong linen well imbued with boiling pitch was so closely put on that it could not be taken off without bringing off a part of the skin and flesh from the head : in many instances the tortured victim had one of his ears cut off to satisfy the executioner that if he escaped he could readily be discovered, being so well marked.'' "&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of Miles Byrne&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victim's hair/scalp. The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles [[scalping]], earlier known as a practice used by the colonists in [[North America]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] on each other.
Pitch has long, even in antiquity, been used (like other hot liquids, even melted metal) to pour into a victim's orifices. However, both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as [[capital punishment]].

A '''publication ban''' is a court order which prohibits the public or media from disseminating certain details of an otherwise [[open court principle|public judicial proceeding]]. In [[Canada]], publication bans are most commonly issued when the safety or reputation of a victim or witness may be hindered by having their identity openly broadcast in the press. They are also commonly issued when the crime involves minors or is sexual in nature.

In countries where [[press freedom]] is the norm, an actual ban on publication is used mostly for ongoing court cases where publicity may affect the case, although in Canada the balance has tilted away from disclosure since the passage in 1985 of the [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)]].

==In Canada== 
There are several types of publication ban permitted under the Canadian criminal code:
* An order restricting the publication of information identifying complainants of sexual offences [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.4 s.486.4] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying victims and witnesses [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.5 s.486.5(1)] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying a justice system participant [ s.486.5(2) ]

Under s. 486.6, anyone who violates  any of these orders (s. 486.4(1), (2) or (3) or 486.5(1) or (2)) can be liable for a summary conviction offence.

===General publication ban (s. 486(1),(2))===
Section 486.5(1) provides the court with the authority to make an order "directing that any information that could identify the victim or witness shall not be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way if the judge or justice is satisfied that the order is necessary for the proper administration of justice."

Section 486.5(2) provides the authority to make an order to not reveal "information that could identify the justice system participant".

This can be applied for by a prosecutor, a victim or a witness, a judge or justice. (s. 486.5(1))

Under s.486.5(4), the application must be made in writing and notice must be given to the prosecutor, accused, or any other person affected by the order that the judge specifies. The application itself as well as the contents of a hearing on the application cannot be published.(s. 486.5(6), (9))

The order shall only be made where the applicant establishes that the order is "necessary for the proper administration of justice". (s. 486(1), (2), (5))

The factors that must be considered to decide whether to proceed are set out in s. 486.5(7):
:(a) the right to a fair and public hearing;
:(b) whether there is a real and substantial risk that the victim, witness or justice system participant would suffer significant harm if their identity were disclosed;
:(c) whether the victim, witness or justice system participant needs the order for their security or to protect them from intimidation or retaliation;
:(d) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of offences and the participation of victims, witnesses and justice system participants in the criminal justice process;
:(e) whether effective alternatives are available to protect the identity of the victim, witness or justice system participant;
:(f) the salutary and deleterious effects of the proposed order;
:(g) the impact of the proposed order on the freedom of expression of those affected by it; and
:(h) any other factor that the judge or justice considers relevant.

===Sexual offence publication ban===
Under s. 486.4 (1), the court may make an order "directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness" not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences (as listed in s. 486.4(1)(a)).

Any complainant or witness under the age of 18 years must be notified of their right to make an application for an order, and if requested by the complainant, prosecutor or witness under 18 years of age, the judge must made the order. (s. 486.4(2))

Similarly, under 486.4(3), for charges under 163.1, the court must make an order in relation to any person who comprises the subject of child pornographic materials.

===Jury identification ban===
Under 631(6), the court or crown may order a publication ban on any information that may tend to identify jury members where it "is necessary for the proper administration of justice".

===Prominent cases===
In Canada, the role of publication bans came under intense scrutiny in April, 2005 when [[John Gomery|Justice Gomery]] issued a publication ban on the testimony of three key witnesses at the [[Gomery Inquiry]] in the [[sponsorship scandal]]. The ban was granted at the request of the lawyers for [[Jean Brault]], [[Paul Coffin]] and [[Chuck Guite]], who argued that intense media coverage would bias potential jurors for their upcoming criminal trials. Shortly after the ban was imposed, however, an edited summary of Brault's testimony was posted on an [[United States|American]] [[blog]]ger's website, where it was immediately accessible and became well-known to Canadians interested in the story. Also, the inquiry remained public, so the opposition parties were aware of what was being revealed even while their respective leaders were kept intentionally unaware to prevent them from accidentally violating the ban at a press conference. Justice Gomery later lifted the ban on most of the testimony.

In January 2005, author [[Stephen Williams (writer)|Stephen Williams]] was sentenced for violating the publication ban by including forbidden details in his two books on [[Paul Bernardo]] and [[Karla Homolka]], making him only the second person sentenced for violating the publication ban—the first being one of the "Electronic ban breakers". Stephen Williams reached a plea agreement with the Canadian authorities in which he agreed that he would no longer use "any materials belonging to the Crown" as part of his writings.

In December 2010, a publication ban was imposed in the case of the [[murder of Victoria Stafford]] because the victim was a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Court Lifts Ban in Stafford Case|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/12/09/stafford-supreme-court.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2010-12-09|date=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown also imposed a publication ban in the case of Nicole Wagler, a 17-year-old from Milverton, Ontario, who was brutally murdered December 2012.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southwesternontario.ca/news/milverton-man-charged-with-first-degree-murder/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
Where a [[judge]] considers that reporting an ongoing case may prejudice a [[trial]], what are termed "reporting restrictions" may be imposed while the case is in progress. For example, an order prohibiting publication under Section 11 of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] was issued forbidding any [[United Kingdom]] newspaper from publishing certain information regarding a memo alleged to be an official transcript of a conversation between U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] and UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], which, in the context of the planning for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], regarded [[Al Jazeera bombing memo|an alleged plan to bomb]] selected offices of the Arabic-language television news station [[Al Jazeera]].

==In the United States==
[[Brian Cathcart]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' has stated that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] "ensures that the media enjoy great latitude in the coverage of criminal investigations and trials."&lt;ref&gt;Cathcart, Brian. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/reporting-restrictions-have-been-lifted--by-the-internet-1573783.html Reporting Restrictions Have Been Lifted – by the Internet]." ''[[The Independent]]''. Sunday February 19, 1995. Retrieved on October 11, 2010. "These questions would not arise in the United States, where the First Amendment, guaranteeing freedom of speech, ensures that the media enjoy great latitude in the coverage of criminal investigations and trials."&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable legal dispute over a government attempt to censor newspapers arose in the context of the [[Watergate Scandal]] during the early 1970s. [[Richard Nixon]]'s administration attempted to block ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' from publishing information contained in the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''. The matter was resolved after a two-week delay by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in [[New York Times Co. v. United States]], in which the Court ruled that the publication ban was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press. 

===Publication of name of sexual assault victim===
{{Main article |Florida Star v. B. J. F.}}

The US Supreme Court ruled the imposition of damages for truthfully publishing public information violates the First Amendment.

[[Gerard McManus]] and Michael Harvey were journalists at the [[Herald Sun]] newspaper in Melbourne in the state of Victoria, Australia. In June 2007 the pair were convicted of contempt of court for refusing to name the source of an exposé the pair wrote on war veterans’ entitlements.

The pair’s conviction prompted a widespread debate on journalistic freedom in Australia and resulted in federal and state governments introducing “[[Shield laws in the United States|shield laws]]” to give judges scope to exempt journalists from revealing their sources during trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixon|first=Nicolee|title=The Pivotal Case of R v McManus and Harvey|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/ResearchPublications/ResearchBriefs/2012/RBR201203.pdf|work=Shield Laws for Journalists|publisher=Queensland Parliamentary Library and Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

A February 2004 Herald Sun report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet’s $500m rebuff revealed|url=http://www.newsawards.com.au/files/pdf/07/chairman4.pdf|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=20 February 2004|author=Michael Harvey|author2=Gerard McManus|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Harvey and McManus revealed an Australian Federal Government decision to rebuff 60 recommendations for improved financial benefits for returned war servicemen and women, including subsidized funeral costs, while still planning to portray the scaled-down support as a boon for war veterans and widows.

The story prompted a large-scale investigation into the possible source inside the [[Australian Public Service]] including [[Australian Federal Police]] probing 3,000 telephone extensions and hundreds of mobile phones. However, McManus and Harvey refused to disclose to the Australian Federal Police their source, citing adherence to journalists “Code of Ethics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Alliance Code of Ethics|url=http://www.alliance.org.au/code-of-ethics.html|publisher=Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failure to Give Evidence ==

A civil servant, Desmond Patrick Kelly, was subsequently charged with a breach of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, but at a pre-trial hearing in August 2005 McManus and Harvey refused to give evidence. Nevertheless, Kelly was still found guilty of leaking confidential material, but in October 2006 the Victorian Court of Appeal overturned the conviction finding there was insufficient evidence to prove that he was the person who leaked the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSCA|221|2006|litigants=R v Kelly |date=17 October 2006 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Victoria)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bureaucrat's conviction for leaking info overturned|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-17/bureaucrats-conviction-for-leaking-info-overturned/1287986|newspaper=ABC News|date=17 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the McManus-Harvey contempt matter continued and on 25 June 2007 McManus was found guilty of five counts of contempt of court and Harvey was found guilty of four counts. Victorian County Court Chief Judge [[Michael Rozenes]] said the offence was a serious one and that he had considered incarcerating the pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Queen v Desmond Kelly (Transcript of Proceedings)|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/img/2005/ep26/proceedings.pdf|page=89|date=23 August 2005|quote=Bearing in mind the nature of this proceeding there would be a range of penalties available, but I think no one should be under any misapprehension that prison is one of them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McManus and Harvey were each fined $7,000, and a conviction recorded against them.

== Reaction to the Case ==

The ensuing outcry from the McManus and Harvey convictions prompted both the [[Howard Government|John Howard]] and [[First Rudd Government|Kevin Rudd]] Governments to introduce laws to provide some level of protection for journalists regarding their sources in 2007 and 2009. However, both administrations fell before the proposed laws were passed.

== Shield Laws ==

Tasmanian independent member of the House of Representatives, [[Andrew Wilkie]], and Queensland Liberal Senator [[George Brandis]]   respectively introduced [[Private member’s bill|Private Member’s Bills]] in 2009 to provide greater protection for journalists and their sources. Both Bills were referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Inquiry into the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2009|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/document-search/senate-legal-and-constitutional-affairs-legislation-committee-inquiry-into-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-and-the-evidence-amendment-journalists-privilege-bill-2010-no-2/|author=Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which recommended the Wilkie amendments, based largely on New Zealand “shield laws”, were preferable.

Prominent politicians who supported the Wilkie Bill included former Attorney-General [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]] and South Australian independent Senator [[Nick Xenophon]].

During the Parliamentary debate [[Australian Greens]] argued the definition of a journalist in the legislation was too narrow and should include “[[bloggers]]”, but its proposed amendments were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dixon|first=Nicolee|title=Shield Laws for Journalists|url=http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/documents/explore/ResearchPublications/ResearchBriefs/2012/RBR201203.pdf|work=Research Brief 2012/No.03|publisher=Queensland Parliamentary Library and Research Service|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual harassment in the military''' is unwanted [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a [[military]] setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in [[civilian]] life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience [[sexual harassment]] in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]].

== Behaviour ==
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}

Sexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of [[Pornography|pornographic material]], may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|title=Quantitative &amp; qualitative research into sexual harassment in the armed forces|last=Rutherford|first=Sarah|last2=Schneider|first2=Robin|date=2006|website=|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018171845/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-18|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Walmsley|first3=Alexis|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Case examples ===
In the [[British Army|British army]], a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘A friend was out on an [[Military exercise|exercise]] when a group of men ducked her head in a bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I could see she was upset.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]], demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the ''Deschamps Review'' of 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, or to become a man”.'&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A woman in the [[French Army|French army]], [[pseudonym]]ised by the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper as Captain Carole, was [[rape]]d by her commanding officer:&lt;blockquote&gt;'It was months before I could pronounce the word "rape"... I blamed myself. I said: "We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?" But when that happens you are terrorised.'&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-battles-sexual-abuse-in-the-military-9271383.html|title=France battles sexual abuse in the military|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=2014-04-20|work=Independent|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prevalence and risk factors ==
Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in [[military]] than [[civilian]] settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828143812|title=Military psychologists' desk reference|last=Anderson|first=E H|last2=Suris|first2=A|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-992826-2|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brett A|location=Oxford|pages=264–269|chapter=Military sexual trauma|oclc=828143812|editor-last2=Barnett|editor-first2=Jeffrey E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cimvhr.ca/conference/mh-symposium/documents/presentations/5-Watkins.pdf|title=Sexual Assault in the Canadian Armed Forces: Prevalence, Circumstances, Correlates, and Mental Health Associations|last=Watkins|first=Kimberley|last2=Bennett|first2=Rachel|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Richer|first3=Isabelle|last4=Zamorski|first4=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on [[conformity]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical power relations]], combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Masculinity|traditionally masculine]] values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Parrott|first2=Dominic J.|date=May 2011|title=What accounts for men's hostile attitudes toward women?

Canadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on [[military operation]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Principal targets ==

=== Female personnel ===
While some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/11/19/cessation-of-military-recruiting-in-public-elementary-and-secondary-schools|title=Cessation of Military Recruiting in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools|last=American Public Heatlh Association|date=2013-10-30|website=www.apha.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Child cadets ===
Cadet forces are military youth organisations for younger teenagers based in communities and schools, and are common around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cadets.ca/en/what-cadets-do/army.page|title=Royal Canadian Army Cadets|last=Government of Canada|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethosworld.com/library/The-New-Profile-Report-On-Child-Recruitment-in-israel-2004.pdf|title=Child Recruitment in Israel|last=New Profile|date=2004|website=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armycadets.com/join-cadets/|title=Join The Army Cadets|last=Army Cadet Force|date=2018|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usarmyjrotc.com/|title=U.S. Army JROTC|last=US Army|date=2018|website=www.usarmyjrotc.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence from the UK, where hundreds of complaints of the sexual abuse of cadets have been recorded since 2012, and from Canada, where one in ten complaints of sexual assault in the military are from cadets, that these institutions are susceptible to a culture of sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40457123|title=Sex abuse against cadets 'covered up'|last=Razzall|first=Katie|date=2017-07-04|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-09|last2=MacSorley|first2=Jane|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/28/ministry-of-defence-pays-out-2m-settle-cadets-sexual-abuse-claims|title=Ministry of Defence pays out £2m to settle cadets’ sexual abuse claims|last=Quinn|first=Ben|date=2014-12-28|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/04/mod-admits-over-350-sexual-abuse-complaints-have-been-made-by-cadets|title=MoD admits over 350 sexual abuse complaints have been made by cadets|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|date=2017-07-04|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/xdm7kn/canadian-military-cadet-program-has-a-sexual-assault-problem-documents-show-674|title=Documents Show the Canadian Army Cadets Program Is Plagued With Sexual Abuse Allegations|date=2014-11-26|work=Vice|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/our-militarys-disgrace/|title=Our military's disgrace|last=Mercier|first=Noémi|date=2014-05-16|work=Macleans.ca|access-date=2018-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516222347/http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/our-militarys-disgrace/|archive-date=2014-05-16|dead-url=yes|last2=Castonguay|first2=Alec|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detainees ===
Individuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the [[Iraq War]], for example, personnel of the [[United States Army|US army]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|US Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a number of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|title=Other government agencies|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|publisher=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|archivedate=February 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 3, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2004-05-17"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|title=Chain of Command|last=Hersh|first=Seymour M.|date=May 17, 2004|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=September 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055751/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|archivedate=January 1, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

== Barriers to redress ==
Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1168765/dod-releases-latest-military-sexual-assault-report/|title=DoD Releases Latest Military Sexual Assault Report|last=US, Department of Defence|date=2017-05-01|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example:
* An official report of the [[Australian Defence Force]] concluded that women affected by harassment were less likely to make a complaint because they do not expect a serious response.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenceabusetaskforce.gov.au/Reports/Documents/Dart-final-report-2016.pdf|title=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce: Final report|last=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|date=2016|website=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ombudsman]] of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] confirmed that women fear the consequences if they report a sexual offence against them to their [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]: 'The fear of repercussions is blatant,' he said in 2014.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2015, the Deschamps Review reported that one of the main reasons why personnel do not lodge a complaint is a fear of the consequences for their career and that there had many complainants had faced reprisals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Leila Minano, the co-author of a book documenting sexual abuse in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]], commented that complaints from women were systematically discouraged from complaining, and were often moved out of their unit if they did so.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
* In the UK, an official report on sexual harassment in the [[British Army|British army]] found that almost half of personnel who had an 'upsetting' experience of sexual harassment did not complain for fear of an impact on their career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* In the [[United States Armed Forces|US armed forces]], a study in 2016 found that 58% of women who reported sexual misconduct by peers said that they had met with retaliation as a consequence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assault-reports-u-s-military-reach-record-high-pentagon-n753566|title=Sexual assault reports in U.S. military reach record high, Pentagon says|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense estimated in 2017 that two in three victims of sexual assault do not report it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Since the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY16_Annual/FY16_SAPRO_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military: Fiscal Year 2016|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Mental health effects ==
Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer [[Stress (biology)|stress]]-related [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] afterwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research in the US found that when [[sexual abuse]] of female military personnel is [[Psychological trauma|psychiatrically traumatic]], the odds of suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Margret E.|last2=Street|first2=Amy E.|last3=Stafford|first3=Jane|date=2014|title=Victims' psychosocial well-being after reporting sexual harassment in the military|journal=Journal of trauma &amp; dissociation: the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation (ISSD)|volume=15|issue=2|pages=133–152|doi=10.1080/15299732.2014.867563|issn=1529-9740|pmid=24410254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example:
* The British armed forces co-commissioned their first formal study of the problem in 2006, and in 2016 the head of the [[British Army|British army]] noted the ‘overly sexualised’ soldier culture and committed to reducing the extent of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/army-has-overly-sexualised-heavy-drinking-culture-head-of-armed/|title=Army has 'overly-sexualised' heavy drinking culture, Chief of General Staff admits|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-06-14|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, after a major study uncovered widespread sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian armed forces, [[Jonathan Vance|General Jonathan Vance]], Chief of the Defence Staff, acknowledged: 'Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sexual-misconduct-military-survey-1.3868377|title=960 soldiers reported being sexually assaulted in the past year|last=Harris|first=Kathleen|date=2016-11-28|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the military, by country ==

=== Australia ===
Widespread reports of sexual harassment in the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian armed forces]] led to the establishment of the [[Defence Abuse Response Taskforce]] to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A [[Royal Commission]] into institutional [[child sexual abuse]] was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/private-sessions|title=Private sessions|last=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|date=2017-05-30|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal [[gang rape]], and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/22/navy-staff-tolerated-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-of-recruits-royal-commission-says|title=Navy staff tolerated widespread child sexual abuse of recruits, royal commission says|last=Australian Associated Press|date=2017-08-22|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further|Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Sexual assault in the Canadian Forces}}According to official statistics gathered by [[Maclean's|''Maclean's'' magazine]], the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[ombudsman]] of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the ''External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces'' (the ''Deschamps Review''), was published.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''Deschamps Review'' also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One male interview told the Review, for example: "Girls that come to the Army know what to expect." It stated that senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year).

=== France ===
The extent of sexual harassment in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]] first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in ''La Guerre Invisible'', a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871236655|title=La guerre invisible: révélations sur les violences sexuelles dans l'armée française|last=Leila|first=Miñano|last2=Pascual|first2=Julia|publisher=Les Arènes|others=|year=2014|isbn=2352043026|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=871236655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Following concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all [[lesbian]]s or [[slut]]s.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, a [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC ''Panorama'']] documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence]] paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Military sexual trauma|Sexual assault in the United States military}}In 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; of whom 6,172 made an official complaint.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to an article published in ''[[Medscape]]'', up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|title=Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|last=Meade|first=Barbara J|last2=Glenn|first2=Margaret K|date=2013-03-29|website=www.medscape.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315173801/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|archive-date=2016-03-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sport]]s (particularly [[association football]]), a '''two-legged tie''' is a contest between two teams which comprises two matches or "legs", with each team as the [[home (sports)|home team]] in one leg.  The winning team is usually determined by [[aggregate score]], the sum of the scores of the two legs.  For example, if the scores of the two legs are:
*First leg: Team A 4–1 Team B
*Second leg: Team B 2–1 Team A
Then the aggregate score will be Team A 5–3 Team B, meaning team A wins the tie. In some competitions, a tie is considered to be [[tie (draw)|drawn]] if each team wins one leg, regardless of the aggregate score. Two-legged ties can be used in [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout cup competitions]] and [[playoffs]].

In North America, the equivalent term is '''''home-and-home series''''' or, if decided by aggregate, '''''two-game total-goals series'''''.

==Use==
In football, two-legged ties are used in the later stages of many international club tournaments, including the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[Copa Libertadores]]; in many domestic cup competitions, including the [[Coppa Italia]] and the [[Copa del Rey]]; in domestic league play-offs, including the [[Football League play-offs]] and the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]]; and in national-team playoffs in some qualification tournaments, including [[FIFA World Cup qualification]].

In [[ice hockey]], the [[National Hockey League]] used two-game, total-goals series in the early years of its playoffs.  It applied to all its playoffs from [[1917–18 NHL season|1918]] to [[1926–27 NHL season|1926]], and the early rounds until [[1936–37 NHL season|1937]], when it completed the switch to best-of-''n'' series. The [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]] also used a two-game total goals format for much of its history.

In [[rugby union]], two-legged matches are used in the qualifying stages of the [[Rugby World Cup]]. The semifinals of the Italian [[Top12|National Championship of Excellence]] are also two-legged, as are the semifinals and final of England's second-tier league, the [[RFU Championship]].

In [[basketball]], the two top European club competitions, the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] and [[Eurocup Basketball|Eurocup]], both use two-legged ties in the qualifying rounds that determine the clubs advancing to each competition's group phase. The Eurocup also uses two-legged ties in its quarterfinal round, which will be a separate phase of the competition starting in [[ULEB Eurocup 2009–10|2009–10]]. The French [[LNB Pro A|Pro A]] league used two-legged ties in all of its playoff rounds, except for the one-off final, until the 2006–07 season. At that time, all of its playoff rounds leading up to the final, which remained a single match through 2011–12, were changed to best-of-three series. The final changed to best-of-five starting in 2012–13.

In [[Gaelic football]], two-legged finals were used for five seasons of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]], the last in [[1988–89 National Football League (Ireland)|1988–89]]. The [[International Rules Series]] was also two-legged in 1998–2013 and from 2017 onward.

In [[Canadian football]], two-legged total point series were occasionally used by the [[Canadian Football League]] and their predecessor leagues in the postseason, most recently in the [[1986 CFL season|1986 playoffs]].

In [[Arena football]], the playoff semifinals (but not the [[Arena Bowl]] itself) were decided, at least for the [[2018 Arena Football League season|2018 season]], by a two-legged total points playoff. In one semifinal, the first game ended in a tie, and went to overtime.  However, the winner of the second game won by a larger margin (within regulation time) and was awarded overall victory based on total aggregate points.

==Tiebreaking==
If the aggregate score is tied after the two legs, various methods can be used to break ties. Under the [[away goals rule]], the team who scored more away goals advances. If away goals are equal, or are not considered, then the tie may be decided by [[extra time]] and/or [[penalty shootout]]. [[Replay (sports)|Replays]], at the second-leg venue or a neutral venue, were formerly used in European club competitions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html#icfc |title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960-61 |last=Ross |first=James M. |date=27 June 2007 |work=[[RSSSF]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''Liguilla'' (playoffs) of the [[Primera División de México]], the team with the better regular-season record advances; some leagues take the two teams' record against one another into account. In the promotion playoffs in Italy's [[Serie B]] (which do not necessarily occur in a given season), two-legged ties that are level on aggregate at the end of regulation time of the second leg go to extra time (away goals are not used); if the tie remains level after extra time, the team that finished higher on the league table advances.

==Second leg home advantage==
Each team hosts one match, and there is no intended advantage to whether a team plays at home first or second. However, lots of managers and players believe that the team playing at home for the second leg has a slight advantage. The thinking is that the team playing away for the first leg can play it safe there (a draw or even a slight defeat is considered a favourable result), and then "win" the tie at home in the second leg.

A statistical analysis of roughly 12,000 matches from the European club competitions between 1956 and 2007 showed that around 53% of teams playing at home in the second leg won the tie (even after allowing for the fact that team playing at home in the second leg tend to be better teams).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a781793320~db=all~tab=content~order=pubdate |title=The second leg home advantage: Evidence from European football cup competitions.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has however decreased over time.

In the case of World Cup intercontinental playoffs the team that plays the second leg at home has won 61% of ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitedge.com/blog/second-leg-home-advantage-in-world-cup-intercontinental-playoffs/|title=Second Leg Home Advantage In World Cup Intercontinental Playoffs|date=2017-09-09|work=Bitedge|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
In knockout competitions, alternatives to two-legged ties include: 
* single-leg ties,
** ''either'' where one team has home advantage, as in all rounds of the [[FA Cup]] except the semi-finals and finals. When a [[Replay (sports)|replay]] is necessary, it may be played at the home ground of the opposite team. Two-legged ties are seen as fairer, since they give neither team [[home advantage]]; conversely, in the [[National Football League]], home advantage is a reward for being the better [[seed (sports)|seed]] or, in the opening [[Wild card (sports)#National Football League|wild-card round]], winning the division.
** ''or'' played at a neutral venue, as in the final match of many tournaments, including the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|UEFA Champions League Final]], the [[FA Cup Semi-finals]] and [[FA Cup Final|Final]], and the NFL's [[Super Bowl]].  Neutral venues may be inconvenient for a team's fans to travel to, and due to this and the much higher prices for such a marquee event, a championship at a neutral site often draws a crowd of a much different nature than a crowd at a regular season contest. If the venue is picked before the teams playing are known, it is possible for the team that normally plays at the neutral venue to reach the match: an example is the [[1984 European Cup Final]] where [[Liverpool F.C.]] played [[A.S. Roma]] at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], Roma's home ground (despite this, Roma had been drawn as the technical away team for this match).
* [[Playoff format#Best-of formats|best-of-''n'' series]], where the team winning more matches wins the series. These are common in [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major Canadian and American sports leagues]]; games cannot be drawn and series are best of 3, 5 or 7. Such series are typically structured with alternating home venues so that the higher-ranked team gets the extra game (if necessary).

In [[mathematics]], an '''uncountable set''' (or '''uncountably infinite set''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UncountablyInfinite.html Uncountably Infinite — from Wolfram MathWorld]&lt;/ref&gt; is an infinite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that contains too many [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] to be [[countable set|countable]]. The uncountability of a set is closely related to its [[cardinal number]]: a set is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than that of the set of all [[natural number]]s.

==Characterizations==

There are many equivalent characterizations of uncountability.  A set ''X'' is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions hold:
* There is no [[injective function]] from ''X'' to the set of natural numbers.
* ''X'' is nonempty and for every ω-[[sequence]] of elements of ''X'', there exist at least one element of X not included in it. That is, ''X'' is nonempty and there is no [[surjective function]] from the natural numbers to ''X''.
* The [[cardinality]] of ''X'' is neither finite nor equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph-null]], the cardinality of the [[natural number]]s).  
* The set ''X'' has cardinality strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The first three of these characterizations can be proven equivalent in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the [[axiom of choice]], but the equivalence of the third and fourth cannot be proved without additional choice principles.

==Properties==
* If an uncountable set ''X'' is a subset of set ''Y'', then ''Y'' is uncountable.

== Examples ==

The best known example of an uncountable set is the set '''R''' of all [[real number]]s; [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that this set is uncountable. The diagonalization proof technique can also be used to show that several other sets are uncountable, such as the set of all infinite [[sequence]]s of [[natural number]]s  and the set of all [[subset]]s of the set of natural numbers. The cardinality of '''R''' is often called the [[cardinality of the continuum]] and denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; ([[cardinality of the continuum|beth-one]]).

The [[Cantor set]] is an uncountable subset of '''R'''.  The Cantor set is a [[fractal]] and has [[Hausdorff dimension]] greater than zero but less than one ('''R''' has dimension one). This is an example of the following fact: any subset of '''R''' of Hausdorff dimension strictly greater than zero must be uncountable.

Another example of an uncountable set is the set of all [[Function (mathematics)|function]]s from '''R''' to '''R'''. This set is even "more uncountable" than '''R''' in the sense that the cardinality of this set is &lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt; ([[beth two|beth-two]]), which is larger than &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;.

A more abstract example of an uncountable set is the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, denoted by Ω or ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The cardinality of Ω is denoted &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; ([[aleph number|aleph-one]]). It can be shown, using the [[axiom of choice]], that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; is the ''smallest'' uncountable cardinal number.  Thus either &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of the reals, is equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; or it is strictly larger. [[Georg Cantor]] was the first to propose the question of whether &lt;math&gt;\beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;.  In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed this question as the first of his [[Hilbert's problems|23 problems]]. The statement that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 = \beth_1&lt;/math&gt; is now called the [[continuum hypothesis]] and is known to be independent of the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]] for [[set theory]] (including the axiom of choice).

==Without the axiom of choice==
{{main|Dedekind-infinite set}}
Without the [[axiom of choice]], there might exist cardinalities [[Comparability|incomparable]] to &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (namely, the cardinalities of [[Dedekind-finite]] infinite sets). Sets of these cardinalities satisfy the first three characterizations above but not the fourth characterization. Because these sets are not larger than the natural numbers in the sense of cardinality, some may not want to call them uncountable.

If the axiom of choice holds, the following conditions on a cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent:
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa \nleq \aleph_0;&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa &gt; \aleph_0;&lt;/math&gt; and
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa \geq \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 = |\omega_1 |&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; is least [[initial ordinal]] greater than &lt;math&gt;\omega.&lt;/math&gt;

However, these may all be different if the axiom of choice fails. So it is not obvious which one is the appropriate generalization of "uncountability" when the axiom fails. It may be best to avoid using the word in this case and specify which of these one means.

'''''United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.'''''  499 U.S. 187 (1991), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] establishing that [[private sector]] policies prohibiting women from knowingly working in potentially hazardous occupations are [[gender discrimination|discriminatory]] and in violation of [[Title VII]] and the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.|volume=499|page=187|pin=|year=1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the case was heard, it was considered one of the most important sex-discrimination cases since the passage of Title VII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Arlynn Leiber|last2=Bertin|first2=Joan|title=Women at Work: Should 'Fetal Protection' Policies Be Upheld|journal=ABA Journal|date=June 1990|volume=76|issue=6|pages=38–39|publisher=American Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
The [[majority opinion]] by [[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] held that that Title VII prohibits gender–specific [[fetal protection policies]]. Hence based on that statute,  the Court decided against [[Johnson Controls]] by concluding that the company’s fetal protection policy contravened Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act|PDA]]; and the company's gender-specific rule was biased and inequitable because it permitted fertile men, but not fertile women, to decide whether to work in jobs subjected to lead exposure while manufacturing batteries.&lt;ref name=Meze&gt;

'''Visual learning''' is  a style in which a learner utilizes graphs, charts, maps and diagrams. It is one of the three basic types of learning styles in the [[Learning styles#Neil Fleming's VAK/VARK model|Fleming VAK/VARK model]] that also includes [[kinesthetic learning]] and [[auditory learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Leite, Walter L.; Svinicki, Marilla; and Shi, Yuying: Attempted Validation of the Scores of the VARK: Learning Styles Inventory With Multitrait–Multimethod Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models, pg. 2. SAGE Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==

==Areas of the brain affected==
Various areas of the [[brain]] work together in a multitude of ways in order to produce the images that we see with our eyes and that are encoded by our brains. The basis of this work takes place in the [[visual cortex]] of the brain. The visual cortex is located in the [[occipital lobe]] of the brain and harbors many other structures that aid in visual recognition, categorization, and learning. One of the first things the brain must do when acquiring new visual information is recognize the incoming material. Brain areas involved in recognition are the [[inferior temporal cortex]], the superior [[parietal cortex]], and the [[cerebellum]].  During tasks of recognition, there is increased activation in the left inferior temporal cortex and decreased activation in the right superior parietal cortex. Recognition is aided by [[neural plasticity]], or the brain's ability to reshape itself based on new information.&lt;ref&gt;Poldrack, R., Desmond, J., Glover, G., &amp; Gabrieli, J. The Neural Basis of Visual Skill Learning: An fMRI Study of Mirror Reading. Cerebral Cortex. Jan/Feb 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Next the brain must categorize the material. The three main areas that are used when categorizing new visual information are the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and two [[dorsolateral prefrontal]] regions which begin the process of sorting new information into groups and further assimilating that information into things that you might already know.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, R., Sary, G., Dupont, P., Orban, G. Human Brain Regions Involved in Visual Categorization. Elsevier Science (USA) 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; After recognizing and categorizing new material entered into the [[visual field]], the brain is ready to begin the [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] process – the process which leads to learning. Multiple brain areas are involved in this process such as the [[frontal lobe]], the right [[extrastriate cortex]], the [[neocortex]], and again, the [[neostriatum]]. One area in particular, the [[limbic]]-diencephalic region, is essential for transforming perceptions into memories.&lt;ref&gt;Squire, L. Declarative and Nondeclarative Memory: Multiple Brain Systems Supporting Learning and Memory". 1992 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming together of tasks of recognition, categorization and learning; [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s help make the process of encoding new information and relating it to things you already know much easier. One can remember visual images much better when they can apply it to an already known schema. Schemas actually provide enhancement of visual memory and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, C. "Schemas and Images as Memory Aids: Two Modes of Processing Social Information". Stanford University. 1980. American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infancy==

===Where it starts===
Between the fetal stage and 18 months, a baby experiences rapid growth of a substance called [[gray matter]]. Gray matter is the darker tissue of the brain and spinal cord, consisting mainly of nerve cell bodies and branching dendrites.&lt;ref&gt;Google definition. (2013, November 12). Retrieved from Google.&lt;/ref&gt; It is responsible for processing sensory information in the brain such as areas like the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is located within the occipital lobe in the back of infant's brain and is responsible for processing visual information such as static or moving objects and pattern recognition.

===The four pathways===
Within the primary visual cortex, there are four pathways: the [[superior colliculus]] pathway (SC pathway), the middle temporal area pathway (MT pathway), the [[frontal eye fields]] pathway (FEF pathway), and the inhibitory pathway. Each pathway is crucial to the development of visual attention in the first few months of life. The SC pathway is responsible for the generation of eye movements toward simple stimuli. It receives information from the retina and the visual cortex and can direct behavior toward an object. The MT pathway is involved in the smooth tracking of objects and travels between the SC pathway and the primary visual cortex. In conjunction with the SC pathway and the MT pathway, the FEF pathway allows the infant to control eye movements as well as visual attention. It also plays a part in sensory processing in the infant. Lastly, the inhibitory pathway regulates the activity in the superior colliculus and, later, is responsible for obligatory attention in the infant. The maturation and functionality of these pathways depends on how well the infant can make distinctions as well as focus on stimuli.

===Supporting studies===
A study by Haith, Hazan, &amp; Goodman in 1988 showed that babies, as young as 3.5 months, are able to create short-term expectations of situations they confront. Expectations in this study refer to the cognitive and perceptual ways in which an infant can forecast a future event. This was tested by showing the infant either a predictable pattern of slides or an irregular pattern of slides and tracking the infant's [[eye movement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Haith, M. M., Hazan, C., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1988). Expectation and Anticipation of Dynamic Visual Events by 3.5 Month Old Babies. Child Development, 59, 467-479.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A later study by Johnson, Posner, &amp; Rothbart in 1991 showed that by 4 months old, infants can develop expectations, but was tested through anticipatory looks and disengagement with stimuli. For example, anticipatory looks exhibit the infant is able to predict the next part of a pattern which can then be applied to the real world scenario of breast-feeding. Infants are able to predict a mother's movements and expect feeding so they can latch onto the nipple for feeding. Expectations, anticipatory looks, and disengagement all show that infants can learn visually, even if it is only short term.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M. H., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (1991). Components of Visual Orienting in Early Infancy: Contingency Learning, Anticipatory Looking, and Disengaing. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 335-344&lt;/ref&gt; David Roberts (2016) tested multimedia learning propositions, he found that using certain images dislocates pedagogically harmful excesses of text, reducing cognitive overloading and exploiting under-used visual processing capacities &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dracs.org/|title=David Roberts Academic Consulting|last=|first=|date=|website=vl.catalystitsolutions.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In early childhood==
From the ages 3–8 visual learning improves and begins to take many different forms. At the toddler age of 3–5, children's bodily actions structure the visual learning environment. At this age, toddlers are using their newly developed sensory-motor skills quite often and fusing them with their improved vision to understand the world around them. This is seen by toddler's using their arms to bring objects of interest close to their sensors, such as their eyes and face, to explore the object further. The act of bringing objects close to their face affects their immediate view by placing their mental and visual attention on that object and just blocking the view of other objects that are around them and out of view. There is an emphasis placed on objects and things that are directly in front of them and thus proximal vision is the primary perspective of visual learning. This is different from how adults utilize visual learning. This difference in toddler vision and adult vision is attributable to their body sizes, and body movements such that their visual experiences are created by their body movement. An adults view is broad, due to their larger body size, with most objects in view because of the distance between them and objects. Adults tend to scan a room, and see everything rather than focusing on one object only.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, L.B., Yu, C., &amp; Pereira, A. F. (2011). Not your mother's view: The dynamics of toddler visual experience. Developmental science, 14(1), 9-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way a child integrates visual learning with motor experiences enhances their perceptual and cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;Bertenthal, B. I., Campos, J. J., &amp; Kermoian, R. (1994). An epigenetic perspective on the development of self-produced locomotion and its consequences. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 3(5), 140-145.&lt;/ref&gt; For elementary school children, aged 4–11, intellect is positively related to their level of auditory-visual integrative proficiency. The most significant period for the development of auditory-visual integration occurs between ages 5–7. During this time, the child has mastered visual-kinesthetic integration, and the child's visual learning can be applied to formal learning focused towards books and reading, rather than physical objects, thus impacting their intellect. As reading scores increase, children are able to learn more, and their visual learning has developed to not only focus on physical objects in close proximity to them, but also to interpret words and such to acquire knowledge by reading.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, H. G., &amp; Belmont, L. (1965). Auditory-visual integration, intelligence and reading ability in school children. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 20(1), 295-305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In middle childhood==
Here we categorize middle childhood as ages 9 to 14. By this stage in a child's normal development vision is sharp and learning processes are well underway. Most studies that have focused their efforts on visual learning have found that visual learning styles as opposed to traditional learning styles greatly improve the totality of a student's learning experience. First off, visual learning engages students and student engagement is one of the most important factors that motivated students to learn. Visuals increase student interest with the use of graphics animation, and video. Consequently, it has been found that student pay greater attention to lecture material when visuals are used. With increased attention to lesson material, many positive outcomes have been seen with the use of visual tactics in the classrooms of middle aged students. Students organize and process information more thoroughly when they learn visually which helps them to understand the information better. Students are more likely to remember information that is learned with a visual aid.&lt;ref&gt;Beeland, W. "Student Engagement, Visual Learning, and Technology: Can Interactive Whiteboards Help?" (2001). Theses and Dissertations from Valdosta State University Graduate School.&lt;/ref&gt; When teachers used visual tactics to teach middle aged students they found that students had more positive attitudes about the material they were learning.&lt;ref name="Farkas"&gt;Farkas, R. "Effects of Traditional Versus Learning-Styles Instructional Methods on Middle School Students" The Journal of Educational Research. Vol. 97, No. 1 (Sep. - Oct., 2003), pp. 42-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Students also exemplified higher test performance, higher standard achievement scores, thinking on levels that require higher order thinking, and more engagement. One study also found that learning about emotional events, such as the Holocaust, with visual aids increase middle aged children's empathy.&lt;ref name="Farkas"/&gt;

==In adolescence==

===Brain maturation into young adulthood===

Gray matter is responsible for generating [[nerve impulse]]s that process brain information, and [[white matter]] is responsible for transmitting that brain information between lobes and out through the spinal cord. Nerve impulses are transmitted by [[myelin]], a fatty material that grows around a cell. White matter has a myelin sheath (a collection of myelin) while gray matter doesn't, which efficiently allows neural impulses to move swiftly along the fiber. The myelin sheath isn't fully formed until around ages 24–26.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Pat. (2001). Brain Matters: Translating the Research to Classroom Practice. ASCD: 1-207&lt;/ref&gt; This means that adolescents and young adults typically learn differently, and subsequently often utilize [[visual aid]]s in order to help them better comprehend difficult subjects.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Learning preferences can vary across a wide spectrum. Specifically within the realm of visual learning, they can vary between people who prefer being given learning instructions with text as opposed to those who prefer being given instructions with graphics. College students were tested in general factors like learning preference and [[spatial ability]] (being able to be proficient in creating, holding, and manipulating spatial representations).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Massa, L. J. (2003). Three Facets of Visual and Verbal Learners: Cognitive Ability, Cognitive Style, and Learning Preference. Journal of educational psychology, 95(4), 833.&lt;/ref&gt; The study determined that college-age individuals report efficient learning styles and learning preferences for themselves individually. These personal assessments have proved accurate, meaning that self-ratings of factors such as spatial ability and learning preference can be effective measures of how well one learns visually.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Gender differences===

Studies have indicated that adolescents learn best through 10 various styles; reading, manipulative activity, teacher explanation, auditory stimulation, visual demonstration, visual stimulation (electronic), visual stimulation (just pictures), games, social interaction, and personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;Eiszler, C. F. (1982). Perceptual Preferences as an Aspect of Adolescent Learning Styles.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, young adult males demonstrate a preference for learning through activities they are able to manipulate, and young adult females show a greater preference for learning through teacher explanation or direction, and through reading. This suggests that men are more visually stimulated, interested in information that they can have physical direct control over. Women, on the other hand, learn best through reading information and having it explained in an auditory fashion.

==Lack of evidence==
Although learning styles have "enormous popularity", and both children and adults express personal preferences, there is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widely touted "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for that student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name=Pashler&gt;{{cite journal

(2004). [http://www.lsda.org.uk/files/PDF/1543.pdf ''Learning styles and pedagogy in post-16 learning.

London: Learning and Skills Research Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent research by David Roberts at Loughborough university, appearing in peer-reviewed scholarly journals [note here], shows that images used with reduced visible text generates greater subject engagement and higher levels of active learning in large group lecture settings. The visual teaching and learning method, developed from the scholarly research of Professor Richard Mayer, was evaluated over 3 years and across 9 disciplines using control and test group methods complemented by focus groups. The visual pedagogy, and the research testing it, is hosted by the UK Higher Education Academy [note here]

'''Witchcraft''' or '''witchery''' broadly means the practice of and belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] skills and abilities exercised by solitary practitioners and groups. ''Witchcraft'' is a broad term that varies culturally and societally, and thus can be difficult to define with precision,&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LsjagvvkveEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=witchcraft+definition&amp;ots=aw4oz13kOS&amp;sig=2CWBjLB2TIsUt1aNz_nyUPxOf5E&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=witchcraft%20definition&amp;f=false Witchcraft in the Middle Ages], Jeffrey Russell, p.4-10.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cross-cultural]] assumptions about the meaning or significance of the term should be applied with caution. Witchcraft often occupies a religious [[divination|divinatory]] or medicinal role,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and is often present within societies and groups whose [[cultural framework]] includes a magical [[world view]].&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

==Concept==
[[File:John William Waterhouse - Magic Circle.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Magic Circle (Waterhouse painting)|The Magic Circle]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1886]]

The concept of witchcraft and the belief in its existence have persisted throughout recorded history. They have been present or central at various times and in many diverse forms among cultures and religions worldwide, including both "primitive" and "highly advanced" cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001, p xiii: ''"Magic is central not only in 'primitive' societies but in 'high cultural' societies as well"''&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to have an important role in many cultures today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bengt Ankarloo &amp; Stuart Clark, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Biblical and Pagan Societies", University of Philadelphia Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Scientifically, the existence of magical powers and witchcraft are generally believed to [[pseudoscience|lack credence]] and to be unsupported by high-quality [[scientific method|experimental testing]], although individual witchcraft practices [[Medical explanations of bewitchment|and effects]] may be open to [[scientific knowledge|scientific explanation]] or explained via [[mentalism]] and [[Psychological theories of magic|psychology]].

Historically, the [[Christian views on magic|predominant concept of witchcraft in the Western world]] derives from [[Old Testament]] [[biblical law|laws]] against witchcraft, and entered the mainstream when belief in witchcraft gained Church approval in the [[Early Modern Period]]. It posits a [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophical]] [[conflict between good and evil]], where witchcraft was generally [[evil]] and often associated with [[Devil in Christianity|the Devil]] and [[Devil worship]]. This culminated in deaths, [[torture]] and [[scapegoating]] (casting blame for human misfortune),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeffrey Burton Russell |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646051/witchcraft |title=Witchcraft – Encyclopædia Britannica |website=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, pp. 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and many years of large scale [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch-trials]] and [[witch-hunting|witch hunts]], especially in [[Protestant]] Europe, before largely ceasing during the European [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Christian views in the modern day are diverse and cover the gamut of views from intense belief and opposition (especially from Christian [[fundamentalist]]s) to non-belief, and in some churches even approval. From the mid-20th century, witchcraft – sometimes called contemporary witchcraft to clearly distinguish it from older beliefs – became the name of a branch of [[modern paganism]].  It is most notably practiced in the [[Wiccan]] and modern witchcraft traditions, and no longer practices in secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]] (1979) ''Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today''. Boston: Beacon Press. pp. 45–47, 84–5, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Western mainstream Christian view is far from the only societal perspective about witchcraft. Many cultures worldwide continue to have widespread practices and cultural beliefs that are loosely translated into English as "witchcraft", although the English translation masks a very great diversity in their forms, magical beliefs, practices, and place in their societies. During the [[History of colonialism|Age of Colonialism]], many cultures across the globe were exposed to the modern Western world via [[colonialism]], usually accompanied and often preceded by intensive [[Christianity and colonialism|Christian missionary activity]] ''(see "[[Christianization#Colonial era (16th−19th centuries)|Christianization]]")''. Beliefs related to witchcraft and magic in these cultures were at times influenced by the prevailing Western concepts. Witch hunts, scapegoating, and killing or shunning of suspected witches still occurs in the modern era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pearlman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/papuanewguinea/9987294/Papua-New-Guinea-urged-to-halt-witchcraft-violence-after-latest-sorcery-case.html |title=Papua New Guinea urged to halt witchcraft violence after latest 'sorcery' case |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with killings both of victims [[Murder for body parts#Medicine murder|for their supposedly magical body parts]], and of suspected witchcraft practitioners.

Suspicion of modern medicine due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic [[healthcare]] consequences. [[HIV/AIDS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV in Africa: Distinguishing disease from witchcraft |date=18 February 2008 |work=thestar.com |url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/columnists/2008/02/18/hiv_in_africa_distinguishing_disease_from_witchcraft.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ebola virus disease]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28625305 Ebola outbreak: 'Witchcraft' hampering treatment, says doctor], BBC News, 2 August 2014, citing a doctor from [[Médecins Sans Frontières]]: ''"A widespread belief in witchcraft is hampering efforts to halt the Ebola virus from spreading"''&lt;/ref&gt; are two examples of often-lethal [[infectious disease]] [[epidemic]]s whose medical care and [[Isolation (health care)|containment]] has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft.

== Etymology and definitions ==
{{Further information|Witch (word)}}
The word ''witch'' is of uncertain origin. There are numerous etymologies that it could be derived from. One popular belief is that it is "related to the English words wit, wise, wisdom [Germanic root *weit-, *wait-, *wit-; Indo-European root *weid-, *woid-, *wid-]," so "craft of the wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12416396|title=Power in the Name: The Origin and Meaning of the Word &amp;quot;Witch&amp;quot;|first=Michael|last=Dilts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is from the [[Old English]] wiccecræft, a compound of "wicce" ("witch") and "cræft" ("craft").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Douglas|title=witchcraft (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=witchcraft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology|anthropological]] terminology, witches differ from sorcerers in that they don't use physical tools or actions to curse; their [[maleficium (sorcery)|maleficium]] is perceived as extending from some intangible inner quality, and one may be unaware of  being a witch, or may have been convinced of his/her nature by the suggestion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cohn |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Cohn |title=Europe's Inner Demons |pages=176–9 |date=1975 |isbn=978-0-465-02131-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition was pioneered in a study of central African magical beliefs by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard]], who cautioned that it might not correspond with normal English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans-Pritchard |first=Edward Evan |title=Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande |date=1937 |pages=8–9 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-874029-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians of European witchcraft have found the anthropological definition difficult to apply to European witchcraft, where witches could equally use (or be accused of using) physical techniques, as well as some who really had attempted to cause harm by thought alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Keith |authorlink=Keith Thomas (historian) |date=1997 |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |pages=464–5 |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-297-00220-8}}; Ankarloo, Bengt and Henningsen, Gustav (1990) ''Early Modern European Witchcraft: Centres and Peripheries''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; European witchcraft is seen by historians and anthropologists as an [[ideology]] for explaining misfortune; however, this ideology has manifested in diverse ways, as described below.&lt;ref name="Pocs"&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 9–10. The first three categories were proposed by [[Richard Kieckhefer]], the fourth added by Christina Larner.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Alleged practices ===
[[File:A Witch.jpg|thumb|''A Witch'', 1902, by [[Edward Robert Hughes]]]]
Historically the witchcraft label has been applied to practices people believe influence the mind, body, or property of others against their will—or practices that the person doing the labeling believes undermine social or religious order. Some modern commentators{{who|date=April 2011}} believe the malefic nature of witchcraft is a Christian projection. The concept of a magic-worker influencing another person's body or property against their will was clearly present in many cultures, as traditions in both folk magic and religious magic have the purpose of countering malicious magic or identifying malicious magic users. Many examples appear in early texts, such as those from [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Babylonia]]. Malicious magic users can become a credible cause for disease, sickness in animals, bad luck, sudden death, impotence and other such misfortunes. Witchcraft of a more benign and socially acceptable sort may then be employed to turn the malevolence aside, or identify the supposed evil-doer so that punishment may be carried out. The folk magic used to identify or protect against malicious magic users is often indistinguishable from that used by the witches themselves.

{{quote|It is argued here that the medical arts played a significant and sometimes pivotal role in the witchcraft controversies of seventeenth century New England. Not only were physicians and surgeons the principal professional arbiters for determining natural versus preternatural signs and symptoms of disease, they occupied key legislative, judicial, and ministerial roles relating to witchcraft proceedings. Forty six male physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries are named in court transcripts or other contemporary source materials relating to New England witchcraft. These practitioners served on coroners' inquests, performed autopsies, took testimony, issued writs, wrote letters, or committed people to prison, in addition to diagnosing and treating patients. Some practitioners are simply mentioned in passing.&lt;ref&gt;Gevitz, N. ""The Devil Hath Laughed at the Physicians": Witchcraft and Medical Practice in Seventeenth-Century New England." Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 55 no. 1, 2000, pp. 5–36. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/15172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There has also existed in popular belief the concept of [[white witch]]es and white witchcraft, which is strictly benevolent. Many neopagan witches strongly identify with this concept, and profess [[ethical code]]s that prevent them from performing magic on a person without their request.

Where belief in malicious magic practices exists, such practitioners are typically forbidden by law as well as hated and feared by the general populace, while beneficial magic is tolerated or even accepted wholesale by the people&amp;nbsp;– even if the orthodox establishment opposes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QqPbJQkSo8EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=alleged+practices+witchcraft#v=onepage&amp;q=alleged%20practices%20witchcraft&amp;f=false|title=Witches, Druids and King Arthur|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852855550|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spell casting ====
{{See also|Magic (paranormal)}}

Probably the most widely known characteristic of a witch was the ability to cast a [[spell (paranormal)|spell]], "spell" being the word used to signify the means employed to carry out a magical action. A spell could consist of a set of words, a formula or verse, or a ritual action, or any combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary, the Compact Edition'', Oxford University Press, p. 2955, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Spells traditionally were cast by many methods, such as by the inscription of [[runes]] or [[sigil (magic)|sigils]] on an object to give it magical powers; by the immolation or binding of a wax or clay image ([[poppet]]) of a person to affect him or her magically; by the recitation of [[incantation]]s; by the performance of physical [[ritual]]s; by the employment of magical [[herb]]s as amulets or [[potion]]s; by gazing at mirrors, swords or other specula ([[scrying]]) for purposes of divination; and by many other means.&lt;ref&gt;for instance, see [[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]], ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds; a Collection of Ancient Texts'', Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985, 2006; also Kittredge, G. L., ''Witchcraft in Old and New England'', New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1929, 1957, 1958; and Davies, Owen, ''Witchcraft, Magic and Culture, 1736–1951'', Manchester University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necromancy (conjuring the dead) ====
Strictly speaking, "[[necromancy]]" is the practice of conjuring the spirits of the dead for [[divination]] or [[prophecy]]&amp;nbsp;– although the term has also been applied to raising the dead for other purposes. The biblical [[Witch of Endor]] performed it (1 Sam. 28), and it is among the witchcraft practices condemned by [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]:&lt;ref&gt;

==== Demonology ====
{{main article|Demonology}}
In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sorcery came to be associated with [[heresy]] and [[apostasy]] and to be viewed as evil. Among the [[Catholics]], Protestants, and [[secular]] leadership of the [[Europe]]an Late [[Medieval]]/[[Early Modern]] period, fears about witchcraft rose to fever pitch and sometimes led to large-scale [[witch-hunt]]s. The key century was the fifteenth, which saw a dramatic rise in awareness and terror of witchcraft, culminating in the publication of the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' but prepared by such fanatical popular preachers as Bernardino of Siena.&lt;ref&gt;For this dramatic rise in witchcraft consciousness during the fifteenth century and Bernardino's critical role in it, see Chapter 2 (pp. 52–108) Franco Mormando, ''The Preacher's Demons: Bernardino of Siena and the Social Underworld of Early Renaissance Italy''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-53854-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a [[Deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]]. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.&lt;ref name="gibbons"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barstow, Anne Llewellyn (1994) ''Witchcraze: A New History of the European Witch Hunts'' San Francisco:Pandora. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In early modern [[Scots_language|Scots]], the word [[Warlock]] came to be used as the male equivalent of [[witch (word)|witch]] (which can be male or female, but is used predominantly for females).&lt;ref&gt;McNeill, F. Marian, ''The Silver Bough: A Four Volume Study of the National and Local Festivals of Scotland'', Glasgow: William Maclellan,1957, vol 1; also Chambers, Robert, ''Domestic Annals of Scotland'', Edinburgh: 1861, and Sinclair, George, ''Satan's Invisible World Discovered'', Edinburgh, 1871&lt;/ref&gt; From this use, the word passed into [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literature and ultimately 20th-century [[Warlock (disambiguation)|popular culture]]. Accusations of witchcraft were often combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]].

The ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]],'' (Latin for "Hammer of The Witches") was a witch-hunting manual written in 1486 by two German monks, Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. It was used by both Catholics and Protestants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0IAjBexFTgC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q=malleus%20maleficarum%20protestant&amp;f=false |title=The Emergence of Modern Europe: C. 1500 to 1788|publisher= Britannica Educational Publishing |page=27 |accessdate=2013-06-29|isbn=9781615303434 |date=2011-01-15 |editor-last1= Campbell|editor-first1=Heather M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; for several hundred years, outlining how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female. The book became the handbook for secular courts throughout Renaissance Europe, but was not used by the Inquisition, which even cautioned against relying on the work,&lt;ref&gt;'In 1538 the Spanish Inquisition cautioned its members not to believe everything the Malleus said, even when it presented apparently firm evidence.', Jolly, Raudvere, &amp; Peters(eds.), 'Witchcraft and magic in Europe: the Middle Ages', page 241 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and was later officially condemned by the Catholic Church in 1490.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the [[satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]]. Such accusations are a counterpart to [[blood libel]] of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

==== White witches ====
{{Main article|White witch}}

[[File:Rila Monastery wall painting.jpg|thumb|A painting in the [[Rila Monastery]] in [[Bulgaria]], condemning witchcraft and traditional [[folk magic]]]]
Throughout the [[early modern period]], the [[Early Modern English|English]] term "witch" was not exclusively negative in meaning, and could also indicate [[cunning folk]]. As Alan McFarlane noted, "There were a number of interchangeable terms for these practitioners, 'white', 'good', or 'unbinding' witches, blessers, wizards, sorcerers, however 'cunning-man' and 'wise-man' were the most frequent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=+interchangeable+terms+for+these+practitioners,+&amp;f=false|title=Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study|first=Alan|last=Macfarlane|date=31 October 1999|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=31 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415196123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary [[Reginald Scot]] explained, "At this day it is indifferent to say in the English tongue, 'she is a witch' or 'she is a wise woman'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scot |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Scot |date=1584 |title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft |volume=Booke V |chapter=Chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk magicians throughout Europe were often viewed ambivalently by communities, and were considered as capable of harming as of healing,&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2006) ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits''. pp. 51–4.&lt;/ref&gt; which could lead to their being accused as "witches" in the negative sense. Many English "witches" convicted of consorting with demons seem to have been cunning folk whose [[fairy]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s had been demonised;&lt;ref&gt;Emma Wilby 2005 p. 123; See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=lmfuwq0mQMUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20witches%20black%20witches&amp;f=false Alan Macfarlane p. 127 who notes how "white witches" could later be accused as "black witches".]&lt;/ref&gt; many French ''devins-guerisseurs'' ("diviner-healers") were accused of witchcraft,&lt;ref&gt;Monter () ''Witchcraft in France and Switzerland''. Ch. 7: "White versus Black Witchcraft".&lt;/ref&gt; and over one half the accused witches in Hungary seem to have been healers.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the healers and diviners historically accused of witchcraft have considered themselves mediators between the mundane and spiritual worlds, roughly equivalent to [[shamanism|shamans]].&lt;ref&gt;As defined by [[Mircea Eliade]] in ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Pantheon Books, NY NY 1964, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Such people described their contacts with fairies, spirits often involving out-of-body experiences and travelling through the realms of an "other-world".&lt;ref name="Ginzburg 1990 Part 2, Ch. 1"&gt;Ginzburg (1990) Part 2, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
Beliefs of this nature are implied in the folklore of much of Europe, and were explicitly described by accused witches in central and southern Europe. Repeated themes include participation in processions of the dead or large feasts, often presided over by a horned male deity or a female divinity who teaches magic and gives prophecies; and participation in battles against evil spirits, "vampires", or "witches" to win fertility and prosperity for the community.

=== Accusations of witchcraft ===
[[Éva Pócs]] states that reasons for accusations of witchcraft fall into four general categories:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
# A person was caught in the act of positive or negative [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]]
# A well-meaning sorcerer or healer lost their clients' or the authorities' trust
# A person did nothing more than gain the enmity of their neighbours
# A person was reputed to be a witch and surrounded with an aura of witch-beliefs or [[Occultism]]

She identifies three varieties of witch in popular belief:&lt;ref name="Pocs" /&gt;
* The "neighbourhood witch" or "social witch": a witch who curses a neighbour following some conflict.
* The "magical" or "sorcerer" witch: either a professional healer, sorcerer, seer or midwife, or a person who has through magic increased her fortune to the perceived detriment of a neighbouring household; due to neighbourly or community rivalries and the ambiguity between positive and negative magic, such individuals can become labelled as witches.
* The "supernatural" or "night" witch: portrayed in court narratives as a demon appearing in visions and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Neighbourhood witches" are the product of neighbourhood tensions, and are found only in self-sufficient serf village communities where the inhabitants largely rely on each other. Such accusations follow the breaking of some social norm, such as the failure to return a borrowed item, and any person part of the normal social exchange could potentially fall under suspicion. Claims of "sorcerer" witches and "supernatural" witches could arise out of social tensions, but not exclusively; the supernatural witch in particular often had nothing to do with communal conflict, but expressed tensions between the human and supernatural worlds; and in Eastern and Southeastern Europe such supernatural witches became an ideology explaining calamities that befell entire communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pócs 1999 pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence related to accusations====
Belief in witchcraft continues to be present today in some societies and accusations of witchcraft are the trigger of serious forms of violence, including murder. Such incidents are common in places such as [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ghana]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tanzania]]. Accusations of witchcraft are sometimes linked to personal disputes, jealousy, and conflicts between neighbors or family over land or inheritance.

=== Contemporary witchcraft ===
{{Further information|Neoshamanism|Modern paganism}}
Modern practices identified by their practitioners as "witchcraft" have grown dramatically since the early 20th century. Generally portrayed as revivals of pre-Christian European [[ritual]] and [[spirituality]], they are understood to involve varying degrees of [[Magic (paranormal)#Varieties of magical practice|magic]], [[shamanism]], [[folk medicine]], [[spiritual healing]], calling on [[elemental]]s and [[spirit]]s, veneration of ancient [[Pantheon (religion)|deities]] and [[archetype]]s, and attunement with the forces of nature.

The first [[Neopagan]] groups to publicly appear, during the 1950s and 60s, were [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s [[Bricket Wood coven]] and [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Roy Bowers]]' [[Clan of Tubal Cain]]. They operated as [[initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society|secret societies]]. Other individual practitioners and writers such as [[Paul Huson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]] ''[[Mastering Witchcraft]]: a Practical Guide for Witches, Warlocks, and Covens'', New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed inheritance to surviving traditions of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton, Chas S., ''Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America'', Lanham, MD: Altamira, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7591-0202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wicca ====
{{Main article|Wicca}}
During the 20th century, interest in witchcraft in [[English language|English-speaking]] and European countries began to increase, inspired particularly by [[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of a [[Witch-cult hypothesis|pan-European witch-cult]] originally published in 1921, since discredited by further careful historical research.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Elliot, ''A Razor for a Goat'', [[University of Toronto Press]], 1962. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles'', [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, Mass.]]: [[Blackwell Publishers]], 1993. Hutton, Ronald, ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest was intensified, however, by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner's]] claim in 1954 in ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' that a form of witchcraft still existed in [[England]]. The truth of Gardner's claim is now disputed too, with different historians offering evidence for&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Wiccan Roots |isbn=978-1-86163-110-7|year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heselton |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Heselton |title=Gerald Gardner and the Cauldron of Inspiration |isbn=978-1-86163-164-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or against&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Aidan, ''Crafting the Art of Magic'', [[Llewellyn Worldwide|Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, ''Triumph of the Moon'', Oxford University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruickbie |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Ruickbie |title=Witchcraft Out of the Shadows |isbn=978-0-7090-7567-7|year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the religion's existence prior to Gardner.

The Wicca that Gardner initially taught was a witchcraft religion having a lot in common with Margaret Murray's hypothetically posited cult of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Margaret A., ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Murray wrote an introduction to Gardner's ''Witchcraft Today'', in effect putting her stamp of approval on it. Wicca is now practised as a religion of an [[Initiation|initiatory]] [[secret society]] nature with positive ethical principles, organised into autonomous [[coven]]s and led by a High Priesthood. There is also a large "Eclectic Wiccan" movement of individuals and groups who share key Wiccan beliefs but have no initiatory connection or affiliation with traditional Wicca. Wiccan writings and ritual show borrowings from a number of sources including 19th and 20th-century [[ceremonial magic]], the medieval grimoire known as the [[Key of Solomon]], [[Aleister Crowley]]'s [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and pre-Christian religions.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, R.,''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'', Oxford University Press, pp. 205–252, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, A.A., ''Crafting the Art of Magic, Book I: a History of Modern Witchcraft, 1939–1964'', Minnesota: [[Llewellyn Publications]], 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valiente, D., ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', London: Robert Hale, pp. 35–62, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men and women are equally termed "witches." They practice a form of [[Duotheism|duotheistic]] [[universalism]].

Since Gardner's death in 1964, the Wicca that he claimed he was initiated into has attracted many initiates, becoming the largest of the various witchcraft traditions in the Western world, and has influenced other Neopagan and occult movements.

=====Witchcraft, feminism, and media=====
Wiccan literature has been described as aiding the empowerment of young women through its lively portrayal of female protagonists. Part of the recent growth in Neo-Pagan religions has been attributed to the strong media presence of fictional works such as the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] and [[Harry Potter]] series with their depictions of witchcraft.&lt;ref name=tosenberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tosenberger|first=Catherine|title=Neo-Paganism for teens|url=http://jeunessejournal.ca/index.php/yptc/article/view/81/63|journal=Jeunesse: Young People, Texts, Cultures|volume=2.2|year=2010|pages=172–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread accessibility to related material through internet media such as chat rooms and forums is also thought to be driving this development. Wiccan beliefs are currently often found to be compatible with liberal ideals such as the [[Green movement]], and particularly with [[feminism]] by providing young women with means for empowerment and for control of their own lives.&lt;ref name=jarvis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=Christine|title=Becoming a woman through Wicca: Witches and wiccans in contemporary teen fiction|journal=Children's Literature in Education|volume=39|issue=1|year=2008|pages= 43–52|doi=10.1007/s10583-007-9058-0|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4140/2/CLE_Jarvis_Wicca_article_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=merskin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merskin|first=Debra|title=Joining Forces: Teen Girl Witches and Internet Chat Groups|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/1/3/0/p171306_index.html |journal=Proceedings of the International Communication Association|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the case particularly in North America due to the strong presence of feminist ideals.&lt;ref name=tosenberger/&gt; The 2002 study [[Enchanted Feminism|Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco]] suggests that Wiccan religion represents the second wave of feminism that has also been redefined as a religious movement.&lt;ref name=jarvis/&gt;

==== Stregheria ====
{{Main article|Stregheria}}
Stregheria is an [[Italy|Italian]] witchcraft religion popularised in the 1980s by [[Raven Grimassi]], who claims that it evolved within the ancient [[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan religion]] of Italian peasants who worked under the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] upper classes.

Modern Stregheria closely resembles [[Charles Leland]]'s controversial late-19th-century account of a surviving Italian religion of witchcraft, worshipping the Goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], her brother [[Dianus]]/[[Lucifer]], and their daughter [[Aradia]]. Leland's witches do not see Lucifer as the evil [[Satan]] that Christians see, but a benevolent god of the Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|first1=Shelley|last1=Rabinovitch|first2=James|last2=Lewis|year=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual format of contemporary Stregheria is roughly similar to that of other Neopagan witchcraft religions such as [[Wicca]]. The [[pentagram]] is the most common symbol of religious identity. Most followers celebrate a series of eight festivals equivalent to the Wiccan [[Wheel of the Year]], though others follow the ancient Roman festivals. An emphasis is placed on [[ancestor worship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stregheria.com/FAQ.html|website=Stregheria.com|title=Stregheria.com FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional witchcraft ====
{{Main article|Traditional witchcraft}}
Traditional witchcraft is a term used to refer to a variety of contemporary forms of witchcraft. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described it as "a broad movement of aligned magico-religious groups who reject any relation to Gardnerianism and the wider Wiccan movement, claiming older, more "traditional" roots. Although typically united by a shared aesthetic rooted in European folklore, the Traditional Craft contains within its ranks a rich and varied array of occult groups, from those who follow a contemporary Pagan path that is suspiciously similar to Wicca to those who adhere to [[Luciferianism]]".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}} According to British Traditional Witch Michael Howard, the term refers to "any non-Gardnerian, non-Alexandrian, non-Wiccan or pre-modern form of the Craft, especially if it has been inspired by historical forms of witchcraft and folk magic".&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition was offered by Daniel A. Schulke, the current Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, when he proclaimed that ''traditional witchcraft'' "refers to a coterie of initiatory lineages of ritual magic, spellcraft and devotional mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sch06|Schulke 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of traditional witchcraft are the [[Feri Tradition]], [[Cochrane's Craft]] and the Sabbatic craft.&lt;ref&gt;[[#How11|Howard 2011]]. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary witchcraft, Satanism and Luciferianism ===
{{main article|Satanism|Satanism and Witchcraft}}
[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|[[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi's]] Sabbatic goat (known as The Goat of Mendes or [[Baphomet]]) is one of Satanism's most common symbols.]]

[[Satanism]] is a broad term referring to diverse beliefs that share a symbolic association with, or admiration for, [[Satan]], who is seen as a liberating figure. While it is heir to the same historical period and pre-Enlightenment beliefs that gave rise to modern witchcraft, it is generally seen as completely separate from modern witchcraft and Wicca, and has little or no connection to them.

Modern witchcraft considers Satanism to be the "dark side of Christianity" rather than a branch of Wicca: – the character of Satan referenced in Satanism exists only in the theology of the three Abrahamic religions, and Satanism arose as, and occupies the role of, a rebellious counterpart to Christianity, in which all is permitted and the self is central. (Christianity can be characterized as having the diametrically opposite views to these.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokyhole.org/wicca/satvnp.htm|title=Satanism vs. Neo-Pagan Witchcraft|work=holysmoke.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beliefs become more visibly expressed in Europe after the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], when works such as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' were described anew by [[Romanticism|romantics]] who suggested that they presented the biblical Satan as an [[allegory]] representing crisis of faith, [[individualism]], [[free will]], [[wisdom]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]; a few works from that time also begin to directly present Satan in a less negative light, such as ''[[Letters from the Earth]]''. The two major trends are [[theistic Satanism]] and [[Satanism#Atheistic Satanism|atheistic Satanism]]; the former venerates Satan as a supernatural [[patriarchal]] [[deity]], while the latter views Satan as merely a symbolic embodiment of certain human traits.&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry Interview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmore|first=Peter|title=Science and Satanism|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/|work=Point of Inquiry Interview|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized groups began to emerge in the mid 20th century, including the [[Ophite Cultus Satanas]] (1948)&lt;ref name=JamesRLewis&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1573922227|page=553|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lk8_ARNz-dYC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;lpg=PA553&amp;dq=Ophite+Cultus+Satanas+arthur+sloane#v=onepage&amp;q=Ophite%20Cultus%20Satanas%20arthur%20sloane&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Satan]] (1966).  After seeing [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''The God of the Witches'' the leader of Ophite Cultus Satanas, Herbert Arthur Sloane, said he realized that the horned god was Satan (''Sathanas''). Sloane also corresponded with his contemporary [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], founder of the Wicca religion, and implied that his views of Satan and the horned god were not necessarily in conflict with Gardner's approach. However, he did believe that, while "gnosis" referred to knowledge, and "[[Wicca]]" referred to wisdom, modern witches had fallen away from the true knowledge, and instead had begun worshipping a [[fertility god]], a reflection of the creator god. He wrote that "the largest existing body of witches who are true Satanists would be the [[Yezedees]]". Sloane highly recommended the book ''The Gnostic Religion'', and sections of it were sometimes read at ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Magic, Satanism, Voodoo'', by Dr. Leo L. Martello, 1972 (Interview with Sloane on pp. 31–34, ''Our Lord Sathanas'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that there were up to 100,000 Satanists worldwide by 2006, twice the number estimated in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/satanism.htm|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=March 2006|title=Religious Satanism, 16th century Satanism, Satanic Dabbling, etc|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|author=B.A. Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satanistic beliefs have been largely permitted as a valid expression of religious belief in the West. For example, they were allowed in the [[British Royal Navy]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/10/24/uk.devilworship/index.html Royal Navy to allow devil worship] ''[[CNN]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Helen.

[[Luciferianism]], on the other hand, is a belief system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altreligion.about.com/od/alternativereligionsaz/a/How-Luciferians-Differ-From-Satanists.htm|title=How Luciferians Differ From Satanists|author=Catherine Beyer|work=[[About.com]] Religion &amp; Spirituality|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not revere the [[devil]] figure or most characteristics typically affixed to [[Satan]].

[[Madeline Montalban]] was an English witch who adhered to a specific form of luciferianism which revolved around the veneration of Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom she considered to be a benevolent angelic being who had aided humanity's development. Within her Order, she emphasised that her followers discover their own personal relationship with the angelic beings, including Lumiel.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=26, 85–86}} Although initially seeming favourable to Gerald Gardner, by the mid-1960s she had become hostile towards him and his Gardnerian tradition, considering him to be "a 'dirty old man' and sexual pervert."{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2010|1p=7|2a1=Philips|2y=2012|2p=69}} She also expressed hostility to another prominent Pagan Witch of the period, [[Charles Cardell]], although in the 1960s became friends with the two Witches at the forefront of the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n tradition, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] and his wife, [[Maxine Sanders]], who adopted some of her Luciferian angelic practices.{{sfn|Philips|2012|pp=69–70}} In contemporary times luciferian witches exist within traditional witchcraft.{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|pp=205–206}}

== Historical and religious perspectives ==
===Near East beliefs===
The belief in sorcery and its practice seem to have been widespread in the [[Ancient Near East]] and [[Nile Valley]]. It played a conspicuous role in the cultures of [[ancient Egypt]] and in [[Babylonia]]. The latter tradition included an [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] anti-witchcraft ritual, the [[Maqlû]]. A section from the [[Code of Hammurabi]] (about 2000 B.C.) prescribes:

{{quote|If a man has put a spell upon another man and it is not justified, he upon whom the spell is laid shall go to the holy river; into the holy river shall he plunge. If the holy river overcome him and he is drowned, the man who put the spell upon him shall take possession of his house. If the holy river declares him innocent and he remains unharmed the man who laid the spell shall be put to death. He that plunged into the river shall take possession of the house of him who laid the spell upon him.&lt;ref&gt;''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' [http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WITCH%3B+WITCHCRAFT/ article on Witchcraft], last accessed 31 March 2006. There is some discrepancy between translations; compare with that given in the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm article on Witchcraft] (accessed 31 March 2006), and the [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/hamframe.htm L.

===Abrahamic religions===
==== Hebrew Bible ====
{{Main article|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
According to the New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia: {{quote|In the Holy Scripture references to sorcery are frequent, and the strong condemnations of such practices found there do not seem to be based so much upon the supposition of [[fraud]] as upon the abomination of the magic in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15674a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Witchcraft |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1912-10-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Wickiana3.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of alleged witches in Central Europe, 1587]]
The [[King James Version]] uses the words "witch", "witchcraft", and "witchcrafts" to translate the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} ''kāsháf'' ({{IPA-he|kɔˈʃaf}}) and {{hebrew|קֶסֶם}} (''qésem'');&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Nahum|3:4|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|15:23|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|33:6|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|9:22|}}; {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:10|}}; {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}}&lt;/ref&gt; these same English terms are used to translate {{lang|grc|φαρμακεία}} ''pharmakeia'' in the [[Greek New Testament]]. Verses such as {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:11–12|}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|22:18|}} ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live") thus provided scriptural justification for Christian [[witch-hunt|witch hunters]] in the [[early modern period]] (see [[Christian views on magic]]).

The precise meaning of the Hebrew {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, usually translated as "witch" or "sorceress", is uncertain. In the [[Septuagint]], it was translated as ''pharmakeía'' or ''pharmakous''. In the 16th century, [[Reginald Scot]], a prominent critic of the witch trials, translated {{Hebrew|כָּשַׁף}}, φαρμακεία, and the [[Vulgate]]'s [[Latin]] equivalent ''veneficos'' as all meaning "poisoner", and on this basis, claimed that "witch" was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.&lt;ref&gt;Scot, Reginald (c. 1580) ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' Booke VI Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory still holds some currency, but is not widely accepted, and in {{bibleverse||Daniel|2:2|}} {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} is listed alongside other magic practitioners who could interpret dreams: magicians, astrologers, and Chaldeans. Suggested derivations of {{hebrew|כָּשַׁף}} include "mutterer" (from a single root) or ''herb user'' (as a compound word formed from the roots ''kash'', meaning "herb", and ''hapaleh'', meaning "using"). The Greek φαρμακεία literally means "herbalist" or one who uses or administers drugs, but it was used virtually synonymously with ''[[Magic (paranormal)|mageia]]'' and ''[[Goetia|goeteia]]'' as a term for a sorcerer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dickie |first=Matthew |title=Magic and Magicians in the Greco-Roman World |pages=33–35 |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-24982-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible provides some evidence that these commandments against sorcery were enforced under the Hebrew kings:
{{quote|And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I [[prithee|pray thee]], divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Note that the Hebrew word {{hebrew|אֹב}} ''ob'', translated as ''familiar spirit'' in the above quotation, has a different meaning than the usual English sense of the phrase; namely, it refers to a spirit that the woman is familiar with, rather than to [[familiar spirit|a spirit that physically manifests itself in the shape of an animal]].

==== New Testament ====
{{See also|Christian views on magic}}
The [[New Testament]] condemns the practice as an abomination, just as the Old Testament had ([[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 5:20, compared with [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:8; 22:15; and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 8:9; 13:6). The word in most New Testament translations is "sorcerer"/"sorcery" rather than "witch"/"witchcraft".

==== Judaism ====
{{See also|Witchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible}}
[[Halakha|Jewish law]] views the practice of witchcraft as being laden with [[idolatry]] and/or [[necromancy]]; both being serious theological and practical offenses in [[Judaism]]. Although [[Maimonides]] vigorously denied the efficacy of all methods of witchcraft, and claimed that the Biblical prohibitions regarding it were precisely to wean the Israelites from practices related to [[idolatry]]. It is acknowledged that while magic exists, it is forbidden to practice it on the basis that it usually involves the worship of other gods. [[Rabbi]]s of the Talmud also condemned magic when it produced something other than illusion, giving the example of two men who use magic to pick cucumbers (Sanhedrin 67a). The one who creates the illusion of picking cucumbers should not be condemned, only the one who actually picks the cucumbers through magic.

However, some of the rabbis practiced "magic" themselves or taught the subject. For instance, [[Rabbah]] created a person and sent him to [[Rav Zeira]], and [[Hanina]] and [[Hoshaiah]] studied every Friday together and created a small calf to eat on [[Shabbat]] (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the "magic" was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from [[God]] rather than "unclean" forces) than as witchcraft.

Judaism does make it clear that Jews shall not try to learn about the ways of witches ([[Book of Deuteronomy]] 18: 9–10) and that witches are to be put to death ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 22:17).

Judaism's most famous reference to a medium is undoubtedly the [[Witch of Endor]] whom [[Saul]] consults, as recounted in [[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 28.

==== Islam ====
Divination, and [[Magic (paranormal)#In Islam|magic]] in Islam, encompass a wide range of practices, including [[black magic]], warding off the [[evil eye]], the production of [[amulet]]s and other magical equipment, [[evocation]], [[cleromancy|casting lots]], and [[astrology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-lZ3QgAACAAJ|title=Magic and Divination in Early Islam|last=Savage-Smith|first=Emilie|date=2004|publisher=Ashgate/Variorum|isbn=9780860787150|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims do commonly believe in magic (''sihr'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_DUM_2460 “Magic”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P.

{{quote|Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn From the mischief of created things; From the mischief of Darkness as it overspreads; From the mischief of those who practise secret arts; And from the mischief of the envious one as he practises envy. (Qur'an 113:1–5)}}

Also according to the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Routledge|others=Leaman, Oliver, 1950-, Credo Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781780343686|location=Abingdon, Oxon [England]|pages=381|oclc=764567609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And they follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind sorcery and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut&amp;nbsp;... And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew. (Qur'an 2:102)
}}

Islam distinguishes between God-given gifts, which can heal sickness, and [[Demonic possession#Islam|possession]], and sorcery. Good supernatural powers are therefore a ''special gift from [[God in Islam|God]]'', whereas sorcery or black magic is achieved through help of [[jinn]] and [[Shaitan|demons]]. In the Qurʾānic narrative, the [[Solomon in Islam|Prophet Sulayman]] had the power to speak with animals and command jinn, and he thanks God for this نعمة (i.e. gift, privilege, favour, bounty), which is only given to him with God’s permission.{{Cite Quran|27|19}}&lt;ref&gt;''Tafsir Ibn Kathir'' for surah 21, verse 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]] was accused of being a magician by his opponents.{{Cite Quran|10|2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1374|title=Magic - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common belief that jinn can possess a human,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic masculinities|last=Ouzgane|first=Lahoucine|date=2006|publisher=[[Zed Books]]|isbn=9781848131514|location=London, UK|pages=89|oclc=654873315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-20357997|title=British Asians turn to exorcists|last=Nye|first=Catrin|date=2012-11-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus requiring [[Exorcism#Exorcism in Islam|exorcism]] (''ruqya'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dentist-stabbed-faith-healer-death-7789872|title='Possessed' dentist stabbed faith healer to death at black magic centre|last=fox|first=aine|date=2016-04-19|work=mirror|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Prophet's ''[[sunnah]]'' to cast off the jinn or devils from the body of the possessed. The practice of seeking help from the jinn is prohibited and can lead to possession. The ''ruqya'' contains verses of the Qur'an as well as prayers specifically targeted against demons. The knowledge of which verses of the Qur'an to use in what way is what is considered "magic knowledge."{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded in {{hadith-usc|bukhari|8|76|479}} states: "Seventy thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without accounts, and they are those who do not practice Ar-Ruqya and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in their Lord." [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya]], a [[Islamic scholar|scholar]], commented on this ''hadith'', stating: That is because these people will enter Paradise without being called to account because of the perfection of their Tawheed, therefore he described them as people who did not ask others to perform ruqyah for them. Hence he said "and they put their trust in their Lord." Because of their complete trust in their Lord, their contentment with Him, their faith in Him, their being pleased with Him and their seeking their needs from Him, they do not ask people for anything, be it ruqyah or anything else, and they are not influenced by omens and superstitions that could prevent them from doing what they want to do, because superstition detracts from and weakens Tawheed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zad al-Ma'ad|last=al-Jawziyya|first=Ibn Qayyim|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1/475|trans-title=Provisions of the Hereafter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students of the history of religion have linked several magical practises in Islam with pre-Islamic Turkish and East African customs.

In Southern African traditions, there are three classifications of somebody who uses magic. The ''[[tagati]]'' is usually improperly translated into English as "witch", and is a spiteful person who operates in secret to harm others. The ''[[sangoma]]'' is a diviner, somewhere on a par with a [[fortune teller]], and is employed in detecting illness, predicting a person's future (or advising them on which path to take), or identifying the guilty party in a crime. She also practices some degree of medicine. The ''inyanga'' is often translated as "witch doctor" (though many Southern Africans resent this implication, as it perpetuates the mistaken belief that a "witch doctor" is in some sense a ''practitioner'' of malicious magic). The ''inyanga''{{'}}s job is to heal illness and injury and provide customers with magical items for everyday use. Of these three categories the ''tagati'' is almost exclusively female, the ''sangoma'' is usually female, and the ''inyanga'' is almost exclusively male.

Much of what witchcraft represents in Africa has been susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks in no small part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited [[Margaret Murray]] to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja|first=Uchenna|title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and should be understood through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.

Complimentary remarks about witchcraft by a native Congolese initiate: "From witchcraft ... may be developed the remedy (''kimbuki'') that will do most to raise up our country."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.12).&lt;/ref&gt; "Witchcraft ... deserves respect ... it can embellish or redeem (''ketula evo vuukisa'')."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 54b (13.9.14).&lt;/ref&gt; "The ancestors were equipped with the protective witchcraft of the clan (''kindoki kiandundila kanda''). ... They could also gather the power of animals into their hands ... whenever they needed. ... If we could make use of these kinds of witchcraft, our country would rapidly progress in knowledge of every kind."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, pp. 54b-55a (13.9.16).&lt;/ref&gt; "You witches (''zindoki'') too, bring your science into the light to be written down so that ... the benefits in it ... endow our race."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; MacGaffey 1974, p. 55b (13.10.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cameroon ====

In eastern Cameroon, the term used for witchcraft among the [[Maka people|Maka]] is ''djambe''&lt;ref&gt;Geschiere, Peter; "''The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa''" (1997) University of Virginia Press. {{ISBN|0-8139-1703-4}} (paperback). Translated by Geschiere, Peter &amp; Roitman, Janet from the originally published in French: "''Sorcellerie et politique en Afrique – La viande des autres''" (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to a force inside a person; its powers may make the proprietor more vulnerable. It encompasses the occult, the transformative, killing and healing.&lt;ref&gt;''idem'' (Geschiere, 1997, p.13)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central Africa ====
In some [[Central Africa]]n areas, malicious magic users are believed by locals to be the source of [[terminal illness]] such as [[AIDS]] and [[cancer]]. In such cases, various methods are used to rid the person from the bewitching spirit, occasionally [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]]. Children may be accused of being witches, for example a young niece may be blamed for the illness of a relative. Most of these cases of abuse go unreported since the members of the society that witness such abuse are too afraid of being accused of being accomplices. It is also believed that witchcraft can be transmitted to children by feeding. Parents discourage their children from interacting with people believed to be witches.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Every year, hundreds of people in the [[Central African Republic]] are convicted of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312100813/http://blogs.reuters.com/africanews/2010/02/04/the-dangers-of-witchcraft/ |archivedate=2010-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-balaka|Christian militias]] in the Central African Republic have also kidnapped, burnt and buried alive women accused of being 'witches' in public ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Esslemont 2015"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Esslemont | first=Tom | title=Witch burning rebels stoke Central African Republic violence | newspaper=Reuters | date=26 November 2015 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-centralafrica-witchcraft/witch-burning-rebels-stoke-central-african-republic-violence-idUSKBN0TF03920151126 | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Democratic Republic of the Congo ====
{{As of|2006}}, between 25,000 and 50,000 children in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], had been accused of witchcraft and thrown out of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Dowden in Kinshasa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/12/theobserver.worldnews11 |title=Thousands of child 'witches' turned on to the streets to starve &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have been subjected to often-violent abuse during [[exorcism]]s, sometimes supervised by self-styled religious pastors. Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/september/27.62.html|title=Kolwezi: Accused of witchcraft by parents and churches, children in the Democratic Republic of Congo are being rescued by Christian activists|website=Christianity Today|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual term for these children is ''enfants sorciers'' (child witches) or ''enfants dits sorciers'' (children accused of witchcraft). In 2002, [[USAID]] funded the production of two short films on the subject, made in Kinshasa by journalists Angela Nicoara and Mike Ormsby.

In April 2008, in Kinshasa, the police arrested 14 suspected victims (of [[penis snatching]]) and [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] accused of using black magic or witchcraft to steal (make disappear) or shrink men's penises to extort cash for cure, amid a wave of panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bavier |first=Joe |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN2319603620080423?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |title=Penis theft panic hits city.. |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one study, the belief in magical warfare technologies (such as "bulletproofing") in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo serves a group-level function, as it increases group efficiency in warfare, even if it is suboptimal at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nunn |first=Nathan |authorlink=Nathan Nunn |last2=Sierra |first2=Raul Sanchez de la |date=2017 |title=Why Being Wrong can be Right: Magical Warfare Technologies and the Persistence of False Beliefs |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=582–87 |doi=10.1257/aer.p20171091 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the study argue that this is one reason why the belief in witchcraft persists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Ghana ====
In [[Ghana]], women are often accused of witchcraft and attacked by neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108050152/http://graphic.com.gh/dailygraphic/page.php?news=10405 |archivedate=2011-01-08 |title=My Mum is Not A Witch |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, there exist six [[witch camp]]s in the country where women suspected of being witches can flee for safety.&lt;ref name="Camps"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19437130 | title=Ghana witch camps: Widows' lives in exile | publisher=BBC | accessdate=September 1, 2012| work=BBC News | date=September 2012 | last1=Whitaker | first1=Kati }}&lt;/ref&gt; The witch camps, which exist solely in Ghana, are thought to house a total of around 1000 women.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; Some of the camps are thought to have been set up over 100 years ago.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt; The Ghanaian government has announced that it intends to close the camps.&lt;ref name="Camps"/&gt;

Arrests were made in an effort to avoid bloodshed seen in [[Ghana]] a decade ago, when 12 alleged penis snatchers were beaten to death by mobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9701/18/briefs/ghana.penis.html ''7 killed in Ghana over 'penis-snatching' episodes''], CNN, January 18, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is easy for modern people to dismiss such reports, Uchenna Okeja argues that a belief system in which such magical practices are deemed possible offer many benefits to Africans who hold them. For example, the belief that a sorcerer has "stolen" a man's penis functions as an anxiety-reduction mechanism for men suffering from impotence while simultaneously providing an explanation that is consistent with African cultural beliefs rather than appealing to Western scientific notions that are tainted by the history of colonialism (at least for many Africans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Okeja |first=Uchenna |title="An African Context of the Belief in Witchcraft and Magic," in Rational Magic|date=2011|publisher=Fisher Imprints|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84888-061-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on May 21, 2008 that in [[Kenya]], a mob had burnt to death at least 11 people accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL21301127 |title=Mob burns to death 11 Kenyan "witches" |newspaper=Reuters |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malawi ====
In [[Malawi]] it is also common practice to accuse children of witchcraft and many children have been abandoned, abused and even killed as a result. As in other African countries both African traditional healers and their Christian counterparts are trying to make a living out of exorcising children and are actively involved in pointing out children as witches.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Carrie 2011. Hunting the vulnerable: Witchcraft and the law in Malawi; Consultancy Africa Intelligence (16 June):&lt;/ref&gt; Various secular and Christian organizations are combining their efforts to address this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meer, Erwin 2011. The Problem of Witchcraft in Malawi, Evangelical Missions Quarterly (47:1, January): 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[William Kamkwamba]], witches and wizards are afraid of money, which they consider a rival evil. Any contact with [[cash]] will snap their spell and leave the wizard naked and confused. So placing cash, such as [[Malawian kwacha|kwacha]] around a room or bed mat will protect the resident from their malevolent spells.&lt;ref&gt;Kamkwamba, William. The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind. Harper Collins. 2009. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nigeria ====
In [[Nigeria]], several Pentecostal pastors have mixed their evangelical brand of Christianity with African beliefs in witchcraft to benefit from the lucrative witch finding and exorcism business—which in the past was the exclusive domain of the so-called witch doctor or traditional healers. These pastors have been involved in the torturing and even killing of children accused of witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humantrafficking.org/publications/593|title=Stepping Stones Nigeria 2007. Supporting Victims of Witchcraft Abuse and Street Children in Nigeria|website=humantrafficking.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017185346/http://humantrafficking.org/publications/593|archivedate=2012-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade, around 15,000 children have been accused, and around 1,000 murdered. Churches are very numerous in Nigeria, and competition for congregations is hard. Some pastors attempt to establish a reputation for spiritual power by "detecting" child witches, usually following a death or loss of a job within a family, or an accusation of financial fraud against the pastor. In the course of "exorcisms", accused children may be starved, beaten, mutilated, set on fire, forced to consume acid or cement, or buried alive. While some church leaders and Christian activists have spoken out strongly against these abuses, many Nigerian churches are involved in the abuse, although church administrations deny knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;Houreld, Katharine (2009) [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/church-burns-witchcraft-children/story-e6frev00-1225788721635 Church burns 'witchcraft' children]. Associated Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
Among the Mende (of [[Sierra Leone]]), trial and conviction for witchcraft has a beneficial effect for those convicted. "The witchfinder had warned the whole village to ensure the relative prosperity of the accused and sentenced ... old people. ... Six months later all of the people ... accused, were secure, well-fed and arguably happier than at any [previous] time; they had hardly to beckon and people would come with food or whatever was needful. ... Instead of such old and widowed people being left helpless or (as in Western society) institutionalized in old people's homes, these were reintegrated into society and left secure in their old age ... . ... Old people are 'suitable' candidates for this kind of accusation in the sense that they are isolated and vulnerable, and they are 'suitable' candidates for 'social security' for precisely the same reasons."&lt;ref&gt;Gittins 1987, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caribbean ====

Brua is an Afro-Caribbean religion and healing tradition that originates in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao, in the Dutch Caribbean. A healer in this culture is called a ''kurioso'' or ''kuradó'', a man or woman who performs ''trabou chikí'' (little works) and ''trabou grandi'' (large treatments) to promote or restore health, bring fortune or misfortune, deal with unrequited love, and more serious concerns, in which sorcery is involved. Sorcery usually involves reference to the ''almasola'' or ''homber chiki'', a devil-like entity. ''Transcultural Psychiatry'' published a paper called "Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua" by Jan Dirk Blom, Igmar T. Poulina, Trevor L. van Gellecum and Hans W. Hoek of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016204|title=Traditional healing practices originating in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao: A review of the literature on psychiatry and Brua|first1=Jan Dirk|last1=Blom|first2=Igmar|last2=T.

[[File:Matteson Examination of a Witch.jpg|thumb|''Examination of a Witch'' by [[T. H. Matteson]], inspired by the [[Salem witch trials]]]]
In 1645, [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but sentenced to be hanged for the death of her child. She died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html |title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents |publisher=Masslive.com |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1645–1663, about eighty people throughout England's [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts Bay Colony]] were accused of practicing witchcraft. Thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that lasted throughout [[New England]] from 1645–1663.&lt;ref name=Fraden&gt;Fraden, Judith Bloom, Dennis Brindell Fraden. ''The Salem Witch Trials''. Marshall Cavendish. 2008. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salem witch trials]] followed in 1692–93. These witch trials were the most famous in [[British North America]] and took place in the coastal settlements near [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. Prior to the witch trials, nearly 300 men and women had been suspected of partaking in witchcraft, and 19 of these people were hanged, and one was “pressed to death”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America: A Narrative History|year=2013|publisher=W.W.

Retrieved 10/3/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salem witch trials were a series of hearings before local magistrates followed by county court trials to prosecute people accused of witchcraft in [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex]], [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] Counties of colonial Massachusetts, between February 1692 and May 1693. Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned, with even more accused who were not formally pursued by the authorities. The two courts convicted 29 people of the capital felony of witchcraft. Nineteen of the accused, 14 women and 5 men, were hanged. [[Giles Corey|One man]] who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so. At least five more of the accused died in prison.

Despite being generally known as the "Salem" witch trials, the preliminary hearings in 1692 were conducted in a variety of towns across the province: Salem Village (now [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]), [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem Town]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], and [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]]. The best known trials were conducted by the Court of [[Oyer and Terminer]] in 1692 in Salem Town.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education|title=Salem Witch Museum|website=www.salemwitchmuseum.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 26 who went to trial before this court were convicted. The four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem Town, but also in Ipswich, Boston, and Charlestown, produced only 3 convictions in the 31 witchcraft trials it conducted. Likewise, alleged witchcraft was not isolated to New England. In 1706 [[Grace Sherwood]] the "Witch of Pungo" was imprisoned for the crime in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia]].

In Maryland, there is a legend of Moll Dyer, who escaped a fire set by fellow colonists only to die of exposure in December&amp;nbsp;1697. The historical record of Dyer is scant as all official records were burned in a courthouse fire, though the county courthouse has on display the rock where her frozen body was found. A letter from a colonist of the period describes her in most unfavourable terms. A local road is named after Dyer, where her homestead was said to have been. Many local families have their own version of the Moll Dyer affair, and her name is spoken with care in the rural southern counties.&lt;ref&gt;David W. Thompson, "Sister Witch: The Life of Moll Dyer" (2017 Solstice Publishing) {{ISBN|978-1973105756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diné / Navajo ====
In [[Navajo people|Diné culture]], witches are seen as the polar opposite of [[medicine man|ceremonial people]]. While spiritual leaders perform "[[Navajo song ceremonial complex|sings]]" for healing, protection and other beneficial purposes, all practices referred to as "witchcraft" are intended to hurt and curse. Witches are associated with harm to the community and transgression of societal standards, especially those relating to family and the dead.

The ''yee naaldlooshii'' is the type of witch known in English as a "[[skin-walker]]". They are believed to take the forms of animals in order to travel in secret and do harm to the innocent.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;Wall, Leon and William Morgan, ''Navajo-English Dictionary''. Hippocrene Books, New York City, 1998 {{ISBN|0-7818-0247-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Navajo language]], ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' translates to "with it, he goes on all fours".&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;  While perhaps the most common variety seen in horror fiction by non-Navajo people, the ''{{lang|nv|yee naaldlooshii}}'' is one of several varieties of Navajo witch, specifically a type of  ''{{lang|nv|’ánti’įhnii}}''.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Corpse powder or corpse poison ({{lang-nv|{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}}}, literally "witchery" or "harming") is a substance made from powdered corpses.  The powder is used by witches to curse their victims.&lt;ref name="PerroneStockel1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perrone|first1=Bobette|last2=Stockel|first2=H. Henrietta|last3=Krueger|first3=Victoria|title=Medicine women, curanderas, and women doctors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApJayEh43ZcC&amp;pg=PA189|accessdate=8 October 2010|date=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2512-1|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of the ''{{spell-nv|áńt’į́}}'' is a curse and disease, usually indicated by an immediate action to administration of the poison, like fainting, swelling of the tongue, or [[Trismus|lockjaw]]. Sometimes, however, the victims simply [[wasting|wastes away]], as from a normal disease.

Traditional Navajos usually hesitate to discuss things like witches and witchcraft with non-Navajos.&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;Keene, Dr. Adrienne, "[http://nativeappropriations.com/2016/03/magic-in-north-america-part-1-ugh.html Magic in North America Part 1: Ugh.]" at ''[[Native Appropriations]]'', 8 March 2016. Accessed 9 April 2016: "What happens when Rowling pulls this in, is we as Native people are now opened up to a barrage of questions about these beliefs and traditions ... but these are not things that need or should be discussed by outsiders. At all. I’m sorry if that seems "unfair," but that's how our cultures survive."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== North America (Mexico) ====
{{See also|Brujería}}
Witchcraft was also an important part of the social and cultural history of late-Colonial Mexico, during the [[Mexican Inquisition]]. Spanish Inquisitors viewed witchcraft as a problem that could be cured simply through confession. Yet, as anthropologist [[Ruth Behar]] writes, witchcraft, not only in Mexico but in Latin America in general, was a "conjecture of sexuality, witchcraft, and religion, in which Spanish, indigenous, and African cultures converged."&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Ruth. ''Sex and Sin, Witchcraft and the Devil in Late-Colonial Mexico.'' American Ethnologist, 14:1 (February 1987), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, witchcraft in Mexico generally required an interethnic and interclass network of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Lavrin, Asunción. ''Sexuality &amp; Marriage in Colonial Latin America.'' Reprint ed. Lincoln, NB.:University of Nebraska Press, 1992, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to anthropology professor Laura Lewis, witchcraft in colonial Mexico ultimately represented an "affirmation of hegemony" for women, Indians, and especially Indian women over their white male counterparts as a result of the [[casta]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Laura A. ''Hall of mirrors: power, witchcraft, and caste in colonial Mexico.'' Durham, N.C.:Duke University Press, 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, notoriety has been awarded to a place called [[Catemaco#The "witches" of Catemaco|Catemaco]], in the state of Veracruz, which has a history of witchcraft, and where the practice of witchcraft by contemporary ''brujos'' and ''brujas'' thrives.

In Mexico City, people who practice brujería, [[Santería]], voodoo, ocultism and magic may find items, herbs and supplies at the ''[[mercado de Sonora]]''.

==== South America ====
In [[Chile]] there is a tradition of the [[Kalku]] in [[Mapuche religion]]; and the [[Warlock of Chiloé|Warlocks of Chiloé]] in the folklore and [[Chilote mythology]].

The presence of the witch is a constant in the [[ethnographic]] [[history]] of [[colonial Brazil]], especially during the several denunciations and confessions given to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] of [[Bahia]] (1591–1593), [[Pernambuco]] and [[Paraíba]] (1593–1595).&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} João Ribeiro Júnior, ''O Que é Magia'', p.48-49, Ed.

Apart from other types of [[Violence against women]] in [[Nepal]], the malpractice of abusing women in the name of witchcraft is also really prominent.

==== Japan ====
[[File:Okabe - The cat witch.jpg|thumb|Okabe – The cat witch, by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]]]]

In Japanese folklore, the most common types of witch can be separated into two categories: those who employ [[snake]]s as familiars, and those who employ foxes.&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen. The Catalpa Bow : A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan. New York: Routledge Curzon, 1999. 51–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fox witch is, by far, the most commonly seen witch figure in Japan. Differing regional beliefs set those who use foxes into two separate types: the ''kitsune-mochi'', and the ''tsukimono-suji''. The first of these, the ''kitsune-mochi'', is a solitary figure who gains his fox familiar by bribing it with its favourite foods. The ''kitsune-mochi'' then strikes up a deal with the fox, typically promising food and daily care in return for the fox's magical services. The fox of Japanese folklore is a powerful trickster in and of itself, imbued with powers of shape changing, possession, and illusion. These creatures can be either nefarious; disguising themselves as women in order to trap men, or they can be benign forces as in the story of "The Grateful foxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academia.issendai.com/foxtales/japan-grateful-foxes.shtml |title=The Grateful Foxes – Japanese foxtales |publisher=Academia.issendai.com |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once a fox enters the employ of a human it almost exclusively becomes a force of evil to be feared. A fox under the employ of a human can provide many services. The fox can turn invisible and find secrets its master desires. It can apply its many powers of illusion to trick and deceive its master's enemies. The most feared power of the ''kitsune-mochi'' is the ability to command his fox to possess other humans. This process of possession is called [[Kitsunetsuki]].

By far, the most commonly reported cases of fox witchcraft in modern Japan are enacted by ''tsukimono-suji'' families, or "hereditary witches".&lt;ref&gt;Blacker, Carmen ''Catalpa Bow'' p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tsukimono-suji'' is traditionally a family who is reported to have foxes under their employ. These foxes serve the family and are passed down through the generations, typically through the female line. ''Tsukimono-suji'' foxes are able to supply much in the way of the same mystical aid that the foxes under the employ of a ''kitsune-mochi'' can provide its more solitary master with. In addition to these powers, if the foxes are kept happy and well taken care of, they bring great fortune and prosperity to the ''Tsukimono-suji'' house. However, the aid in which these foxes give is often overshadowed by the social and mystical implications of being a member of such a family. In many villages, the status of local families as ''tsukimono-suji'' is often common, everyday knowledge. Such families are respected and feared, but are also openly shunned. Due to its hereditary nature, the status of being ''Tsukimono-suji'' is considered contagious. Because of this, it is often impossible for members of such a family to sell land or other properties, due to fear that the possession of such items will cause foxes to inundate one's own home. In addition to this, because the foxes are believed to be passed down through the female line, it is often nearly impossible for women of such families to find a husband whose family will agree to have him married to a ''tsukimono-suji'' family. In such a union the woman's status as a ''Tsukimono-suji'' would transfer to any man who married her.

==== Philippines ====
Witchcraft in [[the Philippines]] is often classified as malevolent, with practitioners of black magic called ''[[Mangkukulam]]'' in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and ''[[Mambabarang]]'' in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]; there are also practitioners of benevolent, white magic, in addition to some who practise both. ''Mambabarang'' in particular are noted for their ability to command insects and other invertebrates to accomplish a task, such as delivering a curse to a target.

Magic and witchcraft in the Philippines varies considerably across the different [[Ethnic groups of the Philippines|ethnic groups]], and is commonly a modern manifestation of [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|pre-Colonial]] spirituality interwoven with [[Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] religious elements such as the invocation of [[saints]] and the use of [[pseudo-Latin]] prayers (''oración'') in spells, and ''[[anting-anting]]'' (amulets).

Practitioners of traditional herbal-based medicine and divination called ''[[albularyo]]'' are not considered witches. They are perceived to be either quack doctors or a quasi-magical option when western medicine fails to identify or cure an ailment that is thus suspected to be of supernatural, often malevolent, origin. [[Feng shui]], an influence of [[Filipino Chinese]] culture, is also not classified as witchcraft as it is considered a separate realm of belief altogether.

While sorcery attempts to produce negative supernatural effects through formulas and rituals, heresy is the Christian contribution to witchcraft in which an individual makes a pact with the Devil. In addition, heresy denies witches the recognition of important Christian values such as baptism, salvation, Christ and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=European Witchcraft|last=Monter|first=E.

[[Brian P. Levack]] (''The Witch Hunt in Early Modern Europe'') multiplied the number of known European witch trials by the average rate of conviction and execution, to arrive at a figure of around 60,000 deaths. [[Anne Lewellyn Barstow]] (''Witchcraze'') adjusted Levack's estimate to account for lost records, estimating 100,000 deaths. [[Ronald Hutton]] (''Triumph of the Moon'') argues that Levack's estimate had already been adjusted for these, and revises the figure to approximately 40,000.&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of witch trials in Europe known for certain to have ended in executions is around 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;

The William and Mary Quarterly 60, no. 2 (2003): 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Europe had a lot of power over individuals living in West Africa, Europeans in positions of power were often accused of taking part in these practices. Though it is not likely that these individuals were actually involved in these practices, they were most likely associated due to Europe’s involvement in things like the slave trade, which negatively affected the lives of many individuals in the Atlantic World throughout the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The familiar witch of [[folklore]] and popular [[superstition]] is a combination of numerous influences. The characterization of the witch as an evil magic user developed over time.

Early converts to Christianity looked to Christian clergy to work magic more effectively than the old methods under Roman paganism, and Christianity provided a methodology involving saints and relics, similar to the gods and amulets of the Pagan world. As Christianity became the dominant religion in Europe, its concern with magic lessened.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Stuart, P. G. (2000) "The Emergence of the Christian Witch" in ''History Today'', Nov, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protestant Christian explanation for witchcraft, such as those typified in the confessions of the [[Pendle witches]], commonly involves a [[deal with the Devil|diabolical pact]] or at least an appeal to the intervention of the spirits of evil. The witches or wizards engaged in such practices were alleged to reject [[Jesus]] and the [[sacrament]]s; observe "[[Witches' Sabbath|the witches' sabbath]]" (performing infernal rites that often parodied the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or other sacraments of the Church); pay Divine honour to [[Satan|the Prince of Darkness]]; and, in return, receive from him [[preternatural]] powers. It was a folkloric belief that a Devil's Mark, like the brand on cattle, was placed upon a witch's skin by the devil to signify that this pact had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Drymon, M.M. Disguised as the Devil: How Lyme Disease Created Witches and Changed History, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Witches were most often characterized as women. Witches disrupted the societal institutions, and more specifically, marriage. It was believed that a witch often joined a pact with the devil to gain powers to deal with infertility, immense fear for her children's well-being, or revenge against a lover. They were also depicted as lustful and perverted, and it was thought that they copulated with the devil at the Sabbath.

The Church and European society were not always so zealous in hunting witches or blaming them for misfortunes. [[Saint Boniface]] declared in the 8th century that belief in the existence of witches was un-Christian. The emperor [[Charlemagne]] decreed that the burning of supposed witches was a pagan custom that would be punished by the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]. In 820 the [[Bishop of Lyon]] and others repudiated the belief that witches could make bad weather, fly in the night, and change their shape. This denial was accepted into [[Canon law]] . Other rulers such as [[Coloman, King of Hungary|King Coloman of Hungary]] declared that witch-hunts should cease because witches (more specifically, [[strigoi|strigas]]) do not exist.

The Church did not invent the idea of witchcraft as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners should be put to death. This idea is commonplace in pre-Christian religions. According to the scholar Max Dashu, the concept of medieval witchcraft contained many of its elements even before the emergence of Christianity. These can be found in [[Bacchanalia]]s, especially in the time when they were led by priestess [[Paculla Annia]] (188BC–186BC).

Powers typically attributed to European witches include turning food poisonous or inedible, flying on broomsticks or pitchforks, casting spells, cursing people, making livestock ill and crops fail, and creating fear and local chaos.

However, even at a later date, not all witches were assumed to be harmful practicers of the craft. In England, the provision of this curative magic was the job of a [[witch doctor]], also known as a [[cunning folk|cunning man]], [[white witch]], or wise man. The term "witch doctor" was in use in England before it came to be associated with Africa. [[Toad doctors]] were also credited with the ability to undo evil witchcraft. (Other folk magicians had their own purviews. [[Girdle-measurers]] specialised in diagnosing ailments caused by fairies, while magical cures for more mundane ailments, such as burns or toothache, could be had from [[Charmer (folklore)|charmer]]s.)

Historians [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]] and his student [[Alan Macfarlane]] study witchcraft by combining historical research with concepts drawn from anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barry, "Introduction: Keith Thomas and the problem of witchcraft" in  Jonathan Barry et al. eds., ''Witchcraft in early modern Europe: Studies in Culture and Belief'' (1996)  pp. 1–46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Macfarlane, ''Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England: A Regional and Comparative Study'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that English witchcraft, like African witchcraft, was endemic rather than epidemic. Older women were the favorite targets because they were marginal, dependent members of the community and therefore more likely to arouse feelings of both hostility and guilt, and less likely to have defenders of importance inside the community. Witchcraft accusations were the village's reaction to the breakdown of its internal community, coupled with the emergence of a newer set of values that was generating psychic stress.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Garrett, ""Women and witches: Patterns of analysis." ''Signs'' 3#2 (1977): 461–470. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173296 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales,  fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500.  There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Kamerick, "Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500." ''Sixteenth Century Journal'' 44#1 (2013) pp25-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536–1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Parkin, "Witchcraft, women's honour and customary law in early modern Wales." ''Social History'' 31.3 (2006): 295–318.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becoming king in 1603,  [[James I]] Brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male [[homosociality]] among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lolis, "The City of Witches: James I, the Unholy Sabbath, and the Homosocial Refashioning of the Witches’ Community." ''CLIO'' (2008) 37#3 pp 322–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] children believed to be witches or seen as possessed by evil spirits can be subject to severe beatings, traumatic [[exorcism]], and/or other abuse.  There have even been child murders associated with witchcraft beliefs.

As in most European countries, women in Italy were more likely suspected of witchcraft than men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witchcraft and the Inquisition in Venice, 1550–1650|last=Martin|first=Ruth|year=1989|isbn=|location=Oxford, UK|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were considered dangerous due to their supposed sexual instability, such as when being aroused, and also due to the powers of their menstrual blood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
In pre-Christian times, witchcraft was a common practice in the [[Cook Islands]]. The native name for a sorcerer was ''tangata purepure'' (a man who prays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA372|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=372|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prayers offered by the ''ta'unga'' (priests)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=471|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods worshiped on national or tribal ''[[marae]]'' (temples) were termed ''karakia'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jasper Buse|date=1995|title=Cook Islands Maori Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=Cook Islands Ministry of Education|page=156|isbn=9780728602304}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on minor occasions to the lesser gods were named ''pure''. All these prayers were metrical, and were handed down from generation to generation with the utmost care. There were prayers for every such phase in life; for success in battle; for a change in wind (to overwhelm an adversary at sea, or that an intended voyage be propitious); that his crops may grow; to curse a thief; or wish ill-luck and death to his foes. Few men of middle age were without a number of these prayers or charms. The succession of a sorcerer was from father to son, or from uncle to nephew. So too of sorceresses: it would be from mother to daughter, or from aunt to niece. Sorcerers and sorceresses were often slain by relatives of their supposed victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|author-link=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A singular enchantment was employed to kill off a husband of a pretty woman desired by someone else. The expanded flower of a [[Gardenia taitensis|Gardenia]] was stuck upright—a very difficult performance—in a cup (i.e., half a large coconut shell) of water. A prayer was then offered for the husbands speedy death, the sorcerer earnestly watching the flower. Should it fall the incantation was successful. But if the flower still remained upright, he will live. The sorcerer would in that case try his skill another day, with perhaps better success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Wyatt Gill|date=1892|title=The south Pacific and New Guinea, past and present; with notes on the Hervey group, an illustrative song and various myths|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/southpacificnewg00gill#page/20/mode/2up|chapter=Wizards|publisher=Sydney: Charles Potter, Government Printer|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Beatrice Grimshaw]], a journalist who visited the Cook Islands in 1907, the uncrowned [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] was believed to have possessed the mystic power called ''[[mana]]'',  giving the possessor the power to slay at will.

=== Russia ===
Among the [[Russian language|Russian]] words for ''witch'', ведьма (ved'ma) literally means "one who knows", from Old Slavic вѣдъ "to know").&lt;ref&gt;See also Ryan, W.F. ''The Bathhouse at Midnight: An Historical Survey of Magic and Divination in Russia'', [[Pennsylvania State University Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Another frequent term is колдунья (koldun'ya), ''sorcerer'' being колдун (koldun).

==== Spells ====
Pagan practices formed a part of Russian and Eastern Slavic culture; the Russian people were deeply superstitious. The witchcraft practiced consisted mostly of earth magic and herbology; it was not so significant which herbs were used in practices, but how these herbs were gathered. Ritual centered on harvest of the crops and the location of the sun was very important.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 524.
&lt;/ref&gt;  One source, pagan author Judika Illes, tells that herbs picked on Midsummer's Eve were believed to be most powerful, especially if gathered on Bald Mountain near Kiev during the witches' annual revels celebration.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004,) page 252.&lt;/ref&gt; Botanicals should be gathered, "During the seventeenth minute of the fourteenth hour, under a dark moon, in the thirteenth field, wearing a red dress, pick the twelfth flower on the right."&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 847.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spells also served for midwifery, shape-shifting, keeping lovers faithful, and bridal customs. Spells dealing with midwifery and childbirth focused on the spiritual wellbeing of the baby.&lt;ref name="Judika Illes 2004 page 847"/&gt;  Shape-shifting spells involved invocation of the wolf as a spirit animal.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 623.&lt;/ref&gt; To keep men faithful, lovers would cut a ribbon the length of his erect penis and soak it in his seminal emissions after sex while he was sleeping, then tie seven knots in it; keeping this talisman of knot magic ensured loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 797.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of an ancient pagan marriage tradition involved the bride taking a ritual bath at a bathhouse before the ceremony. Her sweat would be wiped from her body using raw fish, and the fish would be cooked and fed to the groom.&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 705.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonism, or black magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly involved the practice of simple earth magic, founded on herbology, by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3879463|title=Male Witches and Gendered Categories in Seventeenth-Century Russia|first=Valerie A.|last=Kivelson|date=1 January 2003|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|volume=45|issue=3|pages=606–631}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.&lt;ref&gt;
Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these customs were unique to Russian culture, they were not exclusive to this region. Russian pagan practices were often akin to paganism in other parts of the world. The Chinese concept of ''chi'', a form of energy that often manipulated in witchcraft, is known as bioplasma in Russian practices.&lt;ref&gt;Janet and Stewart Farrar, A Witches Bible: The Complete Witches' Handbook (Washington, Phoenix Publishing, Inc.) 1984. Page 316.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The western concept of an "evil eye" or a "hex" was translated to Russia as a "spoiler".&lt;ref&gt;Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells: The Ultimate Reference Book for the Magical Arts (Element: London, 2004), page 586.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoiler was rooted in envy, jealousy and malice. Spoilers could be made by gathering bone from a cemetery, a knot of the target's hair, burned wooden splinters and several herb Paris berries (which are very poisonous). Placing these items in sachet in the victim's pillow completes a spoiler.  The Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and the ancient Egyptians recognized the evil eye from as early as 3,000 BCE; in Russian practices it is seen as a sixteenth-century concept.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-Paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink) 2002. Page 160.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Societal view of witchcraft ====
The dominant societal concern those practicing witchcraft was not whether paganism was effective, but whether it could cause harm.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  Peasants in Russian and Ukrainian societies often shunned witchcraft, unless they needed help against supernatural forces. Impotence, stomach pains, barrenness, hernias, abscesses, epileptic seizures, and convulsions were all attributed to evil (or witchcraft). This is reflected in linguistics; there are numerous words for a variety of practitioners of paganism-based healers. Russian peasants referred to a witch as a ''chernoknizhnik'' (a person who plied his trade with the aid of a black book), ''sheptun''/''sheptun'ia'' (a "whisperer" male or female), ''lekar''/''lekarka'' or ''znakhar''/''znakharka'' (a male or female healer), or ''zagovornik'' (an incanter).&lt;ref&gt;
Christine D. Worobec, 1995. "Witchcraft Beliefs and Practices in Prerevolutionary Russian and Ukrainian Villages." Russian Review 54, no. 2: 165. Historical Abstracts, EBSCOhost (accessed November 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically enough, there was universal reliance on folk healers – but clients often turned them in if something went wrong. According to Russian historian Valerie A. Kivelson, witchcraft accusations were normally thrown at lower-class peasants, townspeople and Cossacks. People turned to witchcraft as a means to support themselves. The ratio of male to female accusations was 75% to 25%. Males were targeted more, because witchcraft was associated with societal deviation. Because single people with no settled home could not be taxed, males typically had more power than women in their dissent.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The history of Witchcraft had evolved around society. More of a psychological concept to the creation and usage of Witchcraft can create the assumption as to why women are more likely to follow the practices behind Witchcraft. Identifying with the soul of an individual’s self is often deemed as "feminine" in society. There is analyzed social and economic evidence to associate between witchcraft and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peterson|first1=Mark|title=Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England|journal=ProQuest|date=1998|volume=67|issue= 1|pages=192–194|doi=10.2307/3170836|jstor=3170836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Witchcraft trials ====
[[File:"A true and just recorde of the information"; title page Wellcome M0012987.jpg|thumb|''A true and iust Recorde, of the Information, Examination and Confession of all witches...'']]

Witchcraft trials occurred frequently in seventeenth-century Russia, although the "great witch-hunt" is believed{{by whom|date=January 2014}} to be a predominately Western European phenomenon.  However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called "witch hysteria."  This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, herbology, the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community.  Very early on witchcraft legally fell under the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.&lt;ref&gt;
Russell Zguta, "Witchcraft Trials in Seventeenth-Century Russia," American Historical Review 82, no. 5 (December 1977), 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being [[Vladimir the Great]]'s first edition of his State Statute or ''Ustav'', another being multiple references in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' beginning in 1024.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentence for an individual found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the "ordeal of cold water" or ''judicium aquae frigidae''.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"&gt;Zguta, 1189.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but was used as a method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy.  Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them "brought back," but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water test was used as a precursor to execution.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/dictionary/brewers/cold-water-ordeal.html|title=Cold Water Ordeal|website=Infoplease.com|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these two methods of torture were used in the west and the east, Russia implemented a system of fines payable for the crime of witchcraft during the seventeenth century.  Thus, even though torture methods in Muscovy were on a similar level of harshness as Western European methods used, a more civil method was present.  In the introduction of a collection of trial records pieced together by Russian scholar Nikolai Novombergsk, he argues that Muscovite authorities used the same degree of cruelty and harshness as Western European Catholic and Protestant countries in persecuting witches.&lt;ref&gt;
Zguta, 1187.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the mid-sixteenth century the manifestations of paganism, including witchcraft, and the black arts—astrology, fortune telling, and divination—became a serious concern to the Muscovite church and state.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"&gt;Zguta, 1191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsar [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] (reigned 1547–1584) took this matter to the ecclesiastical court and was immediately advised that individuals practicing these forms of witchcraft should be excommunicated and given the death penalty.&lt;ref name="Zguta, 1191"/&gt;  Ivan IV, as a true believer in witchcraft, was deeply convinced{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} that sorcery accounted for the death of his wife, [[Anastasia Romanovna|Anastasiia]] in 1560, which completely devastated and depressed him, leaving him heartbroken.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stemming from this belief, Ivan IV became majorly concerned with the threat of witchcraft harming his family, and feared he was in danger. So, during the [[Oprichnina]] (1565–1572), Ivan IV succeeded in accusing and charging a good number of boyars with witchcraft whom he did not wish to remain as nobles.  Rulers after Ivan IV, specifically during the [[Time of Troubles]] (1598–1613), increased the fear of witchcraft among themselves and entire royal families, which then led to further preoccupation with the fear of prominent Muscovite witchcraft circles.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Time of Troubles, seventeenth-century Muscovite rulers held frequent investigations of witchcraft within their households, laying the ground, along with previous tsarist reforms, for widespread witchcraft trials throughout the Muscovite state.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1195.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1622 and 1700 ninety-one people were brought to trial in Muscovite courts for witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;Zguta, 1196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Russia did partake in the witch craze that swept across Western Europe, the Muscovite state did not persecute nearly as many people for witchcraft, let alone execute a number of individuals anywhere close to the number executed in the west during the witch hysteria.

== Witches in art ==
Witches have a long history of being depicted in art, although most of their earliest artistic depictions seem to originate in Early Modern Europe, particularly the Medieval and Renaissance periods. Many scholars attribute their manifestation in art as inspired by texts such as ''Canon Episcopi'', a demonology-centered work of literature, and ''Malleus Maleficarum'', a "witch-craze" manual published in 1487, by Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Patricia. "THE INCUBUS AND ITALIAN RENAISSANCE ART." Source: ''Notes in the History of Art'' 34.1 (2014): 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canon Episcopi'', a ninth-century text that explored the subject of demonology, initially introduced concepts that would continuously be associated with witches, such as their ability to fly or their believed fornication and sexual relations with the devil. The text refers to two women, Diana the Huntress and Herodias, who both express the duality of female sorcerers. Diana was described as having a heavenly body and as the "protectress of childbirth and fertility" while Herodias symbolized "unbridled sensuality". They thus represent the mental powers and cunning sexuality that witches used as weapons to trick men into performing sinful acts which would result in their eternal punishment. These characteristics were distinguished as Medusa-like or Lamia-like traits when seen in any artwork (Medusa's mental trickery was associated with Diana the Huntress's psychic powers and Lamia was a rumored female figure in the Medieval ages sometimes used in place of Herodias).&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzi, Lorenzo. ''Witches. Exploring the iconography of the sorceress and enchantress''. (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
   
One of the first individuals to regularly depict witches after the witch-craze of the medieval period was [[Albrecht Dürer]], a German Renaissance artist. His famous 1497 engraving ''[[The Four Witches]]'', portrays four physically attractive and seductive nude witches. Their supernatural identities are emphasized by the skulls and bones lying at their feet as well as the devil discreetly peering at them from their left. The women's sensuous presentation speaks to the overtly sexual nature they were attached to in early modern Europe. Moreover, this attractiveness was perceived as a danger to ordinary men who they could seduce and tempt into their sinful world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some scholars interpret this piece as utilizing the logic of the ''Canon Episcopi'', in which women used their mental powers and bodily seduction to enslave and lead men onto a path of eternal damnation, differing from the unattractive depiction of witches that would follow in later Renaissance years.&lt;ref&gt;Stumpel, Jeroen. “The Foul Fowler Found out: On a Key Motif in Dürer's ‘Four Witches.’” Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', vol. 30, no. 3/4, 2003, pp. 143–160., www.jstor.org/stable/3780914.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Dürer also employed other ideas from the Middle Ages that were commonly associated with witches. Specifically, his art often referred to former 12th- to 13th-century Medieval iconography addressing the nature of female sorcerers. In the Medieval period, there was a widespread fear of witches, accordingly producing an association of dark, intimidating characteristics with witches, such as cannibalism (witches described as "[sucking] the blood of newborn infants"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) or described as having the ability to fly, usually on the back of black goats. As the Renaissance period began, these concepts of witchcraft were suppressed, leading to a drastic change in the sorceress' appearances, from sexually explicit beings to the 'ordinary' typical housewives of this time period. This depiction, known as the 'Waldensian' witch became a cultural phenomenon of early Renaissance art. The term originates from the 12th-century monk Peter Waldo, who established his own religious sect which explicitly opposed the luxury and commodity-influenced lifestyle of the Christian church clergy, and whose sect was excommunicated before being persecuted as "practitioners of witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent artwork exhibiting witches tended to consistently rely on cultural stereotypes about these women. These stereotypes were usually rooted in early Renaissance religious discourse, specifically the Christian belief that an "earthly alliance" had taken place between Satan's female minions who "conspired to destroy Christendom".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Hoak, Dale. "THE EUROPEAN WITCHCRAZE REVISITED, PT 2, WITCH-HUNTING AND WOMEN IN THE ART OF THE RENAISSANCE." ''History Today'' 31.FEB (1981): 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant artist whose art consistently depicted witches was Dürer's apprentice, Hans Baldung Grien, a 15th-century German artist. His chiaroscuro woodcut, ''Witches'', created in 1510, visually encompassed all the characteristics that were regularly assigned to witches during the Renaissance. Social beliefs labeled witches as supernatural beings capable of doing great harm, possessing the ability to fly, and as cannibalistic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The urn in ''Witches'' seems to contain pieces of the human body, which the witches are seen consuming as a source of energy. Meanwhile, their nudity while feasting is recognized as an allusion to their sexual appetite, and some scholars read the witch riding on the back of a goat-demon as representative of their "flight-inducing [powers]". This connection between women's sexual nature and sins was thematic in the pieces of many Renaissance artists, especially Christian artists, due to cultural beliefs which characterized women as overtly sexual beings who were less capable (in comparison to men) of resisting sinful temptation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[set theory]], '''Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory''', named after mathematicians [[Ernst Zermelo]] and [[Abraham Fraenkel]], is an [[axiomatic system]] that was proposed in the early twentieth century in order to formulate a [[theory of sets]] free of paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]].  Today, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the historically controversial [[axiom of choice]] (AC) included is the standard form of [[axiomatic set theory]] and as such is the most common [[foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]]. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice included is abbreviated '''ZFC''', where C stands for "choice",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ciesielski|1997}}.  "Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (abbreviated as ZFC where C stands for the axiom of Choice"&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ZF''' refers to the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice excluded. 

Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory is intended to formalize a single primitive notion, that of a [[hereditary set|hereditary]] [[well-founded]] [[Set (mathematics)|set]], so that all [[Entity|entities]] in the [[universe of discourse]] are such sets. Thus the [[axiom]]s of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory refer only to [[pure set]]s and prevent its [[Model theory|model]]s from containing [[urelement]]s (elements of sets that are not themselves sets). Furthermore, [[proper class]]es (collections of [[mathematical object]]s defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly. Specifically, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory does not allow for the existence of a [[universal set]] (a set containing all sets) nor for [[unrestricted comprehension]], thereby avoiding Russell's paradox. [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) is a commonly used [[conservative extension]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory that does allow explicit treatment of proper classes.

There are many equivalent formulations of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.  Most of the axioms state the existence of particular sets defined from other sets. For example, the [[axiom of pairing]] says that given any two sets ''a'' and ''b'' there is a new set {''a'', ''b''} containing exactly ''a'' and ''b''. Other axioms describe properties of set membership. A goal of the axioms is that each axiom should be true if interpreted as a statement about the collection of all sets in the [[von Neumann universe]] (also known as the cumulative hierarchy).

The [[metamathematics]] of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory has been extensively studied. Landmark results in this area established the [[Independence (mathematical logic)|logical independence]] of the axiom of choice from the remaining ZFC axioms (see [[Axiom of choice#Independence]]) and of the [[continuum hypothesis]] from ZFC.The [[consistency]] of a theory such as ZFC cannot be proved within the theory itself.

Formally, ZFC is a [[Many-sorted first-order logic|one-sorted theory]] in [[first-order logic]]. The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] has equality and a single primitive [[binary relation]], [[set membership]], which is usually denoted ∈. The formula ''a'' ∈ ''b'' means that the set ''a'' is a member of the set ''b'' (which is also read, "''a'' is an element of ''b''" or "''a'' is in ''b''").

== History ==

The modern study of [[set theory]] was initiated by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] in the 1870s. However, the discovery of [[Paradoxes of set theory|paradoxes]] in [[naive set theory]], such as [[Russell's paradox]], led to the desire for a more rigorous form of set theory that was free of these paradoxes.

In 1908, [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory]], [[Zermelo set theory]]. However, as first pointed out by [[Abraham Fraenkel]] in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and [[cardinal number]]s whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number &amp;alefsym;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt; and the set {Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), &amp;weierp;(&amp;weierp;(Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)),...}, where Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any infinite set and &amp;weierp; is the power set operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ebbinghaus|2007|page=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one of Zermelo's axioms invoked a concept, that of a "definite" property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and [[Thoralf Skolem]] independently proposed operationalizing a "definite" property as one that could be formulated as a [[first-order logic|first order theory]] whose [[atomic formula]]s were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the [[axiom schema of specification]] with the [[axiom schema of replacement]]. Appending this schema, as well as the [[axiom of regularity]] (first proposed by [[Dimitry Mirimanoff]] in 1917), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by '''ZF'''. Adding to ZF either the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.

== Axioms ==

There are many equivalent formulations of the ZFC axioms; for a discussion of this see {{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.  The following particular axiom set is from {{harvtxt|Kunen|1980}}. The axioms per se are expressed in the symbolism of [[first order logic]]. The associated English prose is only intended to aid the intuition.
&lt;!-- **NOTE TO EDITORS** The symbolic axioms are taken from Kunen, and should not be changed without discussion on the talk page.  Making up a new set of axioms is original research. The English descriptions are new here and can be freely changed.  The choice of Kunen instead of Jech or some other author was arbitrary, and is open for discussion on the talk page. --&gt;

All formulations of ZFC imply that at least one set exists. Kunen includes an axiom that directly asserts the existence of a set, in addition to the axioms given below (although he notes that he does so only “for emphasis”).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kunen|1980|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its omission here can be justified in two ways. First, in the standard semantics of first-order logic in which ZFC is typically formalized, the [[domain of discourse]] must be nonempty. Hence, it is a logical theorem of first-order logic that something exists &amp;mdash; usually expressed as the assertion that something is identical to itself, &amp;exist;x(x=x). Consequently, it is a theorem of every first-order theory that something exists. However, as noted above, because in the intended semantics of ZFC there are only sets, the interpretation of this logical theorem in the context of ZFC is that some ''set'' exists. Hence, there is no need for a separate axiom asserting that a set exists. Second, however, even if ZFC is formulated in so-called [[free logic]], in which it is not provable from logic alone that something exists, the axiom of infinity (below) asserts that an ''infinite'' set exists. This implies that ''a'' set exists and so, once again, it is superfluous to include an axiom asserting as much.

=== 1. Axiom of extensionality ===
{{Main| Axiom of extensionality}}

Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;

The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of [[equality (mathematics)|equality]]. If the background logic does not include equality "=", ''x''=''y'' may be defined as an abbreviation for the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hatcher|1982|page=138}}, def.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z [z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y] \land \forall w [x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w].&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the axiom of extensionality can be reformulated as

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [\forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow \forall w (x \in w \Leftrightarrow y \in w)],&lt;/math&gt;

which says that if  ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraenkel|Bar-Hillel|Lévy|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2. Axiom of regularity (also called the Axiom of foundation) ===
{{Main|Axiom of regularity}}

Every non-empty set ''x'' contains a member ''y'' such that ''x'' and ''y'' are [[disjoint sets]].

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x [\exists a ( a \in x) \Rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x))].&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|2001|page=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
or in modern notation:
&lt;math&gt;\forall x\,(x \neq \varnothing \rightarrow \exists y \in x\,(y \cap x = \varnothing))&lt;/math&gt; 

This implies, for example, that no set is an element of itself and that every set has an [[ordinal number|ordinal]] [[rank (set theory)|rank]].

=== 3. Axiom schema of specification (also called the axiom schema of separation or of restricted comprehension) ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of specification}}

Subsets are commonly constructed using [[set builder notation]]. For example, the even integers can be constructed as the subset of the integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the [[Congruence modulo n|congruence modulo]] predicate &lt;math&gt;x \equiv 0 \pmod 2&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x \equiv 0 \pmod 2\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the subset of a set ''z'' obeying a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;(''x'') with one free variable ''x'' may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x \in z : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification states that this subset always exists (it is an [[axiom schema|axiom ''schema'']] because there is one axiom for each &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any formula in the language of ZFC with all free variables among &lt;math&gt;x,z,w_1,\ldots,w_n&lt;/math&gt; (''y'' is ''not'' free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;). Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall z \forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \exists y \forall x [x \in y \Leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi )].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the axiom schema of specification can only construct subsets, and does not allow the construction of sets of the more general form:

: &lt;math&gt;\{x : \phi(x)\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This restriction is necessary to avoid [[Russell's paradox]] and its variants that accompany naive set theory with [[unrestricted comprehension]].

In some other axiomatizations of ZF, this axiom is redundant in that it follows from the [[axiom schema of replacement]] and the [[axiom of the empty set]].

On the other hand, the axiom of specification can be used to prove the existence of the [[empty set]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, once at least one set is known to exist (see above). One way to do this is to use a property &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; which no set has. For example, if ''w'' is any existing set, the empty set can be constructed as

: &lt;math&gt;\varnothing = \{u \in w \mid (u \in u) \land \lnot (u \in u) \}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus the [[axiom of the empty set]] is implied by the nine axioms presented here.  The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique (does not depend on ''w''). It is common to make a [[definitional extension]] that adds the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to the language of ZFC.

=== 4. Axiom of pairing ===
{{Main|Axiom of pairing}}

If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set which contains ''x'' and ''y'' as elements.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exists z (x \in z \land y \in z).&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification must be used to reduce this to a set with exactly these two elements. The axiom of pairing is part of Z, but is redundant in ZF because it follows from the axiom schema of replacement, if we are given a set with at least two elements. The existence of a set with at least two elements is assured by either the [[axiom of infinity]], or by the axiom schema of specification and  the [[axiom of the power set]] applied twice to any set.

=== 5. Axiom of union ===
{{Main|Axiom of union}}

The union over the elements of a set exists. For example, the union over the elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The axiom of union states that for any set of sets &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; containing every element that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;\forall \mathcal{F} \,\exists A \, \forall Y\, \forall x [(x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F}) \Rightarrow x \in A].&lt;/math&gt;
Although this formula doesn't directly assert the existence of &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the above using the axiom schema of specification:
: &lt;math&gt;\cup \mathcal{F}:=\{x\in A : \exists Y (x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F})\}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== 6. Axiom schema of replacement ===
{{Main|Axiom schema of replacement}}

The axiom schema of replacement asserts that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a set under any definable function will also fall inside a set.

Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be any [[Well-formed formula|formula]] in the language of ZFC whose [[free variable]]s are among &lt;math&gt;x,y,A,w_1,\dotsc,w_n&lt;/math&gt;, so that in particular &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall A\forall w_1 \forall w_2\ldots \forall w_n \bigl[\forall x ( x\in A \Rightarrow \exists! y\,\phi ) \Rightarrow \exists B \ \forall x \bigl(x\in A \Rightarrow \exists y (y\in B \land \phi)\bigr)\bigr].&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if the relation &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; represents a definable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; represents its [[domain of a function|domain]], and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a set for every &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of some set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. The form stated here, in which &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; may be larger than strictly necessary, is sometimes called the [[Axiom schema of replacement#Axiom schema of collection|axiom schema of collection]].

=== 7. Axiom of infinity ===

|}

Let &lt;math&gt;S(w)&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; w \cup \{w\} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; w &lt;/math&gt; is some set. (We can see that &lt;math&gt;\{w\}&lt;/math&gt; is a valid set by applying the Axiom of Pairing with &lt;math&gt; x=y=w &lt;/math&gt; so that the set &lt;math&gt;z &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\{w\} &lt;/math&gt;). Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''.

: &lt;math&gt;\exists X \left [\varnothing \in X \land \forall y (y \in X \Rightarrow S(y)  \in X)\right].&lt;/math&gt;

More colloquially, there exists a set ''X'' having infinitely many members. (It must be established, however, that these members are all different, because if two elements are the same, the sequence will loop around in a finite cycle of sets. The axiom of regularity prevents this from happening.) The minimal set ''X'' satisfying the axiom of infinity is the [[von Neumann ordinal]] ω, which can also be thought of as the set of [[natural numbers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== 8. Axiom of power set ===
{{Main|Axiom of power set}}

By definition a set ''z'' is a [[subset]] of a set ''x'' if and only if every element of ''z'' is also an element of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;(z \subseteq x) \Leftrightarrow ( \forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x)).&lt;/math&gt;

The Axiom of Power Set states that for any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' that  contains every subset of ''x'':

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y \forall z [z \subseteq x \Rightarrow z \in y].&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom schema of specification is then used to define the [[power set]] ''P(x)'' as the subset of such a ''y'' containing the subsets of ''x'' exactly:

: &lt;math&gt;P(x) = \{ z \in y: z \subseteq x  \}&lt;/math&gt;

Axioms '''1&amp;ndash;8''' define ZF. Alternative forms of these axioms are often encountered, some of which are listed in {{harvtxt|Jech|2003}}. Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the [[axiom of empty set|empty set exists]]. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set ''x'' whose existence is being asserted are just those sets which the axiom asserts ''x'' must contain.

The following axiom is added to turn ZF into ZFC:

=== 9. Well-ordering theorem ===
{{Main|Well-ordering theorem}}

For any set ''X'', there is a [[binary relation]] ''R'' which [[wellordering|well-orders]] ''X''.  This means ''R'' is a [[linear order]] on ''X'' such that every nonempty [[subset]] of ''X'' has a member which is minimal under ''R''.

: &lt;math&gt;\forall X \exists R ( R \;\mbox{well-orders}\; X).&lt;/math&gt;

Given axioms '''1–8''', there are many statements {{not a typo|provably}} equivalent to axiom '''9''', the best known of which is the [[axiom of choice]] (AC), which goes as follows. Let ''X'' be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function ''f'' from ''X'' to the union of the members of ''X'', called a "[[choice function]]", such that for all {{math|''Y'' ∈ ''X''}} one has {{math|''f''(''Y'') ∈ ''Y''}}. Since the existence of a choice function when ''X'' is a [[finite set]] is easily proved from axioms '''1–8''', AC only matters for certain [[infinite set]]s. AC is characterized as [[constructive mathematics|nonconstructive]] because it asserts the existence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be "constructed."  Much research{{vague|date=November 2018}} has sought to characterize the definability (or lack thereof) of certain sets{{example needed|date=November 2018}} whose existence AC asserts.

== Motivation via the cumulative hierarchy ==

One motivation for the ZFC axioms is [[the cumulative hierarchy]] of sets introduced by [[John von Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shoenfield|1977}}, section&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this viewpoint, the universe of set theory is built up in stages, with one stage for each [[ordinal number]]. At stage 0 there are no sets yet. At each following stage, a set is added to the universe if all of its elements have been added at previous stages. Thus the empty set is added at stage 1, and the set containing the empty set is added at stage 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinman|2005|page=467}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of all sets that are obtained in this way, over all the stages, is known as V. The sets in V can be arranged into a hierarchy by assigning to each set the first stage at which that set was added to V.

It is provable that a set is in V if and only if the set is [[pure set|pure]] and [[well-founded set|well-founded]]; and provable that V satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, if the class of ordinals has appropriate reflection properties. For example, suppose that a set ''x'' is added at stage α, which means that every element of ''x'' was added at a stage earlier than α. Then every subset of ''x'' is also added at stage α, because all elements of any subset of ''x'' were also added before stage α. This means that any subset of ''x'' which the axiom of separation can construct is added at stage α, and that the powerset of ''x'' will be added at the next stage after α. For a complete argument that V satisfies ZFC see {{harvtxt|Shoenfield|1977}}.

The picture of the universe of sets stratified into the cumulative hierarchy is characteristic of ZFC and related axiomatic set theories such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (often called NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]]. The cumulative hierarchy is not compatible with other set theories such as [[New Foundations]].

It is possible to change the definition of ''V'' so that at each stage, instead of adding all the subsets of the union of the previous stages, subsets are only added if they are definable in a certain sense. This results in a more "narrow" hierarchy which gives the [[constructible universe]] ''L'', which also satisfies all the axioms of ZFC, including the axiom of choice. It is independent from the ZFC axioms whether ''V''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''L''. Although the structure of ''L'' is more regular and well behaved than that of&amp;nbsp;''V'', few mathematicians argue that&amp;nbsp;''V'' =&amp;nbsp;''L'' should be added to ZFC as an additional "[[axiom of constructibility]]".

== Metamathematics ==

===Virtual classes===

As noted earlier, proper classes (collections of mathematical objects defined by a property shared by their members which are too big to be sets) can only be treated indirectly in ZF (and thus ZFC).
An alternative to proper classes while staying within ZF and ZFC is the ''virtual class'' notational construct introduced by {{harvtxt|Quine|1969}}, where the entire construct y &amp;isin; { x | Fx } is simply defined as Fy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Link|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This provides a simple notation for classes that can contain sets but need not themselves be sets, while not committing to the ontology of classes (because the notation can be syntactically converted to one that only uses sets).  Quine's approach built on the earlier approach of {{harvtxt|Bernays|1958}}.  Virtual classes are also used in {{harvtxt|Levy|2002}}, {{harvtxt|Takeuti|1982}}, and in the [[Metamath]] implementation of ZFC.

===Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory===
The axiom schemata of replacement and separation each contain infinitely many instances. {{harvtxt|Montague|1961}} included a result first proved in his 1957 Ph.D. thesis: if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms. On the other hand, [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) can be finitely axiomatized. The ontology of NBG includes [[class (set theory)|proper classes]] as well as sets; a set is any class that can be a member of another class. NBG and ZFC are equivalent set theories in the sense that any [[theorem]] not mentioning classes and provable in one theory can be proved in the other.

===Consistency===
[[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]] says that a recursively axiomatizable system that can interpret [[Robinson arithmetic]] can prove its own consistency only if it is inconsistent. Moreover, Robinson arithmetic can be interpreted in [[general set theory]], a small fragment of ZFC. Hence the [[consistency proof|consistency]] of ZFC cannot be proved within ZFC itself (unless it is actually inconsistent). Thus, to the extent that ZFC is identified with ordinary mathematics, the consistency of ZFC cannot be demonstrated in ordinary mathematics. The consistency of ZFC does follow from the existence of a weakly [[inaccessible cardinal]], which is unprovable in ZFC if ZFC is consistent. Nevertheless, it is deemed unlikely that ZFC harbors an unsuspected contradiction; it is widely believed that if ZFC were inconsistent, that fact would have been uncovered by now. This much is certain &amp;mdash; ZFC is immune to the classic paradoxes of [[naive set theory]]: [[Russell's paradox]], the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], and [[Cantor's paradox]].

{{harvtxt|Abian|LaMacchia|1978}} studied a [[subtheory]] of ZFC consisting of the axioms of extensionality, union, powerset, replacement, and choice. Using [[model theory|models]], they proved this subtheory consistent, and proved that each of the axioms of extensionality, replacement, and power set is independent of the four remaining axioms of this subtheory. If this subtheory is augmented with the axiom of infinity, each of the axioms of union, choice, and infinity is independent of the five remaining axioms. Because there are [[non-well-founded set theory|non-well-founded]] models that satisfy each axiom of ZFC except the axiom of regularity, that axiom is independent of the other ZFC axioms.

If consistent, ZFC cannot prove the existence of the [[inaccessible cardinal]]s that [[category theory]] requires. Huge sets of this nature are possible if ZF is augmented with [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory|Tarski's axiom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarski|1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming that axiom turns the axioms of [[axiom of infinity|infinity]], [[axiom of power set|power set]], and [[axiom of choice|choice]] ('''7''' − '''9''' above) into theorems.

=== Independence ===

Many important statements are [[Logical independence|independent]] of ZFC (see [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC]]). The independence is usually proved by [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], whereby it is shown that every countable transitive [[model theory|model]] of ZFC (sometimes augmented with [[large cardinal axiom]]s) can be expanded to satisfy the statement in question. A different expansion is then shown to satisfy the negation of the statement. An independence proof by forcing automatically proves independence from arithmetical statements, other concrete statements, and large cardinal axioms. Some statements independent of ZFC can be proven to hold in particular [[inner model]]s, such as in the [[constructible universe]]. However, some statements that are true about constructible sets are not consistent with hypothesized large cardinal axioms.

Forcing proves that the following statements are independent of ZFC:

* [[Continuum hypothesis]]
* [[Diamondsuit|Diamond principle]]
* [[Suslin's problem|Suslin hypothesis]]
* [[Martin's axiom]] (which is not a ZFC axiom)
* [[Axiom of constructibility|Axiom of Constructibility (V=L)]] (which is also not a ZFC axiom).

Remarks:

* The consistency of V=L is provable by [[inner model]]s but not forcing: every model of ZF can be trimmed to become a model of ZFC + V=L.
* The Diamond Principle implies the Continuum Hypothesis and the negation of the Suslin Hypothesis.
* Martin's axiom plus the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis implies the Suslin Hypothesis.
* The [[constructible universe]] satisfies the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]], the Diamond Principle, Martin's Axiom and the Kurepa Hypothesis.
* The failure of the [[Kurepa tree|Kurepa hypothesis]] is equiconsistent with the existence of a [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]].

A variation on the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] can also be used to demonstrate the consistency and unprovability of the [[axiom of choice]], i.e., that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF. The consistency of choice can be (relatively) easily verified by proving that the inner model L satisfies choice. (Thus every model of ZF contains a submodel of ZFC, so that Con(ZF) implies Con(ZFC).) Since forcing preserves choice, we cannot directly produce a model contradicting choice from a model satisfying choice. However, we can use forcing to create a model which contains a suitable submodel, namely one satisfying ZF but not C.

Another method of proving independence results, one owing nothing to forcing, is based on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]]. This approach employs the statement whose independence is being examined, to prove the existence of a set model of ZFC, in which case Con(ZFC) is true. Since ZFC satisfies the conditions of Gödel's second theorem, the consistency of ZFC is unprovable in ZFC (provided that ZFC is, in fact, consistent). Hence no statement allowing such a proof can be proved in ZFC. This method can prove that the existence of [[large cardinals]] is not provable in ZFC, but cannot prove that assuming such cardinals, given ZFC, is free of contradiction.

===Proposed additions===
The project to unify set theorists behind additional axioms to resolve the Continuum Hypothesis or other meta-mathematical ambiguities is sometimes known as "Gödel's program".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feferman|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians currently debate which axioms are the most plausible or "self-evident", which axioms are the most useful in various domains, and about to what degree usefulness should be traded off with plausibility; some "[[multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]]" set theorists argue that usefulness should be the sole ultimate criterion in which axioms to customarily adopt. One school of thought leans on expanding the "iterative" concept of a set to produce a set-theoretic universe with an interesting and complex but reasonably tractable structure by adopting forcing axioms; another school advocates for a tidier, less cluttered universe, perhaps focused on a "core" inner model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolchover|2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

: ''For criticism of set theory in general, see [[Set theory#Objections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics|Objections to set theory]]''

ZFC has been criticized both for being excessively strong and for being excessively weak, as well as for its failure to capture objects such as proper classes and the [[universal set]].

Many mathematical theorems can be proven in much weaker systems than ZFC, such as [[Peano arithmetic]] and [[second-order arithmetic]] (as explored by the program of [[reverse mathematics]]). [[Saunders Mac Lane]] and [[Solomon Feferman]] have both made this point. Some of "mainstream mathematics" (mathematics not directly connected with axiomatic set theory) is beyond Peano arithmetic and second-order arithmetic, but still, all such mathematics can be carried out in ZC ([[Zermelo set theory]] with choice), another theory weaker than ZFC. Much of the power of ZFC, including the axiom of regularity and the axiom schema of replacement, is included primarily to facilitate the study of the set theory itself.

On the other hand, among [[axiomatic set theories]], ZFC is comparatively weak. Unlike [[New Foundations]], ZFC does not admit the existence of a universal set. Hence the [[universe]] of sets under ZFC is not closed under the elementary operations of the [[algebra of sets]]. Unlike [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG) and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] (MK), ZFC does not admit the existence of [[proper class]]es. A further comparative weakness of ZFC is that the [[axiom of choice]] included in ZFC is weaker than the [[axiom of global choice]] included in NBG and MK.

There are numerous [[list of statements undecidable in ZFC|mathematical statements undecidable in ZFC]]. These include the [[continuum hypothesis]], the [[Whitehead problem]], and the [[Moore space (topology)|normal Moore space conjecture]]. Some of these conjectures are provable with the addition of axioms such as [[Martin's axiom]], [[large cardinal axiom]]s to ZFC.  Some others are decided in ZF+AD where AD is the [[axiom of determinacy]], a strong supposition incompatible with choice.  One attraction of large cardinal axioms is that they enable many results from ZF+AD to be established in ZFC adjoined by some large cardinal axiom (see [[projective determinacy]]). The [[Mizar system]] and [[Metamath]] have adopted [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], an extension of ZFC, so that proofs involving [[Grothendieck universe]]s (encountered in category theory and algebraic geometry) can be formalized.
