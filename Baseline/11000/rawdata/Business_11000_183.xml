[[File:Abelardo Lafuente.jpg|thumb|Abelardo Lafuente the Spanish architect of Shanghai's Golden Era]]

'''Abelardo Lafuente Garcia-Rojo''' (Madrid 1871 – Shanghai 1931) was a Spanish architect&lt;ref name=podcast&gt;{{cite news|last=La Hora de Asia|title=Abelardo Lafuente: arquitectura española en Shanghai|url=http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/audios/la-hora-de-asia/hora-asia-abelardo-lafuente-arquitectura-espanola-shanghai-21-05-11/1107013/|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Radio Nacional España|date=21 May 2011|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entrepreneur who had his own studio in colonial Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Cultural Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldama|first=Zigor|title=Un español en el Shanghái precomunista|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2011/06/25/babelia/1308960770_850215.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=Babelia 1.022|date=25 June 2011|agency=El Pais|pages=24|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1913 and 1931 he was the only Spaniard to have an architect studio registered in the city; Lafuente collaborated with several contemporary architects. Lafuente blended the mozarab and moorish styles from Spain into Chinese architecture. In 2009, the Spanish architect Alvaro Leonardo Perez established the ''Lafuente Research Project''. The findings of this project were first presented at the Shanghai World Expo in 2010 in collaboration with the [[Instituto Cervantes]]. The Lafuente Research Project is ongoing.

== History ==
Lafuente's professional career began in [[Manila]]. His studio was named ''A. Lafuente Architect &amp; Contractor''. In 1913 Lafuente moved to Shanghai where he opened a new studio named ''A. Lafuente Garcia-Rojo, Architect &amp; Contractor''. Later, Lafuente joined American architect G. O. Wootten to form the ''Lafuente &amp; Wootten'' studio. The two architects worked together for several years, their most notable work being the ballroom at the [[Astor House Hotel (Shanghai)|Astor House Hotel]], built in 1917. After this period he maintained the studio on his own and called it ''A. Lafuente Gª Rojo Architect''. Afterwards he partnered with Russian architect A. J. Yaron, changing the studio's name once again to ''Lafuente &amp; Yaron''.

For the better part of the following 10 years Lafuente worked for the biggest hotel company in Asia at the time: the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels|Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd.]], rehabilitating and refurbishing their buildings. His most important work during this project was the Majestic Hotel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Majestic, the most important company's hotel in Shanghai|url=http://www.hshgroup.com/en/~/media/Files/HSHGroup/Investor_Relations/Financial_Results/2010/Annual_Report/AR_2010_C08.ashx|publisher=HSH|accessdate=11 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112004259/http://www.hshgroup.com/en/~/media/Files/HSHGroup/Investor_Relations/Financial_Results/2010/Annual_Report/AR_2010_C08.ashx|archive-date=12 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1924) where he designed its new ballroom (the most luxurious in Asia at that time{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}). Some of his other projects included churches, mosques, private villas, apartment buildings, movie theaters, private clubs, and hospitals, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=EFE|first=Agency|title=Un arquitecto español trabajando en la belle époque china|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2011/12/20/cultura/1324375509.html|accessdate=11 July 2012|date=20 December 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The north China Herald|title=A Jewish Club for Shanghai|pages=29–30|date=6 July 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His reputation in the Spanish colony is described in the book by Vicente Blasco Ibanez ''La vuelta al mundo de un novelista''. Spanish entrepreneur Antonio Ramos&lt;ref name=Magazine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revista de Occidente|author2=Juan Ignacio Toro Escudero|title=Sombras orientales: Antonio Ramos y el primer cine chino|date=June 2010|issue=349/350|url=http://www.ortegaygasset.edu/fog/ver/408/revista-de-occidente/junio-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was his most important influence during his time in China and his most outstanding client. Ramos brought motion pictures to China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lafuente was commissioned to build some of Ramos' most important cinemas.

Lafuente also worked in North America. In Los Angeles and in [[Tijuana]] he built houses. During 1927–1930, Lafuente maintained operations in Shanghai while he developed his business in California and Mexico. At the end of this period, after being significantly affected by the [[Crash of 1929]], he decided to return to Shanghai and undertake more projects there. He died in Shanghai at the Shanghai General Hospital in 1931, aged 60.

==History==
Action Target was founded in 1986 by Kyle Bateman and Addison Sovine to address a need they saw with law enforcement training,&lt;ref name="daily-herald-leong-20040314"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/business/article_a1a0d5d3-e90c-5064-a09a-3e3ace056e24.html|title=Action Target aims to improve shooting range equipment|publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]''|date=March 14, 2004|first=Grace|last=Leong|accessdate=March 16, 2010|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated out of Bateman's bedroom at first.&lt;ref name="police-one"/&gt; They soon moved to a larger facility near the [[Interstate 15]] freeway in Provo before moving to a manufacturing facility nearby next to a residential neighborhood.&lt;ref name="daily-herald-leong-20040314"/&gt;

In 1989, the company moved to manufacturing facilities on the west side of Provo on property which used to house a [[wrecking yard]]. Throughout the next fifteen years, Action Target expanded and built several large buildings to house its manufacturing. In late 2003 or early 2004, the company donated land to Provo City in order to extend the street and provide an alternate route for delivery trucks, as well as offering to purchase properties to create a [[buffer zone]] between its facilities and those of residential neighbors.&lt;ref name="daily-herald-hill-20040207"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/article_7c45cf89-129e-588d-8a65-0a437e3b3d2f.html|title=Residents voice concern over business|first=Justin|last=Hill|publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]''|date=February 7, 2004|accessdate=March 16, 2010|page=D4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company produced two bullet-proof training villages for use by the [[U.S. Army]] in 2005, a contract worth $3 million. U.S Congressman, [[Chris Cannon]], participated in a demonstration of a similar facility created for use by [[Utah County]] police departments, including those from [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Brigham Young University]], and [[Orem, Utah|Orem]].&lt;ref name="desnews-20050825"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600158696/Cannon-joins-raid-fires-gun-at-target---.html|title=Cannon joins raid, fires gun at target . . .|publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]''|date=August 25, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2010|first=Tad|last=Walch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the city of Provo began consideration of purchasing the property where Action Target was located in west Provo.&lt;ref name="desnews-consider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20070807/ai_n19445113/|title=Provo Council to talk on Action Target deal|publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]''|date=August 7, 2007|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property owned by the company in west Provo was approved for purchase by the end of that same year.&lt;ref name="provo2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://provo.org/mayor.2007_accomplishments.html |title=Partial List of Accomplishments for 2007 by Department and/or Division |publisher=[[Provo, Utah|Provo City]] |date=January 17, 2008 |first=Lewis K. |last=Billings |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o6tUhSF0?url=http://provo.org/mayor.2007_accomplishments.html |archivedate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Provo then approved several [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] in November as incentives for Action Target to move to a new industrial park in the southeast corner of the city.&lt;ref name="Action Target Becomes an NSSF Voting Member-five"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daily-herald-20071120"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_cd0a785f-ed86-542f-b4c7-32b46161a007.html|title=UPDATE: Provo votes to support $9M bond for Action Target|publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]''|date=November 20, 2007|first=Grace|last=Leong|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new industrial business park is the former home of an [[Ironworks|iron mill]] closed down in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="daily-herald-20070730"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/article_78a094fc-8ac3-5d5f-87b9-48930c626f5b.html|title=Provo OKs $3.3M deal with target company|publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]''|date=July 30, 2007|first=Nathan|last=Johnson|accessdate=March 16, 2010|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provo City allowed Action Target to use its [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt status]] to help secure financing for the costs of moving and building the new facility in the industrial park.  The industrial park was part of an [[infrastructure]] improvement paid for by a $2 million [[Federal grants (USA)|federal grant]].&lt;ref name="daily-herald-leong-20071121"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldextra.com/business/article_c8ae662c-8e5f-5deb-9641-0099b7692b7a.html|title=Provo supports $9M bond for Action Target|publisher=''[[Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]]''|date=November 21, 2007|first=Grace|last=Leong|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After breaking ground in September 2008,&lt;ref name="utah-business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3574/is_9_22/ai_n28580859/?tag=rel.res1|title=Action target|publisher=''Utah Business''|date=September 2008|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company began building a new facility which significantly increased its office space and manufacturing capacity.

The '''African Diamond Producers Association''' (ADPA) is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to strengthen the level of influence African [[diamond]]-producing countries have on the world diamond market.

ADPA implements policies, strategies and laws that assist the generation of diamond profits from foreign diamond mining companies to its Member States.

The organization was formed on 4 November 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200611030842.html Angola: African Diamond Producing Countries Ministers Meet], Allafrica.com, November 3, 2006 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|url=http://www.mineweb.net/african_renaissance/389260.htm|date=March 2012}}, African Diamond Council unleashes its intergovernmental branch, Mineweb.net, November 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as a continental branch of the '''African Diamond Council''', Africa's supreme diamond governing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link |url=http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:tY_nFzP23rcJ:www.fels.upenn.edu/internship/CCA_Africa_Business_Report_2007_Vol%25204_Issue%2520No%2520%252068.pdf+upenn+adc+adpa&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=AFQjCNHp0g78Y5M7TYnIR9ziS50kdmhEVA&amp;pli=1 |date=March 2012}}, African Diamond Trade: Top Producing Nations Form Strategic Alliance&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative to establish the ADPA was initially adopted and backed by [[Angola]]n President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]].

Angola is the interim executive secretariat as well as home to the organization's headquarters.

Both the ADC and ADPA organization's executive secretariat and headquarters are in the Republic of Angola.

'''Antoni Norbert Patek''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Antoine Norbert de Patek}}; 14 June 1812 – 1 March 1877) was a [[Poland|Polish]] pioneer in watchmaking and a creator of the [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]], one of the most famous [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[watchmaker]] companies.

== Early life ==

[[File:POL CoA Prawdzic.png|180px|thumb|right|[[Prawdzic coat of arms]]]]

Antoni Patek was born in 1812 in  Piaski Szlacheckie near [[Lublin]] in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] to Anna née Piasecka and Joachim Patek of [[Prawdzic coat of arms]].&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub"/&gt; At the age of 10, Patek moved with his parents to [[Warsaw]] where his father died on April 7, 1828.&lt;ref name="worldtempus"/&gt;

On March 1, 1828, 16-year-old Patek joined the Polish 1st Mounted Rifles Regiment. He fought in the [[November Uprising]] during which he was wounded twice. On February 27, 1831 for his heroic attitude Patek was promoted the second lieutenant of the "1 August" brigade, and on October 3 of the same year decorated with [[Virtuti Militari]] Golden Cross. After the downfall of the uprising – like many other officers and soldiers of Polish Army – he had to emigrate.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;
[[File:Virtuti Militari.jpg|thumb|left|120px|4th Class Order of the [[Virtuti Militari]]]]

In 1832 he was engaged by general [[Józef Bem]] in organising an evacuation route for [[Poland|Polish]] insurgents through [[Prussia]] to France. He was charged with a command over a staging point in [[Bamberg]] near [[Munich]] (one of five staging points on the insurgents' evacuation route). After terminating the evacuation, Patek settled in France, firstly in [[Cahors]], then in Amiens where he worked as a type-setter.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

Two years later an unfavourable decree issued by the French government under pressure from the Russian embassy, forced many former insurgents to resettle in [[Switzerland]]. Patek tried his hand at many trades, including trading with liquors and wines in [[Versoix]] near [[Geneva]]. For some time Patek attended painting courses given by the famous [[Swiss people|Swiss]] painter and engraver [[Alexandre Calame]]. During his studies, Patek also traveled to Paris where he remained for several months. Around this time, he was befriended by the [[Moreau (surname)|Moreau]] family of [[Versoix]] who he became friends with, and at whose home he would meet his future wife.  They probably encouraged him in a new activity – the trade in expensive pocket [[watches]], which were decorated by the goldsmiths, engravers, enamellers and miniaturists of the time. He thus started by buying movements of watches which he got to the Geneva watchmakers already known for the quality of their products and, under his direction, made them furnish with cases. From the very start, he attached highest importance to the quality and the artistic value of work and rather quickly managed to find the market where such creations of exceptional quality were highly appreciated.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

On July 10, 1839 in [[Versoix]], Patek married Marie Adélaïde Elisabeth Thomasine Dénizart, a daughter of a French tradesman Louis Charles Dénizart from Turin, and of his wife Marie Jeanne Adélaïde Elisabeth, née Devimes. Antoni and Marie de Patek had three children. The first one, Boleslas Joseph Alexandre Thomas (Bolesław Józef Aleksander Tomasz), born on June 16, 1841, died on September 18 of the same year. The two others were born much later, when Marie de Patek already was respectively 39 and 41 year old: a son, Leon Mecislas Vincent (Leon Mieczysław Wincenty), July 19, 1857 and one girl, Marie Edwige (Maria Jadwiga), October 23, 1859.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

== Patek, Czapek &amp; Co. (1839–1845) ==

[[File:Polish Watchmaking in Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engraving ''Polish Watchmaking in Geneva'' picturing ''Antoni Patek'' at the top, and portraits of both ''Gostkowski brothers'' below.]]

On May 1, 1839 in [[Geneva]], Antoni Patek together with another [[Poland|Polish]] immigrant (who in fact was of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent), the gifted [[Warsaw]] [[watchmaker]] [[Franciszek Czapek]] established their manufacture producing watches. The company was financially supported also by its first workers, among others [[Poland|Polish]] watchmakers: [[Wawrzyniec Gostkowski]], [[Wincenty Gostkowski]], and [[Władysław Bandurski]]. The first pocket watches were produced on individual orders. Primarily the young firm's artistic production reflected themes from Polish history and culture, such as portraits of revolutionary heroes, 10th and 12th centuries’ legends, and the cult of the Polish [[The Black Madonna of Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patekmuseum"/&gt;

The small company Patek, Czapek &amp; Co, which employed a half-dozen of workmen, produced approximately two hundred watches of quality per annum. The few preserved specimens make it possible to note the degree of perfection of these first watches, result of a successful union between artistic research and the technical skill.&lt;ref name="Swiss Watch Authority"/&gt;

Among the collection of [[The Patek Philippe Museum]] there are watches presenting Coat of Arms of Princess [[Zubów]] (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=1&amp;from=tl&amp;year=1845]) from 1845 and the portraits of Polish general [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], and Polish prince and marchal of France [[Józef Poniatowski]] (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=4&amp;themeId=1&amp;floorId=First]) from 1948.

== Patek &amp; Co. (1845–1851)  ==

Increasing disagreement between Patek and Czapek obliged the latter to withdraw. In 1851 Czapek established Czapek &amp; Co. where he produced watches until 1869. On May 15, 1845 the place vacated by Czapek was filled by the 30-year-old French watchmaker [[Adrien Philippe]], who in 1842 invented the key-less winding mechanism.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patekmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus_a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patek"/&gt;

== Patek Philippe &amp; Co. ==
{{main article|Patek Philippe &amp; Co.}}
[[File:Patek Philippe p1070011.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Exclusive clock of Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]]

On January 1, 1851 Patek &amp; Co. transformed into [[Patek Philippe &amp; Co.]]. The company started mass production of pocket watches.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus_a" /&gt;

Both co-owners recognised perfection as their ideal, and the company gained its success thanks to principles that Antoni Patek left to his descendants:
* the quality of produced watches maintained on the highest possible level,
* the ability of implementing new inventions and constructive solutions.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

The "Queen Victoria" (see picture [http://www.patekmuseum.com/EN/theWatch.asp?id=7&amp;themeId=2&amp;floorId=First]) open-face keyless-winding watch was presented to [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom during the Great Exhibition of London at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] ([[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]), on August 18, 1851.&lt;ref name="Watch Detail"/&gt;

In 1868, Patek Philippe made their first [[wristwatch]], which was sold on November 13, 1876 to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Countess Koscowicz.&lt;ref name="Watch Detail1"/&gt; They have also pioneered in perpetual calendar, [[chronograph]] and minute repeater in watches.&lt;ref name="patek2"/&gt;

Looking for trade contacts Patek travelled among others to England (1847), USA (1854), and Russia (1858).&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;

After Patek's death the company changed its owners several times; since 1929 Patek Philippe &amp; Co. has been owned by the Stern family, but kept its original name. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. issues collectable watches every year, and till today has remained a coveted luxury brand. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. is the only [[Geneva]] watch manufacturer honoured with the [[Geneva seal]]. Of all the movements bearing the Geneva Seal distinction, 95% are Patek Philippe &amp; Co. timepieces. The company does not cease in its efforts to innovate its products. Patek Philippe &amp; Co. has been awarded more than 70 patents, since implementing in 1845 the stem winding system. The 20 most expensive wristwatches sold at auction are all from Patek Philippe &amp; Co. The [[Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication]] watch made in 1933 holds the world record for the most expensive watch—sold at auction in 1999 for more than $11 million.&lt;ref name="patek3"/&gt;

The Sky Moon Tourbillon Ref 5002 is currently the world most complex complication timepiece.  At present only 3 pieces are produced a year.  Owners of these watches are selected by Patek Co as they are highly sought after.  They are sold primarily to collectors rather than traders so as to avoid the flipping of watches for profits.

== Patek's political life ==

In 1843, Patek was naturalized in [[Geneva]] and thus acquired [[Switzerland|Swiss]] nationality. However, he did not cease his political activity of a [[Poland|Polish]] emigrant and did not stop in his efforts to bring his assistance to the refugees. Thus, in 1838, he supported the initiative of a group of [[Poland|Polish]] emigrants for the establishment of "Polish Foundation", organization of mutual aid which was founded the following year and of which he became the treasurer and one of the most active members. In May 1844, he took part in the installation of a Polish Library with a salon of lecture in [[Geneva]]. Persuaded of the need for a centralization of the organizations of [[Poland|Polish]] emigrants, he recommended to the Poles residing in [[Geneva]] to collaborate with the commission of the "Funds of Polish Emigration" and the "Polish Library" of Paris. In the years 1843, 1845 and 1847 he requested the support of prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] for this Society. On May 18, 1846, Patek adhered to the [[Polish Democratic Society]] of [[Lyon]] and, during the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848, he went secretly to [[Frankfurt am Main]] to propose there, at the time of the meeting on March 6 of [[Dozór Polski]], the convocation of the Polish Parliament in exile.&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

The political activities of Patek during the [[January Uprising]] in 1863 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Polacy nad Lemanem w XIX wieku|last = Dąbrowski|first = Krysztof|publisher = Wydawn. Polskiego Tow. Wydawców Książek|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; were described by [[Julian Aleksander Bałaszwicz]], writing under the pseudonym of [[Albert Potocki]]. After the crushing of the insurrection, Patek brought his assistance to the refugees arriving to [[Geneva]] and maintained the relations with the [[Wiktionary:congregation|Congregation]] of the [[Resurrection of Our Lord Jesus Christ]], (Polish: ''Zmartwychwstańcy''), in Paris. Thereafter, the pope [[Pius IX]] conferred on Patek the title of [[count]], in recognition of the services rendered as well as an active [[Catholic]], as within the community of the Polish emigrants. Unfortunately, the files of the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]] do not preserve documents providing information about the date and the nature of this distinction.&lt;ref name="zegarkiclub" /&gt;&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

Antoni Patek died in [[Geneva]] and was buried in a local cemetery in [[Chatelaine, Switzerland|Chatelaine]].&lt;ref name="worldtempus" /&gt;

'''Business journalism''' is the part of [[journalism]] that tracks, records, analyzes and interprets the [[business sector | business]], [[Economy|economic]] and [[finance | financial]] activities and changes that take place in societies. Topics widely cover the entire purview of all [[commerce | commercial]] [[economic activity|activities]] related to the economy.

This area of journalism provides news and feature [[Article (publishing)|articles]] about people, places and issues related to the [[business sector]]. Most{{quantify|date=February 2018}} newspapers, magazines, radio, and television-news shows include a business segment. Detailed and in-depth business journalism may appear in publications, radio, and television channels dedicated specifically to business and financial journalism.

== History ==
Business journalism began as early as the [[Middle Ages]], to help well-known trading families communicate with each other.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournalismhistory.org/main_frame.htm |title=main_frame.htm |work=History of Business Journalism |publisher=Carolina Business News Initiative, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Journalism and Mass Communication]] |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Around 1700, [[Daniel Defoe]]--best known for his novels especially ''Robinson Crusoe''-- began publishing business and economic news.&lt;ref&gt;Margarett A. James, and Dorothy F. Tucker. "Daniel Defoe, Journalist." ''Business History Review'' 2.1 (1928): 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882 [[Charles Dow]], [[Edward Jones (statistician)|Edward Jones]] and Charles Bergstresser began a wire service that delivered news to investment houses along Wall Street.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; And in 1889, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' began publishing.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; While the famous muckraking journalist [[Ida Tarbell]] did not consider herself to be a business reporter, her reporting and writing about the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Co.]] in 1902 provided the template for how thousands of business journalists have covered companies ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://businessjournalism.org/pages/biz/2008/05/taking_on_the_trust/ |title=Book Reviews: Taking on the Trust |last1=Roush |first1=Chris |date=May 2008 |publisher=BusinessJournalism.org |accessdate=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708010519/http://businessjournalism.org/pages/biz/2008/05/taking_on_the_trust/ |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business coverage gained prominence in the 1990s, with wider investment in the [[stock market]]. ''The Wall Street Journal'' is one prominent example of business journalism, and is among the [[United States|United States of America]]'s top newspapers in terms of both [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] and respect for the [[journalist]]s whose work appears there.

== Personnel ==
Journalists who work in this branch are classed as "business journalists". Their main task is to gather information about current events as they related to business. They may also cover processes, trends, consequences, and important people, in business and disseminate their work through all types of mass media.

== Scope ==
Business journalism, although common in most industrialized countries, has a very limited role in [[Third World|third-world]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]]. This leaves citizens of such countries in a very disadvantaged position locally and internationally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Recent efforts to bring business media to these countries have proven to be worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/191013/index.en.shtml |title=Enlightening entrepreneurs |last1=Luesby |first1=Jenny |date=February 2011 |at=Focus, Page 62 |journal=D+C Development and Cooperation |volume=52 |number=2 |publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]] (GIZ) |accessdate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809030853/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/191013/index.en.shtml |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business metadata''' is data that adds business context to other data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It provides information authored by business people and/or used by business people.  It is in contrast to [[technical metadata]], which is data used in the storage and structure of the data in a [[database]] or system. Technical metadata includes the database table name and column name, data type, indexes referencing the data, [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] jobs involving the data, when the data was last updated, accessed, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
According to noted author and columnist Lowell Fryman, "The essence of business metadata is in reducing or eliminating the barriers of communication between human and human, as well as human and computer, so that the data conveyed from reports, information systems, or business intelligence applications can be crystal clear, can facilitate business operations, and can be leveraged for all business decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/news/2240111047/What-is-metadata-Solutions-for-leveraging-technical-and-business-metadata|title=What is metadata? Solutions for leveraging technical and business metadata|work=SearchDataManagement|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Linstedt, creator of the [[Data vault modeling|Data Vault]] methodology, says business metadata "...provide[s] definition of the functionality, definition of the data, definition of the elements, and definition of how the data is used within business...business metadata includes business requirements, time-lines, business metrics, business process flows, and business terminology."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/linstedt/archives/2006/07/technical_versu.php|title=Technical versus Business Metadata - classifications - Blog: Dan E. Linstedt - BeyeNETWORK|website=www.b-eye-network.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business metadata is important because it can greatly facilitate the usefulness of the data to business people.  A simple example of business metadata is a glossary entry.  Hover functionality in an application or web form can enable a glossary definition to be shown when cursor is on a field or term.

Other examples of business metadata include annotation ability within applications.  For example, a business user may be viewing a [[business intelligence]] (BI) report and notice a trend in the data.  The user may have background knowledge as to why this trend occurs.  Some business intelligence tools enable the user to create an annotation within the report that explains the trend.  Such an annotation can enhance other users' understanding of the data.  This example is especially powerful because it is created by a business user for the use of other business people.

== Examples ==
Other examples of business metadata are:
* Business rules
* Data quality rules
* Valid values for reference data
* Wikis 
* Collaboration software

'''The Centre for India &amp; Global Business''' ('''CIGB''') was launched in March 2009 as part of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]], to support the university’s growing engagement with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-india.org/ Cambridge-India Partnership].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a research centre and an engagement platform CIGB is dedicated to the study of India's rapidly expanding role in the global [[knowledge economy]].

==History==
CIGB was established with initial funding from the [[BP]] foundation. The academic director of CIGB is [[Jaideep Prabhu|Professor Jaideep Prabhu]], the first [[University of Cambridge|Jawaharlal Nehru Professor of Indian Business and Enterprise]] at the University of Cambridge, who took up the post in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2008050202 Appointment of the first Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at Cambridge], press release from Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; The founding Executive Director of CIGB was [[Navi Radjou]], who served between January 2009 and June 2011. The Centre has 14 other academic members, including [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] faculty and PhD students.

==Research activities==
CIGB conducts research in collaboration with a global network of academic partners around three complementary themes:
*''India as a global innovation hub'': how and why firms from around the world are increasingly locating their global R&amp;D and innovation activities in India
*''Indian firms going global'': how Indian firms are going global on the back of innovation in India or in order to become more innovative relative to global competitors
*''Co-innovation with the'' [[bottom of the pyramid|''bottom of the socio-economic pyramid'']] (mass markets): how multinational and Indian firms are engaging those who live on less than $5 a day as value-adding partners through innovative products, services and business models.
A major issue underlying these three themes is how India is emerging as a learning laboratory for affordable and sustainable innovation to deal with the global challenges of scarcity and diversity.

The academic projects undertaken by CIGB involve field research in India which CIGB-related faculty visit frequently in order to collect data and conduct interviews with local policy-makers, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|title=Cambridge-India Activity: : University of Cambridge: Cambridge and India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831222345/http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|archivedate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIGB produces case studies that feed into its outreach and networks activities. Its research has been featured in leading newspapers and magazines worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation The New Shape of Innovation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725141517/http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |date=July 25, 2010 }}, Global Intelligence for the CIO, 19 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and networks==
CIGB also hosts conferences and seminars that bring together academics, corporate leaders, and policy-makers from all over the world to discuss and disseminate latest research findings as well as policy and industry best practices. These events are hosted both in Cambridge as well as in major Indian cities. For instance, in March 2009, Professor Jaideep Prabhu, Director of CIGB, delivered his inaugural lecture in [[New Delhi]], which was chaired by Mr [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Deputy Chairman of the Indian Planning Commission. In May 2009, CIGB hosted in [[Cambridge]] a major conference titled “''Innovation in India and China: How to Create Value from Emerging Markets'',” which explored the rise of [[India]] and [[China]] as both fast-growing global markets and world-class sources of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009050105|title=Latest news|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090518_innovation/index.html Proceedings from the “Innovation in India and China” conference], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, CIGB has also hosted a number of speakers including: [[Nandan Nilekani]], Chairman of the new [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) and former Co-Chairman of [[Infosys Technologies]] (April 2009); former Indian president [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam|Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]](June 2009);&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge-India Partnership, Cambridge-India Activitiy, September 2008 onwards, University of Cambridge [http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090603_abdul_kalam.html Creative Leadership in the Global Knowledge Economy], Dr Abdul Kalam’s lecture at Judge Business School, 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravi Kant (Indian executive)|Ravi Kant]], Vice-Chairman of [[Tata Motors]]; and Dr [[Ramesh Mashelkar]], former Director General of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], who delivered the inaugural BP Annual Lecture at Cambridge Judge Business Business on 21 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2010/100621_mashelkar.html Visit of Dr R.A. Mashelkar to Cambridge], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online engagement==
In November 2009, at the [[World Economic Forum]]’s India Economic Summit, CIGB launched Indovations.Net, an interactive, multimedia website that educates users worldwide about innovations in India across five domains: business, social, energy/environment, art/culture, and science &amp; technology. This website addresses a fundamental questions such as, What can the world learn from India-inspired innovation — or [[Indovation]] — and how people can benefit from it, etc.

Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou write [[blog]] posts on innovation, [[emerging markets]], and global leadership on the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/search/radjou%25252520prabhu/ Blog posts by Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou], [http://hbr.org/ HBR.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Babbage''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KH|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|b|ɪ|dʒ}}; 26 December 1791&amp;nbsp;– 18 October 1871) was an English [[polymath]].&lt;ref name="Whalen1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Whalen|title=Edgar Allan Poe and the masses: the political economy of literature in antebellum America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slR0DNOxT00C&amp;pg=PA254|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-00199-9|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable [[computer]].&lt;ref name="babb"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computing-history/|title=The Modern History of Computing (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|last=Copeland|first=B.

Considered by some to be a "[[computer pioneer|father of the computer]]",&lt;ref name="babb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Halacy, Daniel Stephen | title = Charles Babbage, Father of the Computer | year = 1970 | publisher=Crowell-Collier Press | isbn = 978-0-02-741370-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/about/babbage.html|title=Charles Babbage Institute: Who Was Charles Babbage?|website=www.cbi.umn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Swade, Doron | title=The Difference Engine: Charles Babbage and the Quest to Build the First Computer. | publisher=Penguin | year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage is credited with inventing the first [[mechanical computer]] that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref name="babb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Newman, M.H.A. | title=General Principles of the Design of All-Purpose Computing Machines | year=1948 | publisher=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, series A, 195 | pages=271–274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century.&lt;ref name="Whalen1999"/&gt;

Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the [[London Science Museum|Science Museum]] in London. In 1991, a functioning [[difference engine]] was constructed from Babbage's original plans. Built to [[engineering tolerance|tolerances]] achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have worked.

Babbage's birthplace is disputed, but according to the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' he was most likely born at 44 Crosby Row, [[Walworth Road]], London, England.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=962|title=Babbage, Charles|first=Doron|last=Swade}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[blue plaque]] on the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road commemorates the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque | 1140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His date of birth was given in his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' as 26 December 1792; but then a nephew wrote to say that Babbage was born one year earlier, in 1791. The parish register of [[Stoke Newington (parish)#Ecclesiastical parish|St. Mary's]], [[Newington, London|Newington]], London, shows that Babbage was [[Baptism|baptised]] on 6 January 1792, supporting a birth year of 1791.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hyman|1982|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moseley | first = Maboth | title = Irascible Genius, The Life of Charles Babbage | publisher=Henry Regnery | location = Chicago | year = 1964 | page = 29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELAMAQAAIAAJ |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = [[s:The Times/The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S.|The Late Mr. Charles Babbage, F.R.S]] |work=The Times |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage was one of four children of Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Teape. His father was a banking partner of [[William Praed]] in founding Praed's &amp; Co. of [[Fleet Street]], London, in 1801.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Members Constituencies Parliaments Surveys |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1790-1820/member/praed-william-1747-1833 |title=''Praed, William (1747–1833), of Tyringham, Bucks. and Trevethoe, nr.

Around the age of eight, Babbage was sent to a country school in [[Alphington, Devon|Alphington]] near Exeter to recover from a life-threatening fever. For a short time he attended [[King Edward VI Community College#Grammar school|King Edward VI Grammar School]] in [[Totnes]], South Devon, but his health forced him back to private tutors for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moseley|1964|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage then joined the 30-student [[Holmwood Academy]], in Baker Street, [[Municipal Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[Middlesex]], under the Reverend Stephen Freeman. The academy had a library that prompted Babbage's love of mathematics. He studied with two more private tutors after leaving the academy. The first was a clergyman near [[Cambridge]]; through him Babbage encountered [[Charles Simeon]] and his evangelical followers, but the tuition was not what he needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought home, to study at the Totnes school: this was at age 16 or 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was an Oxford tutor, under whom Babbage reached a level in Classics sufficient to be accepted by Cambridge.

==At the University of Cambridge==
Babbage arrived at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], in October 1810.&lt;ref name = Venn&gt;{{acad | id = BBG810C | name = Babbage, Charles }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. S. Leedham-Green|title=A Concise History of the University of Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvScOaG7mHYC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=26 September 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43978-7|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had read in [[Robert Woodhouse]], [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], and [[Marie Agnesi]]. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical instruction available at the university.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Babbage, [[John Herschel]], [[George Peacock]], and several other friends formed the [[Analytical Society]] in 1812; they were also close to [[Edward Ryan (barrister)|Edward Ryan]].&lt;ref name = wilkes&gt;Wilkes (2002) ''p.''355&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as [[The Ghost Club]], concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be committed to one.&lt;ref name = GEB&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofstadter | first = Douglas R. | authorlink = Douglas Hofstadter | title = Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | origyear = 1979| year = 2000 | page = 726 | title-link = Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allsands&gt;{{cite web | title = Charles Babbage'S Computer Engines | url = http://www.allsands.com/history/objects/history/objects/babbagecomputer_yy_gn.htm | accessdate = 13 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130430112345/http://www.allsands.com/history/objects/history/objects/babbagecomputer_yy_gn.htm | archivedate = 30 April 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Babbage transferred to [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = Venn/&gt; He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in the preliminary public disputation; but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==After Cambridge==
Considering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the [[Royal Institution]] on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1816.&lt;ref name="Essinger"&gt;{{cite book |author=James Essinger |title=Jacquard's Web |year=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280578-2 |page=59 and 98}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in the way of career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at [[Haileybury College]]; he had recommendations from [[James Ivory (mathematician)|James Ivory]] and [[John Playfair]], but lost out to [[Henry Walter (antiquary)|Henry Walter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raymond Flood|author2=Adrian Rice|author3=Robin Wilson|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmzfJUShGYUC&amp;pg=PA145|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960139-4|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the [[Society of Arcueil]], meeting leading French mathematicians and physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=George Green: Mathematician and Physicist, 1793–1841: The Background to His Life and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2Y2eb9IzwwC&amp;pg=PA255|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=2001|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-89871-463-0|page=255 note 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Babbage applied to be professor at the [[University of Edinburgh]], with the recommendation of [[Pierre Simon Laplace]]; the post went to [[William Wallace (mathematician)|William Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger Hahn|title=Pierre Simon Laplace: 1749 – 1827; a Determined Scientist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROu0P-pYQekC&amp;pg=PA295|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01892-1|pages=295 note 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=28545|title=Wallace, William|first=Maria|last=Panteki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Edinburgh magazine, and literary miscellany, a new series of The Scots magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NsEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=1819|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of [[Arago's rotations]], publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by [[Michael Faraday]]. The phenomena are now part of the theory of [[eddy current]]s, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of [[electromagnetic theory]], staying close to [[Ampère's force law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Pearce Williams |title=Michael Faraday |year=1965 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80299-7 |pages=170–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage purchased the actuarial tables of [[George Barrett (actuary)|George Barrett]], who died in 1821 leaving unpublished work, and surveyed the field in 1826 in ''Comparative View of the Various Institutions for the Assurance of Lives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=1523|title=Barrett, George|first=Robert|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interest followed a project to set up an insurance company, prompted by [[Francis Baily]] and mooted in 1824, but not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&amp;pg=PA29|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage did calculate actuarial tables for that scheme, using [[Equitable Society]] mortality data from 1762 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this whole period Babbage depended awkwardly on his father's support, given his father's attitude to his early marriage, of 1814: he and Edward Ryan wedded the Whitmore sisters. He made a home in [[Marylebone]] in London, and founded a large family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James|title=Remarkable Engineers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bwb5bevubwC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48625-5|page=45|date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On his father's death in 1827, Babbage inherited a large estate (value around £100,000, equivalent to £{{Format price|{{Inflation|UK|100000|1827}}}} or ${{Format price|{{To USD|{{Inflation|UK|100000|1827}}|GBR}}}} today), making him independently wealthy.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; After his wife's death in the same year he spent time travelling. In Italy he met [[Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], foreshadowing a later visit to Piedmont.&lt;ref name="Essinger"/&gt; In April 1828 he was in Rome, and relying on Herschel to manage the difference engine project, when he heard that he had become professor at Cambridge, a position he had three times failed to obtain (in 1820, 1823 and 1826).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin C.

===Royal Astronomical Society===
Babbage was instrumental in founding the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1820, initially known as the Astronomical Society of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Babbage.html|title=Babbage biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original aims were to reduce astronomical calculations to a more standard form, and to circulate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These directions were closely connected with Babbage's ideas on computation, and in 1824 he won its [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society|Gold Medal]], cited "for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables".

Babbage's motivation to overcome errors in tables by mechanisation has been a commonplace since [[Dionysius Lardner]] wrote about it in 1834 in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' (under Babbage's guidance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Raymond Flood|author2=Adrian Rice|author3=Robin Wilson|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=29 September 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-162794-1|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harro Maas|title=William Stanley Jevons and the Making of Modern Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGWvA6SiWfMC&amp;pg=PA201|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=4 April 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82712-6|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The context of these developments is still debated. Babbage's own account of the origin of the difference engine begins with the Astronomical Society's wish to improve ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]''. Babbage and Herschel were asked to oversee a trial project, to recalculate some part of those tables. With the results to hand, discrepancies were found. This was in 1821 or 1822, and was the occasion on which Babbage formulated his idea for mechanical computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Norton Wise|title=The values of precision|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8uvNtuPhgUC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=17 March 1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01601-6|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of the ''Nautical Almanac'' is now described as a legacy of a polarisation in British science caused by attitudes to [[Sir Joseph Banks]], who had died in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eleanor Robson|author2=Jacqueline Stedall|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIMiWHVKLDkC&amp;pg=RA1-PR34|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=18 December 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-160744-8|page=xxxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Difference engine plate 1853.jpg|thumb|A portion of the [[difference engine]]]]
Babbage studied the requirements to establish a modern [[postal system]], with his friend [[Thomas Frederick Colby]], concluding there should be a uniform rate that was put into effect with the introduction of the [[Uniform Fourpenny Post]] supplanted by the [[Uniform Penny Post]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1839 and 1840. Colby was another of the founding group of the Society.&lt;ref name="Hyman1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in charge of the [[Survey of Ireland]]. Herschel and Babbage were present at a celebrated operation of that survey, the remeasuring of the [[Lough Foyle]] baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Royal Institution of Great Britain|title=Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxNcKnmdDTIC&amp;pg=PA518|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1858|page=518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Lagrangian School===
The Analytical Society had initially been no more than an undergraduate provocation. During this period it had some more substantial achievements. In 1816 Babbage, Herschel and Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of [[Sylvestre Lacroix]], which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constructing a Bridge: An Exploration of Engineering Culture, Design, and Research in Nineteenth-century France and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6P66Ofj6DiYC&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-11217-8|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference to Lagrange in calculus terms marks out the application of what are now called [[formal power series]]. British mathematicians had used them from about 1730 to 1760. As re-introduced, they were not simply applied as notations in [[differential calculus]]. They opened up the fields of [[functional equation]]s (including the [[difference equation]]s fundamental to the difference engine) and operator ([[D-module]]) methods for [[differential equation]]s.  The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing Δ to D, as a "finite" difference becomes "infinitesimal". These symbolic directions became popular, as [[operational calculus]], and pushed to the point of diminishing returns. The [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|Cauchy concept of limit]] was kept at bay.&lt;ref name="Guicciardini2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Niccolò Guicciardini]]|title=The Development of Newtonian Calculus in Britain, 1700–1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIKVQCeI1FUC&amp;pg=PA138|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=13 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52484-1|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodhouse had already founded this second "British Lagrangian School" with its treatment of [[Taylor series]] as formal.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dov M. Gabbay|author2=John Woods|title=British Logic in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UULl07dutBwC&amp;pg=PA403|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=10 March 2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-055701-4|pages=403–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context [[function composition]] is complicated to express, because the [[chain rule]] is not simply applied to second and higher derivatives. This matter was known to Woodhouse by 1803, who took from [[Louis François Antoine Arbogast]] what is now called [[Faà di Bruno's formula]]. In essence it was known to [[Abraham De Moivre]] (1697). Herschel found the method impressive, Babbage knew of it, and it was later noted by [[Ada Lovelace]] as compatible with the [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Craik 2005, pp. 122–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the period to 1820 Babbage worked intensively on functional equations in general, and resisted both conventional [[finite difference]]s and Arbogast's approach (in which Δ and D were related by the simple additive case of the [[exponential function|exponential map]]). But via Herschel he was influenced by Arbogast's ideas in the matter of [[iterated function|iteration]], i.e. composing a function with itself, possibly many times.&lt;ref name="GabbayWoods2008"/&gt; Writing in a major paper on functional equations in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' (1815/6), Babbage said his starting point was work of [[Gaspard Monge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeremy J. Gray|author2=Karen Hunger Parshall|title=Episodes in the History of Modern Algebra (1800–1950)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQijZjoTKnIC&amp;pg=PA19|accessdate=26 April 2013|date=31 August 2011|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-7257-4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic==
From 1828 to 1839 Babbage was [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at Cambridge. Not a conventional resident [[university don|don]], and inattentive to teaching, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: [[George Biddell Airy]], his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Biddell Airy#Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; thought an issue should be made of his lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on [[political economy]]. Babbage's reforming direction looked to see university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; but [[William Whewell]] found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with [[Richard Jones (economist)|Richard Jones]] lasted for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin C. Knox|title=From Newton to Hawking: A History of Cambridge University's Lucasian Professors of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGX_rAeia4kC&amp;pg=PA284|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=6 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-66310-6|pages=284–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never did give a lecture.&lt;ref name="Th35"&gt;{{ThoemmesBritish19C|Babbage, Charles|35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that Babbage tried to enter politics. [[Simon Schaffer]] writes that his views of the 1830s included [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]], a broader [[political franchise]], and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin C.

Babbage now emerged as a [[polemicist]]. One of his biographers notes that all his books contain a "campaigning element". His ''Reflections on the Decline of Science and some of its Causes'' (1830) stands out, however, for its sharp attacks. It aimed to improve British science, and more particularly to oust [[Davies Gilbert]] as President of the Royal Society, which Babbage wished to reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Hyman|title=Charles Babbage: Pioneer Of The Computer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCddaWqWK2cC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=1 January 1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-02377-9|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written out of pique, when Babbage hoped to become the junior secretary of the Royal Society, as Herschel was the senior, but failed because of his antagonism to [[Humphry Davy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James|title=Remarkable Engineers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bwb5bevubwC&amp;pg=PA47|accessdate=27 April 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48625-5|page=47|date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Faraday had a reply written, by [[Gerrit Moll]], as ''On the Alleged Decline of Science in England'' (1831).&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Richard Holmes (biographer)|Richard Holmes]]|title=The Age of Wonder|year=2008 |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=978-0-375-42222-5 |pages=437–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the front of the Royal Society Babbage had no impact, with the bland election of the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]] to succeed Gilbert the same year. As a broad manifesto, on the other hand, his ''Decline'' led promptly to the formation in 1831 of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] (BAAS).&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

The ''[[Mechanics' Magazine]]'' in 1831 identified as Declinarians the followers of Babbage. In an unsympathetic tone it pointed out [[David Brewster]] writing in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' as another leader; with the barb that both Babbage and Brewster had received public money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mechanics' Magazine, Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tQ3AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=1831|publisher=M. Salmon|pages=373–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate of the period on statistics (''qua'' data collection) and what is now [[statistical inference]], the BAAS in its Statistical Section (which owed something also to [[William Whewell|Whewell]]) opted for data collection. This Section was the sixth, established in 1833 with Babbage as chairman and [[John Elliot Drinkwater]] as secretary.

Babbage published ''On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures'' (1832), on the organisation of industrial production. It was an influential early work of [[operational research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ThoemmesBritish19C|Babbage, Charles|39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rennie the Younger]] in addressing the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] on manufacturing in 1846 mentioned mostly surveys in encyclopaedias, and Babbage's book was first an article in the ''[[Encyclopædia Metropolitana]]'', the form in which Rennie noted it, in the company of related works by [[John Farey, Jr.]], [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] and [[Andrew Ure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles Manby]]|title=Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institute of Civil Engineers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBMFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1846|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''An essay on the general principles which regulate the application of machinery to manufactures and the mechanical arts'' (1827), which became the ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana'' article of 1829, Babbage developed the schematic classification of machines that, combined with discussion of factories, made up the first part of the book. The second part considered the "domestic and political economy" of manufactures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Lucertini|author2=Ana Millán Gasca|author3=Fernando Nicolò|title=Technological Concepts and Mathematical Models in the Evolution of Modern Engineering Systems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YISIUycS4HgC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-7643-6940-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not, in its first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy; the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on [[piece rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maxine Berg|title=The Machinery Question and the Making of Political Economy 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azk7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=4 February 1982|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28759-3|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and [[profit sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce E.

===="Babbage principle"====
In ''Economy of Machinery'' was described what is now called the "Babbage principle". It pointed out commercial advantages available with more careful [[division of labour]]. As Babbage himself noted, it had already appeared in the work of [[Melchiorre Gioia]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julio Segura|author2=Carlos Rodríguez Braun|title=An Eponymous Dictionary of Economics: A Guide To Laws And Theorems Named After Economists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6Oy4L-6LSwC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-360-5|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced in 1974 by [[Harry Braverman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0332ru3Rx0sC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4678-7|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related formulations are the "principle of multiples" of [[Philip Sargant Florence]], and the "balance of processes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

What Babbage remarked is that skilled workers typically spend parts of their time performing tasks that are below their skill level. If the labour process can be divided among several workers, labour costs may be cut by assigning only high-skill tasks to high-cost workers, restricting other tasks to lower-paid workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Giddens, Anthony|author2=Held, David|title=Classes, Power and Conflict: Classical and Contemporary Debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cT7xzRMCLUC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1982|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04627-6|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also pointed out that training or apprenticeship can be taken as fixed costs; but that [[returns to scale]] are available by his approach of standardisation of tasks, therefore again favouring the [[factory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guang-Zhen Sun|title=Readings in the Economics of the Division of Labor: The classical tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y16MEasCqicC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=2005|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-270-127-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view of [[human capital]] was restricted to minimising the time period for recovery of training costs.&lt;ref name="ArtiguesCalvet2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pere Mir Artigues|author2=Josep Gonza ́lez Calvet|title=Funds, Flows and Time: An Alternative Approach to the Microeconomic Analysis of Productive Activities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1n1LWVyTWoC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-71291-6|page=72 note 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publishing====
Another aspect of the work was its detailed breakdown of the cost structure of book publishing. Babbage took the unpopular line, from the publishers' perspective, of exposing the trade's profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

====Influence====
It has been written that "what [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] was to agriculture, Charles Babbage was to the [[factory visit]] and machinery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashworth|first=William J.|date=1996|title=Memory, Efficiency, and Symbolic Analysis: Charles Babbage, John Herschel, and the Industrial Mind|journal=Isis|volume=87|issue=4|pages=629–653|jstor=235196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage's theories are said to have influenced the layout of the [[1851 Great Exhibition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=PeterH Hoffenberg|title=An Empire on Display: English, Indian, and Australian Exhibitions from the Crystal Palace to the Great War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejEwvWvGwVUC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21891-8|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his views had a strong effect on his contemporary [[George Julius Poulett Scrope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maxine Berg|title=The Machinery Question and the Making of Political Economy 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azk7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=4 February 1982|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-28759-3|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] argued that the source of the [[productivity]] of the factory system was exactly the combination of the division of labour with machinery, building on [[Adam Smith]], Babbage and Ure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ákos Róna-Tas|title=The Great Surprise of the Small Transformation: The Demise of Communism and the Rise of the Private Sector of Hungary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npl_KOAojT4C&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=1997|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-10795-7|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where Marx picked up on Babbage and disagreed with Smith was on the motivation for division of labour by the manufacturer: as Babbage did, he wrote that it was for the sake of [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]], rather than productivity, and identified an impact on the concept of a [[trade (occupation)|trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ben Fine|author2=Alfredo Saad-Filho|author3=Marco Boffo|title=The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe0VQArHt8sC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-78100-122-6|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ruskin]] went further, to oppose completely what manufacturing in Babbage's sense stood for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1LPEMLG98mgC&amp;pg=PA52|accessdate=8 May 2013|year=2011|publisher=V2_ publishing|isbn=978-90-5662-827-7|pages=52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage also affected the economic thinking of [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Patrice L.

Mary Boole, the wife of Babbage's collaborator [[George Boole]] claimed that there was profound influence {{mdash}} via her uncle [[George Everest]] {{mdash}} of [[India]]n thought in general and [[Indian logic]], in particular, on him and on George Boole, as well as on [[Augustus De Morgan]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830–65. What share had it in generating the [[Vector Analysis]] and the mathematics by which investigations in physical science are now conducted?&lt;ref name=MaryBoole/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Natural theology===
In 1837, responding to the series of eight ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'', Babbage published his ''[[Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]]'', under the title ''On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation''. In this work Babbage weighed in on the side of [[uniformitarianism]] in a current debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genesis and Geology: A Study in the Relations of Scientific Thought, Natural Theology, and Social Opinion in Great Britain, 1790–1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PKERMZkA9A0C&amp;pg=PA247|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-34481-5|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred the conception of creation in which a God-given [[natural law]] dominated, removing the need for continuous "contrivance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John G.

The book is a work of [[natural theology]], and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with [[Charles Lyell]].&lt;ref&gt;Note I, in [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/1838_Bridgewater_A25/1838_Bridgewater_A25.html darwin-online.org.uk, ''Babbage, Charles. 1838. The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. 2d edn. London: John Murray.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator.  In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion; on the one hand, he insisted that ''"there exists no fatal collision between the words of [[The Bible|Scripture]] and the facts of nature;"'' on the one hand, he wrote the [[Book of Genesis]] was not meant to be read literally in relation to scientific terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote ''"that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of [[Moses]] remains unimpeached, we may also be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses."''&lt;ref&gt;Babbage, [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/bridgewater/b4.htm Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]. Chapter V. Further View of the same Subject. The Victorian Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise was quoted extensively in ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some time about 1825, [Everest] came to England for two or three years, and made a fast and lifelong friendship with Herschel and with Babbage, who was then quite young. I would ask any fair-minded mathematician to read Babbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise and compare it with the works of his contemporaries in England; and then ask himself whence came the peculiar conception of the nature of miracle which underlies Babbage's ideas of Singular Points on Curves (Chap, viii) – from European Theology or Hindu Metaphysic? Oh! how the English clergy of that day hated Babbage's book!&lt;ref name="MaryBoole"&gt;{{cite book |author=Boole, Mary Everest |chapter=Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century |editor1=Cobham, E.M. |editor2=Dummer, E.S. |title=Boole, Mary Everest "Collected Works" |publisher=Daniel |location=London |year=1931 |pages=947–967 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5wyxULAKpsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religious views ===
Babbage was raised in the Protestant form of the Christian faith, his family having inculcated in him an orthodox form of worship.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Chapter II#8|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained:

{{quote|My excellent mother taught me the usual forms of my daily and nightly prayer; and neither in my father nor my mother was there any mixture of bigotry and intolerance on the one hand, nor on the other of that unbecoming and familiar mode of addressing the Almighty which afterwards so much disgusted me in my youthful years.|Babbage, (1864)}}

Rejecting the [[Athanasian Creed]] as a "direct contradiction in terms", in his youth he looked to [[Samuel Clarke]]'s works on religion, of which ''Being and Attributes of God'' (1704) exerted a particularly strong influence on him. Later in life, Babbage concluded that ''the true value of the Christian religion rested, not on speculative [theology] &amp;hellip; but &amp;hellip; upon those doctrines of kindness and benevolence which that religion claims and enforces, not merely in favour of man himself but of every creature susceptible of pain or of happiness.''&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Chapter XXX#404|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography [[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), Babbage wrote a whole chapter on the topic of [[religion]], where he identified three sources of divine knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Chapter XXX#396|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), p. 396&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A priori'' or mystical experience
# From Revelation
# From the examination of the works of the Creator
He stated, on the basis of the [[design argument]], that studying the works of nature had been the more appealing evidence, and the one which led him to actively profess the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (1846). [https://archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1873smit#page/174/mode/2up Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution]. Washington Government Printing Office. Smithsonian Institution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Chapter XXX#403|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), The Athanasian Creed, p. 403: "In the course of my inquiries, I met with the work upon the Trinity, by Dr. Samuel Clarke. This I carefully examined, and although very far from being satisfied, I ceased from further inquiry. This change arose probably from my having acquired the much more valuable work of the same author, on the Being and Attributes of God. This I studied, and felt that its doctrine was much more intelligible and satisfactory than that of the former work. I may now state, as the result of a long life spent in studying the works of the Creator, that I am satisfied they afford far more satisfactory and more convincing proofs of the existence of a supreme Being than any evidence transmitted through human testimony can possibly supply."&lt;/ref&gt; Advocating for natural theology, he wrote:
{{quote|In the works of the Creator ever open to our examination, we possess a firm basis on which to raise the superstructure of an enlightened creed. The more man inquires into the laws which regulate the material universe, the more he is convinced that all its varied forms arise from the action of a few simple principles ...  The works of the Creator, ever present to our senses, give a living and perpetual testimony of his power and goodness far surpassing any evidence transmitted through human testimony. The testimony of man becomes fainter at every stage of transmission, whilst each new inquiry into the works of the Almighty gives to us more exalted views of his wisdom, his goodness, and his power.|Babbage, (1864),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Chapter XXX#396|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']] (1864), pp. 396–402&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like [[Samuel Vince]], Babbage also wrote a defence of the belief in divine [[miracle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Pickover, Clifford A. (2009). ''The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics.'' Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; Against objections previously posed by [[David Hume]], Babbage advocated for the belief of divine agency, stating "we must not measure the credibility or incredibility of an event by the narrow sphere of our own experience, nor forget that there is a Divine energy which overrides what we familiarly call the laws of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Babbage, Charles. (1864) [[s:Passages from the Life of a Philosopher/Appendix#488|''Passages from the Life of a Philosopher'']], Appendix: "Miracles", p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; He alluded to the limits of human experience, expressing: "all that we see in a miracle is an effect which is new to our observation, and whose cause is concealed. The cause may be beyond the sphere of our observation, and would be thus beyond the familiar sphere of nature; but this does not make the event a violation of any law of nature. The limits of man's observation lie within very narrow boundaries, and it would be arrogance to suppose that the reach of man's power is to form the limits of the natural world."

He wanted to go faster in the same directions, and had little time for the more gentlemanly component of its membership. Indeed, he subscribed to a version of [[conjectural history]] that placed [[industrial society]] as the culmination of human development (and shared this view with Herschel). A clash with [[Roderick Murchison]] led in 1838 to his withdrawal from further involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering Water: James Watt, Henry Cavendish, and the Nineteenth Century 'Water Controversy'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orL4QRlvBfYC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3177-4|pages=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Iwan Rhys Morus|title=Bodies/Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HCSJaqeyrHIC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=8 May 2013|date=1 December 2002|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-695-1|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the same year he sent in his resignation as Lucasian professor, walking away also from the Cambridge struggle with Whewell. His interests became more focussed, on computation and [[metrology]], and on international contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kevin C.

===Metrology programme===
A project announced by Babbage was to tabulate all [[physical constant]]s (referred to as "constants of nature", a phrase in itself a neologism), and then to compile an encyclopaedic work of numerical information. He was a pioneer in the field of "absolute measurement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mario Biagioli|title=The Science studies reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4iS5_AtZUkC&amp;pg=PA459|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1999|publisher=Routledge, Chapman &amp; Hall, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-415-91868-8|pages=459–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas followed on from those of [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]], and were mentioned to [[David Brewster|Brewster]] in 1832. There were to be 19 categories of constants, and [[Ian Hacking]] sees these as reflecting in part Babbage's "eccentric enthusiasms".&lt;ref name="Hacking1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Hacking|title=The Taming of Chance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud7EzIBwQBwC&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=31 August 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-38884-9|pages=55–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage's paper ''On Tables of the Constants of Nature and Art'' was reprinted by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1856, with an added note that the physical tables of [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] "will form a part of the important work proposed in this article".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Board of Regents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bc4rAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=1 May 2013|year=1857|publisher=The Institution|pages=289–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact measurement was also key to the development of machine tools. Here again Babbage is considered a pioneer, with [[Henry Maudslay]], [[William Sellers]], and [[Joseph Whitworth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David F Noble|title=America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism David F.

===Engineer and inventor===
Through the Royal Society Babbage acquired the friendship of the engineer [[Marc Brunel]]. It was through Brunel that Babbage knew of [[Joseph Clement]], and so came to encounter the artisans whom he observed in his work on manufactures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=23 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|pages=28–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage provided an introduction for [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] in 1830, for a contact with the proposed [[Bristol &amp; Birmingham Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[L. T. C. Rolt]] |title=Isambard Kingdom Brunel |year=1982 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0 14 02 1195 0|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out studies, around 1838, to show the superiority of the [[broad gauge]] for railways, used by Brunel's [[Great Western Railway]].&lt;ref name = "passages"&gt;{{harvnb|Babbage|1864|pp=317–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pages=1149–1152 |&lt;!-- at=p. 1151 --&gt;|jstor = 2727614|title = Charles Babbage (1791 + 200 = 1991)|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=29|issue=3|last1 = Stigler|first1 = George J.|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, Babbage invented the [[pilot (locomotive)|pilot]] (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles;&lt;ref name=lee95&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=John A. N.|title=International biographical dictionary of computer pioneers|year=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also constructed a [[dynamometer car]].&lt;ref name = "passages"/&gt; His eldest son, [[Benjamin Herschel Babbage]], worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.&lt;ref name = BBH&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P000074b.htm | title = Babbage, Benjamin Herschel | work=Bright Sparcs Biographical entry | accessdate =15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage also invented an [[ophthalmoscope]], which he gave to [[Thomas Wharton Jones]] for testing. Jones, however, ignored it. The device only came into use after being independently invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=37617|title=Jones, Thomas Wharton|first=W.

===Cryptography===
Babbage achieved notable results in [[cryptography]], though this was still not known a century after his death. [[Letter frequency]] was category 18 of Babbage's tabulation project. [[Joseph Henry]] later defended interest in it, in the absence of the facts, as relevant to the management of [[movable type]].&lt;ref name="Hacking1990"/&gt;

As early as 1845, Babbage had solved a cipher that had been posed as a challenge by his nephew Henry Hollier, and in the process, he made a discovery about ciphers that were based on Vigenère tables.  Specifically, he realized that enciphering plain text with a keyword rendered the cipher text subject to [[modular arithmetic]].&lt;ref name = "Franksen, 1985" /&gt;  During the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s, Babbage broke Vigenère's [[autokey cipher]] as well as the much weaker cipher that is called [[Vigenère cipher]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Cryptography: With Mathematical Foundations in Computer Implementations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34cE8KzUwLgC&amp;pg=PA187|accessdate=19 April 2013|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1763-6|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discovery was kept a military secret, and was not published. Credit for the result was instead given to [[Friedrich Kasiski]], a Prussian infantry officer, who made the same discovery some years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kahn, David L. | title = The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing | year = 1996 | publisher=Scribner | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-83130-5 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1854, Babbage published the solution of a Vigenère cipher, which had been published previously in the ''Journal of the Society of Arts''.&lt;ref name = "Franksen, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Public nuisances===
Babbage involved himself in well-publicised but unpopular campaigns against public nuisances. He once counted all the broken panes of glass of a factory, publishing in 1857 a "Table of the Relative Frequency of the Causes of Breakage of Plate Glass Windows": Of 464 broken panes, 14 were caused by "drunken men, women or boys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Table of the Relative Frequency of Occurrence of the Causes of Breaking of Plate Glass Windows | author=Babbage, Charles | journal=Mechanics Magazine | year = 1857 | volume = 66 | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Babbage, Charles | title = The Works of Charles Babbage | volume = V | year = 1989 | publisher=William Pickering | location = London | page = 137 | editor = Martin Campbell-Kelly | isbn = 978-1-85196-005-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cScKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA417|title=The Insurance cyclopaedia |accessdate=22 February 2011|year=1878|last1=Walford |first1=Cornelius }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage's distaste for commoners ("the Mob") included writing "Observations of Street Nuisances" in 1864, as well as tallying up 165 "nuisances" over a period of 80 days. He especially hated [[busking|street music]], and in particular the music of [[organ grinder]]s, against whom he railed in various venues. The following quotation is typical:

{{quote|It is difficult to estimate the misery inflicted upon thousands of persons, and the absolute pecuniary penalty imposed upon multitudes of intellectual workers by the loss of their time, destroyed by organ-grinders and other similar nuisances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Campbell-Kelly, Martin |author2=Babbage, Charles | title = Passages from the Life of a Philosopher | publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto Publishers | year = 1994 | chapter = Ch 26 | page = 342 | isbn = 978-1-85196-040-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Babbage was not alone in his campaign. A convert to the cause was the MP [[Michael Thomas Bass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Chase|author2=Michael Levenson|title=The Spectacle of Intimacy: A Public Life for the Victorian Family|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNitcKFsBBEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA151|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=15 August 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3112-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1860s, Babbage also took up the anti-[[Hoop rolling#British Empire|hoop-rolling]] campaign. He blamed hoop-rolling boys for driving their iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babbage|1864|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for "commencing a crusade against the popular game of [[tip-cat]] and the trundling of hoops."&lt;ref&gt;Hansard's parliamentary debates.

==Computing pioneer==
[[File:BabbageDifferenceEngine.jpg|thumb|Part of Charles Babbage's difference engine (#1), assembled after his death by his son, Henry Prevost Babbage (1824–1918), using parts found in Charles' laboratory]]

Babbage's machines were among the first mechanical computers. That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]], the Astronomer Royal.&lt;ref name=Swade&gt;{{cite book |last=Swade |first=Doron |authorlink=Doron Swade |title=The Cogwheel Brain |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=London |isbn=978-0316648479 |year=2000 |page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to £17,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.&lt;ref name=Gleick&gt;{{cite book |author=Gleick, J. |title=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London |year=2011 |page=104 |title-link=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate [[Input/output|I/O]] unit.&lt;ref name=Gleick/&gt;

===Background on mathematical tables===
In Babbage's time, printed [[mathematical table]]s were calculated by [[human computer]]s; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.&lt;ref name="Th35"/&gt;

At Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[B. V. Bowden]], ''Faster than Thought'', Pitman (1953), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by [[Gaspard de Prony]], and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 [[Charles Blagden]] was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Coulston Gillispie|title=Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPgIpRIvaSAC&amp;pg=PA485|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=10 January 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2461-8|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference engine===
[[File:Babbage Difference Engine.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s Difference Engine No. 2, built from Babbage's design]]
{{main|Difference engine}}

Babbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of [[polynomial function]]s. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of [[finite difference]]s, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

For a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in [[Joseph Clement]] to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his [[machine tool]]s were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=37291|title=Clement, Joseph|first=Anita|last=McConnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parts of the prototype survive in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Denis | last = Roegel | title = Prototype Fragments from Babbage's First Difference Engine | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 31 | pages = 70–5 | date = April–June 2009 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2009.31 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype evolved into the "first difference engine." It remained unfinished and the finished portion is located at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London. This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen [[short ton|tons]] (13,600&amp;nbsp;kg), and would have been {{Convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} tall. Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847–1849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,"Difference Engine No. 2", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989–1991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances. It performed its first calculation at the Science Museum, London, returning results to 31 digits.

Nine years later, in 2000, the Science Museum completed the [[computer printer|printer]] Babbage had designed for the difference engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/710950.stm |title=SCI/TECH &amp;#124; Babbage printer finally runs |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical Engine===
{{main|Analytical Engine}}
After the attempt at making the first difference engine fell through, Babbage worked to design a more complex machine called the [[Analytical Engine]]. He hired C. G. Jarvis, who had previously worked for Clement as a draughtsman.&lt;ref name="CollierMacLachlan2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce Collier|author2=James MacLachlan|title=Charles Babbage: And the Engines of Perfection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vzMEwf-bHEC&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=20 April 2013|date=28 September 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-514287-7|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Analytical Engine marks the transition from mechanised arithmetic to fully-fledged general purpose computation. It is largely on it that Babbage's standing as computer pioneer rests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Baggage Engine|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/|publisher=Computer History Museum|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major innovation was that the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using [[punched card]]s: the Engine was intended to use loops of [[Jacquard loom|Jacquard's]] punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations.&lt;ref name="Ceruzzi, Paul"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ceruzzi|first=Paul|title=Computing: A Concise History|year=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=United States|isbn=9780262517676|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Benjamin|title=The French connection|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=10–13|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-french-connection|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It would have been the first mechanical device to be, in principle, [[Turing-complete]]. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Ada Lovelace and Italian followers===
[[Ada Lovelace]], who corresponded with Babbage during his development of the Analytical Engine, is credited with developing an algorithm that would enable the Engine to calculate a sequence of [[Bernoulli numbers]].&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;Robin Hammerman, Andrew L. Russell (2016). ''Ada's Legacy: Cultures of Computing from the Victorian to the Digital Age''. Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers. {{ISBN|978-1-97000-151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite documentary evidence in Lovelace's own handwriting,&lt;ref name=Legacy/&gt; some scholars{{Who|date=April 2018}} dispute to what extent the ideas were Lovelace's own. For this achievement, she is often described as the first [[programmer|computer programmer]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fuegi J, Francis J | title = Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes' | journal=Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 16–26 | date = October–December 2003 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887 }} See pages 19, 25&lt;/ref&gt; though no programming language had yet been invented.&lt;ref name=Legacy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage|title=Charles Babbage {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovelace also translated and wrote literature supporting the project.  Describing the engine's programming by punch cards, she wrote: "We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the [[Jacquard loom]] weaves flowers and leaves."&lt;ref name=Gross/&gt;

Babbage visited [[Turin]] in 1840 at the invitation of [[Giovanni Plana]]. In 1842 [[Charles Wheatstone]] approached Lovelace to translate a paper of [[Luigi Menabrea]], who had taken notes of Babbage's Turin talks; and Babbage asked her to add something of her own. Fortunato Prandi who acted as interpreter in Turin was an Italian exile and follower of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Benjamin Woolley |title=The Bride of Science |year=1999 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-72436-1 |pages=258–60, 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swedish followers===
[[Per Georg Scheutz]] wrote about the difference engine in 1830, and experimented in automated computation. After 1834 and Lardner's ''Edinburgh Review'' article he set up a project of his own, doubting whether Babbage's initial plan could be carried out. This he pushed through with his son, Edvard Scheutz.&lt;ref name="Lingren1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lingren|title=Glory and Failure: The Difference Engines of Johann Müller, Charles Babbage and Georg and Edvard Scheutz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plgMl2yfVkwC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-12146-0|pages=98–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Swedish engine was that of [[Martin Wiberg]] (1860).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=I. Grattan-Guinness|title=Companion encyclopedia of the history and philosophy of the mathematical sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hDvzITtfdAC&amp;pg=PA698|accessdate=27 April 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-7396-6|page=698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
In 2011, researchers in Britain proposed a multimillion-pound project, "Plan 28", to construct Babbage's Analytical Engine.  Since Babbage's plans were continually being refined and were never completed, they intended to engage the public in the project and [[crowdsourcing|crowd-source]] the analysis of what should be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/science/computer-experts-building-1830s-babbage-analytical-engine.html?_r=1/ | title = It Started Digital Wheels Turning | publisher=New York Times | accessdate =10 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have the equivalent of 675 bytes of memory, and run at a clock speed of about 7&amp;nbsp;Hz.  They hope to complete it by the 150th anniversary of Babbage's death, in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Advances in [[microelectromechanical system|MEMs]] and [[nanotechnology]] have led to recent high-tech experiments in mechanical computation. The benefits suggested include operation in high radiation or high temperature environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WVI/is_1999_Oct_11/ai_56912203/print |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013201309/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0WVI/is_1999_Oct_11/ai_56912203/print |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2007 |title=Electronics Times: Micro-machines are fit for space |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=11 October 1999 |accessdate=29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern versions of mechanical computation were highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'' in its special "end of the millennium" black cover issue in an article entitled "Babbage's Last Laugh".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Babbage's Last Laugh |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Economist |pages= |page= |date=9 September 1999 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/324654?story_id=E1_PNQGVQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his association with the town Babbage was chosen in 2007 to appear on the 5 [[Totnes pound]] note.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-new-faces-local-currency/story-21152600-detail/story.html|title=Latest Devon News - DevonLive.com|website=Devon Live|access-date=5 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810153519/http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/Meet-new-faces-local-currency/story-21152600-detail/story.html|archive-date=10 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An image of Babbage features in the [[British culture|British cultural icons]] section of the newly designed [[British passport]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Introducing the new UK passport design|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/.../HMPO_magazine.pdf|agency=Gov.uk|date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Babbages Brain.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Babbage's brain is on display at [[The Science Museum (London)|The Science Museum]]]]
Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871; he was buried in London's [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].

}}The '''Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy''' ('''CIPFA''') is a professional institute for [[accountant]]s working in the [[public services]], national audit agencies, in major accountancy firms, and in other bodies where [[public money]] needs to be managed. It has 14,000 members. It is the only UK professional accountancy body to specialise in public services. Its qualifications include a [[professional qualification]] for [[public sector]] accountants as well as a postgraduate diploma for people already working in management.

CIPFA is a member of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]], the umbrella organisation for the British accountancy profession. It also belongs to the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

CIPFA’s regional branches cover the [[Channel Islands]], [[Europe]], [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[North East England|North East]], [[North West England|North West]] &amp; [[North Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Scotland]], [[South East England|South East]], [[South West England|South West]] &amp; [[South Wales]] and [[Yorkshire]] &amp; the [[Humber]].

==Designation==
Members of CIPFA are entitled to style themselves "Chartered Public Finance Accountant" and use the designatory letters "CPFA".&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cipfa.org/~/media/files/aboutus/governance/agm/cbls%20211116.pdf?la=en | title = supplemental charter and bye-laws   | date = 2016-11-21 | publisher = Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy | access-date = 2018-06-07 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170709133837/http://www.cipfa.org/~/media/files/aboutus/governance/agm/cbls%20211116.pdf?la=en | archive-date = 2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members who have been elected as Fellow Members can call themselves "Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy" and use the abbreviation "FCPFA".&lt;ref name=charter /&gt;

==History==
CIPFA began life as the Corporate Treasurers' and Accountants' Institute in 1885, which was later renamed the Institute of Municipal Treasurers and Accountants (IMTA) in 1901. This later became the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) in 1973 when it obtained its [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]].

==Qualifications==
CIPFA offers a range of qualifications; the "Professional Qualification" is intended for those working in and with public services in the UK. For people outside of the UK there are some International Public Financial Management qualifications; a "Certificate in Charity Finance &amp; Accountancy"; and a "CIPFA Certificate Investigative Practice Qualification" aimed primarily at investigators who have some experience but who lack any formal qualification.

==Membership==
CIPFA students who have successfully completed the CIPFA Professional Accountancy Qualification and their Practical Experience Portfolio (PEP) are invited to apply for CIPFA Membership. Once membership is approved members can use the designatory letters ‘CPFA’ (Chartered Public Finance Accountant) for as long as they continue membership.

Further routes to membership are available, for example for those with some accountancy qualifications but who must top-up with CIPFA qualifications.  There are also arrangements in place with various other professional accountancy organisations where membership, by examination, of these bodies and an appropriate number of years experience in public finance will be regarded as suitable to progress to membership of CIPFA.

==Mutual recognition==
CIPFA and the [[Society of Management Accountants of Canada]] signed a [[mutual recognition agreement]] in February 2004.

===CMA/CIPFA dual qualification and designations===

CIPFA and CMA Canada have a dual qualification which provides Canadian public sector employees with comprehensive financial management and [[leadership]] training.

On completing the programme, candidates can apply for dual public finance management and accounting designations as a Chartered Public Finance Accountant (CPFA) and [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA) from CIPFA and CMA Canada respectively.

CIPFA and [[CPA Australia]] signed a mutual recognition agreement in June 2007.

Although not strictly a form of mutual recognition, CIPFA members of 5 years standing may apply for direct entry to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in [[England]] and [[Wales]] subject to meeting certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/join-us/members-of-other-bodies/pathways-to-membership This scheme is now closed for new applicants and is only available for re-submissions in 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIPFA Group==
The CIPFA Group includes, in addition to the main accounting body; Public Finance - a monthly magazine for the public sector; the in-house CIPFA Education and Training Centre with almost 3,000 students at locations across the UK, and works with other places of learning to provide courses locally; and a commercial services arm which provided advice and services for the public sector. They include information and guidance, courses and conferences, [[Property management|property]] and [[asset management]] solutions, consultancy and interim people for a range of public sector clients.

'''Debt relief orders''' (DROs) are a new form of [[bankruptcy in the United Kingdom|insolvency]] measure in the [[United Kingdom]]. They were introduced under Chapter 4 of the [[Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007]]. A DRO is a simplified, quicker and cheaper alternative to bankruptcy in the United Kingdom, suitable for debtors who have few or no assets (less than £1000 and not homeowners) and little disposable income (less than £50 per month). It is possible to apply for a DRO without attending court and the fee is £90. The fee may be paid by instalments prior to applying for the order.

==Debt relief orders introduction==

Debt relief orders came into force in England and Wales on 6 April 2009.

==Who can qualify for a debt relief order==

Debt relief orders are intended to provide debt relief for people in England and Wales if:

* the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts;
* the debtor’s total unsecured liabilities must not exceed £20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/26/made |title=The Insolvency Proceedings (Monetary Limits) (Amendment) Order 2015 (SI 2015 No. 26) |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;);
* the debtor’s total gross assets must not exceed £1000 (this includes houses so homeowners will not be eligible); the debtor will usually be allowed to keep a car if it is worth less than £1000 or it has been adapted for them because they have a physical impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities;
* the debtor’s disposable income, following deduction of normal household expenses, must not exceed £50 per month;
* the debtor must be domiciled in England or Wales, or in the last 3 years have been resident or carrying on business in England or Wales;
* the debtor must not have previously been subject to a DRO within the last 6 years;
* the debtor must not be involved in another formal insolvency procedure at the time of application for a DRO, such as:
** an undischarged bankrupt;
** a current [[individual voluntary arrangement]];
** A current bankruptcy restrictions order or undertaking;
** A current debt relief restrictions order or undertaking;
** An [[interim order]]
** A current pending debtor’s bankruptcy petition in relation to the debtor but the debtor has not been referred to the DRO procedure by the court as a more suitable method of debt relief;
** A current pending creditor’s bankruptcy petition against the debtor but the debtor has not obtained the creditor’s permission for entry into the DRO process.

==Applying for a debt relief order==

A debt relief order is a form of insolvency, like bankruptcy, and will be subject to a public listing through the [http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/bankruptcy/bankruptcysearch.htm Insolvency Service] website.

Debt relief orders can only be completed by an approved intermediary and competent authorities. Approved intermediaries will be mainly experienced debt advisors attached to debt advice organisations such as a [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], [[StepChange Debt Charity]] or an [[AdviceUK]] member. The approved intermediary can review the persons information, make a determination that they are eligible and appropriate for a DRO and file the DRO application online. Approved intermediaries will not charge a fee for completing or submitting an application.

Organisations approved by the Insolvency Service as competent authorities are listed on the Insolvency Service web site, and include AdviceUK,  Citizens Advice, StepChange Debt Charity, the Institute of Money Advisers, [[Baines and Ernst]] National Debtline, Payplan and Think Money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/personal-insolvency/dro-comp |title=Debt Relief Orders - Competent Authorities |publisher=bis.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926081256/http://www.bis.gov.uk/insolvency/personal-insolvency/dro-comp |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receipt of the application and payment of the fee, an Official Receiver may make the order, administratively, without the involvement of the court if it appears that the applicant meets the requirements.

If the Official Receiver becomes aware of information which means the debtor does not qualify for a DRO, the application will be refused. If this information comes to light after the DRO is made, the Official Receiver may revoke the DRO without reference to the Court. The effect of revoking a DRO will be to leave the debtor open to actions by his or her creditors. If a DRO is revoked the debtor cannot apply for another one within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debtadvisorycentre.co.uk/dro/what-effect-will-a-debt-relief-order-have-on-me-0-3844-0.html |title=What effect will a Debt Relief Order have on me? |publisher=debtadvisorycentre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of a debt relief order==

During the year that a debt relief order is active, the applicant will:

* Be protected from enforcement action by the creditors included in the application (bar certain creditors whose debts cannot be scheduled in the DRO and those creditors whose debts are included in the DRO but who have successfully obtained leave from the court to pursue their debts).
* Be free from those debts at the end of the period (normally 12 months from Order).
* Be obliged to provide information to and co-operate with the Official Receiver.
* Be expected to make arrangements to repay their creditors should their financial circumstances improve.

Certain activities by debtors subject to a DRO may result in  an application to the Court for a Debt Relief Restrictions Order being refused. These include:

* Failing to keep records which account for a loss of property by the debtor, or by a business carried on by him, where the loss occurred in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the application for the debt relief restrictions order;
* Failing to produce records of that kind on demand by the official receiver;
* Entering into a transaction at an undervalue in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the determination of that application;
* Giving a preference in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the determination of that application;
* Making an excessive pension contribution;
* A failure to supply goods or services that were wholly or partly paid for;
* Trading at a time, before the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order, when the debtor knew or ought to have known that he was himself to be unable to pay his debts;
* Incurring, before the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order, a debt which the debtor had no reasonable expectation of being able to pay;
* Failing to account satisfactorily to the court or the official receiver for a loss of property or for an insufficiency of property to meet his debts;
* Carrying on any gambling, rash and hazardous speculation or unreasonable extravagance which may have materially contributed to or increased the extent of his inability to pay his debts before the application date for the debt relief order or which took place between that date and the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order;
* Neglect of business affairs of a kind which may have materially contributed to or increased the extent of his inability to pay his debts;
* Fraud or fraudulent breach of trust;
* Failing to co-operate with the official receiver.

In addition certain more serious misconduct may result in criminal prosecution.

Data released in November 2014 shows the number of debt relief orders in London between 2009 and 2013 was much lower than the average for the rest of England. The study was produced by New Policy Institute and funded by Trust for London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonspovertyprofile.org.uk/indicators/topics/debt/debt-relief-orders/|title=Debt relief orders - Poverty Indicators - London's Poverty Report|first=Trust for London and New Policy|last=Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}

{{BLP sources|date=December 2009}}
'''Sir Douglas Lynch''', [[Knight or Dame of St. Andrew (Barbados)|KA]], [[Order of St Michael and St George|CMG]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] (1926 – 12 April 2016) was a [[Barbados|Barbadian]] retired businessman and lawyer, former member of the [[Privy Council]] of Barbados and a director of the [[Central Bank of Barbados]].

Sir Douglas was the first person to be formally admitted to the party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=30 years and onward: in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary |page=6 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] |oclc=13519235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and himself stood for election, but was defeated in his first and sole attempt to gain political office, but remained a powerful background figure in the Democratic Labour Party with Barrow rarely making any decisions on business or financial without consulting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life and times of Errol Barrow |last=Morgan |first=Peter |page=28 |year=1994 |publisher=Caribbean Communications |oclc=32104227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many posts held in the private sector he was also a director, and vice-chairman, of the island's largest insurance company, the [[Barbados Mutual Life Assurance Society]] (known by all locally as simply "The Mutual").

Sir Douglas joined The Barbados Shipping and Trading Company - the country's largest company, being the holding company for the six next largest companies in the country - as a Director, and as a regular part-time student of business at MIT was instrumental in choosing and setting up their first mainframe computer - which used a card-reading machine for input.

In time, Sir Douglas rose to become Joint Managing Director of BS&amp;T, followed by promotion to Chairman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Menard: 'Silly for me to push them' |work=[[The Montreal Gazette]] |date=1 March 1975 |page=4  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Chairman and Joint Managing Director upon the retirement of his predecessor. He died in Barbados in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leighrayment.com/knights/knightskinlyv.htm Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page - Knights and Dames since 1837: Kin-Lyv]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bryansfuneralhome.com/blog/sir-douglas-percy-lynch-ka-cmg-qc/ SIR DOUGLAS PERCY LYNCH KA, CMG, QC]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Austin''' is the central business district of [[Austin, Texas]]. Downtown is located on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. The approximate borders of Downtown include Lamar Boulevard to the west, Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] to the north, [[Interstate 35 (Texas)|Interstate 35]] to the east, and [[Lady Bird Lake]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;"[ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/DowntownAustinPlan/dap_approved_12-8-2011.pdf Downtown Austin Plan]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6fAtpLi2q?url=ftp://ftp.ci.austin.tx.us/DowntownAustinPlan/dap_approved_12-8-2011.pdf Archive]).

It is where the city's highrise buildings are located, as well as being the center of government and business for the region. Downtown Austin is currently experiencing a building boom, with many condos and high rise towers being built.

==History==
The story of Downtown Austin began with the [[Republic of Texas]] and President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] in the 1830s. Lamar tapped [[Edwin Waller]] to direct the planning and construction of the new town. Waller chose a site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between [[Shoal Creek (Texas)|Shoal Creek]] to the west and [[Waller Creek]] to the east. Waller laid the new city in a simple grid pattern on a 640-acre (or one square-mile plot) with 14 blocks running in both directions. Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.

One grand avenue, which Lamar named [[Congress Avenue|"Congress,"]] cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north-south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east-west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers (they were eventually changed to numbers in 1884). The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]) to West Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Spurlin |last=Charles D. |journal= Handbook of Texas |title= Waller, Edwin |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa38 |accessdate= September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waller reserved key spots for public buildings and four public squares. Three of Waller's original squares survive to this day: [[Wooldridge Park]], [[Republic Square (Austin, Texas)|Republic Square]] and [[Brush Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Barnes |first=Michael |title= Thank Edwin Waller for Austin’s rational plan |date= September 7, 2011 |url= http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/outandabout/entries/2011/09/07/thank_edwin_wal.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downtown districts==

===Congress Avenue===
[[Edwin Waller]], the first mayor of Austin, designed Congress Avenue to be Austin's most prominent street. Planned as the widest street in the original 1839 Austin plan, the 120-foot wide Congress Avenue initially ran from the Colorado River north to the [[Texas State Capitol|State Capitol]]. Not coincidentally, Congress was the most important street in Austin city life during the 19th century. Early structures along Congress Avenue included government buildings, hotels, saloons, retail stores and restaurants. By the late 1840s "The Avenue" formed a well-established business district. The mid-1870s introduced [[gas lighting|gaslight]] illumination and mule-driven [[tram|streetcars]] as well as construction of a new [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] courthouse at Eleventh Street.

Stretching from First Street north to Eleventh Street, the [[Congress Avenue Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Congress Avenue Historic District]] was created on August 11, 1978. Stylistically, the dominating structures of significance reflected general [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] form and detailing, tempered by local materials and building techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= McGraw, Marburger &amp; Associates |title= History of South Congress |url= https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:1174DgI_9KQJ:www.historicbouldincreek.org/PDF/sconhistory.pdf+south+congress+avenue+austin+history&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgTILosO5Y66vzO4Howc3mqJ_V5ijRjRearWHGC01OpwE5g4KECnVyjzjdOoKLW_2XG-okEPE9bzPdWk92LSKY6mKJDoGWBzhfUAUGd2i2X-qRQHyceH8rmDJDt8oK-awHR7aM9&amp;sig=AHIEtbTrYcZQMmSVBjVZjBaoZkdFlguvOA |accessdate= October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable structures along Congress Avenue north of the Colorado include the Texas State Capitol, [[The Paramount Theatre (Austin, Texas)|Paramount Theatre]], the Southwestern Telegraph and Telephone Building, [[Gethsemane Lutheran Church]] and the [[Lundberg Bakery (Austin, Texas)|Old Bakery]].

===Sixth Street===
{{main|Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)}}
[[Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)|Sixth Street]] is a historic street and entertainment district in Downtown Austin. Sixth Street itself stretches from [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Mopac Expressway]] in [[Old West Austin Historic District|Old West Austin]] to [[Interstate 35]] and beyond.

===Rainey Street===
The [[Rainey Street Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Rainey Street Historic District]] is a community positioned near Lady Bird Lake and [[Interstate 35]] in a southeastern pocket of downtown. The situation at Rainey Street is unique in that the area was once a sleepy residential street, albeit nestled right next to downtown, was rezoned as part of Austin's central business district in 2004. The hope at the time was to incentivize development near the [[Austin Convention Center]] and the since-built Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center. But while grander development has stalled, bars and eateries have flocked to Rainey, since CBD zoning enables traffic-heavy cocktail bar or restaurant use without any additional zoning request. As such, old bungalows have been fixed up and turned into bars and cocktail lounges with ample backyards and porches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Dunbar, Jr. |first= Wells |title= The Lure of Rainey Street |publisher= Austin Chronicle |date= January 28, 2011 |url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2011-01-28/city-hall-hustle-the-lure-of-rainey-street/ |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West End/Market District===
The West End or Market District of Austin is located in the northwest section of Downtown Austin, just north of the Seaholm District and to the west of the Warehouse District.

===Seaholm District===
The Seaholm District is a formerly industrial section of southwest downtown Austin that the city wants to transform into a vibrant urban neighborhood. The city of Austin has designated the area from [[Lady Bird Lake]] to 5th Street and from Lamar Boulevard to San Antonio Street as the Seaholm District. At the core of the district is the decommissioned [[Seaholm Power Plant]], which will be redeveloped into a landmark residential and retail destination. After several years of delays and false starts due in part to a recession that dried up financing for development, construction is expected to start on redevelopment projects at the former Seaholm Power Plant and the site of the former Green Water Treatment Plant east of Seaholm in 2012. Austin-based Southwest Strategies Group, the project's lead developer, announced plans to begin work on the 450,000 square feet of development to be built on the 7.8 acre site. The projects will transform the decommissioned plants on downtown's southwestern edge into lively hubs with shops, hotels, condominiums, apartments and other development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Novak |first= Shonda |title= After years of delays, construction in sight for areas in Seaholm District, official says |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= October 17, 2011 |url= http://www.statesman.com/business/after-years-of-delays-construction-in-sight-for-1921958.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121091739/http://www.statesman.com/business/after-years-of-delays-construction-in-sight-for-1921958.html |archivedate= November 21, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are located within the square block bordered by West Seventh, West Eighth, Guadalupe, and San Antonio streets. The district also includes several houses on the west side of San Antonio and the south side of West Seventh, at least three of which were built or altered by the North family.&lt;ref name="Williamson"/&gt;

===Judges Hill===

Although the house was subsequently demolished in 1966. Judge Robertson was the first among the neighborhood resident judges and attorneys who earned the area the name of Judges Hill. The area includes many historically designated properties from the late 19th century, some significant mid-century modern design, student communities and limited multi-family housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Judges Hill History |publisher= Judges Hill Neighborhood Association |url= http://judgeshill.org/history/history.html |accessdate= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. Located geographically at the center of the city, Downtown began its development with the completion of the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (N&amp;W)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]] in 1882. Today the Downtown core is noted as the center of business for the [[Roanoke Valley]] and [[Southwest Virginia]], the [[Roanoke City Market Historic District|Roanoke City Market]], the [[Roanoke Downtown Historic District (Roanoke, Virginia)|Roanoke Downtown Historic District]] and many other attractions and amenities.&lt;ref name="MarketContext"&gt;{{cite web

==Location==
Geographically, downtown Roanoke is defined by the city as the area bound by [[Interstate 581]] on the east, 5th Street to the west, the [[Norfolk and Western]] railroad tracks to the north and Day Avenue to the south. This area is the location of the central core and the historic Market District. An additional section of downtown is located south of Day Avenue, bound to the east by the [[Roy L. Webber Expressway]], South Jefferson Street to the west and Albemarle Avenue to the south. This area is the location of the former [[Carilion Health System|Carilion]] Community Hospital and the [[Jefferson College of Health Sciences]].&lt;ref name="DowntownMap"&gt;{{cite web

Downtown borders the neighborhoods of the [[West End, Roanoke, Virginia|West End]] on the west, [[Belmont, Roanoke, Virginia|Belmont]] on the east, [[Gainsboro, Roanoke, Virginia|Gainsboro]] on the north and both [[Old Southwest, Roanoke, Virginia|Old Southwest]] and [[South Jefferson, Roanoke, Virginia|South Jefferson]] on the south.&lt;ref name="DowntownMap2"&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The initial establishment of the [[Gainesborough, Virginia|Gainesborough]] in 1835 was located to the northeast of present-day downtown.&lt;ref name="Gainsboro2"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.roanokeva.gov/85256A8D0062AF37/CurrentBaseLink/0477E02E1C815712852570D00070EC94/$File/gainsboro_plan_intro.pdf
|title=Gainsboro Neighborhood Plan: History
|publisher=City of Roanoke Planning Division
|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first structures constructed in what is now downtown occurred in the period following the completion of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad line in 1852 to the south of Gainesborough. Now known as Big Lick, during the period of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]] following the [[American Civil War]], the rail infrastructure was restored and the first municipal structure completed in present-day downtown was a jail.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanton|first=Allison Stone|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Roanoke Downtown Historic District District|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Cities/Roanoke/128-5761_Roanoke_Downtown_HD_2002_Final_Nomination.pdf|date=March 2002|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1881 the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (N&amp;W)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]] announced that Big Lick would be the southern terminus of its line resulting in the rapid growth and development of the community. With the arrival of the railroad, Big Lick would incorporate as the city of Roanoke in 1882.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom1"/&gt; The rapid growth resulted in the citizens passing a $90,000 bond in 1886 to provide for the infrastructure to support the growing community. With the adequate infrastructure in place, downtown would see a rapid expansion from the area around the present-day Campbell Avenue/Jefferson Street intersection outward.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom1"/&gt;

During the period between the wars, Downtown would continue to prosper and expand outwards. Many new structures were constructed in a variety of contemporary styles. Some of the notable structures completed during this period include the nine-story [[Boxley Building]] in 1921, the eleven-story [[Patrick Henry Hotel]] in 1925 and the twelve-story [[Colonial National Bank (Roanoke, Virginia)|Colonial National Bank]] in 1927, which stood as the city's tallest through the 1970s.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom1"/&gt; The downtown core would continue to see growth and prosperity through the period immediately following [[World War II]]  and into the 1950s.&lt;ref name="NRHPnom1"/&gt;

With the opening of [[Crossroads Mall (Virginia)|Crossroads Mall]] in 1961, more shops would close their Downtown doors, with more people choosing to shop outside the city center.&lt;ref name="AirportHistory"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.roanokeva.gov/85256A8D0062AF37/CurrentBaseLink/EC5B1D24CD75FD418525740A00621F11/$File/WRAP_Intro.pdf

|publisher=City of Roanoke Planning Division
|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although declining as a retail destination, the 1970s saw a construction boom resulting in a reshaping of the skyline. Both the thirteen-story [[Crestar Bank]] Building (now the BB&amp;T Bank Building) and the sixteen-story First National Exchange Bank Building (now the Carilion Administrative Services Building) were completed in 1973 and the fourteen-story Poff Federal Building was completed in 1976, with each still prominent features of the downtown cityscape.&lt;ref name="Emporis"&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1882, the Roanoke City Market is the oldest continuously operating [[farmers market]] in the Commonwealth of Virginia and forms the central gathering place of the Downtown district.&lt;ref name="MarketContext"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Market"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.roanokefarmersmarket.com/
|title=Welcome to Roanoke Farmer's Market
|publisher=Roanoke Farmer's Market
|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s the market would begin to decline, hitting its low point in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="MarketContext"/&gt; Seen as the key to the revitalization of Downtown, the ''Design 79'' plan was initiated to stimulate the revitalization and redevelopment of the market area. Through its and subsequent plans implementation, the market area was revitalized with the efforts now expanding outside the market area throughout Downtown.&lt;ref name="MarketContext"/&gt;

By the early 1990s Downtown would again be reshaped with the completion of both the 21-story Dominion Tower (now the Wells Fargo Tower) in 1991 as the city's tallest structure and the twelve-story Norfolk Southern Building in 1992.&lt;ref name="Emporis"/&gt; By the early 2000s (decade) downtown would experience the conversion of many former office buildings, stores and warehouses into residential living units.&lt;ref name="Roanoker"&gt;{{cite web

'''Empire-building''' is the practice of attempting to obtain greater power and authority within an organization for the purposes of [[Boasting|self-aggrandizement]], particularly by having extra staff or subordinates.&lt;ref name="oxf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/empire-building |title=empire-building |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Encarta Dictionaries: English dictionary: empire-building |url= |location=Redmond, WA |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |page= |date=2008 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In [[political science]], empire-building refers to the tendency of countries and nations to acquire resources, land, and economic influence outside their borders in order to expand their size, power, and wealth. This expansion can be at the cost of those nations or people that have had resources taken away from them so that the conqueror can be enriched.

In [[business]], empire-building is demonstrated when individuals or small groups attempt to gain control over key projects and initiatives to maximize [[job security]] and promotability. Project leadership hoards potential credit and prestige the project can produce. Because this approach prevents other people in the organization from contributing in a meaningful manner and alternative or competing projects to address the project's goals are destroyed regardless of their merit, the company suffers as a whole, projects fail, and the goals of the project are achieved partially, inadequately, or not at all. This sort of behavior is supposed to be stopped by upper management but is nevertheless very common.

In an organization, empire-building can also be demonstrated when an individual or small group eagerly and proactively suggests and pursues functions, activities or projects that are of questionable value to try to enhance legitimacy and future value. Pursuit of these activities is initially done at little or no marginal cost, but later the activities are used to justify increased resource allocation, being part of the organizational status quo, and thus the individual or group's overall command of resources, and influence, increases.

}}The '''European Foundation for Management Development''' ('''EFMD''') is an international not-for-profit association, based in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=L'European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.groupeiam.com/index.php/accueil-efmd/72-international/organismes-internationaux-de-labellisation/100-l-european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://www.groupeiam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's largest network association in the field of management development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba-courses.com/efmd.htm |title=European Foundation for Management Development: EQUIS Accreditation: A Level of Quality |work=MBA Courses Worldwide |publisher=Sandringham Publishing Ltd |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has over 890 member organizations from [[academia]], business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in [[management development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development|url=http://10times.com/organizers/european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://10times.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD operates the '''EFMD Quality Improvement System''' ([[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]]), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hayleys case study by INSEAD wins top award in Europe |location=Sri Lanka |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|The Daily Mirror]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/print/index.php/business/127-local/12150.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.unprme.org/about-prme/governance/efmd.php|journal=http://www.unprme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of accreditation ==

While the [[EQUIS]] accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EPAS Accreditation EFMD Programme accreditation System (EPAS) |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/services-for-business-schools/epas-accreditation |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA ([[Association of MBAs]]) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of [[MBA]] programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).

== Triple Accreditation ==

In business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by [[EQUIS]], [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] is often considered the "gold standard" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a [[Triple accreditation]] or Triple Crown accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Grandes écoles: les labels enfin décryptés|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/labels-accreditations-grandes-ecoles-enfin-decryptes.html|journal=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr|date = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EFMD activities ==

EFMD is the European partner in the [[China Europe International Business School]] ([[CEIBS]]), a joint venture with [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the [[European Commission]] and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[AACSB]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the [http://globalfocusmagazine.com Global Focus magazine].

In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth €2.2m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Annual Action Programme for Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/documents/aap/2009/af_aap_2009_dci-nsa_p2.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers. This project, called '''Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/international-projects/current-projects/cuba-project |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to be implemented under the leadership of EFMD together with [[ESADE]], a business school in Barcelona, and the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education.

The '''European Trade Union Institute''' (ETUI) is the independent research and training institute of the European Trade Union Confederation [[ETUC]]. 
The ETUI was formed in 2005, following a merger of three specialist bodies: the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI, founded in 1978), the European Trade Union College (ETUCO, founded in 1989) and the Trade Union Technical Bureau (TUTB, founded in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Degryse|first1=Christophe|title=1979-2013 40 years of history of the European Trade Union Confederation|date=2013|publisher=ETUI|isbn=978-2-87452-304-5|pages=251}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11/04/2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETUI is composed of two departments:
* Research
* Education

The ETUI conducts studies and researches on macroeconomics and social policies in Europe, industrial relations and health and safety at work in Europe. 
It also delivers training to trade unionists belonging to National confederations and European Trade Union Federations across Europe on a wide range of topics.

== Governance ==
The ETUI is a non-profit international association (AISBL) based in Brussels, Belgium. 
The Institute is composed of a General Assembly, which meets at least once a year and it is composed of members of the ETUC. It elects the members of the Management Committee. 
The Management Committee is composed of 28 members of the ETUC, elected by the General Assembly and it deals with the administration of the Institute.

The Director's Committee is composed of:
* Luca Visentini, General Secretary of the ETUC
* Peter Scherrer, Deputy General Secretary of the ETUC (in charge of the ETUI)
* Philippe Pochet, General Director ETUI
* Maria Jepsen, Director of the Research Department
* Ulisses Garrido, Director of the Education Department
* Olga Barth, Administrative and Finance Manager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etui.org/About-Etui/Governance|website=European Trade Union Institute|title=Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Advisory Group, composed of 25 members contributes to the multi-annual strategy of the ETUI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etui.org/About-Etui/Advisory-Group|website=European Trade Union Institute|title=Advisory Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
The five priorities of the ETUI work programme are:
* The crisis and the reinforced economic governance system
* Worker participation and industrial relations
* Sustainable development and industrial policy
* Working condition and job quality
* Trade Union Renewal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Work Programme 2015-2016|url=http://www.etui.org/content/download/20232/165927/file/Work+programme+2015-2016.pdf|website=European Trade Union Institute|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETUI publishes several different publications aimed at different audiences, from policy makers, to practitioners and trade unionists. 
Every year the ETUI, in collaboration with the ETUC publishes [http://www.etui.org/Publications2/Books/Benchmarking-Working-Europe-2016 Benchmarking Working Europe], the ETUI’s annual stock-take of macro-economic, social and bargaining conditions in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETUI report underlines the costs of austerity|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/netuf/2014/04/07/etui-report-underlines-the-costs-of-austerity/#more-137|website=New European Trade Union Forum|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Governance Institute of Australia''' (Governance Institute), formerly '''Chartered Secretaries Australia''', is an independent professional association for [[Company secretary|company secretaries]], governance advisers and risk managers in Australia, committed to promoting sound practice in [[governance]] and [[risk management]].

== History ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
A number of company secretaries joined together in the United Kingdom in 1891 to form a society which promoted their professional interests. The society obtained incorporation under a Royal Charter in 1902 and the members of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries of Joint Stock Companies and other Public Bodies become known as Chartered Secretaries. An amendment to the Institute's Charter gave it the name of the [[Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators]] (ICSA) in 1971.

Established in Australia in 1909, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators — Australian Division changed its name to Governance Institute of Australia in 2013.

== Profile ==

F.

==Early life==
Henry Tucker was born in Bermuda on 14 March 1903, the son of merchant Henry James and Nella Louise (born Trott).&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was a direct descendant of the first British settlers in Bermuda, who included Daniel Tucker, an early [[Governor of Bermuda|Bermudian colonial governor]] in 1616.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Bermuda's Trott family descend from famous 17th Century settler [[Perient Trott]] (1614-1679), who led the campaign against the [[Somers Isles Company]] that would lead to its dissolution in 1684.

Tucker was educated at [[Whitney Institute Middle School|Whitney Institute]] and at [[Saltus Grammar School]] in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], before being sent at the age of 17, in 1920, to boarding school in [[England]], where he attended [[Sherborne School]] in [[Dorset]]. Lacking the means to pursue university studies, he returned to Bermuda in 1922 to find work.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;

Tucker moved to [[New York City]], where from 1924 until 1934 he worked for several [[bank]]s and [[brokerage firm|stock brokerages]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Returning to Bermuda, he became an employee of the [[Bank of Bermuda]]. He was promoted to general manager in 1938.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; On his retirement in 1969 he was elected Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Bermuda, and would serve in this capacity until 1985.&lt;ref name=Bank&gt;[http://bermudascholarships.com/donor/Bank-of-Bermuda-Foundation/9 Bank Of Bermuda Foundation Sir Henry Tucker University Scholarship], bermudascholarships.com; accessed 19 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 1938 Tucker was elected to Parliament as a representative in [[Paget Parish|Paget]].&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt; 
Tucker was elected to the [[Bermuda House of Assembly]] in the 1950s. He helped found the United Bermuda Party in 1964, after spending almost 20 years in the Assembly.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He immediately became the UBP's leader. Tucker became Bermuda's first Premier in 1968, after the island's first election with [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Tucker resigned from office in 1971, citing his advancing age.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was [[knight]]ed by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1972.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

'''Horst M. Rechelbacher''' (1941 – February 15, 2014) was an [[ Austrian American]] businessman, who was the founder of the cosmetics company [[Aveda|Aveda Corporation]] and Intelligent Nutrients. His interest in developing products without toxic chemicals launched the market for natural cosmetics in the United States.&lt;ref name=Vitello /&gt;

==Early life==
Rechelbacher was born in [[Klagenfurt]], [[Austria]] to an herbalist and shoe maker/designer and was the youngest of three brothers. His family apartment overlooked a small salon across the street in central Klagenfurt. During his childhood, Rechelbacher had many opportunities to observe the daily activities of the salon. He was both intrigued and inspired by the salon and when the time came to choose a vocation or continue with a formal education, he chose the salon profession. At age fourteen, he embarked on a three-year apprenticeship in the beauty and salon industry. During his apprenticeship, he was a three-time winner of the Austrian Junior Championships. At seventeen, he moved to [[Italy]] and started work at an exclusive salon in [[Rome]].

==India and Ayurvedic Influences==
In 1970, Rechelbacher went to Florida to participate in a number of different competitions. During those he became sick due to the products he was using on clients' hair and came up with the idea to start "Aveda" - an all natural hair products line.

Rechelbacher developed Clove Shampoo and later Cherry Almond Bark Conditioner based on his earlier renditions.

In 1978, he founded Aveda and began to expand the product line into hair, skin and body care, makeup, plant-based purefumes, (aromatherapy) and lifestyle products that were all centered on his newfound convictions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Under his guidance he continued a search for flower and plant ingredients around the globe and focused on working with indigenous peoples in mutually beneficial circumstances.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Following the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], Rechelbacher was the first to sign onto the Valdez Principles, now the [[Ceres (organization)|Ceres]] principles,  joining corporate environmental responsibility with corporate bottom line.  In 1992, along with his partner Kiran, he attended the [[Earth Summit]], where three key agreements occurred:  the Climate Change Convention, a precursor to the Kyoto Protocol, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] and an Intellectual Property Rights accord for indigenous peoples that included preventing actions that could be deemed culturally inappropriate and/or cause environmental destruction.  Through this convention, Rechelbacher forged a relationship with the Brazilian [[Yawanawa]] tribe began a project cultivating uruku and replanting seedlings in deforested areas.

Nearly two decades after Rechelbacher incorporated, he sold Aveda to the [[Estee Lauder Companies]] but remained a consultant until March 2003.

==Intelligent Nutrients==
In the years following the sale of Aveda, Horst became increasingly aware that the beauty industry was stagnating in the face increasing environmental degradation.  In addition, new technologies that could better serve the consumer were being underutilized. Rechelbacher's fierce determination to improve the caliber of cosmetic products manifested itself in his latest company [http://www.intelligentnutrients.com Intelligent Nutrients]. IN is a certified organic, food-grade, non-toxic plant-based hair, skin, body, aroma and lifestyle company with the primary emphasis on using organically grown ingredients. The IN hair, skin and aromatherapy lines are notable for the USDA Certified Organic seal.  Based on nutraceuticals, non-toxics and certified organic food ingredients and flavors, IN also uses post-consumer recycled packaging.

Later, Rechelbacher was a strong advocate within the cosmetic industry against “greenwashing” - misleading marketing claims and so-called organic companies who use the claim "organic" without certification - by bringing transparency and truth to beauty and cosmetic labeling.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[http://www.horstandfriends.com Horst &amp; Friends] (horstandfriends.com), an Intelligent Nutrients Certified Organic Salon, opened in June 2010 in the [http://www.intelligentnutrients.com Intelligent Nutrients] headquarters in Minneapolis.

==Projects==
Rechelbacher was the founder and chairman of the Horst M. Rechelbacher Foundation, a philanthropic organization dedicated to social and environmental preservation projects that operate on a grass-roots level. His  sustainable ideals and values are perpetuated through profit and non-profit organizations.  He also owned HMR Galleries, an art and antiques business, and was involved in producing films including the 1999 film ''Hidden Medicine.''{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

[https://web.archive.org/web/20060911205033/http://www.oneroof.org/naha/modernlegends.html]

==Personal life==
Rechelbacher maintained residences in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and [[New York City]].  As well as a private estate and a company retreat, the Osceola, Wisconsin, property serves as an organic farm cultivating flowers and plants while also operating a distillery for the IN products.  The farm and home are solar powered.

Rechelbacher was divorced with two children, a son Peter and a daughter Nicole. Nicole is a married mother of three, and former accessories and clothing designer for Aveda.  Peter is married with a son, and provided expertise in finance, and was president of Intelligent Nutrients while at Aveda.

Horst lived and worked with his long-time companion, wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/July-2014/Style-Profile-Kiran-Stordalen/|date=July 2014|title=Style Profile: Kiran Stordalen|author=Schneider, Karen S.|publisher=Greenspring Media|journal=Minnesota Monthly|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former vice president of marketing and creative for Aveda, [[Kiran Stordalen]].

Rechelbacher died from complications of [[pancreatic cancer]] on February 15, 2014, at the age of 72 at his home in [[Osceola, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=Vitello&gt;{{cite news|title=Horst Rechelbacher, ‘Father of Safe Cosmetics,’ Dies at 72|author=Vitello, Paul|date=February 22, 2014|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/business/horst-rechelbacher-father-of-safe-cosmetics-dies-at-72.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Horst Rechelbacher Dies at 72"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/people/horst-rechelbacher-dies-at-72-7464020?src=nl/mornReport/20140218 | title=Horst Rechelbacher Dies at 72 | publisher=WWD | date=16 February 2014 | accessdate=18 February 2014 | author=Julie Naughton and Pete Born with contributions from Belisa Silva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Cockburn''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|ər|n}} {{respell|KOH|bərn}}) of [[Ormiston]], [[East Lothian]], (died 12 November 1758) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] landowner and politician who sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] from 1702 to 1707 and in the [[British House of Commons]] for 34 years from 1707 to 1741.

[[File:Ormiston Hall.jpg|thumb|Ormiston Hall, prior to the WWII fire which left it in ruins]]
He was the son of [[Adam Cockburn of Ormiston]], [[Lord Justice Clerk]], who he succeeded in 1735. He is known as the father of Scottish [[husbandry]].

Cockburn became a member of the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] and took an active interest in accomplishing the union. He was the first representative of [[Haddingtonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] in the parliament of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|United Kingdom of Great Britain]], and continued to hold that seat in all successive parliaments until 1741. He was one of the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty]]. &lt;ref name = HOP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/cockburn-john-1679-1758| title= COCKBURN, John (c.1679-1758), of Ormiston, Haddington.| publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate =15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He built [[Ormiston Hall]] on his estate at [[Ormiston]]. This last Cockburn of Ormiston was an enthusiastic entrepreneur and eventually ruined himself as a result of which his estates were sold to the Earl of Hopetoun.

John Cockburn of Ormiston died in his son's house in the [[Navy Board|Navy Office]], London, England. He had firstly married Beatrix, daughter of [[John Carmichael, 1st Earl of Hyndford]], by whom he had no issue and secondly married Arabella, the daughter and coheiress of Anthony Rowe of Muswell Hall, Middlesex, with whom he had a son. His natural son, [[George Cockburne]] (d.1770), was a [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]] in the [[Royal Navy]], and married Caroline, daughter of George Forrester, 5th Lord Forrester, with female issue.

'''La Fête du Slip''' (literally "''Panties Fest''" or "''Underpants Fest''") is an annual [[alternative porn|alternative-porn]] [[film festival]] held in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]]. It is [[Romandy]]'s first and biggest multidisciplinary festival whose sole purpose is to focus on body, [[Gender studies|gender]], and [[Sexuality portal|sexuality]] in [[art]]. It takes places during the first week-end of March since 2012.&lt;ref name="360d"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://360.ch/blog/magazine/2015/03/fete-du-slip-les-sexualites-sexposent-positivement/ | title=Fête du slip: les sexualités s’exposent positivement | publisher=[[360°]] | date=6 March 2015 | accessdate=30 March 2016 | language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lemag.wyylde.com/cest-la-fete-du-slip-avec-viviane-morey/|title=C'est la Fête du slip avec Viviane Morey - Wyylde le Mag|website=Wyylde le Mag|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tracks.arte.tv/fr/le-slip-ca-se-fete|title=Le Slip, ça se fête ! {{!}} Tracks ARTE|website=Tracks {{!}} ARTE|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
La Fête du Slip is a festival celebrating diversity in bodies, gender and sexuality. It offers a select and diverse program of cinema, music, visual and performing arts, literature, and porn.

La Fête du Slip looks for contemporary emerging art. Its programming evolves around innovative and subversive works. Artistic projects transcending categories and proposing new forms of experimentation are favored.

By bringing together very different artworks that have an echo in their content, the festival aims at enriching the experience of its audience by creating unexpected encounters between artists.

== Hosting ==
La Fête du Slip takes place in seven venues in Lausanne: theaters, nightclubs, galleries, cinema...

== Les Préliminaires ==
Each edition gets an early kick-start with a party called Les Préliminaires (literally "The Foreplays") that takes place one week before the actual beginning of the festival. The main goal of this event was – and, to some extent, still is – to raise sufficient funds for the festival. However, having considerably grown in size and larger funds being involved and needed way ahead of time, this party's function is far more less the one of a fund raiser. It is now mostly a way for the festival enthusiasts to take a first pulse of the upcoming events and to discover the program in details.

== Audience ==
The audience of '''La Fête du Slip''' is very diverse. The variety of the program and the venues creates a unique blend, ranging from [[Queercore|queer punks]] to old literature enthusiasts, dance specialists, and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]]. With its thematic color, '''La Fête du Slip''' attracts many sub-cultures, like the [[LGBT]] community, the [[BDSM]]/kink/fetish community, [[Feminist movements and ideologies|feminist]] activists, pornographers, sex workers, or [[gender studies]] researchers. Most of its audience is local, but the festival attracts a growing number of international festival-goers each year. As a [[Paris Match|Paris-Match]] article put it in 2015: "Switzerland was famous for its banks and chocolates, and now it has been shining with its own porn festival for three years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Spectacles/Le-festival-du-porno-intello-721592|title=La fête du Slip en Suisse - "Le festival du porno intello"|website=www.parismatch.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Le Slip d'Or ==
Since 2015, La Fête du Slip hosts an International Sex Positive Porn Competition called Le Slip d'Or, whose aim is to promote and reward the best of the burgeoning sex positive porn scene internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letagparfait.com/fr/2015/09/14/la-competition-internationale-pour-le-slip-dor-2016-est-officiellement-lancee/|title=La compétition internationale pour le Slip d’Or 2016 est officiellement lancée|website=www.letagparfait.com|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spirit of the Competition ===

As Annie Sprinkle puts it: "The answer to bad porn isn't no porn... It's to try and make better porn!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4WICwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;ots=x9NUYKLk7a&amp;dq=%2522The%2520answer%2520to%2520bad%2520porn%2520isn%2520't%2520no%2520porn%2520...it's%2520to%2520try%2520and%2520make%2520better%2520porn%2522&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522The%2520answer%2520to%2520bad%2520porn%2520isn%2520't%2520no%2520porn%2520...it's%2520to%2520try%2520and%2520make%2520better%2520porn%2522&amp;f=false|title=The Pornography Industry: What Everyone Needs to Know|last=Tarrant|first=Shira|date=2016-03-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190205133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;". By acknowledging that a better, more subversive, empowering and liberated porn is being made, La Fête du Slip’s International Sex Positive Porn Competition brings together the porn performers, producers, distributors and consumers and makes this new cultural sector thrive.

By way of appeal for submission, worldwide pornographers are invited to send their sex positive porn films. A jury made of respected and well-known professionals then selects the ones that, according to them, are the more representative of a fresh and bold porn, while still remaining significantly marginal, and while authentically and humorously questioning the various definitions of pornography, sex, and gender. Among these selected films, ten are further nominated for the grand prize: '''Le Slip d’Or'''.

=== Structure, Criteria, Prizes ===

La Fête du Slip’s International Sex Positive Porn Competition has three concentric sections, with three prizes :
* ''Le Fap d’Or''
This competitive section is open to all sex positive porn films, regardless of year of production, premiere status and duration. The films selected in the two more selective sections, Le Prix du Public and the ''Slip d’Or'' are included in this section automatically. Only the accredited professionals of the festival may vote for their favorite film, and the winner will receive the ''Fap d’Or'' prize.
* ''Le Prix du Public''
This competitive section is limited to films of duration of less than 20 min, released in the 12 months prior to the submission deadline. Premiere status is not relevant. The audience of the festival will vote for their favorite film by paper ballot. The winner will win the ''Prix du Public'' prize.
* The Official Competition - ''Le Slip d’Or''
A smaller selection of films will be in the official competition. A jury of three porn film professionals will judge these films. This competitive section is limited to films shorter than 20 minutes, released in the 12 months prior to the submission deadline, and films presenting at least their international premiere at La Fête du Slip, and Swiss premiere for Swiss films. The winner selected by the jury will receive the ''Slip d’Or'' prize

'''Lo Fu-chu''' ({{zh|c=羅福助|p=Luó Fúzhù}}; born July 2, 1943) is a former Taiwanese legislator and a self-described leader of the "Celestial Alliance" organized criminal organization. In the late 1990s and early 2000s he was known as the most notorious person involved with organized crime then holding public office, and was reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in Taiwan. While in office he was described by other legislators as "verbally and physically violent", and he was arrested the same day that his second legislative term ended, in 2002. After leaving office Lo fought and appealed many charges over the next decade, but was eventually convicted in 2012 for money laundering and insider trading and sentenced to four years in prison. Following his conviction Lo was released on bail and subsequently disappeared. Officials at the Taiwanese [[Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau|Criminal Investigation Bureau]] believe that he has probably fled to China, where he has investments in the hotel and entertainment industries.

==Early career==
By the early 1980s, Lo was a mid-level figure in the Taiwanese underworld. Lo's brother was murdered by another figure in the Taiwanese mafia, but Lo was not senior enough to take revenge.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}}

In 1984 Lo was detained for three years following Operation Clean Sweep, an effort by Taiwanese police to target organized criminal organizations and their members.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}} Including Lo, 2,346 alleged "gangsters" were arrested in Operation Clean Sweep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=117408&amp;CtNode=451 "Minister Discusses Elections and Sees ‘Operation Clean Sweep’ Lessening Crime"]. ''Taiwan Today''. October 28, 1985. Retrieved September 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release, Lo joined, and became a leader of, a new criminal organization named the "Celestial Alliance",{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}} which was formed by a coalition of mob bosses who had been jailed together during Operation Clean Sweep.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, Jonathan.

Lo's leadership contributed to the growth of the Celestial Alliance, and it eventually became one of the three largest organized criminal organizations in Taiwan.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}} The Celestial Alliance has become involved in a wide variety of legal and illegal operations, including construction, entertainment, the hotel industry, waste disposal, real estate, extortion, illegal logging, cyber crime, human trafficking, arms and drug smuggling,&lt;ref name="Kastner"&gt;Kastner, Jens.

In 1990 the Taiwanese government launched another initiative targeting organized crime, Operation Thunderbolt, and Lo was personally identified by [[Hau Pei-tsun]], the Taiwanese premier, as the operation's chief target. Lo evaded detention by fleeing Taiwan, and remained abroad until 1992. While Lo was abroad, two of his sons were elected to public office:{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}} one, [[Lo Ming-tai]], was elected to [[Legislative Yuan]] as a Kuomintang representative,&lt;ref name="CPS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huang, Joyce.

Retrieved June 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and the other was elected to the municipal assembly of [[Xindian District|Xindian]].{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=116}}

Following his return to Taiwan, Lo became a successful entrepreneur and businessman. His investment in the construction and real estate industries, and (allegedly) in illegal gambling operations led him to become one of the wealthiest men in Taiwan. In order to establish a good relationship with the people of his hometown, Xindian, he organized a local charitable organization for the elderly and made several large public donations to the community. In 1995, motivated partially because he believed it would assist him in avoiding criminal investigation, he ran for a seat in Taiwan's [[Legislative Yuan|Legislative Assembly]] as an independent candidate, and won.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|pp=116-8}} (In Taiwan, sitting legislators are immune from arrest or imprisonment unless a majority of their fellow legislators vote otherwise).&lt;ref name="Chuang2002"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chuang |first=Jimmy |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2002/02/01/0000122311 |title=Lo Fu-chu Has His Assault Sentenced Raised a Notch |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=1 Feb 2002 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===Political activity===
Lo was elected in 1995, and was re-elected in 1998.&lt;ref name="SWCNA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2012/04/25/2003531204 |title=Lo Fu-chu warrants issued |work=Taipei Times |date=25 Apr 2012 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his election to the legislature, Lo led a small bloc of 11 independent legislators, informally referred to as the "Non-Party Alliance". Because neither of Taiwan's two major political parties (the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP)) had clear majorities, Lo's bloc often held the deciding swing votes. He quickly acquired a reputation as a mediator and arbitrator within the government. He generally sided with the KMT on important issues,&lt;ref name="Pan" /&gt;{{sfnp|Chin|2003|pp=116-7}} but sided with the DPP in 2000 in order to keep the DPP president, [[Chen Shui-bian]], from being impeached.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=118}}

Because of the good relationship that Lo developed with KMT legislators, he was appointed to both attend and chair numerous government committees, including transportation, construction, and several associated with business. In 1998 Lo was appointed to the legislature's judicial committee. Because of Lo's reputation as an organized crime boss, Taiwan's Justice Minister, [[Liao Cheng-hao]], refused to attend the justice committee's meetings while he was a member. In 2000 Lo was appointed to be one of the three co-chairs of the judicial committee, but because of Lo's reputation his appointment was widely protested and criticized by the Taiwanese media, public, and judiciary.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=117}}

In the 2000 presidential election the KMT vice-president, [[Lien Chan]], attempted to utilize Lo's underworld connections in order to help him run for president. Public anger against Lo's public support of Lien was one of the factors leading to the victory of Lien's rival, Chen Shui-bian.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Lary. [http://www.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/papers/taiwan.pdf "How Democratic Is Taiwan? Five Key Challenges for Democratic Development and Consolidation"]. ''Columbia University''. April 1, 2001. Retrieved September 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other activities while in office===
During Lo's first term he gained a reputation for being "verbally and physically violent".{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=117}} He was often at the center of several brawls that occasionally occurred within the Taiwanese legislature, once allegedly swinging an aluminum bar at his political rivals during a dispute.&lt;ref name="Pan" /&gt; He threatened legislators who opposed him, telling one rival: "One day, you may not know how you die." He once insulted a DPP legislator for twenty minutes during a legislative session.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=142}}

In 1996 an independent legislator, [[Liao Hsueh-kung]], publicly accused Lo of being a "gangster". Soon after his accusation, Liao was abducted from his home in the middle of the night,{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=142}} blindfolded, stripped naked and locked inside a dog cage that was then left at the side of the road&lt;ref name="Nunns" /&gt; beside a banner that read "Doing Justice for Heaven". Lo denied any involvement. A young man was later arrested, but it was widely assumed that the Celestial Alliance was responsible.{{sfnp|Chin|2003|p=142}}

In 1998 Lo attempted to strangle a DPP legislator, [[Yu Jane-daw]], during a legislative session when Yu attempted to interrupt Lo, who was fighting [[Lee Wen-chung]] over the passage of a lottery bill.&lt;ref name="Pan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Crystal|title=Lawmakers fear fights to go unchecked|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/03/29/0000079506|accessdate=February 23, 2017|work=Taipei Times|date=March 29, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his assault the Taiwan High Court sentenced Lo to either spend 59 days in prison or pay a fine of NT$53,100 (slightly less than US$2,000) in 2001; but, because Taiwanese legislators cannot be arrested or imprisoned, Lo would not face any potential legal consequences until after his term in office ended, in 2002.&lt;ref name="Chuang"&gt;Chuang&lt;/ref&gt; Lo appealed the conviction, but the appeals judge increased the sentence to five months in prison or the option to pay a NT$135,000 fine (approximately $4,500 US). Because this was his final appeal, Lo decided to pay the fine.&lt;ref name="CPS"&gt;China Post staff.

Retrieved February 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo was sent to the legislature's discipline committee in 1999, but the case was dropped because over 2/3 of the committee members chose not to attend. Several other DPP legislators also claimed that Lo had assaulted them, but no evidence could be produced and the alleged assaults did not take place in public.&lt;ref name="Low"&gt;Low, Stephanie. [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/local/archives/2001/03/31/0000079784 "Legislature Censures Lo Fu-chu"]. ''Taipei Times''. March 31, 2001. Retrieved September 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed about the many allegations against him in 2000, Lo dismissed them as politically motivated attempts to discredit him, claimed that his opponents lacked any evidence that he had any criminal involvement, and presented himself as an honest businessman who only sought public office at the request of religious leaders who had convinced him that he owed it to society. When asked about his violent actions within the Taiwanese legislature, Lo responded: "When I beat people up, it's because I'm trying to get legislation approved."&lt;ref name="Pan" /&gt;

On 28 March 2001, Lo slapped, punched, and pulled the hair of a legislator from the [[Pan-Blue Coalition|Pan-Blue]] [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]], [[Diane Lee]],&lt;ref name="D56"&gt;Diamond 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; during a meeting of the Education and Culture Committee,&lt;ref name="Low" /&gt; after she implied that he had attempted to interfere with the selection of board members for a public educational institution that was experiencing a corruption scandal&lt;ref name="D56" /&gt; and called him a "gangster".&lt;ref name="Dou"&gt;Doufu, Joe.

Retrieved September 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Lo originally denied that he had assaulted Lee, until a video of the incident (which Lo did not know existed) was shown on Taiwanese television.&lt;ref name="D56" /&gt; Lee was hospitalized following the incident with a slight concussion.&lt;ref name="Chuang" /&gt;

Following the public revelations of Lo's assault, he refused to apologize to Lee, but announced that he would take a leave from the legislature for three months beginning 29 March 2001 as a form of self-punishment. This was not viewed as sufficient by most of the other representatives, who passed a censure against him on March 30 recommending a six-month suspension from legislative duties.&lt;ref name="Low" /&gt; Following his censure, Lo remained abroad until late 2001.&lt;ref name="CPS" /&gt;

==Post-political activities==

===Legal difficulties===
Immediately after Lo's term ended (along with his legislative immunity to arrest), on 1 February 2002, prosecutors at the Taiwanese High Court's anti-corruption and anti-organized crime center directed police to arrest Lo, possibly due to fears that delaying his arrest would allow him to flee Taiwan or destroy incriminating evidence. He was first interviewed by the Taipei Prosecutor's Office about suspicions that he had embezzled money from three companies: Taishin Securities (of which he was president); Chinlungtai Co.; and, Li-ta Food Co. He was then sent to the Taipei branch of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau for questioning concerning other suspected criminal activity. Other alleged illegal activity then being investigated included the assault on Diane Lee and an alleged attempt to extort money from the board members of the Jin-wen Institute of Technology.&lt;ref name="CPS" /&gt; Following his arrest, Lo was detained for four months leading up to his conviction.&lt;ref name="SWCNA" /&gt;

Prosecutors alleged that Lo had illegally gained a fortune of NT$1.3 billion (nearly US$44 million) through embezzlement, by taking advantage of his position as a lawmaker, and by working with organized crime to blackmail businessmen from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China. Prosecutors also presented evidence that Lo had evaded taxes. In early 2002 the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, announced his intention to “eradicate black gold politics and put the most notorious gangster in northern Taiwan behind bars.”  Shortly following this announcement, in June 2002, Lo was indicted on charges of corruption, fraud, usury, forgery, breach of trust, and misappropriation of funds. Prosecutors asked the judge at Lo's trial to give him a 30-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Chuang2008"&gt;Chuang, Jimmy. [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/08/13/2003420184 "Court Drops Case Against Lo Fu-chu"]. ''Taipei Times''. August 13, 2008. Retrieved September 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lo appealed the decision, and on 25 September 2003 the Taipei District Court reduced his conviction to four years. Lo again appealed, and on 27 April 2006 High Court judges again reduced his sentence to three years and nine months. Lo was granted another appeal, and on 12 August 2008 was cleared of all charges.&lt;ref name="Chuang2008" /&gt;

24 other people were also charged with crimes related to Lo's case. In 2008 all other defendants received sentences of one to three months, except for Lo's financial manager, Lin Chin-Yuan, who was convicted of breaching the Business Accounting Law and Securities and Exchange Act and ordered to serve three years and two months in prison and pay a fine of NT$10 million (US$330,000).&lt;ref name="Chuang2008" /&gt;

During the period that Lo was being tried, he attempted to run for government office. In 2004 he ran for a seat in the government of [[Taipei County]], but was forced to pull out of the election. Lo claimed that his decision not to run was because he was asked to do so by his mother, and that it was not related to rumors that he had insufficient campaign funds.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Reporter. [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/11/02/2003209347 "Lo Fu-chu Pulls out of Taipei Race"]. ''Taipei Times''. November 2, 2004. Retrieved September 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hualien County Kuomintang approved Lo to run in the 2009 county magistracy election, but the decision was overturned by the KMT Organization and Development Committee.&lt;ref name="MoHsu2009"&gt;Mo, Yan-chih and Hsu, Jenny W.

===Conviction and flight===
On 28 March 2013, Lo was convicted of stock manipulation, money laundering, and insider trading under the Securities and Exchange and Business Accounting Acts. He was given a four-year sentence and fined NT$6 million (US$200,000). Following his trial Lo was released on a NT$10 million (US$330,000) bond, but then failed to report to police on April 24 to begin serving his sentence. The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office received an appeal from Lo, but this was rejected, and the office issued 22 arrest warrants for him and confiscated his bond.&lt;ref name="SWCNA" /&gt;

Officials at the Taiwanese [[Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau|Criminal Investigation Bureau]] believed that he had likely fled to either the United States or Australia (where he has many friends and relatives),&lt;ref name="SWCNA" /&gt; or to mainland China (due to his many business investments in Beijing and Shanghai).&lt;ref name="Nunns" /&gt; The Chinese government considers Lo a fugitive, and states that, if arrested, they will deport him to Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; (Mainland China is the most popular destination for Taiwanese fugitives seeking to flee abroad, partially because Chinese authorities have sometimes been reluctant to arrest wealthy criminals from Taiwan, as long as they do not commit crimes in China.){{sfnp|Chin|2003|pp=198, 202}} If not arrested, Lo will remain a fugitive until 2030, when the statute of limitations runs out.&lt;ref name="SWCNA" /&gt;

Following Lo's disappearance there was speculation in the international media that agents of the Chinese intelligence apparatus had already found him, and would use his connections within the Taiwanese underworld to attempt to influence events in Taiwan. One incident in which Lo's influence was suspected occurred in May 2013, when hundreds of persons reputed to be associated with the Celestial Alliance attempted to simultaneously join the DPP, a party hostile to the Chinese government. After this incident occurred, some journalists covering this event suggested that the Chinese intelligence service had used Lo to influence his subordinates to join the DPP, so that they could influence the party's candidates and policies from within.&lt;ref name="Kastner" /&gt; After investigating the incident, the DPP publicly blamed Lo.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chris.

'''Logistics engineering''' is a  field of engineering dedicated to the scientific organization of the [[purchase]], [[transport]], storage, [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[warehousing]] of materials and finished goods. Logistics engineering is a complex science that considers trade-offs in component/system design, repair capability, training, [[Spare parts management|spares inventory]], demand history, storage and distribution points, transportation methods, etc., to ensure the "thing" is where it's needed, when it's needed, and operating the way it's needed all at an acceptable cost.

==Overview==

[[Logistics]] is generally concerned with [[Cost centre (business)|cost centre]] service activities, but provides [[value (economics)|value]] via improved [[efficiency]] and customer satisfaction. It can quickly lose that value if the customer becomes dissatisfied. The end customer can include another process or work center inside of the manufacturing facility, a [[warehouse]] where items are stocked or the final customer who will use the product. Another approach which has appeared in recent years is the [[supply chain management]]. The supply chain  also looks at an efficient chaining of the supply / purchase and distribution sides of an [[organization]]. While logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate supply and distribution linked up, supply chain looks at multiple echelons/stages, right from [[procurement]] of the [[raw material]]s to the final distribution of finished goods up to the customer. It is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities, can result in better profitability for the organization. The [[local minimum]] of total cost of the manufacturing operation is getting replaced by the [[global minimum]] of total cost of the whole chain, resulting in better profitability for the chain members and hence lower costs for the products.

Logistics engineering as a discipline is a very important aspect of [[systems engineering]] that also includes [[reliability engineering]]. It is the science and process whereby [[Reliability_engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]], and [[availability]] are designed into products or systems. It includes the supply and physical distribution considerations above as well as more fundamental engineering considerations. Logistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements such as [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), [[statistical distribution]]s, [[queueing theory]], and a host of other considerations. For example, if we want to produce a system that is 95% reliable (or improve a system to achieve 95% reliability), a logistics engineer understands that total system reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or component. Therefore our logistics engineer must consider the reliability of all subcomponents or subsystems and modify system design accordingly. If a subsystem is only 50% reliable, one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem, design in multiple subsystems in parallel (5 in this case would achieve approximately 97% reliability of that subsystem), purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out, establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time, and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs. reliability solution.  Then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem.

===The name: logistics engineering===

The are few differences between the terms [[business logistics]] and logistics engineering. Logistics engineering is more focused on the mathematical or scientific application of logistics.&lt;ref&gt;G. Don Taylor, Logistics Engineering Handbook, CRC Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include:

*[[Customer Service]]: provision of services to customers before, during and after a purchase
*[[Purchasing]]: acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals
*[[Outsourcing|Sourcing]]: procurement practices, aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services
*[[Demand forecasting]]: the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management
*[[Facility location problem|Facility Location]]: the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities
*Layout Design
*[[Inventory control]]: the activity of checking a shop’s stock
*[[Material Handling]]: short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle
*[[Warehousing]]
*Distribution System Design
*[[Reliability Engineering]]: sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product
*[[Reverse logistics]]: the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal
*[[Green logistics]]: attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities
*[[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal transport]]
*Supportability analysis

===Performance metrics===
{{main|Performance metric}}

Different [[performance metric]]s (measures of performance) are used to examine the efficiency of an organization's logistics. The most popular and widely used performance metric is the landed cost. The landed cost is the total cost of purchasing, transporting, warehousing and distributing raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods.

Another performance metric equally important is the end customer [[Service level#.CE.B2 service level .28type 2.2C also known as .22fill rate.22.29|fill rate]]. It is the percentage of customer demand which is satisfied immediately off-the-shelf (from on-site inventory).  An alternative to fill rate, is system [[availability]].

In recent years, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has advocated the use of [[performance-based logistics]] (PBL) contracts to manage costs for support of [[weapon system]]s.

'''Luigi "Gino" Macaluso''' (9 June 1948 – 27 October 2010) was the President and Chairman of the [[Sowind group]], under whose roof a watch Manufacture and the two Brands [[Girard-Perregaux]] and JeanRichard are united. Since the long-term strategic cooperation agreement signed with [[PPR (company)|Kering]] in June 2008, he had also joined the Gucci Group Management Committee and the Boucheron Board of Directors.

==Career==
He was born in Turin, Italy, on 9 June 1948. He founded one of the major watch wholesaling company in Italy in 1982 (Blancpain, Breitling, Hamilton). In 1987, he became the Italian distributor of Girard-Perregaux, a company with a history going back to the year 1791, based in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Its Tourbillon with three Gold Bridges is regarded as a landmark in the history of Swiss watchmaking. In 1989, he joined the Company's board of Directors. On 15 September 1992, he took over Girard-Perregaux.&lt;ref&gt;ArmbandUhren, Special Girard-Perregaux, p. 66-69, "The Macaluso Family"&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his leadership, the firm refined its strategy, with a focus on the high-end segment.&lt;ref&gt;François Chaille, Girard-Perregaux, p. 120-123"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alter producing only quartz watches for almost 20 years, Macaluso turned Girard Perregaux into a genuine Manufacture. Since then, the brand builds high end mechanical watches with their own calibers, developed and manufactured in house. With his knowledge of architecture – he held a degree in the field– he was closely involved in the design of the Brand’s creations.

Macaluso was President of the AIHH (Fine watchmaking Professional Association) in 1999, 2001 and 2004.

On October 27th 2010, Luigi Macaluso unexpectedly died at age 62 after suffering a heart attack. Luigi was married to Monica and was the father of four children, Stefano, Massimo, Anna and Margherita. More than 10 years ago, his two sons joined him at the head of the Sowind Group.

An architect, former motor racing driver and entrepreneur, he had been behind the wheel of Girard-Perregaux since 1992. A firm believer in the value of an authentic Haute Horlogerie Manufacture, he pioneered the development of an integrated production strategy. A charismatic leader, he was able to make Sowind Group an essential player in Swiss Haute Horlogerie.

==Distinctions==
In 1998, Luigi Macaluso was awarded the [[Prix Gaïa]] for the entrepreneurship category, the highest distinction within the Swiss watchmaking world, attributed by the Musée International de l'Horlogerie.

In 2008, he was appointed a Grand Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. In 2009, he was appointed a Knight of the [[Order of Merit for Labour]].

==Motor sports==
Motor racing played a pivotal role in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Vanity Fair On Time, October 2009, “On the Road”, p. 37-38"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, he won the title of [[European Rally Championship|European Rally Champion]] as co-driver to [[Raffaele Pinto]] in a [[Fiat 124 Sport Spider]]. In 1985, he joined the Club Italia, a not-for-profit organization promoting the Italian historic car patrimony and over which he presides.
In 2001, he was elected President of the CSAI, the Italian Motor Sport Federation. He served as President of the [[FIA]]’s Karting Commission and sat on the FIA World Council.

'''Luis Aguad Jorge''' (August 25, 1925 – November 6, 2007) was a Cuban actor and salesman who, due to his small size, was better known as "El Enanito de [[Holsum Bread|Holsum]]", a bread company that he worked for many years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holsumpr.com/en/corporativo/holsums-little-big-man-don-luis-aguad-jorge|title=Holsum's Little Big Man, Don Luis Aguad Jorge - Holsum de Puerto Rico|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Aguad Jorge was born in a [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] suburb. As a young man, he met and befriended [[Joaquin Monserrat]],  an actor who later moved to Puerto Rico and became famous there as children's character "Pacheco".

Aguad Jorge himself became involved in acting during his youth in Havana, performing at several theatrical plays there.

==Life in Puerto Rico==
In 1961, Aguad Jorge moved from Cuba to [[Puerto Rico]], where he reunited with old times friend Monserrat. He was introduced to [[Luis Vigoreaux|Luis Vigoreaux, sr.]] and to [[Tommy Muniz|Tomas Muniz, jr.]]. This in turn led him to get a role in the 1965 Puerto Rican television show ''[[La Criada Malcriada]]'', starring [[Velda Gonzalez]] [[Jacobo Morales]], [[Emma Rosa Vicenti]] and Aguad Jorge himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059068/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=La criada malcriada|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was a major hit and Aguad Jorge became a celebrity across his new country.

This show was immensely popular among Puerto Ricans (even influencing a local tomato sauce brand to rename itself as "Criada" sauce) and, in 1968, Puerto Rican marketing firm "Badillo-Compton" came with the idea for Holsum Bread to hire Aguad Jorge as national brand spokesperson in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://palmirar.com/tag/jingles/|title=jingles - PALMIRA|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friend and fellow Puerto Rico celebrity "Pacheco" himself introduced Aguad Jorge to his new job at Holsum. Aguad Jorge enjoyed his new job so much that he actually not only performed as the brand's spokesperson, but worked himself at Holsum's plant daily for the next 23 years until he retired in 1991. He also had Holsum make a custom sized truck that he drove himself to personal public appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holsumpr.com/en/corporativo/enanito-holsum-don-luis-aguad-jorge|title=El Enanito de Holsum, Don Luis Aguad Jorge - Holsum de Puerto Rico|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguad Jorge continued participating on Puerto Rican television until his later years, on a show named "Contra el Reloj", alongside Monserrat, on [[WAPA TV|Canal 4]] in Puerto Rico. In this show, he shared activities with Jeanie Carrion, sister of the later to become famous show host and businessman, Puerto Rican [[Josue Carrion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/estilos-de-vida/cultura/nota/jeaniecarrionlanenadepachecocreciovideo-923583/|title=Jeanie Carrión: la nena de Pacheco creció-VÍDEO|date=24 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Luis Aguad Jorge died on November 6, 2007, at a retirement home in San Juan, ''Nuestra Senora de la Providencia'', where he had been living since 2005.&lt;ref name="primerahora.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/farandula/nota/falleceelenanitoholsum-125977/|title=Fallece el Enanito Holsum|date=6 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was attended by, among others, Puerto Rican businessman, actor, show host and politician [[Roberto Vigoreaux]]-son of Luis Vigoreaux, sr.-and Holsum Puerto Rico president [[Ramon Calderon (businessman)|Ramon Calderon]]. As his body was driven from the funeral home to [[Porta Coeli cemetery]] in [[Bayamon, Puerto Rico|Bayamon]], Holsum company trucks lined up at [[Las Americas Expressway]], all with dark linens on, in honor of Aguad Jorge.&lt;ref name="primerahora.com"/&gt;

Due to his love for Puerto Rico and its people, Aguad Jorge had requested that, shall relations between Cuba and the United States normalize before his passing, he be allowed to die in his adopted nation. Also per his request, he was buried with his Holsum Breads uniform on, as he came to love that company and consider his co-workers there as his second family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''National Consumer Panel''' (NCP) is a service provided by a joint venture between the [[Nielsen Company|Nielsen]] company and [[IRI Company|IRI]] (formerly SymphonyIRI Group) where members in the USA scan the [[barcodes]] on all their purchases with a special [[barcode reader]] to read a product's barcode and an [[Application software|app]] supplying unlisted barcodes such as takeaways and market items. The NCP program was formerly known as the [[Homescan]] Consumer Panel before the formation of the joint venture with IRI and the merger of the two companies' existing panels.

The store, price, quantity, and special deals have to be entered manually for the products scanned and the information is transmitted weekly to the company. This information then allows the company to calculate measures such as [[market penetration]], average weight of purchase and loyalty for its manufacturing clients. In return for scanning services, participants earn "rewards points".

== Program Details ==

The company calls the participants its "panelists" and they represent a "mini USA" in which they track what people buy from where and send it to marketing companies and manufacturing clients. Panelists are requested to scan their data after every shopping trip, including simple purchases such as a candy bar or soda from a vending machine, lottery tickets, fruits and vegetables, gasoline, and anything with a barcode. The scanner records what store the purchase was made at, the price and quantity of each product, as well as the total amount spent at that store.

The data is expected to be transmitted weekly to NCP either directly (by connecting the scanner to a phone line) or by USB connection to computer where their software is installed. After each transmission the panelist receives "points" which can be redeemed for prizes in the NCP catalog, which contains several different types of prizes. Points per transmission increase depending on the length of time spent in the panel, bonus points are awarded if no weekly submissions are missed. In addition, NCP periodically runs sweepstakes in which one weekly transmission is considered one entry into the drawing.

Besides price scanning, Nielsen collects data through online surveys matched to panelist based on shopping data, household demographics, and the needs of their current clients. There is an "NCP Connect" option in which NCP requests the panelist to install software onto their home computers to monitor how they use the internet, what they buy, and what they do with their computer. Membership in this section of the panel rewarded with the usual points and sweepstakes entries.

Membership in the program is available through online registration at the [http://ad.ncpsignup.com/ NCP website]. Acceptance into the program is based on household demographics and the current needs of the company.

As explained in the ''Journal of Accountancy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aicpa.org/PUBS/JOFA/oct2003/ratcliff.htm | title=OCBOA Financial Statements | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031009100446/http://www.aicpa.org/PUBS/JOFA/oct2003/ratcliff.htm | archivedate=2003-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
under [[Statements on Auditing Standards (United States)|Statement on Auditing Standards (United States)]] [http://umiss.lib.olemiss.edu:82/record=b1038085%20full-text  No. 62, Special Reports], an OCBOA is any one of

*A statutory basis of accounting (for example, a basis of accounting insurance companies use under the rules of a state insurance commission).
*Income-tax-basis financial statements.
*Cash-basis and modified-cash-basis financial statements.
*Financial statements prepared using definitive criteria having substantial support in accounting literature that the preparer applies to all material items appearing in the statements (such as the price level basis of accounting).

In situations where GAAP-basis statements aren't necessary because of loan covenants, regulatory requirements or similar circumstances, an OCBOA may just be the answer.

'''Panapasa Balekana''', [[MBE]],&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; [[Solomon Islands Medal|SIM]],&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; (1929 – 22 January 2009) was a Fijian-born [[Solomon Islands|Solomon Islander]] who [[Composer|composed]] the [[national anthem]] of the [[Solomon Islands]], ''[[God Save Our Solomon Islands]]'', with his wife, [[Matila Balekana]]. Panapasa Balekana [[songwriter|co-wrote]] the anthem's [[lyrics]] with his wife while he composed the accompanying music.

The anthem was adopted by the country upon its independence in 1978 following a government competition.&lt;ref name=stimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Solomons National Anthem Composer Dies in Honiara |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3439|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Balekana was originally from [[Kadavu Island|Kandavu]], Fiji.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He moved to the [[Solomon Islands]] in 1953 to work as a [[mechanic]] for the government, which was under British colonial administration at the time.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He was unmarried when he first moved to the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; He eventually married a Fijian woman, [[Matila Balekana]]&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; and resided in the Solomon Islands for most of his adult life.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; The couple had two children, a son and a daughter.

Balekana "fell in love" with the Solomon Islands and decided to stay in the country rather than return to [[Fiji]].&lt;ref name=sstar&gt;{{cite news |title=State funeral today for late Balekana |url=http://solomonstarnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6088&amp;Itemid=26|work=[[Solomon Star]]|date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many occasions, Balekana publicly called the Solomon Islands "my home".&lt;ref name=stimes2&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna|last=Sireheto|title=State Funeral for Composer of National Anthem  |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3446|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balekana and his family joined the Wesley United Church in [[Honiara]]. He remained heavily involved with the congregation, serving as a church pastor&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; and choirmaster.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

==National anthem==
In the run-up to independence on 7 July 1978, the government of the Solomon Islands decided that it needed a [[national anthem]] for the occasion. The government announced on the radio that it would accept submissions from the general public for a new anthem.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Panapasa Balekana and his wife, [[Matila Balekana]], decided to jointly enter the competition as a team.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; The couple agreed that the new anthem should be in the form of a prayer, asking God to support and guide the new island nation.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Balekana claimed in interviews to have received his [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for the anthem in a dream.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; After he woke up from the dream, Balekana and his wife immediately began writing words and lyrics, as well as composing the tune.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Panapasa and Matila Balekana co-wrote the lyrics for the anthem, while Panapasa Balekana composed the accompanying music. The couple credited prayer and God for their success in creating the anthem, noting how well the song came together.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Once the lyrics and music had been composed, Panapasa and Matila Balekana received help recording the prospective anthem from the Wesley United Church choir at the couple's own congregation.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; The choir sang the song for the first time, which was recorded on tape and submitted to competition officials.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

The Balekanas' submission, ''[[God Save Our Solomon Islands]]'', won the competition, and became the national anthem of the Solomon Islands.  It was sung on the country's first independence day, 7 July 1978. Balekana was overjoyed and explained the importance of the anthem and its meaning, ''"Solomon Islands national anthem was written in a form of prayer asking God for safe keeping and protection of our new nation. By the power and grace of God, we may receive joy, peace, progress and prosperity, if only we can be able to work together in harmony. These may be the foundation of building our nation, as we can be rest assured that we will reach our destination- stands forever more."''&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

==Later life==
Panapasa Balekana retired from his work as a government mechanic in 1988.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; Following his retirement he became the manager and director of a Solomon Islander soft drink company, Szetu Enterprise.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt;

In 2000, Panapasa was asked by police to leave the country with his family for his own safety due to the [[History of the Solomon Islands#Civil war|ethnic unrest]] sweeping the Solomon Islands at the time.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Panapasa refused to seek refuge from the violence abroad explaining his loyalty to his adopted country, ''"I refused and told them that this is my home and should anything happen, this is where I'm supposed to die, this is the place – my home."''&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt;

Panapasa continued to work as the Wesley United Church choir director until he became too weak in his later years.&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; His son took over the position.

==Death==
Panapasa Balekana died on 22 January 2009, at his home in [[Henderson, Solomon Islands]], which is located east of the capital city of [[Honiara]].&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; He was 79 years old.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; He was survived by his wife, daughter, son and five grandchildren.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt;

Balekana was given a [[state funeral]] by the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; Balekana's body was [[laid in state]] in the main chamber of the [[National Parliament of the Solomon Islands]] in the morning of 26 January 2009.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; VIPs were allowed to lay [[wreaths]] in honour of Balekana at the Parliament.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

Diginitaries attending the viewing and funeral included the [[Governor-General of the Solomon Islands]] [[Nathaniel Waena]].&lt;ref name=stimes/&gt; Governor-General Waena and Lady Waena led the viewing procession.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; Other leading officials at the viewing, by [[order of precedence]], included Prime Minister Dr. Derek Sikua and his wife, Doris Sikua; [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker to Parliament]] Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]] his wife, Lady Kenilorea; the Chief Justice Sir Albert Palmer; and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Fred Fono and his wife.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt; Several former Governors-General, [[cabinet members]], opposition leaders, members of parliament, the [[diplomatic corps]], and the Mayor of Honiara [[Andrew Mua]] also attended the state viewing and funeral.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

A procession, which included members of the general public, went from Parliemant to the Wesley United Church in Honiara for the funeral in the afternoon.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;&lt;ref name=sstar/&gt; The national anthem, ''God Save Our Solomon Islands'', was performed during the funeral service in Balekana's honour.&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

A police escort brought Balekana's body from the church to the cemetery at Number 3, near the Honiara High School, for burial.&lt;ref name=stimes3&gt;{{cite news |first=Joanna|last=Sireheto|title=Solomons Honour National Anthem Composer   |url=http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=3454|work=[[Solomon Times]]|date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wreaths were laid by the public before the [[casket]] was lowered into the [[gravesite]].&lt;ref name=stimes3/&gt;

'''Protais Zigiranyirazo''' (born 1938?) commonly known as '''Monsieur Zed''' ("Mr. Z"), is a [[Rwanda]]n businessman and politician.  He is the former governor of [[Ruhengeri]] prefecture in northwestern Rwanda.  He has also been accused of collaborating in the [[Rwandan Genocide|1994 Rwandan genocide]] and the 1985 murder of [[Dian Fossey]].

Between 1974 and 1989 Zigiranyirazo served as governor of [[Ruhengeri]].  An ethnic [[Hutu]], he was well-connected to the Hutu establishment of politicians, businessmen and military officers which then controlled Rwanda: he is the brother of [[Agathe Habyarimana|Agathe Kanziga]], wife of the late Rwandan president [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], whose assassination on 6 April 1994 precipitated the events leading to the [[genocide]].

In 1989 he resigned his position as prefect to study at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] (UQAM) in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.  He was expelled from UQAM and from Canada in 1993 after being convicted of uttering death threats against two [[Tutsi]] refugees in Montreal, who "accused him of participating in the planning of ethnic massacres." &lt;ref name=globeandmail19940713a&gt;{{cite news

== Genocide allegations ==

Zigiranyirazo returned to Rwanda following his expulsion from Canada.  The Office of the Prosecutor of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) has accused him of committing several crimes during the months of the genocide in 1994.  Specifically, ICTR alleges that Zigiranyirazo "ordered or authorized roadblocks to be established in direct proximity to each of his three residences ... knowing and intending that they would be used in the campaign of extermination and killing."

Further "Protais Zigiranyirazo further instructed men at the roadblock to kill all [[Tutsi]] that attempted to pass through. Shortly thereafter, and on a continuing basis, soldiers and ''[[Interahamwe]]'' killed a number of people in their homes and killed people identified as Tutsi that attempted to pass through the roadblock."

==Arrest and court appearances==
From sometime after 1994 until July 2001 Zigiranyirazo resided in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].  On 21 July 2001 he was arrested in a [[Brussels airport]]  and seeking asylum in [[Belgium]].  On 4 October 2001 the Belgian government handed him over to the [[ICTR]].

On his initial appearance before the court in October 2001 he was charged with two counts of crimes against humanity.  The indictment against him was, however, amended pending his second appearance on 25 November 2003.  The amended indictment accuses him of committing genocide against Tutsis between April and July 1994 in [[Kigali]] and [[Gisenyi]]. Trial Chamber III composed of Judges Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca, Khalida Rachid Khan and Lee Gacuiga Muthoga, on Thursday 18 December 2008, convicted Protais Zigiranyirazo of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment. Credit was given to him for time spent in prison. The verdict was overturned by the Appeal chamber of the ICTR who acquitted him of all charges on 16 November 2009, ordering the immediate release of Mr Zigiranyirazo and citing that the court has made serious errors in the initial judgement.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://unictr.org/Portals/0/Case%5CEnglish%5CZigiranyirazo%5Cdecisions%5C091116.pdf PROTAIS ZIGIRANYIRAZO v. THE PROSECUTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zigiranyirazo's acquittal, which was partly based on the fact that he was not found to have engaged in "genocide planning," has been criticized for giving credence to denial that the Rwandan genocide was planned by its perpetrators.

Based on records, Protais Zigiranyirazo resigned and abandoned politics in 1989 and since then, he has never been involved in political activities which has influenced the acquittal decision.

'''''The Secret of My Success''''' (sometimes stylized as ''The Secret of My Succe$s'') is a 1987 American [[comedy film]] produced and directed by [[Herbert Ross]], and starring [[Michael J. Fox]] and [[Helen Slater]]. The screenplay was written by [[AJ Carothers|A.J. Carothers]], [[Jim Cash]] and [[Jack Epps, Jr.]] from a story written by Carothers.

==Plot==
Brantley Foster ([[Michael J. Fox]]) is a recent graduate of [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City where he has landed an [[entry level]] job as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is laid off before he even starts working.

After several unsuccessful attempts to get another job, mostly because he is either overqualified or underqualified and has little experience, Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, which is directed by his uncle, Howard Prescott ([[Richard Jordan]]), the CEO. Pemrose was founded by Howard's father-in-law; Howard received presidency of the company by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose ([[Margaret Whitton]]).

Upon inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Howard and most of his fellow "suits" (executives) are making ineffective or detrimental decisions. After Brantley notices an empty office in the building due to one of Howard's frequent firings, he uses his access to the mailroom and his understanding of company processes to create the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive. Brantley then assumes this role.

While handling two jobs (switching between casual wear and business suits in the elevator), Brantley also falls head-over-heels for Christy Wills ([[Helen Slater]]), a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from [[Harvard]]. Brantley meets Vera after driving her home in a company limo (at his employer's request). Vera persuades Brantley to stay for a swim and seduces him by stripping off his swimsuit and having an underwater kiss before she rips off her swimsuit and ultimately swims naked with him. Upon seeing Howard arriving, Brantley and Vera realize they are related (albeit not by blood). Vera only seduced Brantley to get back at her husband for having an affair with a woman in his office. Brantley then gets changed as fast as he can and leaves the mansion without being seen by Howard.

Howard, without Brantley's knowledge, is having an affair with Christy. When Howard asks her to spy on Carlton Whitfield, Christy falls head-over-heels for "Whitfield", not knowing he is actually Brantley. The Pemrose Corporation is preparing to merge with the infamous Davenport Corporation. If Davenport Corporation merges with Pemrose, everyone gets fired. Howard, unaware that Whitfield and Brantley are one and the same person, suspects "Whitfield" is a spy for [[corporate raid]]er Donald Davenport ([[Fred Gwynne]]). Brantley’s double identity is discovered when he, Christy, Vera and Howard end up in the same bedroom after a party at Howard’s home that all 4 are attending. Brantley and Christy end their budding relationship and Brantley gets sacked from his job he did as Whitfield, as does Christy for refusing to continue the affair with Howard.

While both Christy and Brantley are moving out of their offices, they end up in the same elevator and make up, conceiving a revenge plan with Vera. In the end, they raise enough cash, bonds, and stocks to wrest ownership of the Pemrose Corporation from Howard, and to proceed with a hostile takeover bid of Davenport's Corporation. Vera, already contemptuous of Howard for his counter-productive business practices, which were driving her father's empire into the ground, tells the board about his affair as well. She promptly replaces him with Brantley, with Jean, Christy and Melrose at his side. While security guards escort Howard and his aide, Art Thomas ([[Gerry Bamman]]), from the Pemrose Building, Brantley and Christy start planning their future together, personal as well as professional.

Not all of the songs featured in the film are included on the soundtrack, or, at least not in the same version. The film version of the song "The Secret of My Success" is slightly different, and also features a mini-instrumental version. The film version of "I Burn for You" does not feature vocals, whereas the soundtrack version does. The "[[Restless Heart]]" track from the film has a different title ("Something I Gotta Do"), and different lyrics than the soundtrack version.

Popular songs "[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]" by [[Katrina &amp; The Waves]] and "[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]" by [[Yello]] are heard in the film but do not appear on the soundtrack.

The soundtrack peaked at #131 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name="The Secret of My Success, charts at Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000191675|tab=awards|label=''The Secret of My Success: Music From The Motion Picture Soundtrack'' Billboard 200|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme from the picture "[[The Secret of My Success (song)|The Secret of My Success]]", performed by [[Night Ranger]], was one of the songs that competed for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Original Song in 1988. The winner in question was "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]", the central theme from ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', performed by [[Bill Medley]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received a mixed response from critics.
[[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "''The Secret of My Success'' seems trapped in some kind of time warp, as if the screenplay had been in a drawer since the 1950s and nobody bothered to update it." He concluded "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=The Secret of My Success, |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301|work=Chicago Sun Times |date=April 10, 1987|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', felt it was "close to inspired when the ambitious Brantley finds himself leading two lives", although he noted that "Hanging over ''The Secret of My Success'' is the long shadow of [[Frank Loesser]]'s classic musical ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=The Secret of My Success|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/43502/The-Secret-of-My-Success/overview|work=The New York Times|date= April 10, 1987 |publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 55% "rotten" rating at website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 20 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secret of My Success-critics rating|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/secret_of_my_success|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film opened on April 10, 1987, and debuted at number one at the box office, taking $7.8&amp;nbsp;million in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Secret of My Success' No. 1 at the Box Office Spot|work= The New York Times|date=April 15, 1987|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/15/movies/secret-of-my-success-no-1-at-the-box-office.html|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stayed at No. 1 for 5 weeks, and was in the top ten films for 2 months.

'''''Times Square Red, Times Square Blue''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[science fiction]] author [[Samuel R. Delany]] and published in [[1999 in literature|1999]] by the [[New York University Press]]. The book is a compilation of two separate [[essay]]s: ''Times Square Blue'' and ''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''.

==Contents==

===''Times Square Blue''===
''Times Square Blue'' is a first-hand narrative of Delany's (often referred to as "Chip," or, occasionally, as "The Professor") sexual exploits in [[Times Square]]'s [[adult movie theater|pornographic movie theaters]] with other men (some [[homosexuality|homosexual]], some [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]) from 1960 through the mid-1990s. He also describes, in detail, his relationships with these men inside and outside the theatres.

===''...Three, Two, One, Contact: Times Square Red''===
The second essay in the book discusses the nature of [[social relation]]s within the realm of [[urban studies]]. Delany proposes two kinds of relationships, "contact" and "networking," and analyzes the content and benefits of each. He also refers extensively to [[Jane Jacobs]]' ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.

'''Tsai Wan-lin''' ({{zh|c=蔡萬霖|p=Caì Wànlín}}; 10 November 1924 &amp;ndash; 27 September 2004) was a Taiwanese businessman who, at the peak of his wealth in 1996, was considered to be the fifth richest person in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The billionaires' list|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&amp;dat=19960701&amp;id=TekyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xwcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6963,103314|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|publisher=Google News|date=July 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a family net worth of [[United States Dollar|US$]]12.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Gates still richest, but Asian tycoons getting closer|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19960701&amp;id=NCpdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=51oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1782,97999|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=[[Observer-Reporter]]|publisher=Google News|date=1 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 2004, he was the richest man in Taiwan with a fortune of US$4.6 billion ([[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]156.3 billion), ranked 94th worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PASSINGS Tsai Wan-lin, 80; Tycoon Was the Wealthiest Man in Taiwan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/29/local/me-passings29.1|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Lin Yuan Group]], a large [[banking]] and [[insurance]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who will replace Tsai Wan-lin as Taiwan's wealthiest person?|url=http://www.cens.com/cens/html/en/news/news_inner_6317.html|accessdate=6 December 2014|agency=China Economic News Service|date=29 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2219">[[File:Kekkonen-Raade-1961.jpg|thumb|right|Uolevi Raade (standing to the left) with [[Urho Kekkonen]] (sitting) in 1961.]]
'''Tauno Uolevi Raade''' (5 July 1912 &amp;ndash; 13 May 1998) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] industrialist and a long-time [[managing director]] of [[Neste Oil|Neste]] (now ''Neste Oil''), the Finnish national [[oil refining]] company.

Raade was born in [[Turku]], and received university degrees from [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (TKK) and [[Åbo Akademi]]. At TKK, he was one of the founders of the [[Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho|student flying club]]. During the Second World War he initially served as a fighter pilot, but was soon transferred into the industry. In 1945, he was appointed the director of Ministry of Trade and Industry, where he planned the payment of war reparations stipulated by the Soviet Union.

Already in this role he was involved in the founding of the Finnish oil industry. In 1955, he was appointed managing director of Neste. The first oil refinery at [[Naantali]] was brought on stream a couple of years after this. Raade and his friend, Prime Minister and from 1956 President of the Republic [[Urho Kekkonen]] were responsible for promoting the project; Kekkonen rallied the politicians and Raade took care of relations to industry at home and abroad.

In 1959, Raade also became the chairman of the company's board. He acted in both positions until his retirement in 1979. In addition to this post, he was also active in industrial federations and committees and was a member or chairman of the board of 37 corporations. He received the honorary title of [[vuorineuvos]] (the highest one awarded to industrialists) in 1962.

The former [[Fortum head office|headquarters building]] of [[Neste]], now occupied by [[Fortum]], is colloquially called ''Raateen hammas'' ‘Raade’s tooth’. It was constructed 1973–78 and is still the tallest office building in Finland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24983">A '''work permit''' is the permission to take a [[job]] within a foreign country. It may also be a permit given to minors allowing them to work legally under [[child labor]] laws. Within an [[industry]], a work permit may be required to execute certain functions within a factory outside normal operational tasks (such as maintenance tasks) — in some places they might be called Permit to Work (PTW).

== European Union ==
{{see also|Blue Card (European Union)}}
Currently, every EU country has a different process for granting work permits to nationals of non-EU countries. To address this issue, the European Commission began work in 1999 on developing an EU-wide process for the entry of non-EU nationals into the work force.&lt;ref name="Towards a Common European Union Immigration Policy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/immigration/fsj_immigration_intro_en.htm |title=Towards a Common European Union Immigration Policy |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2007, they adopted a proposal to introduce a work permit similar to the United States' "Green Card" program, called the "Blue Card". It is similar to the UK's [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]], with the exception that it will require an employment contract in place prior to migration.  After two years in the first country, the migrant will be allowed to move and work in another EU country, and can sum the number of years spent in the EU for purposes of residency. This new card will abolish work permits across the EU and centralize the issuing from Brussels.
&lt;ref name="EU Blue Card to encourage highly-qualified non-EU citizens to work in the EU"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/press_office/news_of_the_day/bluecard_en.htm |title=EU Blue Card to encourage highly-qualified non-EU citizens to work in the EU |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=European Commission, Irish Press Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
{{main article|Work permit (Belgium)}}

===France===
The procedure to get a work permit is quite elaborate since the applicant should prove that no French jobseeker fitted the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alain-Christian |last=Monkam|title=How to get a work permit in France|website= Village de la Justice|year= 2011|url= http://www.village-justice.com/articles/permit-France,11079.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Work permit (United Kingdom)}}
There are seven standard ways to apply for a work permit in the United Kingdom: the Business and Commercial Arrangements, the Training and Work Experience Arrangements, the Sports people and Entertainers Arrangements, Student Internships, GATS, Ancestry Visa and the Sectors Based Scheme. All applications require the work permit holder to leave the country where the work permit was issued every three months under the Work Permit Arrangements. Costs for leaving the airport are £64, per person and you must return to the airport after 24 hours or one working day to leave the country. If you remain in the airport the cost is £35 per person and you must leave the country after 24 hours or one working day in the airport.  &lt;ref name="Working in the UK - Work Permit Arrangements"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.workingintheuk.gov.uk/working_in_the_uk/en/homepage/work_permits0/applying_for_a_work.html |title=Working in the UK - Work Permit Arrangements |accessdate=2007-03-03 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these involves its own application process, and generally requires a job offer from a UK employer.

UK Work visas allow for extended visa options which may lead to permanent residence. With Europe at its doorstep and a large domestic market, the various UK work visa categories offer a gateway for thousands of applicants seeking the experience of European life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.migrationexpert.co.uk/work_visa/|title= UK Work Visa - Visa Service &amp; Advice Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK work permit system is currently being replaced by a new [[Points-based immigration system (United Kingdom)|points-based immigration system]].

==Russia==
According to the Federal Migration Service of Russia estimates, Russia's 5 million foreign nationals work today.

In order to work in Russia, foreign citizen must have a work visa (visa for arriving at the order), to obtain a work permit and get on migration registration in the Russian Federal Migration Service bodies.

For foreign citizens arriving without visas ([[CIS countries]] except [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) there is a simplified procedure. The period of temporary stay for them is 90 days but can be extended up to one year from the date of entry into the Russian Federation on presentation of the migration service of the employment contract or a contract of civil-legal nature. That is, a foreigner can obtain a work permit for up to 90 days, and then to extend it after the job. However, it is recommended to immediately impose labor or civil contract and to issue a work permit for the duration of its validity.

Issuance of work permits is carried out taking into account the established quota. The quota is divided by region, Russia and the integrated vocational qualification groups.

A work permit is divided to some categories:
*qualified professionals are employed by their existing profession (specialty), included in the approved list of professions (specialties, positions);
*highly qualified professionals engaged in labor activity in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Federal Law "On the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation."
The work permit is valid within the subject of the Russian Federation, in which it was issued.

== Ukraine ==
Foreigners and [[Statelessness|stateless]] persons can be employed in [[Ukraine]] after obtaining an appropriate permit. These requirements are established by article 42 of the Law of Ukraine "On Employment"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/work-permit-in-ukraine/|title=Work permit in Ukraine. Obtaining and legislation.|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. State Employment Service of Ukraine is the main authority to issue work permit. 

Does not require obtaining a work permit for:
* foreigners who have [[Permanent residency|residence permit]] in Ukraine;
* [[Refugee|refugees]];
* foreigners who have permission to immigrate to Ukraine;
* foreigners who are recognized as persons in need of additional protection, or who are granted temporary protection in Ukraine;
* representatives of foreign maritime (river) fleet and airlines that serve such companies on the territory of Ukraine;
* employees of foreign media who are accredited to work in Ukraine;
* professional athletes, artists and art workers to work in Ukraine;
* workers of emergency services for urgent work;
* employees of foreign representative (branch) office that are registered in the territory of Ukraine in accordance with the procedure established by the law;
* ecclesiastic who are to reside in Ukraine temporarily (on the ground of invitation of religious organization) for canonical activity only in such religious organization;
* foreigners who arrived in Ukraine to participate in the implementation of international technical assistance projects;
* foreigners who arrived in Ukraine to conduct teaching and / or scientific activities in higher education institutions;
* other foreigners in cases provided by laws and international treaties of Ukraine;
* Obtaining work permit in Ukraine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/work-permit-in-ukraine/|title=Work permit in Ukraine. Legal services and advisory - Law Firm "Capital Law Consulting"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the basics to obtain residence permit.

== United States ==
[[File:Getting_working_papers._New_York._-_NARA_-_523068.jpg|thumb|Applying for working papers, 1908 ([[United States Children's Bureau]])]]
In general, the United States does not require work permits for adult [[Citizenship in the United States|citizen]]s. However, certain aliens are required to have an [[Employment Authorization Document]] from the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS).

The [[federal government of the United States]] does not require work permits or proof-of-age certificates for a minor to be employed.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"&gt;{{cite web | title= Youth &amp; Labor: Work Permits &amp; Age Certificates | url= http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/youthlabor/workpermitsagecert.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the possession of an age certificate constitutes a good faith effort to comply with minimum age requirements of the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt; The [[United States Department of Labor]] will issue a "certificate of age" if the minor employee's state does not issue them, or if the minor is requested by his or her employer to provide one.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCFR|29|570}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states are not listed in {{USCFR|29|570|9}}(a), such as Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and Utah, and thus their certificates may not meet the requirements of {{USCFR|29|570|5}}(b) as being evidence of compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Many states also require them for workers of certain ages.&lt;ref name="dol_youth_certs"/&gt; In some states, for example [[New Jersey]], permits are only required for minors 14 and 15 years old, while others such as [[Massachusetts]] require, at least in theory, work permits for all minors until they turn 18 years of age. In some states, enforcement is strict. Permits are usually issued through the school system the minor attends, and typically at a minimum is conditioned on enrollment in high school with regular attendance (no chronic absenteeism, tardiness, or truancy). Some states such as [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Indiana]] require high school students with part-time jobs to maintain a certain [[grade point average]]. Minors who are working are usually restricted in the number of hours each day or week they are permitted to work as well as the types of jobs they may hold.

== Turkey ==

The immigration in Turkey is regulated by the {{ill|General Directorate of Immigration Management|tr|Göç İdaresi Genel Müdürlüğü}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goc.gov.tr/main/Eng_3|title=Ministry Of Interior Directorate General Of Migration Management|website=www.goc.gov.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Göç İdaresi Genel Müdürlüğü) under the supervision of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of Interior]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mia.gov.tr/&lt;/ref&gt; while work permits are delivered by the {{ill|General Directorate of Labor Immigration|tr|Uluslararası İşgücü Genel Müdürlüğü}} (Uluslararası İşgücü Genel Müdürlüğü) under the supervision of the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Security (Turkey)|Ministry of Labour and Social Security]] (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Çalışma ve Sosyal Güvenlik Bakanlığı).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csgb.gov.tr/En|title=T.C.

==South Africa==
There are three categories of South African work visa or permit available to a foreigner each with its own set of specific requirements all assisting in immigration to South Africa or working in South Africa. These are the ''General Work Visa/Permit'', the ''Critical Skills Work Visa/Permit'' and the ''Intra-Company Transfer Work Visa/Permit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Work Permits in South Africa |url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/work-permit-south-africa/ |accessdate=2015-07-08 |publisher=Immigration South Africa™}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to recent immigration law changes (May, 2014), the obtaining of work visas or permits in South Africa has become much more arduous. Furthermore, these work permits are now referred to as visas.

'''General Work Visa/Permit''' - 
The basis of a general work visa/permit is that a firm offer of employment has been made by a prospective employer to a foreigner after such employer has unsuccessfully exploited the local labour market in attempting to procure the needed skills, experiences or qualifications equivalent of such foreigner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/general-work-visa-south-africa/|title=General Work Visa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical Skills Work Visa/Permit''' - 
A critical skills work permit may be issued to a foreigner who possesses critical skills or qualifications and is able to demonstrate with supporting documentation in the form of testimonials, publications. This is based on a list published by the Department of Home Affairs in South Africa called the Critical Skills List &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/Critical_Skills_Work_Visa_List.pdf|title=South Africa's latest Critical Skills List (PDF)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter of motivation from an authoritative body to substantiate the benefits that those skills will bring to South Africa. This critical skills work permit is granted for up to five years and may be renewed for a further period, if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/critical-skills/|title=Critical Skills Work Visa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This visa type replaces the previously issued Quota Work Permit and the Exceptional Skills Work Permit.

'''Intra-Company Transfer Work Visa/Permit'''  - 
An intra company transfer work permit is issued to a foreigner who is normally deployed or seconded to South African branch, subsidiary or associate office of a corporate entity aboard.
There are strict controls to ensure that the foreigner remains employed in his or her specific position during the tour of duty. This type of visa is only valid for two years, and often no extension is possible. Also, any applicant must have first worked for a minimum of 6 months in the employ of the company’s foreign office before applying to relocate and immigrate to the South African branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigrationsouthafrica.org/work-permit-south-africa/|title=Work Visas for South Africa - Immigration South Africa™|website=www.immigrationsouthafrica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Canada work permits are issued under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) by Canada immigration and Citizenship.

The TFWP has four streams: high-skilled workers, low-skilled workers, the Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program, and the Live-In Caregiver Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singer|first1=Colin|title=Canada Work Permit|url=http://www.immigration.ca/canada-work-visa/|website=immigration.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singapore==
In Singapore, the work permit process is managed by the Ministry of Manpower.  There are several kinds of work permits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Passes and Visas (Singapore)|url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=2012-05-06 |publisher=SingaporeMinistry of Manpower}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the type accorded generally depends on the salary range of the position, as well as on skills (including education), work experience, and the type of job being applied for. These work permit types include the Employment Pass (monthly salary of at least S$4,000), S Pass (monthly salary of at least S$2,800), and "Work Permit" (generally for unskilled workers).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

For skilled personnel such as confinement nannies from Malaysia, the work permit is short-term. Employers or appointed agencies are able to hire Malaysian confinement nanny&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nannysos.com.sg/confinement-nanny-work-permit-singapore|title= Confinement Nanny Work Permit Singapore|author=|date=|work= Confinement NannySOS |accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by applying the work permit either online or manually. The validity period can be up to 16 weeks with reference to the birth time of the child. There are two situations which the pass can be extended. It is either when the required employment period is longer than the issued permit or when the confinement nanny leaves Singapore during her employment period.

Another kind of work permit available in Singapore commonly known as the EntrePass and is especially geared towards entrepreneurs who might not pass the stringent requirements regarding education and salary. The EntrePass is for foreign entrepreneurs who are planning to start up a business in Singapore. The entrepreneur must be actively involved in operations of the business. Candidates can apply for this anytime up until 6 months after they registered the business.  Generally EntrePass are awarded to individuals who have either have a proven track record of running successful businesses or who have an innovative idea.
The Singapore Personalised Employment Pass, also known as PEP is a special type of Singapore work visa issued to individuals based on their own merits. The issuance of the PEP is managed by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower. The PEP is independent of any employer, rendering a PEP holder the flexibility and freedom to switch employers without having the pass revoked. The PEP holder is also entitled to stay in Singapore for up to 6 months in between jobs and to evaluate career opportunities. It is issued for a period of 5 years, and non renewable thereafter. But, since December 2011, PEP has been discontinued by the Singaporean Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Personalised Employment Pass (Singapore) |url=http://www.mom.gov.sg/foreign-manpower/passes-visas/personalised-employment/before-you-apply/Pages/default.aspx |accessdate=2012-05-06 |publisher=Singapore Ministry of Manpower}}&lt;/ref&gt;
